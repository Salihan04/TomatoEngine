      "review": "  ALL ABOUT THAT BASS - My Review of THE WRECKING CREW (4 Stars)Whether you grew up in the 60s/70s or if you're a fan of the classic music from that period, it's likely you'll treasure Denny Tedesco's loving, passionate, bittersweet documentary about the unsung heroes behind such recordings as \"California Dreaming\", \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelng\", and \"Be My Baby\". Somewhat of a cousin to the Oscar-winning, \"20 Feet From Stardom\", Tedesco has been making this film since 1996 as a tribute to his late father, Tommy Tedesco, a guitarist with the group of West Coast session musicians who played on a jaw-dropping number of rock hits, movie and tv themes.  Finally getting their due, the musicians reveal that they, and not the original members of such bands as The Beach Boys, did the lion's share of the playing. The list of songs is staggering and I spent most of my time viewing the film with my jaw decisively dropped and my toes tapping. More important than uncovering these music industry secrets, however, is the true passion for music on display here. These are musicians who loved to play, to discuss it, and in one extremely potent moment, Tommy says to his reunited group, \"They put notes on paper. That's not music. You make the music\". ...And what incredible music it is. The film dives in and out of the lives of some key players, interweaving a reunion roundtable with rare footage from the era and vibrant photos. I loved watching a very young Sonny and Cher make their way around the studios, these newbies facing a group of old pros. Brian Wilson looked truly inspired to record with the Crew, who unanimously loved working with this genius. Tommy is a great main character. He's energetic and hilarious in footage where he's talking to students or reminiscing with his old pals. Drummer Hal Blaine carries a lot of the pathos in the film with a heartbreaking riches to rags story. A couple of the members broke out into solo stardom, chief among them, Glen Campbell and Leon Russell. The lone female in the group, Carol Kaye, steals every moment she's on screen. Clearly a warm person who suffers no fools, she never once played the victim, assimilating herself into this boy's club because of her undisputed talent as a bass player. A highlight of the film is watching Carol show us the original, too-spare bass line to \"The Beat Goes On\" and then demonstrating how she added her own touches to make it unforgettable. Every so often we'll hear a musician play, for example, \"The Pink Panther Theme\" and then Tedesco will lay the finished track on top of that footage. It's a terrific way to show us their artistry and bring these invisible talents front and center with the songs that shaped so many lives. This isn't a perfect film, but it's a perfect experience. At times, the storytelling can duck down a few too many corridors, but it's an extremely minor complaint. The shaggy style constantly brings us gem after gem of music and lively reminiscences. Imagine turning a radio dial over and over and only hearing masterpieces and that describes the viewing pleasure of this film.The journey to get this film released has been arduous. I met Denny back in the 80s as we both worked in film production. Years later, he started talking about a documentary he was making to honor his father who was starting to get ill. Tommy, and many others, did not live to see the final product, which, after a successful film festival run, has been held up for years dues to music rights. We see many people who are either gone (Dick Clark is among them) or have mentally slipped away (Campbell), making this film that much more essential as a time capsule. There were times, however, that it looked like this film would never get the proper release it so richly deserves. But Tedesco persevered, raised the hundred of thousands of dollars needed to pay off the endless list of musicians, and 19 years later we have THE WRECKING CREW. His passion to tell this story about a group of very passionate people was well worth the wait and is a glorious homage to REAL talent.",

While relying prominently on a quartet including drummer Hal Blaine, guitarist Tommy Tedesco and bassist Carol Kaye (whom clearly deserves a writers credit for her crucial bassline on The Beat Goes On!!) as well as a few of the Wrecking Crew graduates (Glen Campbell and Leon Russell); the group largely and loosely consists of maybe 3 dozen players, give or take... and the reverence for them, displayed here by everyone from Cher, and Nancy Sinatra, to Frank Zappa is deserved, and ultimately quite life affirming.  A must, not just for musicologists of any persuasion, but for music lovers of all ages. Amazing stuff, full of stories I never wanted to end! GRADE: (A-)",

And, while large portions of the film respectfully pay tribute to these little-known artists, there are also many interview segments that are a little too \"inside\" to be fully appreciated by an audience that probably doesn't know much about the subject to begin with. Regrettably, it feels like the filmmakers were a little too close to their material to step back and fully appreciate how viewers might react to it.",

My hat off to Denny Tedesco for his unwavering tenacity, financial struggle and focus in order to bring this endearing true story to the big screen. Having worked alongside a number of the wrecking crew musicians in the 1960's, I can attest first hand to their expertise as players, their incredible ability to create new and exciting sounds and their warm demeanor as fellow musicians. The wrecking crew were my hero's then and now. This is a not to be missed film if you loved the music of the 1960's.",

      "review": "  Instead of being stationed in West Germany in 1971 as he previously was informed, Private Gary Hook(Jack O'Connell) and his squadron are instead sent to Belfast due to rising tensions. Their first assignment from Lt. Armitage(Sam Reid) is to assist in rounding up some suspects but without riot gear. That almost instantly goes horribly wrong as Gary is left behind to fend for himself while another soldier lies dead.Not only is '71a riveting and harrowing tale of survival in what could be thought of as hell on earth and not just for a lone English soldier but also those living there, caught in the crossfire, but it also proves that sometimes the simplest approach is the best, even when approaching complex issues while also having the confidence not to attempt to resolve everything. Overall, the movie serves as a master class in dispensing a great deal of information in the smallest amount of time, as a wide variety of characters are fully formed, allowing for many varied points of view. Some of whom directly intersect Gary; others incidental. They may seem like little stories on the surface, but that does not mean they are any less important.",

That predicament makes him a sitting duck for the warring forces of Catholic nationalists, already embroiled in their own internal conflicts with the notorious IRA and other insurgents, and Protestant loyalists.Basically, Gary is in deep shit. '71, a barcing, hard-charging debut from TV director Yann Demange, makes sure we feel every wincing, violent moment with Gary, the threat of death lurking around every corner. Director Paul Greengrass brought documentary-like immediacy in his telling of the Troubles in 2002's Bloody Sunday, but Demange's film, starring an outstanding O'Connell, is seeking to make the personal more political. It can be a bit much, but why harp on an ambitious film that provides so many knockout moments? You don't.",

      "review": "  A British soldier gets isolated from his unit in a street battle in Northern Ireland, and spends a harrowing night evading the murderous thugs determined to kill him. Although it is a thriller about one ordinary man caught up in the maelstrom, it also heart-breakingly shows how the cycle of violence and the shifting loyalties among the factions of \"The Troubles\" brought misery and terror to the people of Belfast, and how traditional military training ill-prepared young soldiers to handle hostile civilians and mobs. I wished for more of this soldier's home story (I wasn't sure if the boy he left behind was his little brother or a son), but it was enough to make us care about him. I had a hard time figuring out who the plains-clothes soldiers were (intelligence officers?) and their role, but perhaps that was the point - the soldiers didn't really know what they were up to, either; and once they found out, they were powerless to make a bad situation any better.",

It is a \"confused situation\" to be sure, and we are privy not only to the soldier's experiences but also the backroom conversations of members of the IRA and the Ulster Rifles. Our soldier (Jack O'Connell) becomes a bloody pawn in the political machinations of the times. And those times are very nicely recreated with cars, outfits, hairstyles, furniture and wallpaper. In some ways, what we have here is the inverse of Carol Reed's Odd Man Out (1947) which saw injured IRA man James Mason passing the night (and from life to death) on the run from the law/Brits also in Northern Ireland. Similarly, we meet an array of characters and situations as O'Connell moves from location to location in and around the Catholic tenement flats but the focus in '71 is less on creating a parable and more on gritty pulse-pounding action done well.",

      "review": "  An immigrant's business is threatened by crime just as he has over-leveraged his assets.Oddly, A Most Violent Year is one of the least violent movies I've seen in a long time, but that doesn't mean that it's not incredibly tense and compelling. Jaw-clenching Oscar Isaac and icy-staring Jessica Chastain make compelling scene partners, and this plot puts them through the ringer.The film has been favorably compared to the work of Sidney Lumet, one of American cinema's most underrated masters, and I can see why: both director J.C. Chandor and Lumet use long, slow shots, framed in shadowy backgrounds to subtly establish a pervasively sinister mood. Anything can happen in the threatening worlds of Chandor and Lumet, and even when it doesn't, there's the feeling that the characters have only temporarily escaped tragedy. This mood leads to what I think is one of the film's great sequences. It's a chase sequence in which Abel, Isaac's character, must run down a lead on who has been stealing his business's trucks. With most chase sequences, it's easy to tell how it's going to end - the plot event has to be resolved by the character either catching the prey or not - but in this sequence, even though we know that Abel will catch the guy, we don't know whether Abel will fall further from grace and become a murderer. This moment of unpredictability is masterfully built and becomes an example of how good films can take a familiar construct - the chase - and make it fresh and exciting.Overall, A Most Violent Year is a phenomenal film, and it solidifies Isaac and Chandor as two of our most promising talents.",

Isaac's rock-solid, confident performance is the driving force behind this movie, as he is a presents a rare individual that is unlike anything we've seen from these kinds of stories. The last act of the film has a scene in it that encapsulates the movie's message as a whole, and its rare we see this kind of skill behind the camera from a gifted, fairly new big movie director like J.C. Chandor.",

      "review": "  \"When it feels scary to jump, that is exactly when you jump, otherwise you end up staying in the same place your whole life, and that I can't do\".After the impressively talkative Margin Call and the hypnotically silent All Is Lost, the third film from J.C. Chandor had a lot of expectations behind it. However, due to a misjudged marketing campaign, I think many people will be left disappointed with A Most Violent Year. It's doesn't have echoes of The Godfather as the trailer would have you believe but is, in fact, a leisurely and low-key criminal affair that will mostly appeal to those who are prepared for it's more personal story.Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is self-made businessman who is determined to expand his heating oil organisation. However, someone keeps hijacking his trucks costing him money and the trust of his local investors. Abel tries to deal with the situation lawfully and non-violently but his no-nonsense wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain) suggests he gets tougher on the gangsters and the unions around him before everything he's worked hard for comes crashing down.The title A Most Violent Year will mislead many when it comes J.C. Chandor's third film. It actually refers to the year (1981) in which it's set, whereby New York had an upsurge of violent crimes. This violence isn't necessarily relevant to the film itself and to know this beforehand may allow you to enjoy the film and it's methodical and meticulous approach all the more.Although this film should certainly not be compared to Francis Ford Coppola's Corleone saga, you can definitely see Oscar Isaac resembling a young Al Pacino. He plays his character with the same simmering intensity and intelligence and it's largely due to Isaac's towering performance that the film succeeds in being a mood-piece or a solid character study and less of a mob movie. It's not overly concerned with people getting 'whacked' or double-crossed but more concerned about business and how our struggling protagonist deals with things in a controlled and dignified manner despite his righteous indignation. It also doesn't help that his wife is the daughter of a Brooklyn gangster who feels the solution to every problem is a violent one. Keeping her in check is a constant problem, especially when it's played with such verve and dangerous passion by Jessica Chastain. Personally, I'd liked to have seen the leads among the Oscar contenders this year as the work they produce here, is some of their very best.As well as the performances, the film's look is equally impressive. Bradley Young's gorgeous, desaturated cinematography captures the feel for the time and the city of New York and (as some critics have already pointed out) echoes the gritty early work of Sidney Lumet. It manages to avoid the usual genre clichés and deliver a work of thoughtful suspense. It leaves you hanging and waiting for something to happen but resists the urge to tread a well worn path within the sub-genre and, as a result, succeeds in the very things that it doesn't do.In hindsight, if Chandor had chosen a different title then he might not have led many viewers into false expectations. However, this is a slow burner and if you resist the urge to judge the film before seeing it, you'll find it as stylish and refined as the camel-haired apparel that Isaac carries so gallantly.Mark Walker",

      "review": "  If you've seen A Most Violent Year, you'd have already realized the title barely adheres to what the movie is actually about- which is the American Dream, a theme now as old as time itself. Revolutionized in The Godfather and proving it's longevity in Scarface, the subject of the American Dream in film is indeed a popular one. A Most Violent Year is about Tony Montana's boring distant cousin Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) and his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) residing in the New York/ New Jersey area, also trying to carry out his own version of the American Dream. A Most Violent Year is the maverick of American Dream/ gangster movies: Abel Morales is an honorable family man who runs an oil heating company. His wife and the company lawyer (played by Albert Brooks) both try to sway him towards the crime path while he does his best to resist them both... majority of this film is about him doing his best to do everything legally and honorably, and it's also the films biggest downfall because it makes for some pretty dull material. While I respect the themes: that some have to get a little \"dirty\" once in a while to succeed, and that attaining this American Dream is definitely not a black and white affair, I couldn't help but shake the feeling that it's been done so many times before in more entertaining, watchable, and interesting ways.",

      "review": "  In \"A Most Violent Year,\" Abel(Oscar Isaac), the owner of a home oil businessin New York City, is on the way up. Not only has he moved into a palatial new home with his wife Anna(Jessica Chastain) and their three children but he has also just closed a deal to buy a distribution center that will greatly enhance his business. However, he has only a month to get the rest of the money, or not only will he lose his sizable deposit but the property will also go to his competitors. Complicating things even further is the DA(David Oyelowo) investigating him and hijackers targeting his trucks, with Julian(Elyes Gabel) being the latest driver victimized.As he seeks to make movies on his own terms, J.C. Chandor has directed another movie that hits the mark with \"A Most Violent Year\" about a man seeking to fulfill the promise of the American dream, by making it as legitimately as he possibly can. That involves Chandor doing so with standout scenes including the one on the Queensboro Bridge and a lead character who seeks to avoid violence in the most violent of times, a message the movie handles well without resorting to being didactic.(It is either irony or penance that both Oscar Isaac and Albert Brooks were also in \"Drive\" which glorified violence to a sickening degree.) Of course, it helps when you have Jessica Chastain being no less than quietly effective and a nearly unrecognizable Albert Brooks stealing scenes left, right and center. Sadly, the Julian storyline does not work as well as it should, being as awkwardly shoehorned into the rest of the movie as it is.",

      "review": "  ONE DOG SHORT OF A FULL AFTERNOON - My Review of A MOST VIOLENT YEAR (3 1/2 Stars)J.C. Chandor is clearly a filmmaker who refuses to be pegged. From MARGIN CALL's cutting Wall Street language to almost the complete absence of it in ALL IS LOST, he has announced himself as a writer/director who can seemingly tackle any genre. Filling the shoes quite well of the late Sidney Lumet, Chandor's third film, A MOST VIOLENT YEAR, just picked up National Board of Review awards for Best Picture, Actor (Oscar Isaac) and Supporting Actress (Jessica Chastain). Based on that, I went into the film with very high expectations, but left with mixed feelings.The story of a corrupt yet somewhat honorable heating oil company owner who faces many obstacles on his way to acquiring an important piece of land, the film is set in the winter of 1981. Isaac plays Abel with a quiet intensity unmistakably comparable to that of Al Pacino in THE GODFATHER. His wife and business partner (Chastain as Anna) comes from some vaguely detailed mob past, and her slow burn throughout is one of the film's great pleasures. Populated with a strong selection of characters straight out of THE SOPRANOS handbook and effortlessly conveying its time period (credit Production Designer John P. Goldsmith for not pushing things too hard), the movie is set a simmer for most of its running time. Sure there are a couple of thrilling chase sequences (one in a tunnel has great sound design and kept you on the edge of your seat despite its utter simplicity), but the film never truly explodes. Perhaps its title is misleading. Referring to a tumultuous year in New York City, the threat of violence is always around the corner, but it rarely goes there. Some may find this unbearably suspenseful, and at times it is, but I wanted it to jump out of its shell and go full \"ATTICA! ATTICA! ATTICA!\"The issue seems to be with Isaac's characterization and how the filmmakers take their cues from his tone. A study in grace under pressure, his character gets himself into a lot of dangerous situations but never seems to lose it. Chastain, on the other hands, gets to rage beautifully. She reminded me of Amy Adams in AMERICAN HUSTLE, all suppressed rage and surprising revelations. Albert Brooks plays Abel's lawyer, and its strong, workmanlike work, but like mostly everything else here, it's unfussy. David Oyelowo (INTERSTELLAR) has some fine moments and a bucket load of ambition as the District Attorney hungry to indict Abel. Elyes Gabel, however, nearly walks away with the picture as on of Abel's put-upon drivers. Desperate, scared and unpredictable, much of the story hinges on his actions, and I couldn't help but feel I wanted that kind of energy to be released from Isaac. Now don't get me wrong, Isaac is a great actor who seems poised to give us one memorable performance after another. From DRIVE to INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS to this, he's a bonafide, classic star, but Chandor's script clearly guided him to play it cool. One scene, however, will go down as an American classic. Without spoiling things, the words \"Please stop\" are most memorable, and in this GODFATHER-esque meeting of the mobsters, Abel's ability to dominate a room is a master class in uncluttered acting. Another terrific sequence involves a birthday party, a search warrant, and file boxes being quickly stashed away. This type of minutiae gives the film its loopy charm. I wish it had more of it.As the plot thickens, all of the motivations and double crosses wrap around each other and make you truly understand how understandable everyone's actions are, leaving you with a hopeful feeling of ever being able to make a profit in this world. It's final scenes are definitely shocking, leading up to a leaky image (you'll know it when you see it) which perfectly illustrates the movie's themes. I can't wait to see what Chandor does next, as he clearly loves movies and telling stories. If only he had really cut loose and ditched some of the formalities, but I'm ok with a very, very good if overpraised film.",

      "review": "  A fan of mature filmmaking, and fast becoming a trailblazer of it, director J.C. Chandor continues to impress with A Most Violent Year. Unlike what the title would suggest, A Most Violent Year is a slow burn of a film, concerned with the psychology of its subject rather than violence as a vehicle. The film focuses on the efforts of a businessman to hold on to what he has amidst aligning forces threatening to ruin all that he has worked for.The film distinguishes itself through its smart script and excellent performances. The film serves as a meditation on not only crime, but what it takes to both achieve and sustain the American dream. Its' protagonist, Abel Morales, tries to keep himself above water in a system and a climate that thrives on tearing down those on top. Unlike most similarly themed films, Morales is able to resist these temptations to a large degree, and that is what makes him so fascinating. This theme, that of self-control and the strength it requires, is found throughout. Methodically paced, the film is a slow burn. The film is dialogue-driven, and rests on its lead, with Oscar Isaac giving an Oscar worthy performance. While the film does lack in the back-story of Morales and his family, it manages to offer a uniquely conceived story to a saturated genre.4/5 Stars",

      "review": "  Sigh. I was so ready to love this one. As it is, A Most Violent Year is a solid small-scale crime drama more along the lines of Killing Them Softly than the Scorsese-esque show stopper the trailer promised. Violent Year makes vague commentary about the American Dream through its protagonist underplayed by Oscar Isaac and his adamant refusal to believe that through his illegal business practices, forced circumstances, and shady connections he is slowly becoming a powerful criminal. (He has much in common with Niko Bellic from GTA IV, though he lacks his Terminator-esque killing prowess.) The best scenes are between Isaac and the always great Jessica Chastain. You've got to admire competent no bullshit acting when you can get it. Few, if any of the other characters make much of an impression. The film suffers more than it should from a glacial pace. And this is coming from a person who enjoys slow films. This movie is VERY slow. While I have to admire how it maintains a limited focus and is content with a very limited arc for our characters, it damages the impact it might have had. On the plus side A Most Violent Year does give you a feel for crime-ridden 1981 New York and there is an impressively filmed, restrained chase scene that came almost out of nowhere and managed to have consequence on the plot. So while it is beautifully shot and well-acted it fails to be (at least for me) enjoyable or memorable. It's worth renting or downloading and breaking it up into a couple of sessions.",

      "review": "  A carefully plodded thinking mans morality tale, J.C. Chandor's awe-striking and atmospheric latest easily ranks as one of the decade's best crime stories. Many films have charted the less-than-successful attempt of social climbing criminals to go clean (The Long Good Friday, The Godfather Part III, Carlito's Way). This film does the same with a scrupulous business unsuccessfully trying to STAY clean. Its a sad and cynical parable reflecting American politics and commerce--not just today but for as the story knowingly relays through the ages. Through generous amounts of dialogue, the film plays out like a high-stakes white-knuckle chess match. You'd think that these sequences would feel too talky, but they only build the tension and suspense of this searing drama, which works excellently as both a character study and proto-gangster story. Like every word in a James Joyce novel, the lines of this film just like the photography and shots - are meticulously chosen and controlled expressions of these powerfully drawn characters.In this R-rated crime-thriller set in New York City during 1981, an ambitious immigrant (Isaac) fights to protect his business and family (Chastain, et al) during the most dangerous year in the city's history. Without the brilliant lead performance, itself meticulous and controlled, A Most Violent Year wouldn't amount to such an auteurial tour-de-force. If Inside Llweyn Davis didn't already compound this fact: Isaac is one of the best actors working today. With Chastain, who builds upon an already ridiculously great CV (The Help, Tree of Life, Zero Dark Thirty, Interstellar), he brings immense heft to a thought-provoking, weighty story, and yes violent story. Whats amazing is that this film bowed in 2014 and amassed zero Academy Award nominations. Someone should've yelled miss-deal. Bottom line: My Favorite Year",

      "review": "  Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain give palpable performances in \"A Most Violent Year\", but the pace of the film trudges in the oil (figuratively), which is what the focus is all about.Set in the early 80's and centered around oil and fuel, Isaac's character is an honest, or is he, businessman trying to create an empire the right way. He preaches trust, loyalty, and honesty with his moral compass pointed in the direction opposite of a gangster. However, Chastain's character tugs at those strings with her connections to her father, who you never see on screen but gather was corrupt. They are great opposing forces as Isaac's character tries to keep his head without falling into violence while Chastain's always wants the quick fix to show strength.The difficulty here is the movie felt billed as a gangster/crime drama whereas it ends up being just a simple drama. It didn't quite carry the punch of the title with very limited violence and true gangster activity. I enjoyed the story though because it stuck you right in the middle of a fictional, yet believable, time period of how things were progressing back then.On an odd note, they had a shot of the city (it was set in NY) and it being the 1980's, they didn't have the twin towers in the cityscape shot.It feels like another case where the acting carries the movie from point A to B to C more-so than both the story and acting cohesively working together at the same time to get you to a fulfilling ending.",

      "review": "  Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is a Colombian immigrant who's worked his way up to the owner of a heating oil delivery service. He's got it all - money, power, a sexy wife played by Jessica Chastain, and a killer camel-hair coat - but he still wants more. How he gets it is the dramatic question of the latest entry in J.C. Chandor's impressive filmography. The film unavoidably gives off the air of \"The Godfather: Part IV\" (Chandor employs a similar slow-burn technique, violence constantly lurking on the edge of the frame, and Isaac's performance instantly conjures up the ghost of Pacino in \"Part II\"). And yet Chandor takes an alternate route - namely, dramatizing how one climbs the ladder in a society so reliant on fraud and violence without compromising one's morals. That's Abel's dilemma, and it's incredibly engaging to watch, thanks to a fantastic collaboration between Chandor's script and direction and the actors involved, not to mention a tense Pink Floyd-esque score by Alex Ebert. The only real problem is in the Chastain character. Chandor writes her as a pretty flat daughter of a gangster, the kind who 40 years ago would say things like, \"Show me what you got, mister.\" This would all be well and good, but Chastain is simply too good an actress and the character seems an odd fit. Still, this is one of the most sneakily great movies of the year, and more proof that Chandor is one of our most consistent up-and-coming filmmakers.",

      "review": "  J.C. Chandor has to be admired. With only two previous full length features under his belt (this is his third), he has made a name for himself for creating smart, well crafted, original tales that feel much different than most of what is offered on the cinematic market today. A Most Violent Year, like his impressive debut Margin Call, can best be described as a thriller of words. Or business noir if you like. They're stories that on paper don't look like they should be all that suspenseful or even particularly interesting. But in the way they're executed: the music, the acting, the dialogue, they become intense explorations of corporate corruption and entrepreneurial tenacity. This gives them that most boring sounding of genre tags 'adult drama.' But the amazing thing about these films is how compelling Chandor makes them. In A Most Violent Year, Oscar Issac is a man who is putting his whole life savings on the line toward expanding his business, a fuel farm via Standard Oil. But things become tricky when someone targets his trucks for repeated hijackings, stealing over $200,000 worth of fuel in the process and strange men with guns start showing up on his property. While all that's going on, the FBI is applying pressure in an investigation into illegal business practises that seem to be the norm for the fuel business. Then things get more complicated and more, and the dam seems about to burst for our hapless protagonist who's only wish is to build an empire in an honest, law abiding way. The story spins against the backdrop of New York City, 1981. A year in the city's history notorious for its soaring crime rates, particularly in area of violent crime (hence the movie's title). It provides an interesting historical backdrop to the narrative and is used in the same way the Obama/McCain presidential elections were in Killing Them Softly: a contextual buffering of the story, rather than a device which directly impacts it. The movie's anchored by Oscar Issac. First of all, his character is admirable. He's not perfect. There are hints that he's had his dishonest days, but his resolution to run an honest business, especially when it would be much easier to take the easy, less legal road, is always at the forefront of his actions. An uncorrupt man who is flanked on all sides by varying levels of corruption always makes for compelling viewing. Isaac himself is fantastic in the role and is surrounded by a basket of impressive supporting performances. Unfortunately, A Most Violent Year is a film with a great deal of buildup to which the climax doesn't entirely satisfy. Every scene is filled with a pervading sense of doom and tension. You consistently feel as if something bad's about to happen. It gives the whole affair a level of anxiety that fits the film if not the story. A Most Violent Year is a film that is somewhat misleading. It promises more than it delivers, but it's an interesting film and an interesting look at the pursuit of capitalism. It feels, and plays, like 70's filmmaking through and through: intelligent, precise and gritty. It's even got that desaturated, honeyed look that the first two Godfathers had. It's not as well crafted or sure of itself as Margin Call. And it's not as compelling or brave as All Is Lost, but it retains J.C. Chandor's current position within the film industry as a talent to watch. Maybe for his next film he could mix what he's already done and give us a film about a massive oil spill that threatens...oh, he is. Never mind.",

I like the way the suspense is kept high without having to resort to Godfather-type gory violence that often plagues stories about recent immigrants in NYC pursuing the American dream. Also, the main protagonist Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) has an ambiguous personality that keeps you guessing whether or not he is actually a good guy or a bad guy.",

      "review": "  This should be called 'A Most Misleading Title', but while the film did split my opinion on more than a few occasions, I've been thinking about it almost constantly after it ended. On one hand, I was disappointed that the film didn't have any \"explosive\" points. There's an atmosphere of danger and violence constantly looming that never actually materializes, it's essentially a massive cock tease, and I wonder whether it would have been better for the movie if the things I was waiting for happened. On the other side of the coin, I loved how understated it was, and I really respect films when they lead you in a certain direction but do the total opposite of what you're expecting. The fact that this never turns into a violent crime thriller after it endlessly misleads you into thinking it will, is something I really enjoyed. So I'm in two minds here. What isn't up for debate is everything else. The acting is phenomenal. Oscar Isaac (Say no more) but Jessica Chastain stole it for me. Her character is the one who is really making things happen but stays out of the limelight, and her performance is great. It's shot beautifully, the cinematography and colouring seems to have been meticulously planned, and the score is so subtle I actually can't remember if a single song was played at any point during the film. Overall, this will split people down the middle. If you don't like slow paced movies, you'll probably hate this. Personally I prefer a slower pace. If you need to feel satisfied by the end of films you'll also be left a little empty probably, but if you appreciate the way the story unfolds in a realistic way and doesn't do a bunch of \"movie things\" like you're expecting, you'll find yourself in my boat. Honestly, this is a strange watch but I've decided I really like it. I had to think about it though.",

      "review": "  Good, but not entirely satisfying.New York, 1981. An owner of a heating oil supply company, Abel Morales (played by Oscar Isaac), has just struck a deal to buy an oil storage terminal. This will take his business to the next level. However, the contract to buy the terminal has a very strict timeline and provisions. To add to his worries, his trucks are being hijacked and the District Attorney is about to take him to court on felony charges...Interesting and intriguing drama. Is a slow-burner, but is never dull. However, for all the work that goes into building the intrigue and developing the plot, there are a few scenes which just don't gel and the ending does feel quite flat. There is no great profundity awaiting you at the end of it all. Excellent performance by Oscar Isaac in the lead role. Then again, I don't think he is capable of a bad performance - surely an Academy award cannot be too far away? Good work too by Jessica Chastain as his wife, Albert Brooks as their lawyer and David Oyelowo as the DA.Ultimately, while the plot is reasonably interesting, the performances carry the movie.",

      "review": "  A Most Violent Year is a tense, quiet, tightly scripted drama lead by two amazing performances from Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain. Opting for a character driven story, atmosphere and gripping dialogue over shootouts and action sequences, this film is a unique and thought-provoking subversion on the 'American Dream' narrative. It never falls into the cliches or cheap plot devices of standard mob movies, and the way it tackles its themes of corruption and the 'honest working man' is refreshingly new. The story follows a guy trying to make an honest way in a dishonest world, and actually sticking to it - the opposite of nearly every other crime movie about the American Dream. And while there are a few suspenseful moments of violence and action, like I said I must commend the powerful direction and magnetic performances for how much tension is evoked from simply two characters talking. Apart from its thematics and writing, A Most Violent Year also works really well as a period piece. The costumes and sets are amazing, and a prosperous yet melancholic 1980s New York is brought to life with immense attention to detail and sleek, captivating cinematography. A Most Violent Year is an engrossing, suspenseful and atmospheric crime drama, and while I admit I'm not as crazy about it as I've seen a lot of critics are, I believe it has undeniable merit in how it effortlessly breathes new life into such a tired genre, and it's definitely an underrated standout of 2015.",

Academy Award winner Asghar Farhadi had made four other films prior to A Separation and The Past. About Elly is one that somehow got lost in the shuffle as far as getting an American release. Regardless, the film has now arrived and continues to shed light on what a talent Farhadi is in capturing human drama.The film is something of a mystery set among a group of old friends on a holiday retreat. With the return of a close friend, a group of former college pals decide to reunite for a weekend outing by the Caspian Sea. While things begin in good spirits, complete with an attempt to hook up two individuals, trivial lies start accumulating and things really escalate when a sudden disappearance occurs. This sets in motion a series of deceptions and revelations that threaten to shatter everything.As I mentioned, this film really continues to prove how adept Farhadi is at developing human drama. That it is not quite as good as A Separation or The Past only suggests that Farhadi has improved only time as a filmmaker, given how good About Elly still is. This is a film that is stripped down of nearly everything, aside from some narrative ambition when it comes to utilizing the location for high tension. What is left are a collection of characters and a screenplay that allows for very natural conversations, arguments, and other relatable interactions.",

This one is not as good, but still interesting. Lots of dialogue to read. I did not feel the storyline was set up well... i felt confused at times, and this is unusual for me. I kept feeling like there was something I missed.All this said, it was interesting, and I recommend it.",

      "review": "  In \"About Elly,\" a group of friends travel to the seaside during a holiday weekend. They are all married couples and their children with the exceptions of Ahmad(Shahab Hosseini) who has just returned to Iran from Germany and a divorce and Elly(Taraneh Alidoosti) who is one of the children's teachers. So, there is hope that they will become better acquainted. But sadly there is no hope for them to stay at the house they had wanted to since it had been reserved by a wedding party, so they will have to rough it out in an unfurbished house closer to the sea.\"About Elly\" teases out a tantalizing mystery. But after that, director Asghar Farhadi does something rather interesting by almost tying the movie into a knot exploring a single procedural point. But considering he has shown a great deal of interest in the Iranian legal system in his other films, I think he is trying to make a point here however subtly through exaggeration about how such minutiae can weigh down everyday life in Iran.",

      "review": "  \"A bitter ending is better than endless bitterness.\"A naturalistic, deeply gripping drama that in its second half practically plays as a thriller. In this modern Iranian film, a sudden shock shifts what we know about a character and further muddles the motivations of another. It deftly demonstrates what can result from small deceptions, lies and and half-truths without ever making judgements or offering easy answers. Above all the film is exceptionally well written and acted, and though it isn't as emotionally satisfying as the director's later masterpieces A Separation and The Past, it remains a cerebral and powerful film.",

About Elly was my first movie of this Persian director Farhadi .The movie opened with a simple plot, and ends with much more simplicity.The cast was great, Farhadi did a great job in putting the viewer inside the locations to live with the story. A group of married couples, some with children, went to the North of Iran to have a 3 days vacation.The director showed here clearly the consequences of lies and deceptions. How lies even for inconvenience can lead to unexpected events. Farhadi got the best performances from his actors,specially Golshifteh Farahani who played the role of Sepideh so convincingly.",

      "review": "  I thought A SEPARATION was one of the best films of its given year. I understand ABOUT ELLY came before that film but just released this year and I can easily say this new film from Asghar Farhadi is one of the year's best. It starts off as a drama about a group of friends on vacation and ends up being a dark mystery where nothing is what it seems. All the characters are suspicious and you have no idea who to trust. Farhadi is great at developing his characters slowly in the beginning, setting everything up, so when the real plot kicks in, we too are able to judge them because we feel we have known them the same amount of time as those on screen.

      "review": "  I can go and on about Iranian writer/director Asghar Farhadi, who received global recognition for his 2011 Oscar-winning A Separation. That film absolutely blew me away. Named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the world by Timemagazine in 2012, Farhadi is intricate in his weaving of society's interpersonal conflicts within a seemingly straight-forward story. Playing at Berlin and Tribeca film festivals in 2009, Farhadi's About Elly was lauded by film theorist and historian David Bordwell as \"a masterpiece.\"The film opens on a light note, with a group of old friends, made up of three couples and their children, traveling from Tehran to the Caspian Sea for a beach getaway. Joining them are Ahmad (Shahab Hosseini) and Elly (Taraneh Alidoosti). Ahmad, an affable Iranian who returns from Germany after a recent split with his wife, is open to the idea of being matchmade with Elly, an elusive but obliging kindergarten teacher of the daughter of Sepideh (Golshifteh Farahani), who organized the getaway. Sepideh's secret plan to introduce both of them is welcomed by the rest of the group, but we'll soon find out that it's the least of her string of little white lies which will play a part in the twist of events coming. As Elly fits into the group of friends since their university days, act 1 is a clever intention for us to observe and get to know more about each character as they joke, laugh, break bread and end the day with a game of charades.About Elly quickly ratchets up suspense in act 2 the next day, as the upbeat mood of their weekend takes a dark turn when Elly suddenly goes missing. Leaving the group helplessly clueless, has she drowned in the angry sea attempting to save a child, or has she abruptly left the place unannounced despite Sepideh's pestering to stay. What appears to be another kitchen sink drama suddenly erupts into panic mode, trampled by series of revelations that challenge the moral core of these characters. These developments ooze varying degrees of mistrust and hostility among the friends, whilst audience is kept anxious coupled with the soundtrack of endless crashing waves so cleverly added to further bring us into the scene.What's so brilliant about this film is the revelation that the actual whereabouts of the titular character no longer seems important at the end, as we witness how each small lie repeatedly breeds damaging consequences. Whilst a woman's disappearance is on the line, what eventually matters is how each of the character deals with the crisis, broods over each other's surfacing dishonesty and unconsciously depend on them to salvage their own dignity. Farhadi builds an elaborate psychodrama depicting how harmless intentions can culminate into most scourging and life-changing events. Using everyday lives and conversations, his film has an uncomfortable but important message to tell. And along with some of the other films which are in my top list, what I really love is how the film lets audience decipher the clues and make our own conclusions. All the characters' performances are on point, especially Golshifteh Farahani. Even the children are invested in the emotional roller-coaster, making this film another testament of Farhadi's excellent filmmaking.",

      "review": "  Retroactively released after the success of A Separation and The Past, About Elly is a simple drama that occurs over one weekend that spirals out of control. A school teacher named Elly is invited to a getaway near a beach, but things quickly escalate when she disappears. Then more secrets and lies get uncovered, and what follows is a tense drama with solid performances. It doesn't have the bite of Farhadi's later movies, but its still a decent watch for a minimalist drama with lots of insight into that culture.",

      "review": "  I thought A SEPARATION was one of the best films of its given year. I understand ABOUT ELLY came before that film but just released this year and I can easily say this new film from Asghar Farhadi is one of the year's best. It starts off as a drama about a group of friends on vacation and ends up being a dark mystery where nothing is what it seems. All the characters are suspicious and you have no idea who to trust. Farhadi is great at developing his characters slowly in the beginning, setting everything up, so when the real plot kicks in, we too are able to judge them because we feel we have known them the same amount of time as those on screen.

The takeaway is a glimpse of modern Iran: it's both conservative (the sacredness of marriage, unmarried couples don't go on trips together) and the dark side of it (domestic abuse). At the same time, the characters seemed normal, have access to cellphones, women drive cars and seem cheerful and content, at least in the First Act of the film. Unfortunately, we got a poorly translated copy in that one of the characters, visibly very upset, was offered a \"sedative\" in which the upset character said \"toilet\".

Though it starts off deceptively-perky (though peppered with nuanced foreshadowing), Elly starts plunging the viewer into psychological unease as lie after lie are laid bare after a near-tragedy.

En About Elly, un grupo de amigos deciden alquilar una casa en la playa. Sepideh es la encargada del viaje, y decide invitar a Elly, la profesora de uno de sus hijos. Su intenci�n es emparejarla con Ahmad, uno de sus amigos quien se acaba de divorciar. La situaci�n es torna inc�moda ya que es evidente sus intenciones desde el principio. Elly es una mujer misteriosa, y no estamos claros de quien es, o que esconde. Durante el segundo d�a del viaje, Elly desaparece. Lo que sucede luego, afectar� no s�lo el viaje, sino la din�mica del grupo dr�sticamente.About Elly es una pel�cula que te mantiene al borde del asiento. Es inevitable ponerse en los zapatos de los personajes, ya que es f�cil sentirse identificados con ellos, y con las decisiones que toman. La trama no es para nada predecible, y constantemente nos sorprende con nuevos giros dentro de la historia. Asghar Farhadi tiene una facilidad incre�ble para lograr que el p�blico se sumerja en la historia. No es com�n ver personajes como este grupo de amigos en el cine. Normalmente j�venes musulmanes son vistos de manera negativa, y ac� son como personas normales y convencionales. Se divierten y se comportan como cualquiera. Siento que es importante presentar este tipo de personajes para dejar atr�s los estereotipos.Las actuaciones son incre�blemente realistas. Se siente como si fu�ramos testigos de las vidas de estas personajes y como si realmente existieran. Las actuaciones de todos son magistrales y aportan a el realismo de esta pel�cula. About Elly es una obra casi perfecta. El final no me dej� totalmente convencida, y la inclusi�n de su \"prometido\" fue un poco abrupto, pero tambi�n le a�ade esa cara de el machismo dentro de la sociedad musulmana.",

      "review": "  4 out of 5 stars. Excellent mystery by the writer/director of the Iranian masterpiece, \"A Separation.\" Several of the same actors are in this film & writer/director Asghar Farhadi is now a world class filmmaker in the French New Wave tradition of Chabrol, Rivette & Truffaut. His nuanced attention to human behavior builds into true works of art which surprise you because the layers of everyday action and routine become very important later in the dramatic structure. His films almost feel like documentaries at first because there is no driving plot, just observation of groups of upper middle class intellectual Iranian people, going about their lives. That in itself is interesting compared with all the anti-Iran propaganda here because he shows how universally relatable his characters are to all humans striving for better lives, education for their children and care for their families.But you have to pay attention because the smallest details in the beginning become crucial to characters' outcomes later. A small conversation or a glance between two people seems insignificant at first and then suddenly becomes very important in the final resolution. Always well acted with specifically composed shots, his work is all about careful writing, directing & performance. His craftsmanship is first rate and all the details are important. There are no wasted moments in his films, which are never high budget. Farhadi already has dozens of international awards, an Oscar and Cannes recognition, so he is well established after only 6 feature films. Definitely worth seeking out his films because they stay with you for years. That unique window into Iranian life is a valuable artistic perspective and his ensemble of actors do such a great job on screen for him. You will replay moments in your head the way Bergman films never leave you once experienced. A filmmaker of the highest order, the cinema world eagerly awaits more great films to come from him and his team.",

      "review": "  Sepideh: Now, what does he think about Elly?It is interesting to go back in time with a director I have only recently found myself so intrigued by in recent years. Academy Award winner Asghar Farhadi had made four other films prior to A Separation and The Past. About Elly is one that somehow got lost in the shuffle as far as getting an American release. Regardless, the film has now arrived and continues to shed light on what a talent Farhadi is in capturing human drama.The film is something of a mystery set among a group of old friends on a holiday retreat. With the return of a close friend, a group of former college pals decide to reunite for a weekend outing by the Caspian Sea. While things begin in good spirits, complete with an attempt to hook up two individuals, trivial lies start accumulating and things really escalate when a sudden disappearance occurs. This sets in motion a series of deceptions and revelations that threaten to shatter everything.As I mentioned, this film really continues to prove how adept Farhadi is at developing human drama. That it is not quite as good as A Separation or The Past only suggests that Farhadi has improved only time as a filmmaker, given how good About Elly still is. This is a film that is stripped down of nearly everything, aside from some narrative ambition when it comes to utilizing the location for high tension. What is left are a collection of characters and a screenplay that allows for very natural conversations, arguments, and other relatable interactions.",

This Netflix released picture really shows that they know how to find quality content for their streaming service, because at one point this film was being considered for Oscar buzz. Not only is this a powerful story, but Idris Elba really makes you believe this clan exists and the way he forces his kids to do things is brutally realistic. \"Beasts of No Nation\" does suffer from an extended running time and a slightly over calculated screenplay, which to me felt a little tame compared to it's subject matter. I felt as though the film explored more than it explained, which was a very odd thing to do in my opinion.

Sporting no flies in its barbed mouth, this heavy drama pulls no brass-knuckle punches. Even though this coming-of-age occasionally tends to weigh filmgoers down to near-dismal depths (purposely, mind you, but it takes a toll regardless), a note of hope nonetheless rings through the funeral dirge.In this R-rated drama adapted from the novel by Uzodinma Iweala, a child soldier (Attah) fights in the civil war of an unnamed African country and falls under the watchful eye of a sadistic commandant (Elba). In this, the first film released on a wide scale by a streaming service and not exclusively in theaters, Netflix makes a great case for the future of distribution. As unflinching as Fukunaga's adaptation and direction (it helps that he helmed the GOOD season of HBO's Hard-R crime saga True Detective), Attah and Elba's award-worthy performances ground the action all the more. Bottom line: Bout of Africa",

      "review": "  Devastating brutal, and unflinching, Beasts of No Nation is an honest look at the horrors of a civil war conflict in Africa. It's a film of violence and repulsiveness, such as can only be witnessed in such carnage. Following a young boy who becomes conscripted in to rebel faction of a resistance group, Beasts of No Nation transports us in to a tragedy that is all too real, yet little talked about.The film's uniqueness has largely been focused on its release venue through Netflix, which is proving to be ingenious, yet one must also acknowledge the achievement by Cary Joji Fukunaga, the director. He brings to life what could be any number of war-torn regions, and focuses his craft on conveying the sheer emotion and the stupendous brutality of the situation. That is to say, it's not the fact of who's fighting or why that's important, all of that is mostly irrelevant; it's the toll that the war has that's important. That is follows a child-soldier makes it all the more impactful, and Cary brings a very talented cast together. This cast, of course, is headlined by Idris Elba, who deserves a nomination for his performance.It's a film that is hard to watch, yet necessary. Bleak, yet honest. If there's a criticism, it's that the underlining humanity is perhaps lost a bit, it can be very difficult to enjoy without an emotional undercurrent for the viewer to follow. Yet it seeks to challenge the viewer and does so unapologetically, with strong performances, a smart script, and all-too realistic execution.4/5 Stars",

Beautifully shot, well written, amazing acting all around (also a crime Idris and Abraham weren't nominated), a story you do not normally see about a topic that's heart-rending and depressing to no end. A tactful and beautiful telling of how children are being manipulated and forced into servitude, with no moments of glorification or fan-service violence.",

What makes this movie different from others? Because it takes place in an unidentified sub-Saharan African country? Since the country is not named, the implication that this could happen in any of the nations in such a large continent strikes me as a too broad.But maybe the movie isn't necessarily about Africa. It's about all the wars throughout history that have used children as soldiers to do horrific things. It is about how allegiance falls to charismatic and imposing figures, and there is none more suited to this role than Idris Elba. Elba's physical presence and performance allows us to see how one man can convince others to do unspeakable things.",

War is hell and this never more true than through the eyes of a child forced into war. It's one thing to have men go through the horrors of war, but to have children changes the whole game. This is not an easy watch, but it is one of those films that will leave you speechless.Grade: A",

Beasts of No Nation is the disturbing tale of Agu (Abraham Attah), a young boy whose village is caught up in the brutal events of a civil war. His family killed and nowhere to go, Agu is captured and then manipulated by the sadistic Commandant (Idris Elba) to become a child soldier bent on vengeance.It's a disturbing look into the horror of genocide, civil war and the loss of adolescent innocence that occurs every day in war torn African countries.Elba nails the African warlord and Abraham Attah turns in an impressive debut performance. Emmanuel Nii Adom Quaye was also good as Agu's best friend, Strika.The movie itself was good, but dragged at some points. It could have been about 20 minutes shorter.",

I guess the \"child soldier\" genre is much like the \"political prisoner in jail\" genre for me - you've seen one or two, you've seen 'em all. I suppose that's very jaded of me, and Beasts of No Nation is very well made and all. Idris Elba is great as always and the main boy was good, too. I just didn't think the movie built to much. For me its my least favorite Cary Fukunaga movie so far, as I loved Jane Eyre and really liked Sin Nombre (and of course, the 1st season of True Detective was great). I wish we had gotten more perspective on Elba's character.",

In this case we are following a boy named Agu (Abraham Attah) who is captured and \"made\" into a child soldier. The commandant of this \"child army\" is played amazingly well by Idris Elba. It is beyond me how he didn't get nominated for an 'Academy Award'. To round up, great honest film which, probably, will touch your heart in many ways.",

The answer is simple, this is not an enjoyable film. There are scenes in this movie that will stay with you long after the final credits, and play in your mind like a distorted X rated charity infomercial that you can't hit the 'power' button on. And that's exactly what Netflix wanted. As paradoxical as it sounds, I will not recommend this movie to anyone, but I believe everyone needs to watch it.

An amazing breakout performance is given by Abraham Ata as \"Agu\".

Abraham Attah and Idris Elba should have been nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively, in every major award-giving. I have not seen every movie, but I don't understand how this movie and the actors were over-looked. If you want a politically relevant movie, this is it.

      "review": "  Beasts of No Nation is a heartbreaking tale of a child, Agu, who's family is killed and run out of their West African village. Agu has grown up in the grip of civil conflict wherein a dead body or the sound of machine guns popping off in the distance is just an everyday part of life. When the military chases him off into the bush after killing his father and brother, he comes across a band of rebels who take him in and transform him into a child soldier and, in effect, a killing machine. The film is based on a book by Uzodinma Iweala. According to Wikipedia, the book was an expansion on the thesis he wrote while attending Harvard. And while the book and the film are fictional, they fit firmly in the 'docudrama' category. That is, a fictional character or story dropped in to a real setting or conflict. And with Beasts, you buy every minute of the story that unfolds before you. Of course, this is Africa. Google the top ten most war torn countries in the world right now and a good half of the list will be African ones. The destruction and devastation that has gone on in parts of Africa for so many years is more or less unfathomable to people lucky enough to call places like Canada or the U.S. home. And director Cary Joji Fukunaga, who directed the similarly brutal and touching film Sin Nombre, about the Mexican cartels and the warring at the Mexican/American border, approaches Beasts with the observant eye of a documentarian all the way. A lot has been made of the performances of both Idris Alba, who plays the charismatic and dangerous leader of the rebel group Agu joins, and who we know from classic shows like The Wire and Luther, as well as a bevy of popular films. And of Abraham Attah, who plays the very difficult and important role of Agu. Abraham was born and raised in Ghana in West Africa and this is his first acting gig. The character of Agu goes through a great many changes throughout the course of this film. As the poster above shows, he goes from child, to captive, to killer. He encounters great atrocities and causes great atrocities himself. Agu's character is changing in every scene. In every scene, he is learning and growing and becoming something else, sometimes better, sometimes worse. It's a tremendous arc and Abraham Attah deserves an Oscar for the naturalism, maturity and bravery with which he pulls it off. He's already won an award for his performance in Venice, I hope he and Alba, who is also brilliant and puts in his best performance to date in this film, win many more. Beasts of No Nation is a tricky film to recommend. On the one hand, I recommend it whole heartedly and cannot compliment the efforts of the filmmakers and cast enough in bringing this story and vision to life in a such an honest and effecting way. On the other, it's not an easy film to watch. But it isn't supposed to be. Death, rape, destruction and devastation in parts of Africa are a real problem and child soldiers doing and seeing things no child should see or do is a real thing in these places. In some cases whole armies are made of kids who aren't old enough to ride in a car without a booster seat in North America. And Fukunaga doesn't shy away from the hard stuff. If he did, if he watered down the realities of these civil wars in these poor countries, he would be doing them and us a disservice. This is the way it is. It isn't pretty, because it really isn't pretty. But there's no glorification here. Nobody will walk away from Beasts of No Nation thinking 'damn, that's cool. I wish I lived somewhere like that.' So if you're sensitive to these depictions of violence, this won't be an overly enjoyable couple of hours. But I would still recommend it, because I think it's an important document of a real crisis and a very well made and executed (no pun intended) work by a talented group of people. If nothing else, it will make you First World citizens grateful for the country you live in and that dead bodies and the popping of machine guns at all hours of the night isn't an everyday part of life.",

Part of why film works is that it dramatizes and exaggerates emotions and events to give the desired feelings more punch/relevancy/staying power in a shorter amount of time. This movie was 2 hours and 17 minutes long... and I was bored during the entire thing. There was no plot, it was just random stuff happening. It took a good subject matter and painted it as flatly as possible. This war and child solider crap is real and it is real problem, but no one is going to care when, more likely IF, they watch this film. There wasn't anything meaningful going on narratively or thematically. No clever ideas or connections to be made; not even any good dialogue. I was surprised to read that Idris Elba received a Golden Globe nomination for this. His was bland, generic performance. Certainly not his fault however. When the script says you are generic, African army commandant, there isn't really much to go on.Beasts of No Nation takes important, moving subject matter and material and fails to be compelling in any way. It is unremarkable, fails to make a statement and was made seemingly for the sake of being made. This movie was like slowly emptying air from a dry whoopee cushion.",

After it is shot down in mid air, the survivor of the plane is then in negotiations to be traded for a supposed Russian Spy they have in custody. With a few more complexions, this film is the perfect amount of smart, witty, and serious. Written by the Coen Brother, Steven Spielberg was able to get quite a bit of comedy out of these actors, while they simultaneously deliver sharp dialogue. Terrific performances, brilliant direction, a story definitely Spielberg worthy, and beautiful cinematography work. If you are a fan of this genre, it is not one to miss. I loved every second of \"Bridge of Spies\" and I cannot recommend it more. Although, it is definitely not for everyone. It is a bit lengthy, but the pace was perfect in my opinion. After thinking long and hard about what could have been a flaw or issue with this picture, I simply could not think of anything. \"Bridge of Spies\" is what filmmaking is all about.",

      "review": "  Although it is a charm to watch given the Spielberg-Hanks reunion as well as a script which co-credits the Coen Brothers, BRIDGE OF SPIES proves to be an all-in-all solidly-made film that is entertaining and more or less satisfying, but unfortunately a piece that plays too safe to transcend. SPIES features some smart and masterful filmmaking - as evident in its strong visual storytelling, well-crafted one-on-one exchanges, and clever editing (some amazing match cuts as well as Spielberg and DP Kaminsky's usual soft, glowy lighting amidst beautiful end frames to precise camera moves) - in addition to a steady yet immersive performance by both Hanks and Rylance. However, the film lacks the much-desired impact upon its delivery of turning points; the narrative is fancied with surprisingly funny moments and pleasurable scenes but the plot becomes a bit too easy - the grip never holds on, the sense of danger never reaches its potential, and likewise the end result is not as powerful as it was building up to be (Hanks' character appears to negotiate his ways through obstruction that operates more on its bark than its bite; there is a Cold War level of fear that tags along as opposed to being imposed and infused - with a Spielberg staple, trademark sentimental music, that does little to help). In the end, taking into account the genre of Cold War spy drama/thrillers, Spielberg's latest is simply a solid entry that services quite well but falls short of greatness.",

      "review": "  T. HANKS FOR THE MEMORIES - My Review of BRIDGE OF SPIES (4 1/2 Stars)Due to poor marketing, a generic poster and forgettable title, I initially had no interest in seeing BRIDGE OF SPIES. It reeked of sup-bar Tom Clancy with dime store espionage. Little did I know it was based on a remarkably true Cold War story about an ordinary lawyer who brokered a hostage deal with the Soviets and East Germans. Additionally, when I discovered the Coen Brothers did a polish on the script, my interest was piqued just a little. Now that I've seen it, I can say it's one of Steven Spielberg's greatest accomplishments, a quietly suspenseful, beautifully acted and shot, twisting, turning yarn with quirky, specific characters and acute relevancy to current international politics. Tom Hanks, in full Jimmy Stewart Everyman mode and knocking it out of the park, plays James B. Donovan, an insurance attorney who is quietly asked by the Feds to perfunctorily represent a Soviet spy they've captured. The film opens on said spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance, giving an Oscar caliber performance) as he paints a self-portrait. It's a terrific opening shot, loaded with a wry sense of humor and multiple angles on the man to convey the layers to his character. There's no doubt from the outset that he is indeed a Russian spy, but it's the richness that follows which surprises. Soon, agents are pursuing him through the New York subway system in a bravura sequence of mounting tension, disorientation and stellar sound design. When Spielberg and his longtime collaborator, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, become engaged with material as rich as this, it's a pleasure to watch. Once captured, Donovan is asked to give the appearance of caring just enough so that the American Justice System looks good, but not enough to prevent Abel from the electric chair. Donovan, however, has more compassion than they expected. What follows is a story which stresses the importance of maintaining who we are or would love to be as a country by how we treat our prisoners. It's so easy in times of terrorism to go the way of Guantanamo Bay and torture our captives, but perhaps more important to maintain our ideals of justice rather than surrender to barbarism. Ultimately, the story involves a more well-known hostage, Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), an American pilot commissioned by the CIA to spy on Russia. His capture provides another thrilling sequence, this one in mid-air. Without spoiling too much, Donovan travels to East Berlin to quietly swap hostages without any official U.S. backing. Complicating matters is the fact that another American is captures by the East Germans just as the Berlin Wall is being erected.It's in the passage that I saw something new, and clearly Spielberg is all in as we witness the wall going up brick by brick as desperate people attempt to escape the oncoming horrors of life in the other side of that border. It's stunning and told with such assuredness and clarity. Another unexpected bonus is the humor in this film. Matt Charman, along with the Coens, keeps each character grounded in reality and adds such wonderful touches as Abel's cousin joyfully coming to beg for his release, Donovan's nagging cold throughout, and Abel's fantastically dry response of \"Would it help?\" whenever Donovan asks him to present himself a certain way. The relationship between Donovan and Abel is the heart of this film, and both actors rise to the occasion. Abel is deceptively still and on-the-surface, an enigma. Rylance, however, brings such quiet heart to Abel, that it's easy to see this potentially dangerous spy as just a man serving his country. This is a no-brainer supporting actor Oscar nominee if there ever was one, and deservedly so. Amy Ryan as Donovan's wife is straddled with the \"meanwhile back in the States scenes\" but she meshes really well with Hanks, giving such a vivid portrait of a late 50s/early 60s housewife on the verge of asserting herself more and more. The film is not without its flaws. Clearly scenes were cut between Donovan's assistant and daughter, whose secret affair must have meant something to a story about sneaking around, but obvious not enough to matter. There's enough there to leave one hanging, perhaps because their scenes carry a lot of the early exposition of the story. Also, even Spielberg at his best can turn syrupy and obvious at the end of his films, and this is no exception. SCHINDLER'S LIST, which I consider a masterpiece, suffered from Liam Neeson's breakdown scene. Here, we get a way-too-obvious comparison between the lives of wall-hopping East Germans and free Americans. It's not enough to derail the exceptional film that precedes it, and Spielberg and Co. are wise enough to provide a crawl of what happened to each character over this scene....so the on-the-nose nature of it is slightly diffused...a minor step in this nostalgic, uplifting, classically told, perfectly written film.",

      "review": "  An entertaining Bridge to the H'Wood studio days, this Spies game exemplifies Steven Spielberg at his treacly but satisfying best. The golden age of H'Wood are alive and well in the oeuvre of the maestro behind Jaws, E.T., and Jurassic Park, most noticeably in his latest brush with history, Bridge of Spies. Oh, this is not to say that his latest true story unintentionally comes across as old fashioned. Rather, the legendary director purposely exhibits an old-school approach to storytelling and workmanship that brings to mind the days of John Ford (The Grapes of Wrath, The Searchers), William Wyler (The Best Years of Our Lives, Ben-Hur), and - most of all - Frank Capra (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. It's a Wonderful Life). There's his assured use of Steadicam sweeps and close-ups, as well as a celebrated leading man who radiates both trustworthiness and nationalism. Just look at the film's poster: the giant mug of American hero Hanks caught between the stars and stripes and hammer and sickle, grandstanding the values of life and liberty before the opening credits have even rolled. This process serves him well with a Cold War tale such as this but it also plays it a little too safe. As beautiful and striking as this sentimental film looks, it plays out too predictably, which takes some of the punch out of the more suspenseful moments.In this PG-13-rated thriller based on true events, an American lawyer (Hanks) gets recruited by the CIA during the Cold War to help rescue a pilot (Austin Stowell) detained in the Soviet Union. Calculatedly, the film feels like a family friendly product of the era that it represents, which is laudable on many fronts save for the multiple somewhat heavy-handed endings. For the auteur who chose to chronicle such a specific warts and all bent in the life of the 16th U.S. president with Lincoln, however, his Bridge of Spies ultimately comes across as lighter fare. With a reliably stalwart performance by Hanks, a knock-out turn by stage veteran Rylance as a captured Soviet spy, and quotable dialogue provided by the Coen Brothers, this throwback boasts enough winning moments of distinction that make it stand tall even in a familiar line-up. Bottom line: Spies Like U.S.",

Following the grand traditions of Amistad and Munich, Bridge of Spies is an incredibly fine, concise and versatile Cold War drama/thriller. With an impressively written script contributed oddly by the two and only Cohen Brothers, add to that under Spielberg's bold direction the film shines as one of his most finest films to date. Another big credit added towards the casting, with another impressive collaboration with Tom Hanks (making this their third collaboration), alongside the likes of other incredibly talented actors, particularly Mark Rylance (soon to be in Spielberg's BFG next year), and the gorgeously looking cinematography. The film itself, also tells it's story really well with minimal music by Thomas Newman, making this the third Spielberg film to be scored without John Williams. Overall, the film really challenges the rights of prisoners and country's laws and constitution in a time of great conflict where almost anything could happen. Lastly, it's a highly recommended film in which it's Oscar changes might be big.",

      "review": "  Bridge of Spies is a Cold War thriller that is as subtle and understated as most of its characters. The narrative tells the little known backstory of Soviet KGB spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and his defense by American lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) against the wishes of an unforgiving public mood. Later, we see Donovan in East Berlin successfully negotiating his exchange with captured U2 pilot Gary Powers and an American student imprisoned by the East German Stasi. Bridge has fairly average direction and Tom Hanks largely plays himself as is his habit, but then again that's the advantage of being a national treasure. Spielberg and Hanks can give in rather perfunctory work and it will stand out above many others simply by default. I'd argue that Mark Rylance is the true gem of the picture and his simple, quotable dialogue, weary but observant expressions, and stoic demeanor make him the most memorable element. That and it features a fairly strong script written by the Coen Brothers. In summation, Bridge of Spies fails to reinvent the genre but it didn't need to - it tells a story more Americans and Russians need to learn and it tells it well.",

      "review": "  Another one of Spielberg's political morality plays . . . like \"Lincoln\" it's a mix of of old fashioned idealism and hard, real world truths. Some of his usual sentimentalism is on display but it's mostly kept in check by the screenplay (no doubt due to the Coen's involvement) and the tight pacing that never lingers too long on emotional moments. If this performance doesn't solidify Hanks as our generations Henry Fonda than I don't know what will.",

      "review": "  Steven Spielberg's engrossing period drama which is based on a true life incident, in 1957 the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, impressively played by Mark Rylance was capture in New York City, his defense is assigned to American lawyer, James B. Donovan, played magnificently by Tom Hanks, he makes a selfless sacrifice out of his sense of patriotic duty, but then is recruited by CIA director Allen Dulles, well-played by Peter McRobbie to secretly negotiate and arranged a prisoner swap of Abel for U.S. pilot Francis Gary Powers who's U2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union by there armed forces. Masterful direction by the great Spielberg, with extraordinary cinematography by Janusz Kaminski. great supporting performances by Alan Alda, Domenick Lombardozzi, Amy Ryan, John Rue, Billy Magussen, and Henny Russell, but its Hank's searing performance of great dignity and total conviction that steals this film completely. A taut thriller and fascination motion picture, one of the year's very best. Highly Recommended.",

      "review": "  \"Aren't you worried?\" \"Would it help?\"Gripping, thrilling and enjoyable, Bridge of Spies is a brilliant old-school Cold War spy thriller which benefits from powerful direction, top-notch performances and a story of friendship, personal values and determination. With a fascinating story and an overall visual style that brings back the classical spy-thriller film-making of previous decades, the movie is a most welcome return to the genre roots while it remains incredibly up-to-date despite a topic which could be considered nowadays far from being modern. Based on the true story of James Donovan (Tom Hanks) and his memoirs, Bridge of Spies tells the most curious events surrounding the conviction of the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and the following negotiations exchange which take place in East Berlin. It is not only a story of incredibly interesting events, but also a clash of values, of personal integrity and reflection of a period when values and constitutional rights were challenged. To the great delight of all viewers Steven Spielberg has returned with a flawless delivery that combines convincing cinematography, sober, but impactful visuals, amazingly convincing performances and of course a story that even though it is well know, still contains enough twists to keep you fully engaged. Without further spoiling what is all about, I would only say that Bridge of Spies has \"Oscar Awards\" written all over it. With 6 nominations, among which for Best Motion Picture, for Best Supporting Actor of Mark Rylance and Best Screenplay of the Ethan and Joel Cohen, this spy-thriller might not be a big winner (due to its earlier release date), but it could already be considered a contemporary classic ! A must see movie !",

      "review": "  No other American director has made more movies audiences have billed as \"just plain good\" more often than Steven Spielberg, who, for his decades long career, has managed to warm our hearts, move our souls, make our eyes misty, thrill us, tease us, like a storyteller who can transport us into a different dimension with the snap of a finger. Like Hitchcock, simply hearing his name is enough to evoke a certain emotion, which, in most cases, is a feeling of home, of sentimentality, at least when putting such classics as \"Jaws,\" \"E.T.,\" \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" and \"Jurassic Park\" into perspective.  But more recently has he begun to focus on more humanistic issues, covering and bringing to life (sometimes more vividly than we'd like) such issues as the Holocaust (\"Schindler's List\"), war (\"Saving Private Ryan\"), and even the Munich massacre (\"Munich\"). Clearly, Spielberg is one enamored with the idea of making a movie out of dramatic events of days past - some stories are meant to be told and heard on an international level, but deserve to be helmed in a way that provides them with the justice they so unmistakably warrant. Spielberg, time and time again, does a magnificent job of retelling real life events with theatric suppleness while still making a certain story more than just a story: a miraculous sense of importance is left intact. So I was surprised by \"Bridge of Spies,\" which is well-made, well-acted, well-directed, and well-shot, but is ultimately more textbook interesting than it is cinematically engaging. With a lack of dramatic haul, it has the wow factor of a documentary but not the heart-thumping majesty of \"Argo.\" Everything told is so inevitable, so unsurprising, that we are left notably impressed by the bravery of its central figure but never moved by the story. It's a tale of heroism without any twists and turns. As suggested earlier, \"Bridge of Spies's\" events would, perhaps, be more investing when captured within the walls of a documentary setting, where things are supposed to be predictable (though compelling) from the beginning. The film, set in 1957 at the height of the Cold War, stars Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan, a relatively small-time lawyer (he mostly specializes in insurance settlements) given the difficult task of defending Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), a Soviet accused by the American government of being a KGB spy. Donovan isn't so convinced that this is necessarily the truth - everyone involved in the case is predisposed from the beginning - and so he fights to at least get the man out from under the umbrella of death row, which he successfully (though controversially) does. But the plot thickens when Francis Powers (Austin Stowell), a CIA pilot, is shot down by the Soviet Union mid-flight and is soon captured, and when Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), an American student studying in Germany, is arrested for espionage by government officials after causing a tumult during the building of the Berlin Wall. In response, Donovan is proposed with the unthinkable - what if a trade is made, America giving Abel back to his home country, Powers back to the U.S.? It is an interesting proposition only to increase dramatically in its intensity after Pryor becomes part of the deal. Sent to negotiate with East German and USSR officials, Donovan overcomes his humble roots and does the extraordinary. At a time where most Oscar nominees seem to be relatively feral and imaginative (just look at \"The Revenant\" and \"Mad Max: Fury Road\"), \"Bridge of Spies\" seems conventional and safe, told with a traditional and old-fashioned flair that leaves it easy to look at and understand but sometimes insipid to watch due to its lack of any real suspense or stylistic risk. It is beautiful to gaze upon, though: the camerawork is glossy, reminiscent of Old Hollywood, and Spielberg conjures the iconic allure of a forgotten era. Hanks is a dependable leading man, trustworthy and strong, and Rylance is very good as the quirky Abel. But \"Bridge of Spies\" languishes from the fact that it never packs any punches - we wait for something jaw-dropping to occur to leave us emotionally stunted, but nothing ever does. We're affected by its story yet never dazzled by it; it sits there flatly as we wonder if it will ever become larger-than-life. A striking true story it is. I'm just not so sure big-budget, Hollywood treatment was necessarily the right place to go.",

After finding many Irish people in that town, she feels at home. Coming across the love of her life, the romance complexities of the story ensues. At times this film can be heart-wrenching, because you know people go through the same emotions as her in real life. This heartbreaking, yet beautiful story is not one to miss. This film is very low on the radar and is only picking up traction for awards season, but the film is so much more than that. Yes, it takes a lot for a period piece to impress me, but this one sure pulled it off. Although my one issue with the film heavily defines itself in it's third act, turning me off a bit (which I won't spoil), this film is still definitely one of the best films I have seen in 2015. The performances and direction are magnificent!",

      "review": "  If you're looking for an Oscar movie this award season that will be perfect for grandparents, I direct you to the perfectly pleasurable Brooklyn. Beyond the throwback to the 1950 setting, it's a movie that can appeal to multiple generations of audiences. There's an admirable classical sense of filmmaking with Brooklyn, a delightful and charming movie with a healthy dose of nostalgia and heartfelt sincerity that should find a wide range of appeal to all ages. Eilis (Saoirse Ronan) is an Irish immigrant who leaves her sister and mother to start a new life in Brooklyn. Thanks to a kindly Irish priest (Jim Broadbent) who had settled from her village, Eilis finds housing and a job. New York takes some getting used to, especially the density. Eilis is attending night classes to become a bookkeeper, but by day she works at a department store counter. It's at one of the socials in her new Irish neighborhood where she meets Tony (Emory Cohen), a smitten yet confident Italian boy. She agrees to go on a date, actually two upfront, and it's no time before Tony is walking her home from her night classes and talking about all his dreams. Eilis must return to Ireland for a family emergency. While she's there, a bookkeeping job opens that needs her help, and a nice boy named Jim Farrell (Domhall Gleeson) grows closer to her with affections that aren't exactly unwarranted. Eilis must decide which place to call her home and which life she wants to seek. While the story is set in the early 1950s, this movie could have been made in any decade of the film industry. It would not be out of place with the films of the 40s and 50s, hopeful and romantic odes about women finding new lives in the land of opportunity. There's a classical sense to its storytelling that is rather universal about the struggles of self and independence. While this movie is awash in the period details of 50s New York City, it really could be told anywhere. The personal struggles of Eilis are completely relatable, which makes her an instantly engaging heroine. She's a kind-hearted woman who's trying to step out and discover who she wants to be, and this promising reality is a pleasure to watch. We're watching the maturation of a person, watching her find her footing and gain confidence small victory after small victory. There aren't any large or arch plot events to navigate. It's the small moments in life, from starting a job, to becoming more sure of one's self, to knowing whom to open up and trust. The movie is kept at a pleasantly low simmer of intensity, which works just fine. The gentle tone does not imply a lack of urgency but more so the beguiling and romantic spell. Thanks to writer Nick Hornby, who is becoming an ace screenwriter, the movie tells such a heartfelt and emotionally rich and resonate story in 100 carefully paced minutes. There's a general joyous sensation that washes over you, elongating smiles naturally. The dialogue is often clever without being glib and the characters come across as realistic and humane. There's only one character that is thinly drawn to approach being stock (well two counting the precocious \"tells it like it is\" kid). The others are hopeful, yearning, and fundamentally decent people. There's something quite nourishing about watching decent people try and navigate their desires while maintaining their decency.I think that's what makes the love triangle work as well as it can, the fact that both options, not just the gentlemen at the center, are appealing. New York and Ireland both present options that afford Eilis opportunities in a career she wishes to pursue, both have compassionate men who have expressed an interest in her and are supportive of her education and goals, and both locations have a support system of friends. It may sound boring that Eilis can't really go wrong with where and whom she chooses but I think that makes the ultimate decision that much more engaging. If these options weren't so appealing then it wouldn't be so interesting to watch. The mistake is that because the choices are good that there is less at stake when the opposite is true. She could rightfully be happy with either choice but which representation of Eilis will she decide? One life represents the old, the other he new. As I stated above, the characters in Brooklyn have an commendable decency to them, which makes the love triangle more difficult. Tony loves her completely but fears she may not come back, and yet he knows he has to let her go and she has to decide on her own where to call home. Jim is thoughtful and even though he obviously has feelings for her Jim knows that now is not the right time to ask, and so he too waits and hops he presents enough worth staying over. It's a love triangle where you like all three participants, which happens so rarely in movies. Another strength of the film is that Ronan (The Grand Budapest Hotel) delivers a wonderfully felt performance. Much is placed upon her shoulders as our entry point into this world, and Hornby doesn't resort to his characters explaining everything they're thinking and feeling. Eilis is a woman who doesn't speak in paragraphs but in short succinct sentences. She's guarded but observant, and Ronan's face is our great tapestry for understanding Eilis and her changing demeanor. We can watch her process the intimidating and invigorating world and read her thinking. It's the most realistic Ronan has come across on screen as she has a habit of coming across slightly robotic, whether it's as a pint-sized killer (Hanna), slain teenager (The Lovely Bones), or whatever the hell they were going for with the atrocious Violet & Daisy. With Ronan's care, Eilis comes across like a resourceful young woman who is growing her sense of self. She's a deserving lead for our simply story told with excellent care.The only problem with a simple story told well is that it can also be predictable, which is a minor fault that doesn't negate the impact of Brooklyn's conclusion but does make it easy to anticipate. I'll dance around spoilers but in a way I feel like even discussing the topic is going to be sufficient for you, dear reader, to accurately infer what direction the movie takes and which choice Eilis makes in the end. In short, Eilis makes a decision before leaving back to Ireland that somewhat stacks the deck in the favor of one of the two locations. This kept me from feeling like the choices were evenly considered. In the end, it's a decision for Eilis about embracing her home and native culture and sense of community or branching out on her own and building something new and exciting. It's possibility and independence versus comfort and family. It's what can be versus what she's known. It's a decision that is universally relatable. Few of us have had romantic suitors and prosperous situations to vie over but many people have to make the normal decision of what path to embark, whether it's the risk of something different or the reassurance of what is familiar and what has been earned. These aren't the life-and-death stakes we see typically in the movies but they're the decisions that often dictate fates. Brooklyn is an easy movie to be carried away with. It's full of honest and earned emotions that resonate from its reletability, tender heart, and gentle observations of watching a woman navigate the choices of her life. It's an immigrant story and a coming-of-age tale, a romantic triangle with some fish-out-of-water elements. It's a lot more than the sum of its parts, but with actors this good and with a script this tailored to deliver emotional uplift and satisfaction, those are some mighty impressive parts. If you're on the hunt for a feel-good movie that won't make you roll your eyes or overdose on sap, then I advise you and your family take a trip to Brooklyn and enjoy the sights. Nate's Grade: A-",

      "review": "  LUCKY CHARMED - My Review of BROOKLYN (4 1/2 Stars)I'm not familiar with director John Crowley's previous work, but if the stellar, emotionally overpowering BROOKLYN is any indication, then he's definitely worth investigating. It doesn't hurt that Nick Hornby wrote the screenplay based on a book by Colm T�ib�n, as Hornby is no stranger to connecting with audiences via ABOUT A BOY, AN EDUCATION, and WILD. It's also a huge bonus to have, without a doubt, one of the best young actresses of her (or any) generation in Saoirse Ronan (ATONEMENT, THE LOVELY BONES), who at 21 years old can not only carry a movie, but sweep you away with such quiet skill and subtlety. If anyone working today reminds me of a young Meryl Streep in looks and talent, it's her. Mix all of that together to present an equal parts immigration and love story, and you get BROOKLYN, a simple, no-nonsense, old school tale that had me not just weeping, but straight up bawling for most of its running time. It may not be the best movie of the year, but it's hands down one of the best romances I've ever seen. Ronan plays Eilis, a young woman in a small Irish town who lives with her mother and sister. Wanting a better life than that of a whipping girl to the town Ogre's shop owner, Miss Kelly (a memorable Brid Brennan), Eilis gets a sponsored trip to America to start anew. Leaving her family behind presents the aching dramatic tension of this story, as well as her arduous trip across the ocean. On board, her bunkmate, a veteran of such crossings, teaches her how to properly assimilate into 1952 America.Upon arrival, her sponsor, Father Flood (Jim Broadbent) finds her an upscale department store job and a boarding house run by Mrs. Kehoe (Julie Walters, who has a table pounding great time with her many quotable lines). MAD MEN's Jessica Par�, in the snooty Parker Posey role as Eilis' new boss, manages to bring empathy to a somewhat bitchy role. Short on true Brooklyn atmosphere, the film, however, gets the emotions just right of a stranger in a strange land. Crowley knows how to use silence, glances, and breathing room in scenes to bring real feelings to the surface. Ellis is a strong yet observant character who can only contain her emotions for so long before they erupt, and I erupted right along with her. Cinematographer Yves B�langer, who kept his camera much more alive in WILD and DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, tends towards visceral, sweeping grandeur here, and appropriately so. Whether it's the musty views of a dark Irish street at night or the technicolor splendor of a crowded Coney Island beach, this is dreamy perfection. Also of note is the spot-on costume design by Odile Dicks-Mireaux and the just-right production design by Fran�ois S�guin. The pneumatic tubes in the department store are just one great detail we get to savor.More joy comes in the form of Tony (a star making performance from Emory Cohen), an Italian plumber who meets Eilis when he crashes an Irish mixer. Their love story is what makes this movie soar beyond all expectations. I can't recall the last time I witnessed a film where the puppy love and unbridled adoration just oozes off the screen. Cohen's sparkling eyes tell the whole story of what falling in love looks like. To say this pair has chemistry is an understatement in all its whooshy, gooey, innocent splendor. These two characters simply love being together, and the considerate, present, gentle tone of Cohen's performance redefines \"winning\". When is the last time you saw a film where the male protagonist rushes to wait outside a girl's school just so he can escort her home? Or when his declaration of love is done with such delicacy? I don't know if I cried because I was alone and dateless when I saw this film, or if I knew I was witnessing something so rare and pure, but the courtship scenes hit me in the gut.Of course complications get in the way of the relationship when unexpected events dictate Eilis' temporary (possibly permanent) return to Ireland. Here, we're treated to one heartbreaking scene after another, a pile-on many may find insufferable, but I found to be truthful. Virtually unable to escape her tribe whether in Ireland or her U.S. boarding house, Eilis finds herself at a crossroads. More than a love story, BROOKLYN is about figuring out your identity in life. Through Ronan's perfectly calibrated performance, we see Eilis change bit by bit. Introducing her Irish friends to her new culture, she meets another kind, young man, Jim (Domhnall Gleeson) who may impact the tough decisions that lie ahead. Ronan, Cohen, and Gleeson know what movie they're making, all of whom are unafraid of the gentle vulnerability in the script and direction. A special mention must be made for James DiGiacomo, who plays Tony's little brother Frankie. Stealing every moment with hilarious Italian hand gestures and direct, succinct comic timing, DiGiacomo feels like the kind of performer who will grow up to snag Don Rickles' career. Late in the film, there's a beautiful bookend to an earlier sequence that speaks to the generous loving heart of this movie. By paying kindness forward, by passing along knowledge and experience, BROOKLYN reveals a true American spirit. It's one we don't see very often anymore, particularly during a time where we don't always welcome newcomers with open arms. We may never again see an era as guileless as the kind depicted in this strong, lovely film, so go as a reminder of what true decency looks like. Go for Ronan's Oscar-worthy performance. That almost final shot of her standing, waiting, and posed with an iconic confidence gives you a visual, final gut bunch, guaranteed to melt even the coldest of hearts.",

Period pieces often miss the mark so far as authenticity, betraying a chink in the armor of an otherwise spotlessly told tale. It spoils your connection to the materials, no matter how well written or performed. No moment of Brooklyn feels forced, put-on, or broad. Everything - from the brilliant reconstruction of early '50s life in the city borough to the impeccable performance at its center - feels like a beautiful moment taken directly from your past life-something felt, seen, heard, smelled, and tasted.In this PG-13-rated drama, an Irish immigrant (Ronan) must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within after she lands in 1950s Brooklyn and quickly falls into a new romance, only for her past to catch up with her. Thanks to director John Crowley, the moments and characters feel utterly tangible. Saoirse Ronan proves a revelation here. On many radars since her unforgettable turn in Atonement, she grounds this satisfying immigrant song at every beat. Bottom line: New York State of Grace",

He captures the trepidation and excitement of Ellis Lacey's life-changing move to Brooklyn, New York from small town Ireland perfectly; his impressive script given all the gravitas required with an enchanting performance from Saoirse Ronan. It's a delicate, wise-beyond-her-years portrayal of a caring, considerate young woman who is torn between her new life and her old one. Ronan is nothing short of a revelation here in a weighty leading role that fully embraces her incredible acting abilities.The story may feel twee at times, but Hornby's script details incredible restraint. Ronan too reins in the need to wallow in melodrama with her nuanced performance. Director John Crowley's attention to detail in authenticity of the period is incredible; giving this small story the right injection of scale to give it weight without overburdening the story.The film rarely falters with its impeccable combination of production design, great storytelling and amazing performances. But more than anything, Brooklyn is a great reminder that old-fashioned storytelling is a dying art, and when it's this good it needs to be embraced.",

It can be a tear jerker. But it also has an underlying sweet and gentle tone to it so that even the tougher scenes don't last long.I really enjoyed the guy who played Tony. He played the character so naturally and just made you smile (and his little brother is a riot).",

I suppose it has some interesting and nice moments, about homesickness and finding your confidence, but I wasn't particularly compelled by anybody and I disliked how they tended to jump cut out of any large bits of dialogue. All in all, a very sweet and endearing movie but felt emotionally reserved to me. You never get a real sense of Tony so I didn't feel like she would have lost out. I'd say the lesson I learned was \"don't marry the first guy you meet.\"",

There is not a false note through the entire movie -- the girls and the boarding house mistress are not the evil stepsisters another movie would have made them, but a funny and protective group guiding the girl as she adjusts to life in the New World. That you are so invested in the young girl getting over homesickness, falling in love, and having to decide between Ireland and New York is a testament to Saoirse Ronan's performance. She is simply excellent in this role. The chemistry between her and the Italian American boy she meets in New York could not have been better. I also enjoyed the film's score and costume design -- the pastel colors of the dresses Ms. Ronan's characher wears throughout the film are appeasing to the eye. \"Brooklyn\" is funny, sweet, sad, and most importantly real.",

      "review": "  Its been a while I checked out a romantic film, & probably I would not have seen this one too provided it had not received all the Oscar buzz, despite the fact the film stars one of the most likable leading actresses of the younger generation. And boy was I glad I decided to watch this one. Trust me, this film is a remedy for anyone who is losing faith in good film making. It is a splendid reminder that you can tell a great story without resorting to excessive twists and effects. It's a simple tale, made complex by conflicting emotions and a welter of detail. It's funny and sad and bursting with life. Crafted with care, told with elegance & resonating a deep sense of warmth throughout its run time, this film is the story of an immigrant that beautifully illustrates the struggles faced when trying to adjust in a new environment with people you don't know & places you aren't familiar with, and not only does it work as a wonderful coming-of-age drama but also succeeds as a pleasant love story. The film also talks about being homesick. We have all felt it (I know I have), and continue to experience it when we venture off for a while. Not many of us have sailed across the ocean to a new country (obviously), torn apart from family and friends to begin a new life. Sometimes, a new romance can cure homesickness. They allow one to feel secure, like they made the right decision and loved, just like home. This film also walks us through that daring experience. Based on the novel of the same name, the film takes place during the early 1950s and follows Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan), a young Irish Catholic girl who has left Ireland to seek a better life in America. Leaving her elderly mother (Jane Brennan) and adored sister Rose (Fiona Glascott) in the small Irish town of Enniscorthy in Ireland, Ellis arrives in New York bewildered but hopeful after a journey marred by sea sickness. It is only after she begins a job as a salesperson in a ritzy department store in Brooklyn where her leering supervisor Miss Fortini (Jessica Par�) trains her to deal with their upscale customers that homesickness begins to set in and she longs for her mother and sister. The job, a room in a boarding house with other Irish immigrants, and night classes in accounting at Brooklyn College are all provided by Father Flood (Jim Broadbent), a reminder of the contribution that caring priests with integrity can provide, one that most immigrants do not have. At an Irish dance, she meets Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen), a young somewhat stereotypical Italian man who goes to these dances because he is attracted to Irish girls. Their relationship grows when Tony invites Ellis to his home to meet his family, a scene stolen by Tony's brash and funny eight-year-old brother Frankie (James DiGiacomo) who lets everyone know right away that \"the Italians hate the Irish.\" Their relationship is put on temporary hold, however, when unforeseen circumstances force Ellis to return to Ireland. Happy to see her mother again and to be back in familiar surroundings, she is also reminded of the small-town mindset as personified by the gossipy mean-spirited Miss Kelly (Brid Brennan), Eilis's one-time employer. Her stay extended to attend a friend's wedding, Ellis is offered work at an accounting office and is courted by an old friend Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson), a circumstance that confronts her with choices that will affect the rest of her life. The details of Eilis' story are fictional and may not match those of a majority of immigrants to the U.S., but her basic struggles and her heart match most of those immigrants. And they represent us. Writer Nick Hornby and director John Crowley also show a considerable amount of restrain in terms of evoking comedic circumstances in the film. Consider the scene when Eilis sits down to meet Tony's full-blooded Italian family over a spaghetti dinner, a scene ripe for stale comedic possibilities about the passive-aggressiveness Italians had towards Irish people and vice-versa. Instead, writer Nick Hornby conducts the scene in a manner that's thoroughly pleasant and even wryly comedic at times, thanks to great timing and strong respect for logic and narrative seriousness. This is a relate-able and utterly charming film which should not be missed. It's a simple tale that's wonderfully told with the help of great costumes, beautiful cinematography and story-telling that's old-fashioned, but doesn't feel outdated within the early 1950s setting. Eilis' particular set of circumstances are well-researched and not uncommon for this particular time and place. While the film has its fair share of emotionally manipulative sequences, mainly because the film's score is frequently overbearing and excessive, its nuances and insights into young love and how one person can almost entirely make one's fears and uncertainties about an area and their situation simply evaporate are considerably powerful. The scenes between Eilis and Tony are undeniably romantic and not overblown or incredulously depicted, as they are in your run-of-the-mill Nicholas Sparks novel. The two exude a very natural chemistry that is buoyed by their innocence and their clearly authentic smiles and affection for one another; to put it simply, if you're single and seeing this film alone, as I did, you'll be wishing you are walking out with someone special by your side at the end of it. Often movies have a magical quality as you're viewing them. Some will demand your undivided attention, others will hypnotize your senses, leaving them to simply wash over you with their exuberance and classic film making procedures. In the case of director John Crowley's film, the latter is certainly the case. There comes a moment in the film when you are taken in by the film's classic style film making, and tenderly thought-provoking performances from its cast. Director Crowley, in partnership with Oscar-nominated scribe Nick Hornby, create a beautiful and sensitive love story that is everything a Nicholas Sparks film adaptation wishes it could be. The main contributor to the film is the lead actress, Saoirse Ronan, who plays her role meticulously while also constantly owning the tone of the film. Her delicate and sincere portrayal makes all Eilis's issues, however selfish or insignificant they may seem at first, materialize in your mind, and makes you hope that her pain will somehow ease. Already a one-time Oscar nominee, Ronan reaffirms her acting strength with this exceptional performance. Of all emerging young adult lead actresses, she is likely the most charismatic one in 5 years since Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone. Emory Cohen shows his sensitive and charming side of his range, resulting in an equally measured and tantalizing performance to his co-star. Domhnall Gleeson's career has blown up, and rightfully so. He shows his brilliant talent, even in a small role. You can see the ache and pain in his movements, desperate for love and an overwhelming feeling of being lost. In a few scenes, Julie Walters as Mrs. Kehoe sustains as a surprisingly comic relief in a very serious drama. Her passive demeanor is such a treat to watch in her scenes of interaction with the girls of the boarding house in which Ellis is staying. Jim Broadbent is likable in a small role. On the whole, 'Brooklyn' is is a damn fine movie! Filled with universal themes, the film doubles well as heartfelt love story & a compelling coming of age drama. It's a joyful and heart aching film that stands as one of last year's best, and a sure-fire contender for several Academy Awards.",

First I thought he had the freshness and welcoming, transparent charm of Paul Newman, then he had the physical smoldering of Marlon Brando, finally he had that edgy self-will of Sinatra. But those comparisons do him no justice. He may have all those characteristics, but he ain't any of those actors. He is who he is, open and charming, smoldering, a bit driven. He could be one of our greatest actors if his roles and lifestyle cooperate. We should be watching this guy.",

      "review": "  With a setting as authentic as the performances themselves, Brooklyn is a genuinely touching and honest movie. Rather than simply recycling the typical romance clich�s that have long-saturated the genre and led it to becoming something of a punchline, it instead sets out to tell a very real story with very real emotions. Much like The Spectacular Now it isn't afraid to show a love story beginning and developing through its characters most basic of interactions, not through contrived occurrences or profundities. Saoirse Ronan is truly fantastic in the lead role, and her emotional development and maturity is the movie's centrepiece. From shy small-town girl to big-city woman, the character is moulded by her environment and the people in it. When she switches between her new home and her old it is easy to see how differently she acts in each of them, before and after her life-altering relocation. The film's use of lighting and colour help to set the mood, and while the score can be overbearing at times, it really helps to push the emotional moments. The pacing, which is admittedly a little to pedestrian, may weigh the movie down in places, but with likeable, relatable characters, beautiful historic detail, a witty, down to earth script and truly marvellous performances, Brooklyn more than succeeds as a human drama, emphasis on the word human.",

      "review": "  Such a great film about relationships and family. The movie is shot with a full view but has a very subtle tone to the story. It has some parts that are overly dramatic and some that drag on at parts, but overall it is a great movie for anyone over the age of 18. The acting is brilliant and the film work is even more amaing. The characters in the film are perfectly dramatic but with some humor, but not too much to over play the story. I think the story is written in a way that tells a beautiful tale while not being too much. I think Saoirse Ronan does a brilliant job in this film and should win at least one award for such an amazing job at acting the part.",

      "review": "  Have you ever watched a movie that was so understated you wanted to jump into the onscreen world and push the characters around? That's exactly how I felt with Carol, an unrequited lesbian romance set against the closeted and intolerant era of 1950s America. Carol (Cate Blanchett) is a rich wife who meets Therese (Rooney Mara), a department store employee who assists with her Christmas shopping. They are both drawn to one another in the strange way that love works, and their possible relationship could jeopardize Carol's custody of her young child. Because of the time period, so much of this romantic liaison is internalized and thus we get longing looks, small gestures that are meant to speak volumes, and plenty of starting and stopping, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks. I don't have an issue with unrequited romances but Carol is one that feels like its entire world, painstakingly recreated, has been placed under glass for study. There's no passion evident throughout the movie and I was left wondering what exactly Therese saw in Carol and vice versa. Neither woman has a particularly strong personality, though that could be a side effect of having to live publicly as a different person. I couldn't get into them as characters and so felt little interest in seeing them together, which made the constant circling and nervous indecision even more belabored. Blanchett and Mara are quite good and director Todd Haynes (I'm Not There) handles the material with respectful subtlety, I just wish that Carol could have shaken off some of that subtlety and given me a better reason to care about these women. It's understated to death. Nate's Grade: C+",

      "review": "  To me, with the amount of buzz and praise that \"Carol\" is getting, I was expecting a much more powerful love story, but here we go. \"Carol,\" at its core is about two women, one young and one older, who share similar interests and have a bond unlike ever before. There have been quite a few films over the past ten years that explores this subject, so for me it will take a little more to impress. Throughout the duration of this picture, each of them question if they truly are in love and by the end of the film I had no connection to these characters whatsoever when their minds were finally made up. This is a very drab looking film set in the past, and I felt that aspect alone was only to attract an older audience, in which I really believe this film was intended. \"Carol\" is a very deep story that is not anyone who isn't of age or can buy into a relationship as drastic as this one. \"Carol,\" for me, is the epitome of a story that does what it does in order to attract attention. It's risqu� plot felt risqu� just for the sake. I will say this in favour of this movie however. With performances this good from it's two leads, this should have been a much more interesting story. \"Carol\" is pretty disappointing to say the least. I just can't get myself to recommend it, but the effort shines the whole way through and I will commend it for that. A nice attempt, but it is just not for me.",

Terrific performances from Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are heightened by excellent direction from Todd Haynes, who focuses more on visual storytelling here), and a wonderful screenplay that expresses the burden of ordinary lives for women. Women, even today, have been tied down by the fate of their male lovers and societal norms, and the movie expresses this with subtlety and class. Furthermore, it expresses that this is not a story about two lesbians falling in love; it's a story about two good people falling in love. That is the mindset that society needs to get to. That is what this movie is pushing for. What a message, and what a movie. Easily one of the best of 2015.",

      "review": "  FAR FROM HEAVIN' - My Review of CAROL (4 Stars)Somewhat of a sister project to his 2002 film, FAR FROM HEAVEN, Todd Haynes' CAROL, written by Phyllis Nagy, looks at repression in the 1950's through a decidedly queer lens. It's a quiet, deliberately stilted look at the developing love between Carol, a New York suburban divorcee (Cate Blanchett) and Therese (Rooney Mara), a young department store clerk. Still in the throws of a divorce and custody battle with her husband Harge (Kyle Chandler), which has got to be the WASP-iest character name I've heard in ages, Carol meets Therese while Christmas shopping. The film opens, however, later on in the story, when Carol and Therese sit in a fancy restaurant and are interrupted by one of Therese's friends. The remainder of the film flashes back to their meeting and eventually fills us in on the importance of their dinner scene. It's a strange bookend device due to the fact that it's based on an emotional epiphany rather than a plot point. The great mystery of this film is whether or not these characters will ever be truly able to express themselves. Haynes is swimming in very familiar waters again, making another twisted variation of a Douglas Sirk melodrama. Mara is icy, interesting, and otherworldly, giving Therese a wide-eyed vacant stare that deftly hides her true feelings. She's like an eerily quiet Zooey Deschanel. It's a tricky, fill-in-the-blanks role, and Mara, resisting the tough bravado at which she typically excels, stretches herself with this minimalist approach. Chandler gives a galvanizing performance as the jilted, typically patriarchal husband who still manages to sympathetically show the hurt of losing his wife. Jake Lacy plays Mara's boyfriend, and like Chandler, he evokes sympathy due to the fact that society expected alpha male behavior from its men, even if the men weren't fully on board. Sarah Paulson plays Blanchett's ex-girlfriend, and in her very few scenes, she paints a vivid picture of a woman not afraid to be her own person, much like the actress herself. Blanchett, however, has the toughest part, and she's grand and theatrical in a way we haven't seen since the great female stars of the 30s and 40s. The performance factor necessary to conform to 50s society reads loud and clear with every formal gesture and tight smile Blanchett gives. Carol often comes off as a predator in trying to ensnare Therese, lacing her polite conversation with subtle innuendos and not-so-subtle glances. Blanchett and Mara don't so much have chemistry together as they do an odd performance friction and a cohesive dedication to the subject matter. Neither character has the tools for self-expression, and at a time where one could go to jail on morals charges, it's easy to understand why their love story is so clandestine. When Therese requests Carol's address and subsequently mails gloves she left behind, it feels like a suspenseful, sexually charged endeavor. It's a risk that still could lead to jail time, torture and even execution in many parts of the world today. It takes most of the film's running time for these women to even so much as kiss. They circle each other, speak in code, until they finally, FINALLY feel safe. Late in the film, there's a surprising turn of events that drives home the necessity for gay people to be quiet even behind closed doors. CAROL keeps things pretty chaste and at arm's length throughout. It's long been a signature of Haynes' work to play with these formalities and expose what's hidden just under the surface. If you love that style, you'll love it again in CAROL. If not, it's easy to see how some could find this to be a lifeless bore. Quite the opposite, I found the film to be achingly beautiful, sad, and swooningly powerful. The novel was the first of its kind to depict a same sex relationship that didn't end in suicide or some such tragedy. I won't spoil the ending to the film, however, but suffice it to say, Haynes and Nagy seem to delight in bringing all of the subtext usually buried in romantic storylines, and gradually laying it out on the table. This film remains true to its time and is a reminder of how far we've come as an American society, yet how far we need to go as a world community still.Adding greatly to the mood of the film is Edward Lachman's gorgeously windswept, snowy cinematography and Carter Burwell's swirling, quiet yet memorable score. It's highly reminiscent of Philip Glass' work, yet Burwell maintains his own distinct voice. Sandy Powell's costume design adds to the beautiful color palette of this film, giving both Blanchett and Mara vivid, memorable looks. Mara's hat alone feels just right for her curious, observant character. It tells us she's an artist trapped in the social mores of her time. Like its source material, Patricia Highsmith's novel, THE PRICE OF SALT, CAROL is a romance that feels like a mystery thriller. If you don't mind its formal style, stilted chastity and the feeling that Todd Haynes has already made this film before, you're likely to fall for the lushness of the furs, the restaurant smoking, the poached eggs and creamed spinach dishes and the \"love that dare not speak its name\" nature of this little gem.",

      "review": "  Making a forbidden love feel so palpable that it leaves you breathless, Carol whisks you into the early 1950s and a romance so perfectly that snapping back into reality proves challenging. You feel the passion. You feel the performances. Indeed, Blanchett and Mara ground the material to a blush-inducing goose pimply degree. Their attraction breathes authenticity from frame one, building from a simmer due to the mores of the time and slowly putting filmgoers through the paces of wanting something that they cannot touch. Then, however, the kettle boils over as only such a beautifully conveyed adaptation of a groundbreaking book can.In this R-rated romantic drama based on the novel The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith, an aspiring photographer (Mara) develops an intimate relationship with an older woman (Blanchett). Todd Haynes, who excellently emulated the Technicolor H'Wood melodrama of Golden Age director Douglas Sirk with Far from Heaven, chronicles a much more tangible '50s here. So rich in period detail that you begin to interpret social media as a communal payphone in a boarding house, Carol is an immersive period piece in every sense of the word. Bottom line: The Price of Salty",

      "review": "  \"Carol\" is a beautiful work of art. The acting is subtle, the script is simple, and the 1950's culture comes alive in this period piece. It is a shoe-in for Oscar nominations in Production Design, Costumes, and probably Best Picture. But there is one scene that will overshadow all of the other elements. The writing of an adapted screenplay comes with a responsibility to stay true to the source material but less is often more in these sorts of scenes. The human imagination is powerful and some of the most intimate scenes in cinema history have been filmed through tasteful images that do not necessitate graphic nudity. There is a reason that \"50 Shades of Gray\" does not deserve a place in the Oscars. In an artsy film like this, I actually believe that it would have been more artistic to use the powerful musical score and creative cinematography to portray this scene. The score by Carter Burwell is sublime and pulls the subtle acting and time period together into a tapestry of emotion. Its minimalist quality is reminiscent of Philip Glass's Oscar-nominated scoring of \"The Hours.\" The highlight of the film is Rooney Mara. She brings so much innocence to this role and has an amazing classical look. I would have never predicted that after seeing her in \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\" but that's what makes her such a versatile actress. She is physically contrasted by Cate Blanchett, who brings an entirely different set of emotions to the film. The beautiful thing about this film is the self-discovery that these two characters experience together but in different ways. The acting is absolutely wonderful and the film's energy comes directly from the vivid portrayals of these characters. We spend most of the film waiting for something big to happen, only to realize that the \"something big\" is happening inside of Therese and Carol. This film needs to be approached like a painting. Rather than looking for something unexpected, you will experience the beauty of \"Carol\" through the growth of its characters and by absorbing the visually marvelous 1950's atmosphere.",

Homosexuality was a disease and in fact was treated with doctors.Carol is blackmailed with her little girl to be the model housewife in order to quit her relationship with other women. The film explore unhappiness in the most happy time of all Christmas, men Misogyny's and also lack of women empower in a time where america was interested in keeping their women's in the kitchen.This film is stunning when it comes to cinematography art direction and costume design. Blanchet and Mara have a perfect chemistry, but also are powerful in their roles.",

As Therese, Mara's passion is able to elevate a fairly bland script to unforeseen heights. With apologies to fellow star Cate Blanchett, I feel pretty safe in saying Carol is a one-woman show.",

In many ways it's a more realistic portrayal of falling in love than movies that a filled with immediate drama and intense passion that fizzles out. They have great chemistry and I'm cheering for them to make it from the get go. A lovely movie, wonderful time spent on getting the period piece right, and superb acting. If people could just slow down and let the characters in, this movie would be appreciated even more.",

      "review": "  Is this movie going to be for everyone? No. I enjoyed it for the most part especially because it has some excellent performances, but I found the overall story to be lacking a bit. Taking place in the 1950's the film follows a young lady named Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) who is an inspiring photographer that is working at a toy store in New York when she encounters an older woman named Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett). They both get the vibes off each other and soon enough Carol calls Therese and they go on a lunch date together. Both women are in relationships, but they're not going anywhere, or just not working. Therese has a boyfriend, but doesn't seem to fond of him and Carol is going through a divorce from her husband Harge (Kyle Chandler). Harge takes Carols young daughter away from her and awaits the lawyers for their divorce. During this time a heart broken Carol takes young Therese with her on a road trip where they both realize they have strong feelings for each other. When they get back to New York they both have to make tough decisions. Therese wants to focus on her career while Carol just wants her daughter back in her life. The decisions are what define us and the plot itself gives us an understanding that the two women although divided by age love each other. I would have liked it to show a bit more of how homosexuality was seen during the 50's, but the film barely scratches that surface. The film itself is a bit slow paced and really is just about a road trip that seems to end too soon. The performances are the main reason for this one and overall i'd say its a rent!",

Set in the early 50s in New York we follow young Therese who meets the older and very refined Carol. Carol's marriage is loveless and falling apart. Slowly but surely they form a relationship that is clearly frowned upon in that era. This is a slow burn of a film that is elegant and assured like most Todd Haynes films. But somehow I couldn't connect 100% emotionally. Cate Blanchett is always seriously good but I don't think this is absolutely her best work. Her character was a little too one dimensional and distant. Maybe that was deliberate but it just kept me a little at arms length. It does finish strongly though and Rooney Mara is quite superb. It is also an insightful glimpse into the morals of the time.",

      "review": "  Carol touches on the idea that love can be a difficult concept to grasp and may cause confusion to those who aren't certain about their sexuality. It's a great topic to look into; if only certain points of the movie were more subtle about it than having Mara's character try to beat around the bush asking her almost boyfriend if he's ever loved a boy.We begin by seeing Therese and Carol talking in a lobby when Therese is spotted by an old friend who asks her if she is attending a party. Therese goes with the friend while reflecting on Carol, sending us into the past to the events right before Therese and Carol meet. When Therese spots Carol for the first time in the store where she works, it seems very similar to the notion of the male gaze often found in narrative cinema. There is a clear interest in the figure before Therese gets distracted, but they of course meet a few moments later. They aren't necessarily flirting, but they are two people with a connection, and perhaps that's what love is - as long as the connection is strong enough.Kyle Chandler as Carol's husband Harge (his name is Harge?) is the closest thing to an antagonist in this film, and this role is somewhat strange. At first it seems that he feels Carol is evil because she is a lesbian who won't come out and say it, but you have to put into context that he's the father of her child, and by seeing other people (women or not) she is damaging the relationship she has with her husband, a relationship that would affect the child. What seems to be overly dramatic is the fact that he doesn't think she is fit to have joint custody simply due to these lies she is trying to cover up. Carol is a struggling lesbian in a time well before anybody like her would be accepted, and because of this she has to be condemned? This film is partially about the struggles of the LGBT community, but that allegation seems too dramatic considering the actual circumstances within the film.This film is definitely well-acted by both Mara and Blanchett. Both leads have their own internal struggles with who they are and what love really means. Mara's playing her character as shy and fragile is top notch while Blanchett shines as being confident but overwhelmed and sometimes heart-broken by the results of her actions. If you don't mind sex, Carol is not really that heavy with \"bad\" content for an R-rated movie. This film is easy to watch and explores great issues, but at certain points comes across as cheesy or tries too hard to be dramatic.3.0/4.0",

      "review": "  Carol is complicated. Outwardly, it's a retro-drama about forbidden love between two women in the 1950s. Underneath, it's looking at the more complex and intriguing world of human connection. It's sexy yet proper; it's delicate yet strong; it's romantic yet haunting; a picturesquely shot period-piece that stuns with its beauty, both visually and aurally (the score is mesmerizing). So with all the technical perfection, why did I find it to be the most critically overrated movie of 2015? Despite its unendingly admirable skill, it left me unsatisfied and, worse yet, emotionally confused.Mara plays a na�ve young woman spellbound and emotionally seduced by Blanchett's broken and mesmerizing Carol, a woman who seems to have a \"There's-Something-About-Carol\"-esque effect on everyone she meets. Both actresses are as phenomenal as you've probably heard, but our relationship to them is nearly as frustrating as their relationship is to each other. In a terribly confused bit of story framing, we meet them at the end of their relationship before going back to the beginning, as we watch the sheepishly sweet Mara get emotionally destroyed by the almost predatory Blanchett. This would be fine, except the movie itself doesn't seem to be wrongly convinced that Carol is ultimately a \"good\" person, giving her too many chances to plead her selfish case.Herein lies the complication: despite these flaws, it's a visually gorgeous and thematically interesting film. Director Haynes creates a hazy atmosphere in his perfect Christmas setting, highlighting the similarities between its titular character and the holiday season's preposterous promises. Unfortunately these noble positives couldn't mask my overwhelming sense that Carol was less-than-noble in its own messaging.",

There seems to be no order and the country is entirely corrupt. If i was a Mexican it would totally depress me.

      "review": "  Two men stood against on the different side of the border for the same cause.I was not sure what to expect from this film. By seeing its poster, my mind was very clear that it definitely some serious subject. I'm kind of a person who's not okay with the lions killing a zebra on the animal planet, so I was worried about the clips they might show would be too violence. You know, in the movies everything's fake, and this isn't a movie, but a documentary. That's why I simply disliked 'The Act of Killing'.The opening scene was something like 'Breaking Bad', so I thought it might told from the bad guy's perspective about how their network and business would work. But everything drastically changed after the 5-10 minutes of the film. It's where the original story commence.The two main characters were introduced who are fighting for a same cause, but separated by the international line. Across the border, under the different society and government, how these two sacrifice their lives in battle against the dangerous networks that threatens the peace is the story.In a small town on the southern border of the US, a small paramilitary team headed by Tim has taken such a measure to prevent the all kinds of trafficking. In the same line, Dr. Mireles from the Michoacan, Mexico, goes a bit bigger and stronger by forming a force with the volunteered people with arms to fight for the same mission.The film had many the phases, not like the chapters or the episodes, but like a split in the narration to cover the other side of the story. The stories of two men and their undertaking was the prime focus. That's what I thought, you know I felt it was a modern day 'The Magnificent Seven', but in the larger scale of everything. Only until a twist that surprised me, because I was not thought a tale would turn like this.\"I believe what I'm doing is good.And I believe what I'm standing up against is evil.\"So what's the twist? I tell you, you know, one man was doing his task all by himself with the help of a few other buddies. On the other side, the man's contribution becomes the nation and international news and publicity. In such circumstance, a fame can turn the destiny of a man on whatever side. It's not like why he did what he had done, but a default human nature.I thought 'Heli' was a fictional work. After seeing this documentary I'm not sure how to judge any country by what they depict in their films. Every nation has its flaws, but I wondered why Mexican government was so blind over drug trafficking as shown in this film, if the information was correct. The absence of the federal law enforcement agencies on those disputed places is really a humiliation for the government after this film officially entered the Oscars race.I don't think taking action again them won't collapse the nation or the economy. And again, I'm not the right person here to analyse and predict the nation's fate. I've never been to Mexico and I know little about Mexico, but all this only because of the curious to know the truth, that's all. When it comes to the filmmaking, I don't know how it was made.Documentaries usually follows with the series of interviews and the recorded clips, in this it was a live shot like any entertainment film. Maybe I must look for director's Q&A for the answers. But something was sure, that production happened at the right place at the right time.This a very good documentary film, very gripping and interesting storyline with the characters. I don't watch documentaries on the regular basis and to be honest, I saw it for the Oscars nod, to know what its special. I don't think it is going to win, certainly I can't either rule out the chances as it made this far. Anything might happen, so wait and see.It had a few dull moments, lot like a pause in the narration or took a wrong diversion after the first half. But during the conclusion, brought back to the track and clarified many doubts, yet leave a few unanswered. Not for the sake of the Academy Awards nominee, you can give it a try if you feel you're interested to know why the people are taking arms in their hands to fight the evil force that corrupting our society.8/10",

It also talks a lot about the Mexico vigilantes and how they try to clean their towns. At the same time showing how the Autodefense (Mexican vigilantes) sometimes abuse this power. In all this film mostly shows how little power the Mexican Government has against the cartels and how that lack of control is causing problem for us hear in America. On a side note, if people just stopped doing so many drugs there wouldn't be this problem. Just saying.",

      "review": "  The story of the Mexican vigilantes is engrossing and rich, with nuances that expose some of the complexities that exist with the cartel/vigilante/government struggle for power in these rural communities. The parallel that tries to be drawn with the Arizona civilian army is confusing, and at times seems contrived. While the coverage of the strife that happens in Michaoacan is insightful, the opposite is true for the coverage of the self armed, racist border patrol. It knocks you over the head, trying to juxtapose the stories of self determination in two communities that struggle against drug cartel violence. The movie could have had more direction and purpose if it hadn't included the Arizona vigilantes. While they do have a story to to tell, it doesn't add much to the narrative.",

On the Arizona border US vet Tim Foley has formed a vigilante group out of frustration at flagrant lawlessness. In Michoacan, 1,000 miles south, where death is an everyday occurrence, Jose Mireles, a medical doctor leads the Autodefensas, intent on driving out the Knights Templar cartel. There are severed heads, dead bodies, a survivor's account of having to witness the unspeakable murder of her husband and other family members, interviews with workers in a meth lab, real shootouts. Dr. Mireles, a charismatic leader, nearly dies in a plane crash. Originally embraced by the local population, the vigilantes' lack of discipline is their undoing. Infiltrated by the cartels, they often behave no better than their enemy.",

      "review": "  Having liven in Arizona, in Tucson no less and spent times hunting in the Mountains South of Tucson, just 15 miles from the Mexico border, I can say the Mexican Drug cartels are causing major problem for the U.S. Cartel Land shows not just the problems on the US side but more importantly the problems in Mexico. It also talks a lot about the Mexico vigilantes and how they try to clean their towns. At the same time showing how the Autodefense (Mexican vigilantes) sometimes abuse this power. In all this film mostly shows how little power the Mexican Government has against the cartels and how that lack of control is causing problem for us hear in America. On a side note, if people just stopped doing so many drugs there wouldn't be this problem. Just saying.",

      "review": "  The story of the Mexican vigilantes is engrossing and rich, with nuances that expose some of the complexities that exist with the cartel/vigilante/government struggle for power in these rural communities. The parallel that tries to be drawn with the Arizona civilian army is confusing, and at times seems contrived. While the coverage of the strife that happens in Michaoacan is insightful, the opposite is true for the coverage of the self armed, racist border patrol. It knocks you over the head, trying to juxtapose the stories of self determination in two communities that struggle against drug cartel violence. The movie could have had more direction and purpose if it hadn't included the Arizona vigilantes. While they do have a story to to tell, it doesn't add much to the narrative.",

On the Arizona border US vet Tim Foley has formed a vigilante group out of frustration at flagrant lawlessness. In Michoacan, 1,000 miles south, where death is an everyday occurrence, Jose Mireles, a medical doctor leads the Autodefensas, intent on driving out the Knights Templar cartel. There are severed heads, dead bodies, a survivor's account of having to witness the unspeakable murder of her husband and other family members, interviews with workers in a meth lab, real shootouts. Dr. Mireles, a charismatic leader, nearly dies in a plane crash. Originally embraced by the local population, the vigilantes' lack of discipline is their undoing. Infiltrated by the cartels, they often behave no better than their enemy.",

Firstly I don't think the group on the American side were that interesting or analogous to the group on the Mexican side. The Mexican side were basically an effective operation to fight criminality both in the cartels and the government. The American guys seemed like a bunch of lost souls. I wasn't even quite sure what they thought they were achieving but all it seemed to be was capturing some dumb kids. So the story on the mexican side was much more fascinating but it was told in a quite a muddled way. For example the split in Autodefensas (which was a key point) seemed confusing, Basically it was a filmmaker so familiar with his subject matter than he often lingers on irrelevant details while failing to explain major points. The story of Autodefensas was amazing and can be summed up by \"Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.\"",

Still, the show must go on, even as the tone has changed radically. So, while Maria does her best to avoid a fellow actor she loathes, she also learns of a proposed new version of the same play with Maria playing the older character this time around.At first, I very much enjoyed the interplay between Kristen Stewart and Juliette Binoche which makes up a large chunk of \"Clouds of Sils Maria.\" But at the end, as I stood up from the art house theatre where I saw this, I began to realize how preachy the entire movie had been. Just because I agree with how unfairly certain young actresses like Kristen Stewart(see also: Heigl, Katherine) are treated by the media did not make me feel any better. And then there is the shrill way that writer-director Olivier Assayas goes after superhero movies which is ironic considering it looks like he has not seen a science fiction movie since about 1979.",

      "review": "  ALL ABOUT ALEVE - My Review of CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA (4 Stars)Writer/Director Olivier Assayas, whose work on CARLOS I greatly admired, has returned with the quiet, meditative CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA. Featuring a trio of fantastic performances by Juliette Binoche, Kristen Stewart, and Chloe Grace Moretz, this backstage showbiz drama takes on issues such as aging, identity, relevancy, honesty, feminism, agism, and the inevitability of change. Think of it as a modern day ALL ABOUT EVE, but with headier concerns.The hushed tones of the film are not for everybody and are highly reminiscent of the late Eric Rohmer's work. Very talky and complex, with overt themes spelled out in nearly every conversation, the film tells the story of Maria Enders (Binoche), who accepts a part in a play revival which made her a star decades earlier. Now, however, she's been cast to play the older character, with her original role going to a Lindsay Lohan-esque actress Jo-Ann Ellis (Moretz). For the bulk of the film, Maria holes up in the chalet of the late writer to better absorb the part and rehearse with her incredibly competent personal assistant, Valentine (Stewart). Soon the lines get blurred between reality and the play they're picking apart, whose subject and circumstances seem to mirror what's right in front of them. The chalet is in the shadow of a Swiss Alpine weather phenomenon called the Maloja Snake, which also is the name of the play Binoche is in. Essentially a rolling fog/cloud formation that works its way through a mountain pass, the metaphor of its mystery and reliability to charge ahead will not be lost on the viewers of this film. That's because the script goes to great lengths to make sure you get it. Regardless, this is is a truly engaging film, but not without its flaws. Nearly every male role in the film is awkwardly performed and somewhat thankless. There is a very strange interlude in the film in which Valentine takes a road trip that defines ambiguity and will lead to after-movie discussions. Same goes for a late-in-the-movie scene with Binoche and Stewart; the less said the better. Trust me, you'll be talking about it. Sometimes the dialogue is highly stilted, yet our two leads always find a way to ground it in reality with their considerable chemistry. Stewart won the Cesar Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first American actress to ever win France's equivalent to the Oscars, and it's easy to see why. Stewart is assured, complicated, and so entirely present in her scenes. She and Binoche work up such a lovely rapport, prickly one moment and affectionate the next. It's by no means a showy role, bereft of that big scene actors chew on in order to win statuettes. Instead, Stewart is focused, presenting a highly accurate depiction of the assistant's life. This isn't a wisecracking Thelma Ritter performance. Valentine must be a jack of all trades, as proficient in rehearsing as she is in making travel plans, and Stewart invests herself so completely in this role. With her performance here and in STILL ALICE (and let's not forget she's done stellar work before in PANIC ROOM, INTO THE WILD, and ADVENTURELAND), she may just yet succeed in making me forget the TWILIGHT SAGA. Binoche has always been great. I look back on an incredible career with her star-making turn in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING and subsequent stellar performances (ok, we can pretend GODZILLA never happened!), and see that the role of Maria is a meta-critique of her own experiences. Everything that Maria experiences clearly has a counterpart in Binoche's own life, and her brave, tough-as-nails portrayal is a career highlight.Moretz doesn't appear until very late in the film, but she leaves her mark as a character with impressive duality. One moment, she's the strung out starlet we're used to seeing stumbling panty-free out of limos on TMZ, and the next she's lucid, highly articulate,and pulled together. There's either scenes of scary ambition in her squinting eyes or no doubt a half bottle of Visine in others, and it begs the question, \"Which one is the real Jo-Ann?\" The fun of this role is finding out the answer, and her final scene with Binoche is a knockout. Yorick Le Saux's cinematography is simple yet effective, but the real technical star here is Production Designer Fran�ois-Renaud Labarthe, whose stage set for the play-within-the-movie alone is something he needs to put in his highlight reel for the remainder of his career. Contrasting so sharply with the nature photography that comes before it, the set is a jaw-dropping, highly imaginative realization of a modern office. If only the stage musical to 9 TO 5 had Labarthe on their team!Again, this isn't a film for those who need action, loud soundtracks, or explanations. It's small, haunting charms, however, will resonate with moviegoers who have grown tired of the BOOM BOOM POW.",

She so effortlessly holds her own against the typically magnetic Binoche to the point where she steals the show; a feat made all the more impressive considering the duo share most of the screen time together, with not a second of fineness wasted between them.Which is an important dynamic, as Clouds is fundamentally rich in character because of the two, but the light-as-air narrative moves at a glacial pace. It's slow, but the absorbing interplay of dialogue highlights the complexities in their multi-layered, nuanced performances. The honesty and openness shared by the characters often feels ethereal, much like the setting they find themselves in, but also force these characters to become far more fascinating than they would otherwise have been.Clouds is a captivating character study that will be a struggle for some, but is all the more rewarding thanks to its incredible lead performances that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",

It's still intriguing however, due in no small part to Binoche who gives an unsurprisingly complex and nuanced performance . . . and you know, Stewart isn't half bad herself here.",

Another thing is how great Kristen Stewart is in this movie. With solid performances recently in Still Alice & Camp X-ray, she is really surprising a lot of people. I think she has always been capable of this, but the Twilight movies kind of sent her off track for awhile. Hope to see more good things from her in the future. Binoche & Stewart are just so much fun to watch together on screen. Clouds of Sils Maria is very much worth seeing.",

I find it a little funny for that Kristen Stewart seems to be getting so much buzz and praise for her performance, neither her character or performance is all that good or memorable. I don't mean to say she's bad, just merely competent. That's where I find the humor: finally Kristen Stewart gives a competent performance, and it blows people away to see her give an average performance after years of having less emotional range than a block of wood.",

      "review": "  I'm always fascinated when a film's subject is film itself. The actors conflicts, fame, the making a play, show business in general. In \"Cloud Sils Maria\" is a French movie by director Oliveier Assayas, about an actress Maria Enders (Julliete Binoche) and her relationship with her loyal American Assistant Valentine (Kristen Stewart) At the beginning of the movie Maria and Valentine are traveling by train to Zurich for an event to honor a famous writer Wilhelm Melchoir who gave Maria her first opportunity in the industry, playing a young role in Maloha Snake. Maria received the news that Melchoir passed away, but the event will happen as plan. During the event a theater director approached Maria to play a role again in the play Maloja Snake, but this time the older character, Maria decided to spent the following months in Wilhelm Melchoir house in the mountain to prepare for the role, the house name Sils Maria\"Cloud Sils Maria\" is a deep exploration of fame in the film industry as well the theater circuit. The film divided by chapters present a conflict, young vs old, from Mari to Valentine, they argue on how important celebrities are portrait themselves in the media to be relevant. This is when Jo-Ann Ellis (Chlo� Grace Moretz) appears, which is the new younger antagonist she is a reflection of Maria at her younger years as an actress. Maria is famous but is not relevant as Jo-Ann is. The film is powerful, with great performances and a very unusual structure that makes the audience question the reality of the characters and their actual presence on film.",

      "review": "  Imagine Bergman directing All About Eve and that should give you a general idea of Clouds of Sils Maria, which is a terrific film spiced with wit and acid, and a penetrating look into the female psyche, a running theme for director Olivier Assayas, who gave Juliette Bnnoche her first starring role as a young actress in 1985's Rendez-vous. Assayas is again collaborating with Oscar-winner Binoche, where she plays a 40-something film actress seeing coveted roles slip out of her reach because of her age.Binoche is simply award-caliber in the role. Trouble begins when Maria is offered a part in the stage adaptation of Maloja Snake, the film that launched her career 20 years earlier. Maria is no longer the hot young thing since she is being asked to play the part of the middle-aged assistant with an erotic fixation for her young boss.It's Val (Kristen Stewart), Maria's personal assistant, who encourages her boss to accept the part. Val also encourages Maria to take a closer look at Jo-Ann Ellis (a wonderful Chloe Grace Moretz), the new Hollywood It girl who is tapped to play the role that made Maria famous. In a stingingly funny scene, Maria looks on as Jo-Ann stars in a cheesy sci-fi epic and ponders what business this teen starlet has acting.Watching art and life collide so tantalizingly is a kick. Stewart knows form what she's playing, even as the lowly assistant. Stewart's role is a challenging one, and she meets every one of those challenges with sharp eyes and timing. She nails the role, so it's no wonder her sensational performance earned her a Cesar award, the French Oscar that before Stewart, was never awarded to an American actress.Stewart and Binoche mixing it up onscreen as Val and Maria engage in power games to prep Maria for a role she fears, whether running lines or comparing high lives in a chalet in the Swiss Alps, where they get to see the actual Maloja Snake, a meteorological phenomenon that happens when clouds move between mountains in the form of a serpent. No need to get too hung up on the metaphors, just dive into the pleasures of seeing two dynamo actresses go toe to toe, as well as the beautiful artwork Assayas has made of them as he puts the things that define womanhood under the knife.",

It seems like it was edited with a sledgehammer, and the fiction-within-the-fiction doesn't justify the in-film praise it receives, but Clouds is an incredibly clever movie which builds exceptional characters for Binoche and Stewart, whose chemistry is so remarkable that it almost works as a buddy film disregarding the big heavy metaphors.

      "review": "  There is something within the craftsmanship of an artist, notably one of an actor or actress, to view and understand the strokes of their skill, to witness the progression of their journey as they either come into grips or further alienate in the roles they commit, to penetrate the facade built upon the voyeuristic perspectives of the roaming and hunting members of the tabloids, shedding light that allows for its in-lookers to share empathy.Olivier Assayas distances Clouds of Sils Maria's perspective from grand satire, its heart remains with the protagonists in focus; an established actress, Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche) returning to the stage production that stimulated and stamped her career, the foundations that has brought to where she is now, now embarking on the role that was once opposite her, now the woman of perceived success, emotionally and psychologically turmoiled by the entrance of a younger woman into her life, a role embodied by the up and coming Jo-Ann Ellis (Chloe Grace Moretz).This play becomes the catalyst of its reflective mirrors, it reveals the truth in Maria's current state, her place in the modern world, exposing the difficulties in her ability to reach acceptance, dwelling upon denial as she clings on to her pride and vanity as it slowly decays to fragility, pulsating in quiet tension as we anticipate the delivery of her prognosis. Primarily it travels in the preparatory and enduring phases of Maria's transformation, viewing her trials as she is aided by the contrasting presence of her personal assistance, Valentine, played by the dense but fitting Kristen Stewart. Assayas refuses to assemble his film with a calculated agenda, he willingly ensures indulgence in favouring the natural justifications of his characters, to encapsulate its viewers with a steady and unforeseeable pace, unshakeable in its grasps, compelled by the exchanges of its seemingly banal scenes.Upon every moment, it reveals something critical of its characters, it highlights the spiritual connection between the performers and the roles they embark, cohering Valentine into the studied material, a conflicting perspective to Maria's, highlighting shades and natural forces that was once blinded from or ambiguous in their form, inching us in closer to the souls of these characters. It is in the prideful blindness of Maria and its radiating toxicity towards a once firmly healthy relationship, dissolving the joys and tolerance that was present underneath. Furthermore, my fascination persists as such ideas and emotions are dwelled upon moments of insightful observations in the craftsmanship of their profession, to incorporate the principles and tropes of modern show business, a satire that never deviates from its purpose.Clouds of Sils Maria is aware of its significance in the cast that it has assembled, it shines on them and equally demands of them, providing its viewers with portrayals that deprives itself of extreme theatricality, planting its roots on more identifiable foundations, a reflection these characters are indeed, leaving us in awe in the process. Binoche delivers an assured performance, a role that more or less fits, never reaching a state of self-awareness as for example the casting of Michael Keaton in Birdman; she conveys extensively upon moments of subtlety, refusing to expand on them in simple exposition, a growth that is plausible from its start to end.Kristen Stewart further dampens such elements of theatricality, relying on the more stoic aura that is commonly associated with her performances, but utilised here with efficiency, delivering moments of shared thoughts or clarity that never intrudes on our plausibility, to avoid the tendencies to preach, with our attentions instead locked in the reactive banter in her chemistry with Binoche. Chloe Grace Moretz, despite embodying a role of great relevance to its greater themes, evidently reveals herself in a role micro-size to he point of almost invisibility, simpler in its construction and far less demanding in the actress delivery, Moretz relying on her true stature as art begin to imitate life. Much more could have been fleshed out from such a character, especially one as malevolent.There is much to be desired in the calming nature of Clouds of Sils Maria, it leaves enough gaps for our own thoughts to fill, it exposes its characters that never ceases to fascinate, it is anchored by magnificent performances and resonant themes that becomes further invigorating upon retrospect or subsequent visit. Does it earn the compliment of perfection or pure excellence? Probably not, but it certainly comes close.",

      "review": "  Nostalgia has crept into a lot of films lately. In 2015 alone, we've revisited Bond (for the 24th time) in Spectre, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is now the 5th film spawned from the 60's TV show, Mad Max was rebooted with Fury Road, Jurassic World and Star Wars: A Force Awakens tapped into the magic and excitement of their predecessors and now Ryan Cooglar's Creed is a revisit to the boxing gyms of Philadelphia and has much in common with the original Rocky of 1976. Yes, it's hard to believe but it's been 40 years since Balboa first had us on the edge of our seats and punching the air with delight. Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) has had a troubled youth and always forced to fight his corner in juvenile correction facilities. When he learns that his late father was World Heavyweight Champion, Apollo Creed, Adonis decides he wants to go into boxing himself. With no-on-one to train him, though, Adonis heads to Philadelphia to seek the mentorship of his late father's friend, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone).Let's face it, Creed was always going to be a bit of a gamble. Some people had written it off before it had even arrived but Ryan Cooglar and Michael B. Jordan's follow-up to the brilliant Fruitvale Station is a gamble that pays off. For a start, Jordan is a very talented and charismatic actor who has a magnetic presence while Cooglar manages to put his own stamp on the proceedings, considering he's essentially retreading old ground. A huge helping hand comes from the man himself, though; Stallone reprising his most iconic role is a real treat and it's not just for nostalgia reasons. Sly is genuinely very good here. He's not normally credited with strong performances but when he's going against his tough guy persona - like he did in Cop Land - it just shows how well he can fit that type of role and that's exactly what he does again. It's the first film to feature Rocky that hasn't been written by Stallone himself but Cooglar and co-writer Aaron Covington seamlessly manage to capture Stallone's flavour for the character. Rocky is now older, slower and more vulnerable and Stallone has no problem displaying and embracing this vulnerability. As mentioned, it isn't really anything new. We've seen, done and wore the gloves before but that's even more of a testament to Jordan, Stallone and especially Cooglar for making this work. The fact that he goes back to making it more story and character-based and less about the pugilism adds a much needed freshness to the franchise and the bouts in the ring that we do see are very impressively handled. They're frantically involving as Maryse Alberti's camera dances around the ring as much as the actors and every crunching blow makes you feel more like a participant and less of an observer - It's also an added bonus that the unashamed, flag waving jingoism that was so prominent in the Rocky sequels is toned down somewhat.Albeit from another character, this very much looks like the continuation of the franchise and it's off to a good start. The only problem now is whether they can find the material to keep it from becoming stale. For the moment, though, Creed can certainly handle itself. Mark Walker",

      "review": "  Creed is a crowd-pleaser, an effective character drama, and a rewarding continuation into the Rocky franchise that brings greater relevancy to Sylvester Stallone's acting muscles. Thanks to the talents of co-writer/director Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station) and star Michael B. Jordan, the franchise is given new life by mostly following the same tried-and-true underdog formula that Stallone helped cement long ago. Jordan plays Adonis Creed, the illegitimate son to the deceased boxing legend, and he wants to make his way on his own merits. Adonis tracks Rocky (Stallone) down and convinces him to be his trainer, and the two build a father-son relationship supplying the half the other was sorely missing. From there the plot is fairly predictable as the media discovers Adonis' identity and he's fast-tracked for a high-profile bout with the outgoing champ but the movie still hits the right notes to earn its emotional triumph. I was surprised at the careful attention Coogler gave his supporting characters, providing details to round them out and make them feel like legitimate people rather than stock roles. I enjoyed Tessa Thompson (Dear White People) being an actual character rather than an underdeveloped love interest. Coogler's fluidity with the camera is also striking, and many of the boxing matches are filmed in long tracking shots that amp up the sports verisimilitude. Jordan gives a strongly felt performance that further confirms his star status. The real surprise is Stallone, whose legendary fighter is starting to break down physically. Rocky's inability to fight an invisible enemy makes for great drama, and Stallone sinks into the meaty dialogue. He has a few genuinely affecting moments, and I didn't even know Stallone was still capable of that. Easily the best Rocky sequel, Creed is an uplifting underdog tale that doesn't reinvent the formula but brings added attention, reverence, and sincerity to a whole lot of punching people in the face.Nate's Grade: B+",

As he meets a young girl along the way, you completely buy into their connection and you never once think that it feels forced. This film is essentially about fighting for your name, but at its core it really is a release from the \"Rocky\" films and an introduction into the new generation. Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan share amazing chemistry, bringing me to tears on multiple occasions. \"Creed\" is easily one of the best entries in the franchise, even comparable to the original. With a great script, incredible performances, a story worthy of the title, and direction that puts you in the front row, \"Creed\" is fantastic! If I had one complaint, it would be that it might just share a few too similarities to the first film. By the end of the film I felt I was just accepting the conclusion.

However, Creed really suffers from its execution. And no, I am not going to criticize this movie for sharing similar elements to the original Rocky. That isn't the problem for me.The problem lies in the fact that Creed's script feels filled with unfocused themes, unexplored plot lines, and new characters that aren't all that interesting. The movie seems to know what its main theme is by the end, but it seems so unsure of itself throughout the majority of its runtime that I found myself just not caring that much by the end. And ultimately, the movie didn't focus on the characters enough for me to really care. As a result, Creed left me incredibly disappointed.It's by no means terrible, and there is certainly enjoyment to be had. But a great movie, Creed certainly is not.",

      "review": "  DEAR FIGHT PEOPLE - My Review of CREED (4 Stars)I went into the most recent ROCKY movie, CREED, with the same trepidation I've felt since ROCKY II. Would I be in for another round of cornball inspiration or would this one finally be the version to equal or top the original? It's a roll of the dice I wasn't all that interested in taking, but I'm so glad I did, because CREED is surprisingly wonderful. This, despite the fact that the film ladles on the cheese with extra dollops. Maybe it's the fact that director Ryan Coogler (FRUITVALE STATION) and his co-writer Aaron Covington took over the writing responsibilities from Sylvester Stallone and added incredibly fresh, lived-in direction, but the results make this my favorite ROCKY movie since the first. Michael B. Jordan, who starred in Coogler's prior film, plays Adonis Creed, son to Apollo, Rocky's biggest opponent. An angry child who finds himself in constant trouble, he grows up wanting to be a fighter like the father he never met. Unable to secure a trainer to take him on in LA, Adonis, of course, heads off for Philadelphia to seek the assistance of none other than the Italian Stallion. Retired and happily managing his restaurant, Rocky wants nothing to do with the fight world, but damn if Adonis isn't one persistent man. Dare I say it? He's got the eye of the tiger! So the question remains, will Rocky help Adonis capture the title or say no and just go about his life? Would it be spoiling things to say which way this goes?I'm making this all sound sillier than it really is, because the filmmaker's imbue this story with such grace, capturing the scrappy, blue collar world that got lost in the many sequels. ROCKY BALBOA came close to returning to its roots, but Coogler has such wonderful visual chops, aided greatly by his cinematographer, Maryse Alberti (THE FIGHTER), and additionally gives us a ROCKY movie where we care so much about every character. Jordan clearly dedicated himself physically to this role and his approach to his character allows for Adonis' many flaws to come to the surface. I wish he had brought more humor to the proceedings, but constantly pushing himself to his limits, so there's not a lot of time for jokes. Stallone, however, brings humor and such gravity to his aged fighter, slipping into the Burgess Meredith role here and winning our hearts all over again. The way Stallone can deliver a speech in his patented deep, palooka-like monotone and get to the heart of the line, to the humanity, is astounding here. It's early, but I'm going out on a limb to say Stallone should start practicing his Oscar acceptance speech. For me, this wouldn't be the sentimental favorite award, it would be in honor of a truly great screen performance. Their co-star, Tess Thompson (DEAR WHITE PEOPLE, SELMA) delivers a charming performance as Adonis' downstairs neighbor, a singer who is slowly losing her ability to hear. Refusing to be relegated to \"the girl\" role, her Bianca is as much of a fighter as the two men. Ultimately, this is a story about fighting for your survival and leaning on your chosen family to accomplish that. So yes, it's your standard ROCKY crap, but it's done with such conviction, such visual skill, that there's no choice but to surrender to its many charms. Let's start with that great training montage. Creating an iconic shot of its own without having to resort to the run up the stairs of the Philadelphia Museum of Art (don't worry, they make an appearance), Coogler chases Adonis up a street, escorted by his supporters on various types of motorcycles. Popping wheelies in slo-mo as Adonis runs, I rolled by eyes, until they stop in front of a location to pay their respects. I won't give anything away here except to say Coogler turned cheddar into brie in this wonderful moment. Also astounding is a single take fight sequence that feels impactful, exciting, and puts the audience right in the ring with the boxers. It's a thrilling accomplishment, the camera hitting each character at the precisely right time. Also, Coogler enjoys a good slo-mo, smoke-filled entrance or two, because he has the right panache for this type of spectacle. Sure, the film takes many maudlin, melodramatic turns, some of which brought tears to my eyes, and it's because the actors fully commit. By the time the familiar opening strains of the ROCKY THEME hit, the audience I sat with cheered. CREED hits all of the right nostalgia buttons while updating the saga, passing the torch to very capable hands. In doing so, we've been given one of the year's better films.",

      "review": "  Creed is a masterful film that succeeds in being a perfect revisit into the Rocky franchise and being one of the years best movies. Ryan Coogler flaweless directs this film with a realistic and fresh view into Philadelphia. He hits every emotional chord by cutting to the core of every Rocky fan such as myself, bringing both the old and new characters to life. Michael B. Jordan brings every bit of raw power and charisma to the character of Adonis Creed. His performance only further proves he is one of the best young talents currently in the business and is absolutely leading man material. I found myself loving Adonis and his journey to glory, as he is an underdog who despite his life of fighting and troubles has stayed a good man. Sylvester Stallone gives a spectacular performance in the film as he returns to his iconic Rocky Balboa. Stallone still acts as a mentor and a hero to both Adonis and to the audience, as he once again pulls us into his world. His heartwrenching and emotional performance is Oscar caliber, as he gives us an old man we all know and love and shows him as broken as he has ever been. Stallone and Jordans chemistry and relationship in the film is the films high point, as its a father-son like relationship that will bring a tear to any Rocky fan. There was a particular boxing scene in the film that looks like it was filmed in one shot, and my jaw was dropped throughout. Coogler showed me he is a talented director with Fruitvale Station, but his second film Creed is such a triumphant picture that I believe he could go on to be one of the best directors in the business. I watched this movie and loved every second of it. Creed is a masterpiece in my opinion for what it tries to accomplish, and I will likely go and watch it several more times.",

      "review": "  Rather than put audiences between Rocky and a hard place, winning combo Creed brilliantly plays out as one of the best and freshest chapters in the storied sports franchise. What's most amazing is the continuing development of an older Italian Stallion into a complex evolving mentor figure even after he's given up the titular mantle. Reverential to the past with a dynamite new fight story all on its own, Creed pits a new unlikely underdog and his trainer on the hard knocks road to a title fight. The whipsmart result brings you to your feet almost as much as 1976's Rocky, the classic that put us all in this fight. Oh, predictability rears its punch-drunk head at times and females get underserved, but not nearly enough to throw in the towel. On the contrary, this is a rare film about legacy that beautifully honors and extends its own. In this PG-13-rated sports drama, former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa (Stallone) serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson (Jordan), the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed. If Mad Max Fury Road and Jurassic World proved anything this year, it's - with the right vision and creative minds -it's better to continue a known franchise than start from scratch with an uninspired reboot (Poltergeist). Thankfully, Creed doesn't throw out the Balboa with the bath water. In fact, Ryan Coogler finds fascinating new depths for the simple Philadelphia fighter. More than proving that he wasn't just a one-shot pony after his harrowing feted drama Fruitville Station, the writer-director advances the game of the iconic character while charting the riveting course for his prot�g�. With Rocky Balboa, Stallone conceived a warm epilogue for the series, signing off Balboa's fighting career on a high note, complete with a new status as widower keeping his beloved's memory alive by running a restaurant under her name, Adrian's. Coogler, however, uses this as an awesome jumping off point, offering up the palooka as benevolent elder statesman. With Jordan's Adonis Creed, he gives us a new hero worth rooting for while still cheering for the old hero. You get on your feet for the performances as well, especially Stallone in a career highlight that's surely due an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Bottom line: Gonna Fly and How",

      "review": "  It's easy to forget that the original Rocky was a masterpiece. A couple of terrible sequels will do that to popular perceptions. This also happened with Sylvester Stallone's other signature character Rambo, which had a truly excellent original thriller and weak, silly sequels. But I like to assert that there was great value in the character of Rocky Balboa and there were some later installments that did work. Rocky II and III were fun, above average efforts that handled character development in a way most mainstream franchises these days seem incapable of accomplishing. And sure IV and V were steaming pieces of garbage, but Rocky Balboa (2006) redeemed the character in a realistic and endearing turn. So a spin-off using an entirely new character may seem totally unnecessary. So why is this movie so damn good? Creed (no, not the crappy post-grunge band) centers around the son of Apollo Creed, Adonis, as he tries to hack out his destiny in the arena. Along the way, an older Rocky Balboa takes him on as an apprentice, serving as his Obi-Wan Kenobi like mentor. Both form a bond and learn to keep fighting in the face of tough odds. Creed doesn't break any mold, but it manages to fill it quite well, delivering a hard hitting but sentimental movie that both Rocky fans and general audiences will enjoy. Michael B. Jordan comes into his own as a leading man, proving that Hollywood really needs to start putting more diverse actors in roles such as these. He has the right amount of likeability and charisma that made Rocky such a relatable character in the original film. He commits fully and deserves credit for not using a body double during production, receiving all the punishment himself. Sylvester Stallone reminds us that yes, he can act. Old Sly provides much of the humor and light-hearted-ness of many scenes, while bringing a special type of gravitas to the film. This is a character that has grown immensely over the years, graduated from the school of hard knocks, and has much wisdom to offer to our protagonist. But what makes the picture exceptional is the back and forth between the two. There are funny moments as I mentioned before, but there are also touching and bittersweet scenes as well - on par with any awards season material this year. Creed is well directed and edited with Ryan Coogler accomplishing a masterful job helming his first large film with precision. The fight scenes are brutal and skillfully choreographed. The camera work is impressive, often revolving around the action and seemingly in one take. The final fight scene in particular, bears much in common with the climatic showdown at the end of the original film. In fact, I was quite impressed how reverential Creed was in relation to the rest of the franchise, treating all the previous movies as canon, even the bad ones. Furthermore, while these are used as background, they are not exploited or rehashed as one might expect. The love interest for the main character was completely tacked on and unnecessary and proves to be the sole weakness. So yes, you need to see this film. It is, in my opinion, the best since Rocky III, a good start to a new spin-off franchise, and one of the best dramas of the year. It goes the distance.",

      "review": "  Ryan Coogier's wonderfully rousing new entry in the Rocky legacy. It tells the engrossing story of Adonis \"Hollywood\" Johnson, the illegitimate son of the late great heavyweight boxing champion, Apollo Creed, who died before he was born, Adonis is superbly played by Michael B. Jordan, in a truly sensational performance that is filled with fire and conviction. Adonis is a gifted fighter in his own right and is making his way up the ranks, while trying to face his father's legacy. But Adonis is up against a tremendously dangerous fighter by the name Leo \"The Lion\" Sporino, well-played by Gabe Rosado, for this upcoming match he seeks out his late father's best friend and opponent the legendary former heavyweight boxing champion Rocky Baloba as a mentor and trainer, played magnificently again by the scene-stealing Sylvester Stallone returning to his iconic signature role, his impressive surprisingly subtle performance has already won him the National Board of Review Critic's Award for Best Supporting Actor. What follows is a brilliant well-crafted motion picture of style and substance that exhilarates and has the audience rooting for the underdog, thanks to Coogier's masterful direction. The edge of your seat boxing sequences are fiercely intense and visceral. Solid entertainment from beginning to end, and an exceptional crowd pleaser. Highly Recommended.",

      "review": "  Too often Hollywood falls into a rut when it involves some of its most famous franchises (Terminator comes to mind first) by keeping its aging star at the forefront of future movies it produces. In a complete about face, Creed levels that trend with an emotional, yet believable rise of a new young boxer played by the true star of the movie, Michael B Jordan.Rocky Balboa was truthfully a movie that didn't make any sense yet still allowed the character to have his day in the spotlight once again. Move over Sylvester Stallone. Passing off the \"Rocky\" franchise to Apollo Creed's illegitimate son Adonis was a near flawless way to continue making these movies. That being said, I don't necessarily think they need ANOTHER one, but you should definitely expect it this day and age with all the remakes and reboots and sequels we see.Let's start with Sly. He delivered his best performance at this age in this movie. Hands down. While nothing about it screams Oscar-worthy, it's the most relaxed and at home in the 'Rocky' role he's been in since he started making them. This is the tale of coming full circle you want to see from someone as beloved across the movie community as Rocky is. For a guy who lost just about everything near and dear to him, it was incredibly easy to empathize with the character throughout the movie when some major decisions force his hand late in the film.Jordan was fit, fast and loose as Adonis. We get a bit of a rushed look into his upbringing that gives you the basics on why he wants to be a fighter, but even with the fast tutorial on his younger years, that's easy to overlook as a small nuisance by kicking things off fast and heavy after the time jump to his 20s where the bulk of the film takes place. Jordan and director Ryan Coogler did Fruitvale Station together. Their chemistry is easily seen.The love interest, played by Tessa Thompson, came off as organic and believable. There's a subtle contrast between her approach to music and Jordan's approach to boxing. While it's no \"Adriaaaaan\" kind of relationship, it does the job.My only other knock on the film was the opposing fighters. The first big fight was well done. In fact, probably done better than the final fight. Though it was shorter, it had more pop. That's not to say the second (and main) fight was bad...it lacked that same ferocity in the buildup. And that has everything to do with the guy he was fighting who looked NOTHING like a boxer. There was a great knockout in that final fight that knocks you back in your seat, but aside from that, getting someone who looked the part (and a little more imposing) would have helped.Creed is a standout sports film that does everything you want from an up-and-comer. The film rises with its star character and is anchored by its veteran. If they made another, would I be surprised? No. Am I looking for it in a year or two or three? No. Would I take it? If it was anything like this...absolutely.",

What follows is a great story highlighted by an excellent revival of Sylvester Stallone's acting and fictional boxing (this time as the mentor) career.

      "review": "  After watched Rocky 4, 5 and 6 I felt the franchise was falling flat and it appeared to be pretty much down and out to me. Yes, Rocky 6 has got decent reviews but personally I think it's overrated. Creed brings a new director (Ryan Coogler) and new writers (Coogler and Aaron Lovington with input from Stallone) and with it comes a fresh pair of eyes.We see Michael B. Jordan introduced into the franchise as Adonis Johnson who leaves his day job to box full time. He goes under the name Johnson to stay under the radar and more importantly out of his great Dad's shadow but he soon learn that he needs to embrace the Creed name rather than ignore it. This film also sees Rocky (Stallone) play the trainer role similarly to Rocky V but with much better results. Stallone is on top form and I feel the Golden Globe was well deserved.This film is absolute electric, it has a great tension and determination. You feel like you are part of every step of the journey and it is truly captivating. The character's have great chemistry and above all the story feels real, it feels credible. Which is more than what can be said of Rocky 4 and 6 in my opinion. Also this brings the Rocky franchise to a whole new audience who may not have seen the original films so this can only be a good thing to bring awareness to the original films which were so great and started the ball rolling.The Rocky franchise, back with a knock-out blow!",

A surprisingly good effort and hopefully more to come from this director. Even Stallone does a great job and I doubt I've ever said that before. In fact he may well be the star performer here alongside Tessa Thompson who brings some real sass with her role.",

      "review": "  The night had finally come - it was a really long hard day: waking up 4.30 AM, flying out to a business meeting, knowing that I had a hard fight ahead of me that night - the highly praised return of the Rocky franchise: Creed. I will right get into spoilers - so please stop reading if you still planning to watch it.After coming out of the theater, I had a content grin on my face - I think it is fair to say: I was happy. Because this film really ends up making you feel good - Baby Creed ends up not being a failure and Rocky has found a new meaning in life and has a new member in the family. All good, right ? Well, yes sort of - I will confess I am probably one of the biggest Rocky fans there is on the planet; I have watched Rocky IV about 253 times, I have used the Rocky IV montages for many many workouts (and I still have Hearts on Fire and No Easy Way Out on my workout playlist) - and every now and then I watch either one of the final fight scenes on Youtube (in case you want to do the same, here is a little compilation):Admittedly, my love for the Rocky saga has no logical reasoning, the movies end up becoming sort of dumb and the fight scenes are everything but realistic but who cares: THEY ARE AWESOME!Now, why am rambling on about Rocky so much - probably I wanted this movie to take me back to the good old times. I wanted to shed a man tear like every time when Rocky says:Yo, Adrian I did it!To a certain extent, the movie does a great job in all the right places. It builds up an interesting new story line about Apollo Creed's son - who doesn't have this super cliche story - but actually is street kid from a foster home who has turned into a rich boy who can't help but shed his inner fighter. Despite all good advice he wants to give boxing a shot and who else the man himself could teach him what it takes - and also here the movie just does a wonderful of job of introducing Rocky into Adonis' life. And Stallone has aged his character beautifully; he has created his routine in which both Paulie and Adriane are still part of his life and it is just really endearing to watch. Rocky is still a simple man and everyone just absolutely loves him. Their chemistry works really well - and the film hits the drama tones as well as the more comedic tones really well.Adonis: It's already up in the CloudRocky: Which CloudAlso the love interest of Adonis is in fact a pretty interesting and solid character - and their relationship is refreshingly unclichee - so well bravo on that too. So in nutshell, this movie did in fact do all the things a good movie needs to do:Introduce new and interesting into the existing Rocky universeDon't take itself too seriousStay true to its rootsNow, let's get to what makes a great Rocky movie; let's be honest here - we all live and die for Rocky when he is either running up the stairs or mountains and/or when we are in the 3rd or 15th round and it is all about the final punch. So this factor needs to be heavily accounted for when judging a Rocky movie. Also here Creed actually delivers some really decent Training montages with Adonis journey to becoming the next Creed - the film heavily borrows from its predecessors but that's ok because ultimately it doesn't really copy but pays tribute to the originals. And when it comes to the fight scenes it actually surpasses the originals by a landslide - camera work, pacing, drama are all perfectly balanced. So also here all checks in the boxes are basically fulfilled:Training montage - CHECKDrama in the ring - CHECKGreat fight choreography - CHECKStill, when I walked out of the theatre despite absolutely loving the Rocky franchise, I did not carry the Rocky enthusiasm with me - which basically means I didn't run up the stairs, didn't sign up for a new gym membership BUT I did a shed a little mantear in Adonis' final words. The reason for my \"lack\" of excitement was probably that I love the Rocky franchise so much, that it is up on a pedestal of my childhood memories and I won't allow anything to even remotely touch it - and that's ok. Still, this was a great reboot of the Rocky franchise and Michael B.Jordan is a champion who really deserves his shot at the title of becoming the Rocky of this generation.",

Rocky scouting on an ipad to really drive home the point that he's with the times. Also, rap with nigga in it.

So then, I started wondering where the the \"Liverpool scenes were filmed. I asked myself, is it possible the producers were too cheap to fly to Liverpool? Well, it turns out, they were too cheap to film anything in England. I surmised, from the ending credits that the \"Liverpool\" scenes were done in Georgia. This production gaffe, really let me down.

      "review": "  As we reach towards the end of the year 2015, the year's entertainment, film- and television-wise, has some portals that goes back to the respective original's glory while the portal's path is like a nostalgic vibe to feel the original's atmospheric prime. The anticipation for \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" goes back to the original in 1977, and \"Jurassic World\" goes back to \"Jurassic Park\". Those are just to tell a few as they'd gained the cultural following over the years, including newer generations to experience what their parents and grandparents felt (i.e. including \"The Peanuts Movie\"). Now, spawned from the 1976 Academy Award for Best Picture winner \"Rocky\", \"Creed\" comes for the exact scenario when it comes to build up a past legacy whilst going ultimately back to the first punch.The \"Rocky\" franchise examined the life of an everyman going the distance and facing obstacles as he fights for, and lives, the title of professional boxing, at wide recognition, with the challenges of the ups and downs in life. Apollo Creed gave Rocky Balboa an invite to rise to the distance next to him in a match, and Rocky went slacking off with the fame and fortune he'd been receiving after being recognized from his match with a Heavyweight Champion. The do-over button was pressed by Apollo asking for a rematch, and Rocky gain his title, as well the title of being a father. His celebrity status continues on even when losing his title but later regain it when he fought for his fallen trainer Mickey. Rocky then later went for the ultimate to give up his title just to avenge his friend's death for not ending the fight with the Soviet fighter Drago by fighting him in a Cold War match. Him going that much of the distance and gaining that victory weakened him at his head, and came back to his roots after a total financial mishap that costed his fortune. Retired and started to train, but being a trainer was affecting his relationship with his son. Retired from fighting and training, Rocky spent the rest of his time by owning a restaurant under his late wife's name, Adrian. He briefly went back for an exhibition match to prove one last time that he still got it despite his advanced age. Afterwards, he settles on from there with a relaxing life of an everyman still.The point of reviewing back Rocky's story is that the latest installment, being a sequel to the homage film in 2006, went for the sensitive touch to what Rocky had been through and what he has left to do under his legacy by taking on one last fight for himself while training a family friend with what he'd learned from going the distance and building up your own legacy. But this time, Rocky sits back to be the supportive character. This time, as it says on the title, his late friend Apollo's blood carries on in a fresh fighter who seems to have the same vision of life as Rocky's whilst not wanting to waste the blood of a Creed.\"Creed\" goes on to the other side of the coin between the best of rivals-turned-friends that'd built up Rocky's legacy. Spawned from a revealed affair, Adonis \"Donnie\" Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) has fighting in his blood from the father he'd never met since he was born after he died. Donnie wants to pursue his dream of professional boxing, but his adoptive, widowed mother Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rahad) is against it after what happened to her husband 30 years earlier. Now going nowhere in Los Angeles, Donnie moves to Philadelphia to kick start his dream with the help of his father's old rival-turned-friend, Rocky Balboa. With Donnie's strength and determination to go the distance that Rocky understands and sees it as the same as his old friend, he decided to train him.The \"Fruitvale Station\" director Ryan Coogler takes the \"Rocky\" franchise back to the original's glory with the modern art and spirit of cinema - particularly the cinematography - in comparison to the 1976 Best Picture winner (if I'd known that specific thought, I would've watched \"Rocky\" before \"Creed\") within the same taste of inspiring emotions of a sports drama with a little extra weight. \"Creed\" met the uplifting structure used in \"Rocky\" with the helpful elements and developments but in its own way that seems to make this the best of the series. Contributing to both glories of the current bookends is the excellent, probably definitive soundtrack heightened the former's power with certain familiar cues sporadically. Adjacent to that aspect, the film did well to the emotions it'd played out from the performances lifting the weights, especially pitting Rocky to be reached with sensitive talks.Further on the parallel-ness between the two is the level of the performances and the respective characters' relationship of the trainee and his trainer. Clarifying that thought, Sylvester Stallone's character is in a similar role as his late co-star's character Burgess Meredith as Rocky's late trainer, with similar developments, and techniques, spanning the first three films. Stallone's performance is his probable best, and agreeable on being the contender for Best Supporting Actor. Now for Michael B. Jordan, who was given the rise to stardom from \"Fruitvale\", felt his character's own independence yet performed the same as Stallone did as his character: taking the punches if possible and letting the makeup department mark the violent marks of the match (if that how it was done). Just like most dramas with high and strong energy, the main star give it all and Jordan did that. Although, not enough to meet the nominating standards like his co-star since the competition of other actors filled up the void (same goes for the film itself of its respective category if didn't go to the distance enough to be nominated), his performance is his probable best as well when next to the strength of his breakthrough.\"Creed\" is definitely in my top ten with its power and value coming from Ryan Coogler's masterful, yet faithful (considering going back to the glory days and roots) direction and the cast's performances to make a strong entertaining film in the prime fashion of the original (hopefully it doesn't include going for more rounds to lessen the remaining amount of the strength, even though the character's arc and the dynamics are appealing and would be pleasant at the sight if not going for the exact storyline structure). You'd find this sports drama generally enjoyable by its qualities when treating it as a regular film than its connection with the previous installments, but excitement of pleasant sighting would be an added weight if you've seen the other films and understand more of the emotions. \"Creed\" is a must-see of an average greatness at its ranging standards.

It has a similar feel to it that his other films have, but this is a great directorial debut for him. It is suspenseful and intriguing all the way through to the end and even though it is science fiction, it is grounded in realism that makes it even scarier to watch. The tech noir soundtrack fits perfectly as well. The performances are solid with the best being Alicia Vikander as the A.I. Ava. Ex Machina evokes themes that are chilling and thought-provoking without being too wordy. If you like your science fiction to be more about ideas than action, Ex Machina is highly recommended.",

      "review": "  It's been far too long since I've seen a movie with such economic exposition! Within the first five minutes, Caleb wins a contest, helicopters out to a remote paradise, meets genius-inventor-gone-rogue Nathan, and becomes the human component in an AI Turing Test, and we're off on a twisted android/creator/savior hate-triangle that challenges our notions of God, patriarchy, and humanity.I loved Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander's simmering chemistry in \"Anna Karenina,\" and they are even more quietly explosive here as an ordinary computer programmer who falls under the spell of the dangerously alluring robot, Ava. Ava uses her sexuality, but she is not the typical femme fatale with only the one trick. Nathan and Caleb debate her sexual anatomy versus her sexual agency, and her fierce fight for autonomy from her God/father makes for a white-knuckle creation allegory tinged with sexual politics. Vikander is grace personified, Gleeson does a good American accent, and excellent-in-everything Oscar Isaac plays the mad scientist with fast and loose insouciance.I do wish, however, that the script better defined the criteria for humanity. Not being well-versed in bio-robotics, I still think of androids as robots, but the movie's thesis hinges upon the supposition that they're not - that a robot programmed to have that high a level of human consciousness is essentially human. As such, I didn't quite understand why Caleb calls Nathan a monster for so blithely dismantling his beta versions. Also, the big reveal is played out for the audience's benefit with unrealistic suspense that is incongruous to what Caleb already knows.",

      "review": "  Garland takes what some would call a redundant sci fi premise (AI gone bad!) and makes a very harrowing, engaging commentary on what it means to be human through a Frakenstein-esque thriller. Between the visual direction, phenomenal acting, astute dialogue and overall design there's a level of undeniable finesse to Ex Machina that lends a huge hand in getting poignant ideas across. The toxicity of loneliness in Ava, (or arguably, the whole cast.) creating and understanding life deteriorating Nathan's empathy for it, innocence is not a virtue in Caleb... and so forth.The beauty is that it manages to have so much to say through the delivery of an intelligent mystery. The suspense rarely leaves your mind between the character studies and interactions of an isolated enigmatic genius, the tragically optimistic average joe and the curiously deceptive android. A perfect balance of commentary and plot.Ex Machina is an incredibly rewarding film to viewers who can appreciate the science, complex characters and the revealing darker aspects of humanity. To those who can't it's an equally intelligent multi-layered thriller.One question though, why didn't Nathan simply install an emergency remote off switch on Ava? Seems like the first thing one would do...",

      "review": "  You could very well call this the UK equivalent of the grandiose Spielberg movie 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence'. The difference being this is a highly realistic and grounded science fiction story that isn't really a million miles from where we are today. What was surprising for me was the fact that its a British film, the cast were all unknown to me (often a winning move) and its Alex Garland's directorial debut! One thing is for sure, you'd never guess this was the directors first film, this looks like a Stanley Kubrick feature!Its a simple premise, a company employee (Caleb) wins the chance to go and stay with his mega rich CEO at his private secret home/research lab facility, in the mountains. This CEO (Nathan) is a genius who has been working on creating A.I. and he wants Caleb to help him test his creation. The outcome Nathan is after? to see if Caleb will determine whether his robotic creation is actually more human than machine, if the robot (Ava) is actually developing its own A.I. and learning. Of course as with robots and A.I. things don't go completely to plan, tensions rise and very human emotions like suspicion, mistrust and betrayal begin to surface.I have read that the budget was kept deliberately small for creative purposes, well you wouldn't believe that at all because this movie looks slick as f*ck! If you want a clean, sterilised, highly stylised, glossy, shiny, highly futuristic looking sci-fi movie, but for all the right reasons, then look no further. The film was shot in and around Valldalen in Norway which is basically a vast snowcapped mountainous valley not unlike what we saw in the Jackson/Tolkien movies. This location alone is stunning even without the science fiction story, but what was even more impressive was the Juvet Landscape Hotel in the valley where some scenes were shot. This real hotel is in the middle of nowhere and consists of small oddly shaped wooden huts with windows on one side that basically replace a wall, ceiling to floor windows. This hotel was used for Nathan's home/research facility and you'd never guess it was a real place, it comes across as so fanciful, so out of this world you'd swear it was a specially built set for the film.All the interior sets (or what I think were sets) were so minimalistic, so bare with bold stark lines and in various tones of stony grey, but at the same time very eerie, especially with those power cuts. The cavernous research facility with its long lonely corridors only highlighted by the odd neon blue door sensor, really give a strong ominous presence to the whole film, you never really know what might occur at any minute. It all looks so expensive too, so precise, so perfectly created by expert designers, each room or lab looks like no expense was sparred in its construction. It makes it very hard to believe the budget was apparently small, you can see the similarities with '2001' in set the bold design, I think.Not only that but the visual effects for Ava are superb also, clearly they have CGI'd parts of Vikander's body away and replaced them with those excellent transparent sections. But you'd never guess it, the whole design and execution of this robot is so deliciously flawless to look at, admittedly its nothing outrageously original because its very hard to achieve that these days (what could you do that hasn't been done before?). In the end Ava looks like a blend of Robocop and a retro piece of 80's kit (remember back in the day things used to be transparent like some videogame joysticks), it does actually make it hard to believe this one guy (Nathan) could do all this himself, his home, the labs, the robots etc...Sure he's a genius and rich but blimey! he must have some serious money and brain power to do all this on his own (is it easy getting supplies to this hidden fortress of solitude?).So we've established the visuals are top banana, what about the characters and the plot? Well that's where the film is let down I think because the characters are pretty unlikable if you ask me. Sure Nathan is suppose to be this creepy isolated rich loner but he is fundamentally unlikable from the start, the guy just didn't sit well with me, you know something is off. I also really didn't think we needed to have his character doing all the weights though, that felt like a modern trend or obsession crowbarred in, possibly because the actor like doing weights? I understand the character is living in the wilderness and he wants to keep fit but how about going for a run, Jesus does every male in movies have to be buffed up these days.As for Caleb (hate that name), he is also a creepy 'Children of the Corn' type looking dude too. Despite the fact he's suppose to be the character we relate too he's annoyingly wet and...annoying. What was unusual though is this guy is suppose to be an A.I. expert and pretty clever in the old IQ department, yet he ends up falling for Ava'a tricks. She manipulates him very easily merely using sexuality basically because she has a female shape, its like this guy completely forgets she's a machine despite her appearance. This also leads me to one part of the plot evolution I didn't like, the fact Nathan makes his creations pleasurebots, sexbots, robots with sexual bits (robotic sex dolls). Why the hell would anyone do this?! seriously! surely its plainly obvious no good will come of it, it will bring up moral/ethical issues which really never need be brought up in the first place. Also Caleb accuses Nathan of emotionally abusing his creations yet...they are his robots, and they are evidently still in development so I think 'abuse' is way off the mark . The Caleb character in my opinion doesn't make sense, he's this intelligent guy and really up on A.I. yet he completely folds and fails his own test in not getting suckered by a machine.As with anything there were a few nitpicks that hit me, some glaring, some small. When Ava takes another robots fake skin towards the end its amazingly convenient that it fits over her body perfectly, no overlapping or sticky-out bits anywhere. I must also ask how that fake skin stays on, it doesn't look like velcro. Then at the very end Ava leaves Caleb as she does, but why? surely she would need him to fully assimilate into human society, they are friends, they know each other, it would benefit her immensely. That leads me to my final question, why on earth did the chopper pick Ava up at the end?? Yeah sure she looks like a real human at that point but I would of thought the pilot would know to pick up Caleb, seeing as he went out there a week prior. Surely it would say on his paperwork, pick up one male, the same male who went out to this location earlier this week. Nowhere would it say to pick up some random female stranger instead of that male who went out there a week earlier (Caleb). You'd think questions would be raised straight away by the pilot, calling his control to ask who the hell this female is.This isn't 'I Robot', there are no big set pieces, no car chases, no battles with invincible robots, the movie is a slow burner divided into mini chapters of sorts. Most of run time is simply dialog between characters in various glossy locations, a psychological battle of wits between Caleb and Nathan with Ava playing them off each other to a degree. What's more the movie doesn't hide away from complex scientific theories, processes and jargon, at times the characters babble away about stuff that may well fly over your head...but it sounds good. The fact that everything you see in the movie looks completely realistic and functional only enhances its effect tenfold. If it wasn't for the unlikable characters (personal opinion) and a few quibbles, this is a nigh on perfect sci-fi thriller, well not really a thriller, more of a lesson in quality filmmaking on a small budget with first rate science fiction. Isaac Asimov would be proud.",

There were even times when I had no idea where the film was going, but I wasn't lost, just along for the ride. Director Alex Garland's shots are all remarkable, subtly showing the power dynamics between these characters, and the production design department is top-notch with a set that almost becomes another character.The performances are all excellent, but the highest marks go to Oscar Isaac who infuses a subtle but ever-present menace in the enigmatic genius, Nathan.Overall, this is the best film of the summer so far.",

      "review": "  Alex Garland is a screenwriting staple in Hollywood. He's a science fiction specialist, adapting everything from Kazuo Ishiguro's wrenching Never Let Me Go to the Halo movie. He's worked with Danny Boyle, adapting his novel The Beach, and then on 28 Days Later and Sunshine. If you've noticed a theme with the titles, Garland tends to subscribe to a pessimistic view of human nature. And yet each film is grounded by the humanity of its characters no matter the extreme circumstances. Garland's gift is making the fantastic grounded on a recognizable human level. Ex Machina is his latest and his directorial debut but you'd never have guessed it with how controlled and polished the film comes across. It's a cerebral sci-fi film that haunts, enchants, and consistently engaged the imagination.Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a corporate contest to spend a week's vacation in the home of a reclusive Google-esque tech billionaire, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Caleb is here to test out Nathan's newest invention - artificial intelligence. He's built an android woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) and he wants Caleb to interview her.Ex Machina throws you right into the hook within minutes, and it was mere minutes for me to get hooked. Garland does a glorious job of teasing an audience with his story and unlocking further mysteries that develop intrigue. At the start, knowing the Turing test, we're just as interested in Ava as Caleb is, trying to figure her out and how lifelike she may be. But then the conversations start to linger and, during a brief power outage that cuts the feed to the omnipresent cameras, Ava warns Caleb that his host is not whom he thinks. As soon as the power is back and running, it's as if the comment never happened. The pristine underground quarters have an eerie tranquility to them, almost as if Apple is designing high-end prisons. Garland's movie becomes consumed in paranoia. Is Ava being honest? Is Nathan being honest or underhanded? What's in some of those \"off limits\" rooms? What is the true test at hand? Who is the silent Asian assistant? At one point, Caleb slices open his own arm to search for circuitry, and you completely understand his reasoning. This mounting sense of paranoia and dread, tagged with Garland's mysterious and well-developed storyline, are enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen and rapidly second-guessing and triple-guessing your shifting loyalties. Garland also smartly doesn't dance around the obvious plot device of having a beautiful robotic woman, namely the inevitability of romance to bloom. What is it about android women that science fiction seems to love so much? From Blade Runner to Fritz Lang's Metropolis, the genre loves the concept of robotic women. Perhaps this is merely a byproduct of a genre written by a majority of men, or perhaps it taps into something more unconscious about the desire to control women, or a fear of women, but that's a conversation for another day. Ava is certainly a stunning creature, thanks to Vikander, but also from the sleek production design that makes her feel like the world's most gorgeous Mr. Potato Head with her lycra-like skin for easy detachment. Her exposed stomach of bolts and bulbs is also a constant reminder of her \"other-ness.\" There's an obviously sexual dynamic to the character, and while she's technically nude for most of the film, watching her slip out of stockings and a dress has a strange erotic quality. Thankfully, the percolating would-be romance between man and machine actually plays a vital part throughout the script and especially with the end. There's even a darkly comic yet disconcerting reveal about why Ava looks as she does. Is Ava capable of feelings? Is she falling for Caleb, or does she merely view him as a means to an end? It's essentially a sci-fi play with limited locations and three primary actors. The power is on Garland's effortlessly engaging script, which is far more cerebral and philosophical and nuanced than you might expect from its premise. This is a film that allows its characters to breathe, to organically develop relationships and doubts. The concept of A.I. has been explored in many sci-fi stories before but Garland finds fresh resonance by paring down his story to a manageable trio. Nathan's reclusive home is like a twenty-first century version of the haunted house and full of fun detours begging to be explored. Garland's cinematography and production design are reminiscent of the cool artifice of David Fincher's films. The world feels like a small step into the future but constantly unsettling. Garland's story always has another mystery to unlock, always driving the story further as Caleb's weeklong stay is coming to a close. Garland has a natural eye for images and composes several startling sequences that can equally evoke beauty as well as disquiet. There's a moment where Ava passes a wall of faces as if they were simply a row of hats. Simple moments like Ava \"dressing up\" are given a gentle poignancy that isn't overplayed for effect. Garland's film is what I wanted 2014's Under the Skin to be. Both of them are unsettling, moody, and atmospheric with striking Kubrickian imagery, but Garland's film is less purposely oblique. The trio of actors provides strong work, especially Swedish actress Vikander (Seventh Son, A Royal Affair). As the film is told from Caleb's prospective, she has to find a very exact balance with her performance with elements of innocence, uncertainty, and ethereal curiosity. She's rather placid but you always feel like there's more just under the surface, whether it's the ache of sentient realization or something more sinister. She's a test subject, a captive, and a possible romantic interest. Vikander hits every right note to remain mystifying and beguiling. Gleeson (Unbroken) is becoming a go-to young actor for Hollywood. His awkwardness and enthusiasm to be part of history is an easy channel for the audience, but as Garland's script spins along, Gleeson's enthusiasm ebbs to concern, for Ava and then himself. The source of Ex Machina's surprising font of humor is Isaac (A Most Violent Year) as a too cavalier tech genius. He's so nonchalant and chummy, usually soused, that you start distrusting his amiable nature. It's a shame then that the film couldn't quite hold onto these ambiguities to the end. Garland has had third act missteps in many of his films, some tone-altering and simply losing momentum like 28 Days Later, and some as disastrous as Sunshine's blurry slasher killer, which ruins a perfectly good-to-great sci-fi thriller. Ex Machina too exhibits its own share of third act issues, namely a confluence of contrivances with the characters. There are certain revelations you should already be suspecting giving the nature of the film, and if you've watched other movies before. Those reveals work in relation to Garland's plot; however, the climax feels a bit too forced and obvious for a movie that has been, up to that point, expertly keeping the audience on its toes. Nathan spilling the beans on all the different levels of the experiment comes across not as an outlet of his character's blas� narcissism and more a need for the script to force a confrontation. The different levels of intrigue fade away to what is a rather conventional climax that feels poorly developed and woefully inadequate for the story being told. I will credit Garland with the courage of his resolution, though, which provides deliberate decisions that cast the rest of the film in another dimension. It also feels completely right, while still allowing for Garland to work his Kubrick fetish fully to its eerie erotic ends. Ex Machina is a hard movie to pin down because it balances various genres with delicacy, providing a little something for every sci-fi fan. It's a well-developed mystery that constantly unravels new layers that only hooked me further, but then I was hooked from the immediacy. The relationship between the main three characters is enough to hold an entire film thanks to Garland's scripting. I started doubting my own senses and that i a testament to Garland's artistic vision. It's a nice antidote to the louder bombast of Hollywood, especially with science fiction films that confuse shrill and busy with appealing and satisfying. Here is a film that doesn't forget to entertain but respects an audience enough to take its time to properly develop its mysteries, tension, and characters. Ex Machina is a stellar debut for Garland as a director and I wouldn't be surprised if he starts shifting more of his attention to getting back into the director's chair. It's not a perfect film, as it too suffers from Garland's streak of third act troubles, but it's a remarkably assured, sleek, and absorbing movie that gets under your skin. Nate's Grade: B+",

      "review": "  It's safe to say that because the sci-fi genre calls upon grandiose CGI spectacles and imagination, the genre is saturated with many blockbusters, albeit excellent blockbusters. \"Ex Machina\" comes into the fray with a very different vision that takes everything from a tired genre and humanizes it with very real questions. It's such a refreshing take that it's hard to see the genre the way Hollywood has in the past.But don't get me wrong -- there's always room for sci-fi blockbusters. Everything from \"Terminator 2\" to \"District 9\", this genre alone has contributed to years and years of entertainment for Hollywood. However, \"Ex Machina\" doesn't seek to wow viewers with life-sized robotics and spectacles -- it challenges viewers, leaves them breathless, sitting at the edge of their seat questioning the characters' motives, analyzing what may happen next. The attention is in the ideals that it presents; the CGI and visionary elements of the sci-fi genre are just a mere backdrop for its compelling narrative. As much as sci-fi flicks has thrown millions of dollars into outstanding CGI set-pieces, \"Ex Machina\" is a well-rounded machine altogether (Sorry, that pun was too easy) -- breathtaking cinematography, a fascinating script, a pulse-pounding score that hits hard), and excellent performances to boot.However, \"Ex Machina\" is not a light film nor is it for the average joe. Though it is intriguing throughout, the pacing does tend to seem slower than the average blockbuster film, but I personally did not have any issues with it. The main faltering factor with \"Ex Machina\" is that though it is primarily a very thought-provoking movie with very human elements sprinkled evenly across the narrative, too many ideas are thrown in, many left unquestioned -- not unquestioned like an open-ended film, but just as a mere question to jolt the mind. I would understand if there were hints of its answers as symbolism or small nuances as its vehicles, but there were none to be found (or perhaps I was too unaware to spot them). That doesn't say that all ideas are left unanswered, it's just that the film unravels an entire box full of ideas on the drawing board and chooses only a few as its focal point.\"Ex Machina\" is an extremely ambitious and stylish thriller that challenges viewers with very real questions. It's broodingly dark, probably one of the most darkest sci-fi films I have seen to date, but an outstanding one that'll leave many breathless.",

Creating deeper and more emotional characters than any film I have seen in the past couple of years, \"Ex Machina\" is not only a great story of the evolution of technology and what are world really has under it's skin, but of reality in general. There is a fascinating line in the film that states, \"We are destined to be overcome by the A.I.'s that will eventually surpass the brain capacity of a human, just like we surpassed apes. Evolution has it's path.\" I know that quote is way off, but it was something along those lines, and it was such a fantastic take on our lives that I was blown away by how well it fit into this story.

Not in the sense that it is an intense thriller, but the eerie slow burning of the storytelling is what makes this film shine.

I find myself mulling it over even now, weeks after watching. There is so much going on in this film. In a way it is a Frankenstein tale. Though, unlike the classic, this monster is beautiful and perfectly able to assimilate into the world of humans. Is it in our nature to create ourselves? In doing so, will we bring an end to our race? Note: Isaac Oscar's dance scene is something to behold.",

      "review": "  \"Ex Machina\" is a surprisingly deep science fiction film. The Oscar-nominated special effects are stunning and give the story a truthful, believable sensation. There is never a point where you question whether Ava could actually exist. There is also never a point where you question whether the Ava that we see is actually a real robot. Her appearance is futuristic but modern, and her design is visually fascinating. Alicia Vikander is perfectly cast in this role. Most importantly, she has a youthful look that portrays innocence. This allows us to see the humanity of the robot and keeps us wondering if she can actually have romantic feelings. Her possible humanity is the key to this story and an intimidating, Schwarzenegger-esque AI certainly would not fit into this story. Vikander's mastery of subtle movement convincingly paints her as a robot programmed to move like a human and her strong emotional performance further emphasizes her potential humanity. If her performance in \"The Danish Girl\" wasn't nominated for an Oscar, she likely would have been nominated for this role. Her acting is contrasted by the bold acting of Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac. It was strange to see this pair together after seeing them in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" especially because they are playing very different characters. I loved Gleeson's chemistry with Rachael McAdams in \"About Time\" and I feel the same about his chemistry with Vikander in this film. Who cares if it would be a human-robot relationship - we just want to see them get together! And Oscar Isaac makes a great instigator/bad guy, even though I prefer his nicer roles like in \"Inside Llewyn Davis.\" The most impressive part of this film is its Oscar-nominated screenplay. The film trades in the stereotypes of science fiction for believable concepts that are easily understood by any layman. The story is addictive and will have you constantly hypothesizing potential plot twists as the story unfolds. Even though you'll think up several twists that would be great in a non-realistic sci-fi film, this realistic story has a thought-provoking conclusion that will keep you discussing it for days. There's a lot of nudity in this film but it doesn't seem like it because they are robots. Actually, it does seem like a lot of nudity and you should be prepared for that before seeing this movie. It's unfortunate because this could be a great film for teens if not for some unnecessary f-words and extended shots of full-frontal nudity. It fits the story but definitely goes beyond what is necessary. \"Ex Machina\" is fresh, exhilarating, and entirely unique. I would have preferred it without most of the objectionable content but I can't help but be amazed by its visual effects and riveting story.",

This is an interesting perspective for a documentary concerning the subject of religion, especially one that is so prevalent in Hollywood. The filmmakers do an excellent job collecting many different stories and viewpoints from those they speak to, and the result is a horrifying exercise of religious exploitation of power. The manipulation and abuse that infects this religion is very concerning, and it will be especially fascinating to watch the public's response to this movie once more people get the opportunity to watch it.",

There were plenty of other aspects of the church I'd like to know about, specifically the whole process of brainwashing. The documentary ended and I was still baffled at how many people go along with this shit. I couldn't believe it and needed to know more. By focusing a bit too much on the ex member, Going Clear suffers a bit by not going in depth on the research aspect of a documentary. Hopefully, this isn't the last we hear from this crew and we might have something that complements it in the future.Thanks to a beautiful presentation, a great structure, relentless pacing and shocking revelations, Going Clear is essential viewing for us to learn how something so preposterous became so unbelievably powerful.",

But, it did feel like a lost opportunity. Despite the one-sidedness of it all! This is probably one of the most shocking and eye-opening documentaries to be released this decade, if not ever. To have gotten to the level that Scientology has risen to and for them to be allowed to conduct their business in this manner. With very little intervention from our government! It was unsettling to realize just how much influence and power they have. While the film is not perfect! It stands as a very damning piece of evidence against Scientology and from a journalistic standpoint. It is an incredible expose on this controversial group and hopefully will shed light on their business practices. Help those who work within the church in some way and force those who hold higher-power within the organization to answer for any crimes they may have committed.",

      "review": "  Going Clear doesn't do anything new or special for the art of documentary film, but it does provide a fascinating peak behind the closed doors of the cult of Scientology. Though much of the doc's information on the subject is easily researchable (the film itself is based on a book), there's plenty of shocking, and downright chilling revelations within the accounts of the cult's former members participating here. Since most of these people are former high-ranking officials, members of internal security, and/or notable Hollywood figures, one can hardly be surprised by the wealth of inside information and controversy that they dredge up throughout the film. The documentary doesn't, however, resort to over-sensationalism or gossip-mongering to get its point across. It's simply being up front with the audience and recounting real, personal stories that detail abuse and corruption at the hands of the so-called church. This documentary is all about getting the truth out there. Indeed, notable celebrities such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta aren't demonized. Their public and private struggles serve only as cautionary examples of the power and influence of the organization and its leaders. If anything, audiences will sympathize with Scientology members and their families, and will hope that the information in this documentary becomes common knowledge -- putting more pressure on the church and hopefully one day brining its leaders to justice for their crimes.",

      "review": "  Despite being 2 hours long, this documentary still only tells a fraction of the story. Haunting documentary about a cult that has evolved out of control. Dangerous and power. At its roots are lies, fabrications, and fantasy. What they offer is happiness and joy, but the cost is great misery and cutting off the loved ones from your life. This tells a good story and paints an extraordinary picture of Scientology.",

Honestly, if you put some scary music over a bunch of people singing to an image of a dead guy on a cross, it'll look weird too. Other stuff, however, is very interesting. Occasionally horrifying. Like all the LRH stuff and all the recent scandals. RECOMMENDED",

      "review": "  Anti-theists will look to this movie and point out how the theology of the Church of Scientology is no wackier than the stories of other religions, or that the barbarism allegedly practiced by Scientologists pales in comparison to the atrocities committed by other religions in the past. But that equivocation doesn't work well when you take into consideration that it is the 21st century, and humanity has supposedly evolved past the point of acts of barbarism in the name of the supernatural. Violent extremism of any type from any religion has no possible justification in the modern scientific era, and Scientology is not exception.As a documentary, it is an amazing piece of work that is told in chronological order, from L. Ron Hubbard's beginnings to the present day. As the interviewees talk about their cases, the mixture of hope and despair becomes palpable, as former members come to their realizations, leave the Church, but emphasize the depths to which current members have been trapped in or sunk to. Reason and rationale have no place in faith, but coupled with the monetary power behind the organization, the institution and its members become that much more intimidating.I'm just a small-time reviewer with a small-time podcast. My work hasn't caused more than a blip on the radar of a very few people. But I am legitimately nervous as I type this, because there is the very real possibility that when I post this, the defenders of Scientology will come at me as they have other people. Here's to hoping I'm not ruined.",

Not saying it changed my mind or anything (I've thought Scientology was kind of ridiculous after South Park's brilliant Trapped In The Closet episode), but the level of detail and care with which this documentary handles this expose is admirable and honestly pretty horrifying. This is one of the few times I agree with a Rotten Tomatoes' Critic Concensus entirely, particularly the \"impossible to ignore\" statement. This is a great documentary and a great film.",

      "review": "  GOING CLEAR: SCIENTOLOGY AND THE PRISON OF BELIEF is directed by Alex Gibney and is based on the book by Lawrence Wright. While it doesn't really replace the book in any meaningful sense, it was a great companion piece that filled in a lot of gaps that a book was never going to fill anyway. Among these significant additions were archival footage of Scientology gatherings and L. Ron Hubbard, as well as interviews with many of the key people who provided anecdotes for the book. I suppose the edge that the film has is in being able to actually go behind the scenes with a look at how Scientology operates. Even still, the book goes into far more detail than the film had time to do. As for its documentary qualities, I thought it was well put-together, as is to be expected from veteran documentarian Alex Gibney. The interviews were sufficiently interesting, alternating between talking heads and archival footage. A couple of the crazier moments were courtesy of Tom Cruise, shown in one clip fervently saluting a portrait of Scientology founder, L. Ron Hubbard. The film even manages to tug at your heartstrings as the discussion moved to the Scientology policy of disconnection, and one former member recounts her daughter saying that she would have to disconnect from her. And of course there were all the tales of abuse at \"The Hole\" perpetrated against the Sea Org, the Scientology clergy. All together, it paints a very dark picture of a religion that uses fear and intimidation to keep its members in line while, at the same time, catering to its celebrity members' whims. I would have liked a little more general discussion about religion and how belief is used to control people, something that is touched upon a little bit towards the end, but for what it's worth this film does a great job exposing Scientology for the fraudulent scheme it is.",

      "review": "  Though far from unbiased at heart, this film takes a clinical approach as it investigates, indicts and ultimately savages its subject without seeming to editorialize that much. Not much of what it contains is entirely new or shocking, for those who have heard some reports on Scientology in recent years, but it's thorough enough and scathing in its tale of the atrocities committed by this bogus church. The polished and provocative film lets former members--many of them in the higher echelon of the church's leadership at one time--speak candidly of their experiences with a cult that is insidious, vengeful, hideously controlling, spiritually and morally bankrupt, and rotten to the core. Even if only half of this expose is roughly accurate, the facts are infuriating. This so-called church is no church at all and certainly doesn't deserve its tax exempt status, gained by ruthless intimidation of IRS officials, who can certainly be cowed. Their \"leader,\" the Machiavellian David Mascavige, engages in the most despicable tactics to maintain control and ruin the lives of anyone who dares to criticize the organization. Yet many of the believers have chosen this and relinquished their free thought, even with the brainwashing that the \"church\" engages in. The interview subjects acknowledge this toward the end of the film, admitting their shame as well as their rage. One thing you can do is boycott the films of Tom Cruise, a shameless huckster for this bogus \"church\". His arrogance and complicity are made crystal clear.",

      "review": "  ABORT LAST NIGHT - My Review of GRANDMA (3 Stars)Although writer/director Paul Weitz (ABOUT A BOY, AMERICAN PIE) will most likely never be accused of being a visionary auteur, he knows how to move and entertain an audience. GRANDMA, which could easily be dismissed as a totally unambitious, artless slice of life, still managed to hold me in its dry, acerbic spell for its brief 80 minute running time. One of my friends loathed this film, calling it completely unconvincing and poorly acted, and I could have so easily leaned in his direction were it not for my deep, blind love for Lily Tomlin. Even with her terrible films, and yes, I never drank the BIG BUSINESS Kool Aid, I've always appreciated Tomlin's delightfully bitter world view. Her killer smile, commanding voice, and take no prisoners attitude has a special place in my cold, cold heart. She's a comic genius who earned her dramatic chops with her stunning performance in the 1975 classic NASHVILLE. It's been such a long time since Tomlin has starred in a movie and even longer since she's tackled a drama, so I went to GRANDMA ready to savor every delicious minute of it. Sure, she still leans on comedic beats here, but having her front and center in every frame was enough to get me through its \"small time\" feel. Taking place over the course of a single day, Tomlin's Elle Reid has just broken up with her much younger short-term girlfriend (Judy Greer) when her granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner from THE AMERICANS) knocks on her door. Needing an abortion that evening and unable to shoulder the cost, Sage has come begging Elle. A broke ex-poet turned teacher, Elle takes Sage on a journey to drum up the funds, encountering people in their lives with the potential to help. It's an extremely clean, simple premise, giving Tomlin one opportunity after another to rail against anyone who gets in their way.I won't spoil what happens, but the cast of characters they meet consist of some great up-and-coming and established names, including Nat Wolff (PAPER TOWNS) as the idiot who knocks Sage up, the late Elizabeth Pena who is gets to match Tomlin's anger in an amusingly explosive scene, Colleen Camp, who proves that you can mine comedy out of a single line of dialogue, Marcia Gay Harden as Tomlin's severe daughter, Laverne Cox, who unfortunately does very little with her tattoo artist role, and best of all, Sam Elliott, as a man from Elle's past. Most of these characters merely exist to shine a light on Elle's tortured, petty, cruel and stagnant personality, which is ok, because the film, after all, is called GRANDMA, not A BUNCH OF PEOPLE. Moreover, while I would watch Judy Greer in almost anything (which means I did see JURASSIC WORLD), and I find Julia Garner to be a strong, self-possessed young actor, the main attraction is Tomlin. Depending on your stomach for her brand of comic bile, you may end up savoring every moment or end up looking for a moist towelette to wipe the somewhat sitcom-like machinations off of you. I'm, of course, with the former camp, loving that Tomlin has been freed up here to \"dyke out\" for the first time on film, instead of having to pretend to actually enjoying kissing John Travolta, her lookalike in the execrable MOMENT BY MOMENT. Elle's take-no-prisoners brand of feminism along with her Mother Cub protective instincts make her encounters bristle with the energy of a person who's sifted through enough crap in her life. Elle is a complicated character in that she doesn't always do or say the right things, yet Tomlin's command keeps you in the game. There's a fine line between being too Sundance-like and too populist, and GRANDMA walks the tightrope quite well between the two. Yes, it's artless, often obvious, and pretty clear from the start where the whole thing will end up, but that quiet, subtle, long final shot of Tomlin feels earned. You may not know what comes next for this unstable, unreasonable, yet wholeheartedly caring person, but you'll feel confident she can handle it by the end.",

      "review": "  Lily Tomlin is an undisputed miracle worker. She's already been comedy royalty for decades, from her time on Laugh-In to 9 To 5, and she even has an Oscar nomination to her name for the classic Nashville. Why? Because she has a range and skills that cut deeper than laughs. But no actual Oscar wins. Perhaps this wonderful gem of a film will finally do it. This is Tomlin in a tour de force.It's not that the 75-year-old Tomlin is warming hearts as a sweet old dearie fighting off illness or senility. Writer-director Paul Weitz (About a Boy) manages to play to her strengths. Tomlin is Elle Reid, a celebrated poet with a real mouth on her, and Tomlin uses the role to take on hypocrisy head on. Her longtime partner has just died and she's just dumped a new, younger version (Judy Greer). That's when Elle's teen granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) shows up and announces she's pregnant.The film is an absolute delight as Elle and Sage go on a no-bull search for 'a reasonably priced abortion', causing down on her luck Grandma to come across that baby daddy (a hilarious Nat Wolff), as well as Sage's mother (an excellent Marcia Gay Harden) and Karl (a terrific Sam Elliott), an old flame from Elle's past. Every encounter reveals long-buried feelings Elle can't just shrug off, and Tomlin, ever the artist, will leave you astonished and devastated.",

Her day starts when her granddaughter comes to her for help after finding out she is pregnant. The two go on a mini road trip to collect money. At the same time, we are introduced to Elle's past as we meet an array of characters that filled her past. This is where we get to find out who Elle was as a person. This is Tomlin's show and she is sharp, witty, funny, and sentimental. Though this is seen as a comedy, the story is rather sad as it is about regrets and moving on. But, Tomlin is the main reason to see this and she will make you want a grandma like her.Grade: A-",

Yeah, she's a bit of an indie clich� but Lily Tomlin is on steroids here and I loved the turn the character took in the final act (if only they had the balls to go deeper in that particular story line, they could have come up with something great). So at the end of the movie, we have four characters in constant conflicts with each other and they suddenly find ways to resolve the conflicts but if you ask me how we came to that resolution, all I could come up with would be: by a twisted version of divine intervention. One of the conflicts (between Elle and her lover of a year and a half, Olivia) is your typical indie filler. It takes too much time, it contributes little to the overall narrative, but it's kinda cool and it even works somehow, mostly thanks to the two terrific, underused actresses portraying Elle and Olivia (Judy Greer always does so much with so little). And that's too bad, because the film is fun. It's affectionate and smart, but it never ever makes a bold storytelling choice. The actors are bold, yeah, once again - Lily Tomlin, you're a goddess, but the writing, the writing needs work. Actually, starting from scratch would be a good idea. End of rant.",

In a scene that sets out to be more prophetic than it actually is, our titular character, played by Lily Tomlin, claims that hatred and ignorance is the way the world errs most. But hatred is what fuels Tomlin-she rips on everyone who does not fall into her mold, that of the new wave. It's a tireless effort that is boosted by the supporting cast rather than in-your-face leads. Recent films like Me and Earl and the Dying Girl do this \"small landscape\" genre right, while Grandma relies more on propaganda and clich�s than structure.",

The grand old Lily Tomlin is Elle a past her prime college professor who's down in the dumps she's broke money wise and she's just broken up with her gay lady love Olivia(Judy Greer). To complicate matters one day her granddaughter Sage shows up one day needing 600 dollars and guess what it's for an abortion as Sage was knocked up by her boyfriend who hit the road! Then it's a funny and feel good road journey to obtain the 600 for an abortion and along the way it's a bonding of love and friendship as Sage's mother and Elle's daughter Judy(Marcia Gay Harden)an uptight and business like society snob provides the money for the procedure. Still thru it all each discover a journey of hope and a new beginning and Lily Tomlin's performance is shining even with her grand old age.",

      "review": "  This film is way too eager to wrap up all its story lines as cleanly and quickly as possible and that's unfortunate because there was too much to tell and the filmmakers haven't exhausted even a small portion of possibilities created by these characters, above all by the cocky, bossy, anti-dogmatic, anti-pragmatic, no-nonsense, don't-fuck-with-me free spirit, Elle Reid. Yeah, she's a bit of an indie clich� but Lily Tomlin is on steroids here and I loved the turn the character took in the final act (if only they had the balls to go deeper in that particular story line, they could have come up with something great). So at the end of the movie, we have four characters in constant conflicts with each other and they suddenly find ways to resolve the conflicts but if you ask me how we came to that resolution, all I could come up with would be: by a twisted version of divine intervention. One of the conflicts (between Elle and her lover of a year and a half, Olivia) is your typical indie filler. It takes too much time, it contributes little to the overall narrative, but it's kinda cool and it even works somehow, mostly thanks to the two terrific, underused actresses portraying Elle and Olivia (Judy Greer always does so much with so little). And that's too bad, because the film is fun. It's affectionate and smart, but it never ever makes a bold storytelling choice. The actors are bold, yeah, once again - Lily Tomlin, you're a goddess, but the writing, the writing needs work. Actually, starting from scratch would be a good idea. End of rant.",

I wouldn't doubt it if Planned Parenthood financed most of this. You mix in some LGBT theme and of course it's catnip for the critics that are employed by left-wing media outlets. It's as bad as having Christian ministers critiquing Passion of the Christ. I'll give it one star for Lily Tomlin. Next, a story about inner city kids bonding through dog fighting.",

      "review": "  A patchwork quilt of wish fulfillment and dream for all the single ladies out there, the senior single ladies. Blythe Danner is our ever elegant surrogate in this day trip to Autumn, a wineglass never far from her graceful fingers, and capably aided by friends Mary Kay Place and Rhea Perlman. The highlight: Danner's version of the delectable \"Cry Me A River\". Like many of the dreams of filmdom though no hair is ever out of place, and even an intrusive rodent seems tame and Disney- fied.",

      "review": "  Beautiful from start to finish, \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" follows Carol, a middle-aged woman who recently lost her dog, and is still getting over her late husband of 20 years. Following her as she learns to let go of certain aspects of here life and welcome in new people is just an amazing viewing experience. Blythe Danner and Sam Elliott share fantastic chemistry, as does Martin Starr. Essentially, this picture is about learning to let go, let in, and learn about life in general. There are so many hidden messages about life throughout this film, that it will demand multiple viewings. With extremely believable dialogue, superb direction, and brilliant performances, \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" may be in the tight race for my favourite film of 2015. This is as simple of a premise as you can get, but the maturity level of screenplay is cranked up to eleven, which makes it that much more engaging. To me, this little film is a revelation, I (to put it bluntly), cannot find a single thing to complain about. \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" is beautiful.",

      "review": "  I absolutely loved I'll See You in My Dreams, which opened the Cleveland International Film Fest in 2015!! It succeeds because of the funny, sweet and stellar ensemble cast. Carol Petersen (Blythe Danner) is a widow with a routine. She lives independently, but visits her three friends (Squibb, Perlman, and Place) regularly for card games at their retirement community complex. She mostly keeps to herself, always somewhat in an attitude of mourning. Quite unexpectedly she befriends her much younger pool cleaner, Lloyd, the droll Martin Starr who I've enjoyed since Freaks and Geeks. The title refers to a song that Lloyd shares with Carol. Within days another man, Bill, played by perpetual cowboy Sam Elliott, who is close to Carol's age begins flirting with her. Suddenly Carol has two men vying for her attention, paying her compliments, and encouraging her to really live life. Her friends and her daughter Katherine, played by Malin Akerman rather than her real daughter Gwyneth Paltrow, are a little puzzled by the changes in Carol but ultimately very supportive. There are heart-touching moments of sadness whether you are a retiree or you have a parent who is reaching retirement age and you realize that life doesn't need to end with isolation in what could be thirty more years of living. There are also uproarious laughs with so many comedians in this cast. This indie film was amazingly shot in 18 days and carries an energy and realistic spirit in its simple story that is especially rare.",

His Lloyd the pool boy is a truly nuanced and heart-felt turn for the comedic actor (as we witnessed in Freaks & Geeks, Party Down and all the Aptow movies). I want to be Sam Elliott. (8--1-15)",

The ending may not be everyone's cup of tea, but life is not always going to have happy endings. Grade: B+",

But what happens after the primes of our lives have come and gone? This is what makes \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" such a wonderful movie. If you can make it through the first 15 minutes of the movie without shedding a tear, you are a stronger person than me. We look into the everyday life of Carol, who clearly is widowed and lives alone in a big house in Southern California. We see her waking up, going to bed, and doing everyday chores alone. Yet the movie doesn't want us to feel sorry for Carol. She herself doesn't seem to be phased by how she has had to live the las20 years of her life. Yet good things are in store for Carol, as we see her kindle a few budding romances, perform karaoke in a bar, and smoke medical marijuana with her similarly single lady friends and go on a binge trip to the grocery. All of these moments are depicted with humor, and without giving anything else a way, the movie tells us that life creeps up very fast, and there is no way to be certain you have always made the best decisions for yourself. To enjoy life and to live ifor the moment is what is important. Blythe Danner as usual is wonderful, and the tone of the film is subtle but touching.",

      "review": "  Pixar returns to form with the delightful 'Inside Out'. Following 11 year old Riley and her emotions (Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness) this film explores the psychology of a child in a unique and gratifying way, with simple yet effective messages that will warm the heart of any child or adult. For me the message was quite beautiful that a memory doesn't have one emotion attached to it- it has a plethora of emotions, showcasing how unique and complex we are as individuals. It also tells us that we are allowed to feel joyful or sad etc, and that we shouldn't feel bad for feeling anything that we do because it is human to feel. Without spoiling anything there are a few scenes in the movie that may leave you with a tear in your eye. Pixar effectively gives emotions feelings in this brilliant animated movie.4.5/5",

      "review": "  When I first saw the pics for this movie I thought it was about little living emojis/emoticons, it does look like that doesn't it? Nope, instead its actually about little living creatures inside your head that represent emotions. When I say living creatures I'm not so sure that's even correct, they are more like representations of the mind or emotions, each one a little physical embodiment of each emotion. Its not an overly original concept lets be totally honest, I know I've seen this type of thing before in cartoons many times, and in pretty similar fashion, but again lets be honest, there's only a few ways you can do this.So the plot revolves around a little girl as she is born, and at the same time her little emotions are born within her head (I assume). We follow little Riley as she grows up with her parents and experiences all of life's wonder and beauty, but of course, all of the little negative bits too. At the same time we see everything from inside little Riley's head from the perspective of her emotions and how they each deal with individual situations. Naturally each emotion deals with different things such as sadness, anger, joy etc...they each specialise in their emotion of course. Alas, many years later aged 11, one day goes tits up when Riley attends her first day at school and loses control, she begins to cry because she is home sick, this causes a permanent negative memory which Joy (the happy emotion) tries to get rid of. In a series of bizarre accidents Joy and Sadness get ejected from the control room (the brain) and end up lose within Riley's head. Without Joy in Riley's mind (and life) keeping control, the duo now have to get back into Riley's brain/mind before she becomes depressed forever, seemingly.Right so the emotions, a generic bunch truth be told, Anger, Joy, Sadness, Disgust and Fear. Anger is a little red fellow that isn't a million miles away from a satanic looking creation, he also emits fire when in a rage. He is probably the second best emotion going for obvious reason really, one of the funniest emotions. Joy is the main protagonist and is a happy-go-lucky shiny female character that is rather vomit inducing. Sadness is probably the best emotion if you ask me, he looks kinda plain yet random in design, but his permanent, nervous, hyper paranoid persona is clearly the main laugh out loud machine. Disgust is easily the weakest of the bunch with not much to do or say frankly. She is modelled on young teenage valley girls which is a good notion, but highly annoying (check her glittery appearance). Lastly we have Sadness who is a stereotypically short, plump, glasses wearing female character that kinda reminds you of the nerdy high school girl, the librarians assistant type. She mopes around being all glum and useless, again, kinda annoying and makes you wonder why no one ever kills her.Overall the emotions are a reasonably fun little group but nothing overly hilarious, personally I found the other background characters much more interesting. The best of these has to be Bing Bong who was Riley's old childhood imaginary friend, but long forgotten. This guy is a combination of Riley's favourite things from that young age, his body is made of candy floss and various animal parts...plus he cries candy. His sidekick is an old child's tow wagon with rocket boosters that fire a rainbow coloured discharge, this was Riley's old toy back in the day which she would play and imagine could fly like a space rocket. This guy gives us some of the best laughs throughout the main adventure through Riley's mind, but he also gives us some of the most emotional. I don't think I can deny that I almost cried when he meets his end. Hands up who's with me here...yeah, I thought so. The various other colourful, bizarre, weird and wonderful little mind creatures we meet along the way are all really well designed and voiced acted, like I said, overall I think the majority were actually more engaging than the main characters. I really didn't like the designs for the main emotions, they just seemed way too simplistic and generic.I also have to say I didn't like or understand the other emotional representatives in other peoples minds, they didn't really make sense. Hear me out, Riley's mind emotions don't look anything like her, they are just visual representations of the emotion. Now when we go to Riley's dad (who has a tash), his mind emotions also have little moustaches, Riley's mum has emotions that look like her with the glasses and hair. Then in the end credits we see more mind emotions for other people, all of them look like the people they inhabit. One guy who works as a clown even has mind emotions that look like clowns, eh?? why would his mind emotions look like clowns when that's just his day job? So I guess the question is, why does Riley have random looking emotions when everyone else has emotions that look like them? Yeah I know this is a kids flick and I'm [b]really[/b] looking too far into this, but things like that kinda bug me cause it doesn't really add up. The animal ones really seemed far fetched as the emotions just run wild inside the animals head, so I guess that would work? who knows.The visuals are of course stunning, really slick, but did you expect anything less? really? I'm not trying to take anything away from the visuals but these days its really no big deal anymore is it, if a movie looks less than stunning then its something to talk about. I did like the imagination on display though, some really great ideas fleshed out, not all great, I would have done some things differently, but still good. I really liked the abyss of lost memories or memory dump, nice touch. The individual floating personality islands were neat, like family island or friendship island, that house memories of those certain aspects in Riley's life. I liked how they fell apart when affected by Riley's emotional state being rocked badly. I also liked the train of thought which was of course...a train. Overall the ideas and some visuals reminded me of an old animated movie called 'The Phantom Tollbooth', which also delved into such things as individual human traits being fleshed out, alongside things like words and numbers.Its a strong emotional ride that's for sure, no puns intended. The kids will love the visuals and the wacky characters, whilst the adults will enjoy the trip down memory lane for the...errmm, the childhood memory aspect of it all. I'm sure many people will be able to relate to what's going on, first day of school and crying, snow days, moving etc...its all there, the full gamut of human anguish and joy. The way they have thought out how things like memories, long term memories, forgotten memories, special memories etc...all work is very clever, typically adults make everything into a bureaucratic headache, but it works well. But like I said already I didn't really feel the main emotions, which was a problem, they weren't overly funny but slightly annoying. I mean come on, Sadness creates all the problems, everything is her fault! and she kept on touching everything and fucking it up!! arrgghhh!! Still I can't deny this was an excellent little rollercoaster that had me on the edge of my seat wondering how they would ever save the day.",

We see how children naturally evolve from their compartmentalized basic emotions to composite secondary and tertiary emotions. Even I didn't understand Joy's fanatic tenacity for much of the movie, but the overarching message about how putting a happy face on all the time can take its toll is quite kathartic and accurate. There are some random, goofy tangents throughout the journey, but Bing Bong's sacrifice is so sad and moving.*Mild spoiler: So does that mean children's comprehension of Sadness becomes Reason later on in life?",

The adventure on top is just icing on the cake. I'm just somewhat underwhelmed by the lack of exploration with the other three core \"emotion\" members (anger, fear and disgust) Like Sadness I think they're a lot more interesting as perceptively \"negative\" emotions. Instead Joy gets an unprecedented amount of focus that I just don't care for.Inside Out is a great \"journey\" adventure, but a missed opportunity to simplify and explore the complexities of its own cast.",

      "review": "  This is a very rare case of a films idea being greater than the movie, but the movie still being pretty good. Pixar really targets the adults in this picture, but includes some funny moments for children and some really clever moments for everyone. Some parts of this movie are complex, probably too much so for its own good because it does get out of hand at some points, but that is better than being too simple. This film may be overshadowed and under appreciated since it came out on the heels of Frozen and The Lego Movie, and while I consider those 2 to be better films, that is not to take away from how enjoyable this one is.",

Hardly worthy of a film, you might think, but in the capable hands of Pixar, worthy insight into that indefinable nuance, that which makes us tick. One cool decision is that Fear and Anger, while present, are given diminutive roles compared to Sadness and even Disgust. Overall, at the end of the work, there is that largest of compliments any film can hope to gain: one wishes that it could go on and on.",

      "review": "  It feels immeasurably satisfying to finally have the Pixar we all fell in love with back and running. There's been a sharp decline in the company's quality since 2010's Toy Story 3. Did we really need a sequel to Cars and a prequel to Monster's Inc.? It started to look like Pixar was steering away from the kind of bold and brilliant storytelling that had earned its audience trust. With Inside Out, Pixar tackles the intricacies not of the secret world of toys, bugs, monsters, or sea life, but of the human brain itself and our embattled emotions, finding new ways to wow us once again and remind us just how magical the right combination of story and storyteller can be. Inside Out is a luminescent piece of filmmaking, brimming with intelligence, imagination, and powerfully moving while also being deeply relatable and entertaining. In looking inward, Pixar has found the path out of their recent rut, and Inside Out is a shining example of their ingenuity. Inside 11-year-old Riley is a complex world. Five primary emotions help oversee her day-to-day functions; they're the caretakers of Riley. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) is the effervescent leader of the bunch, along with Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), and Anger (Lewis Black). These five are entrusted with Riley's well being and her memories. Riley's core memories, the moments that make up who she is, help to form personality islands: honesty, hockey, goofball, and family. Riley and her family have recently moved from Minnesota to San Francisco, and Riley's having a hard time adjusting. Her parents don't know what's happened to the daughter they knew. Sadness seems to be \"tainting\" Riley's memories, and Joy tries her best to keep Riley happy at all times. Joy and Sadness get accidentally sucked away wrestling over Riley's core memories. They're sent to the outer reaches where the aisles of long-term memories are vast. The two emotions have to work together to get back to headquarters before the remaining emotions convince Riley to run away from home. Even just reading that again, it's easy to see how complicated this movie can be with its world building and internal logic, and yet under the guidance of director Pete Doctor (Up) and his writers, the movie is at no point confusing. Pixar once again does an amazing job of guiding you through a new world and its various parts, all while expanding and complicating this environment while staying true to its internal logic and keeping an audience properly oriented. I can't imagine many screenwriters would be able to tell this story while still being as clearly understood. The simplicity of the story, the ease to follow along, the natural development and connection of the storylines and characters coming together, is the greatest credit one can offer. It's ostensibly a buddy adventure film like many Pixar tales, as the unlikely team of Joy and Sadness having to find their way back to headquarters and learning important life lessons along the way. It's also a smart way to explore the various other elements at work in Riley's brain. It's not just an interesting descent but each new station further opens up Riley as a character. Her subconscious (and fear of clowns), her dream theater projections, her working abstract concepts, all tie back together in satisfying ways. Though the greatest side character is unquestionably Riley's former imaginary friend, Bing Bong (voiced by Richard Kind). He's wandering around her memories, and at first you have your suspicions, but then you realize, like the other characters, that he just wants what's best for Riley. Coming to terms with the fact that Riley has moved on, and his time, while cherished, is now left behind, is a complete character arc, and that's for a comic side character. Oh, and if you're like me, Bing Bong's conclusion just wrecked your tear ducts. You know you've watched an impactful film when even thinking back on moments starts the process of tears welling in your eyes. It's somewhat strange to think about characters as ephemeral as emotions and imaginary friends and the like, but they really work on two levels: the emotions themselves are exaggerated figures with distinct points of view but they also better inform the whole of Riley. There's a depth there that gets even more impressive the more you analyze the creative process. What's also impressive is the vial message of the movie, which is that growing up is hard and that being sad is okay. Seriously, the journey of Joy is to accept that being sad isn't necessarily an emotion to minimize but a vital part of being human and an essential process. Much of the conflict that drives Riley is her avoidance of being sad, her postponement of accepting her real feelings and accepting that San Francisco is not going to be like her old home. It's also a realization that to be a fully functioning person, you have to own the sadness in life. When Riley eventually unburdens herself of all her troubles and fears, and the tears flow, that's when the healing can begin, and that's when her parents swarm in for the group hug, and even now my eyes are starting to water. Damn you, Pixar. Don't be mistaken by my words thus far, Inside Out is also a wonderfully funny and inventive comedy. The sense of discovery with the movie is alive and well, and each new revelation of Riley's inner mind adds to the fun. The jokes are consistently paced. The vocal cast is expertly chosen and each emotion gets some good jokes. There's a terrific running gag about a catchy jingle that the memory workers just enjoy kicking back and forth for their own impish amusement. The film dives into other minds other than Riley's, including both parents trying to communicate during a family dinner meant to soothe their daughter. It doesn't lean too heavily on tired gender stereotypes when it comes to the differing thought processes of men and women, which is a relief. During the end credits, we zoom into the mind of a schoolteacher, a bus driver, and a dog and a cat, and it's an enjoyable way to leave the theater and gather yourself emotionally. The greatest comic asset is Joy, particularly as voiced by Poehler. As fans of TV's Parks and Recreation can attest, Poehler can make insufferable optimism endearing, tap toeing around what should be annoying and instead finding stronger comic rhythms. If you're looking for the closest thing to an antagonist, it's Joy who got the whole mess started and yet we don't ever really side against her. Part of that is because she's not doing what she does as some weird power play but because she wants what, she thinks, is best for Riley. The other part is because Poehler is such a skilled vocal performer. If I had to find some point to quibble, the world isn't as beautifully realized in a visual sense as other Pixar classics. I think this was a deliberate decision to ground what is such an unusual environment into something a little more familiar and less flashy. I also don't think that Disgust seems as well articulated as a necessary emotion. She's well played by Kaling but her application seems lacking in comparison to the other four main emotions. It's remarkable that the summer is still young and already we have two instant classics in theaters; first Mad Max: Fury Road and now Pixar's Inside Out. I'm still riding high from my screening, but I'd feel safe to call this a top-three Pixar film. I wouldn't even begrudge those who cite it as their best. Far more than a big screen version of the 90s comedy Herman's Head (anybody remember this one?), this is an exceptional animated film that will appeal to all ages but, I suspect, hit adults even harder than their little ones. It's a wonderfully poignant film about the struggles of growing up, of holding onto your past definitions of yourself, of accepting the full barrage of emotions, including the necessity of sadness. It's relatable in many aspects and this further compounds its power. It's dazzling with its creativity, it left me cackling with laughter (a superb Chinatown reference almost had me fall out of my chair), and it left me weeping at various points. Inside Out is a return to form. This is the Pixar we remember.Nate's Grade: A",

      "review": "  While the trailers didn't manage (or maybe didn't even try, because they left me entirely indifferent) to grasp the entire concept of the latest Pixar adventure, the movie needs mere seconds to sell the audience on its premise: Emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust) are working hard in their headquarters inside our heads. Dreams are made in a film studio nearby. Imagination is a wild amusement park. Our character traits and interests are like islands that have to be maintained. The train of thought runs through it all. Our memories are marbles in the color of the emotion we connect with them.This concept is as simple as it is brilliant and beautifully solved here. The design of this entire world is absolutely gorgeous and makes perfect sense in the film's own logic. It wouldn't be Pixar if they didn't manage to create an exciting and deeply moving adventure around this concept.A smart, heart-warming and funny film that may be a little too weird and abstract for the youngest kids. But adults may even get even more from this in exchange. Lovely!",

I grew up with Andy in Toy Story (literally we graduated the same year) and there have been some fantastic movies in the interim, but none quite like Inside Out. On an emotional level this movie hits a home run. Whether you are a kid or an adult this movie really hits home on the human experience, namely our emotions and what we are actually feeling and what makes us ourselves. Not that it's an hour and a half of constant crying or anything; it is also a funny movie, really funny. I think this is impart to the wonderful voice casting. As far as the story line goes it is pretty classic problem, climax, solution, but it's classic because it works. It's well written and keeps moving without rushing. On a different note, I wish I had some background in psychology because I'm very curious to know exactly how accurate their anthropology is. Don't get me wrong, it seems accurate...but I would have to say that it wasn't clear what the role of free will and intellect played along with the emotions. That being said the main character is only an 11 year old so the emotions will be a much bigger player than an adult (we hope). Nonetheless, it's not a documentary, but an incredibly fun, entertaining, and tear jerking movie. For me it goes down as a classic!",

It illustrates quite literally the value of embracing all of one's emotions, especially sadness, to live a fulfilling life.

      "review": "  Disney Pixar's latest classic \"Inside Out\" stars Joy and Sadness as your main emotions you'll be feeling when watching the film, alongside with Fear in a form of worry in a minor role of your emotions throughout this wonderful, inventive experience.Twenty years ago, Pixar made themselves well-known by creating the first ever computer animated film in the animated genre of film, \"Toy Story\". From then on, Pixar has shared various wonderful stories in different areas and sizes, but their grandness was constant throughout. Their best originality belongs to \"Brave\" while their best film belongs to \"Toy Story 3\". Now it didn't seem that \"Toy Story 3\" would be dethroned when it has that much heart on growth, while \"Brave\" however shows a possibility that it might get dethroned sometime eventually, even if it consists a heartwarming side while being a great fantasy flick. But now, those two films have gotten dethroned by Pixar's latest fun masterpiece \"Inside Out\".\"Inside Out\" explores an imaginative/creative, thought-provoking concept of our emotions inside of our heads that takes care of us on how we express ourselves and think. The film centers on an 11-year-old girl named Riley, who's going through what any kid would go through: leaving your hometown and old friends behind because one of your parents got a better job at a faraway city. To Riley's parents, she's a happy girl who's a bundle of joy to them. As she adjusts to her new life at a new place while trying to make new friends, as it's a usual routine for a kid to experience, her emotions are there to take care of her.According to the film, there are five basic emotions: joy, sadness, fear, anger and disgust. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) makes sure that Riley's happy, positive, spirited and having fun, and optimistic if possible. Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith) brings the tears and sadness out of Riley's eyes, but she hasn't discover her purpose like the other emotions have their purposes in Riley's life. Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) keeps Riley safe from anything that'll cause harm or would hurt her, physically or mentally (i.e. nightmares). Anger (voiced by Lewis Black) makes sure that Riley's life is fair in a way that she'll be in modes of disapproving and being argumentive or just simply negative without positivity. And finally Disgust (voiced by Mindy Kaling) keeps Riley from anything that'll \"poisoned\" her physically or mentally, or simply just providing judgement and common sense.The way things work is that the five physical forms of Riley's emotions controls her mind (Joy's the captain in Riley), and whatever actions they make, it becomes a memory orb (and Joy's done most of the memories). Furthermore, whatever memory that builds Riley's personality, it becomes a core memory and creates an island that holds that personality from the memory. That's where the complicating action comes in when Sadness touched one of them, and the Joy-ful memory becomes a sad one. As Joy's trying to fix whiny Sadness's mistake, it leads to a mishap of the core memories on the loose and were sucked to where long-term memories are located, with both Joy and Sadness sucked along as well. While Joy and Sadness are on the reflective, explorative journey back to their headquarters, it was now up to Fear, Anger and Disgust to help Riley, which led into not-so-good consequences sense Joy isn't around to put a smile on Riley's face.It's not really a near-tearjerker sad like the ending of \"Toy Story 3\" and the duration of Ghibli's latest \"When Marnie was There\", but it's truly sad. It would genuinely garner tears from different viewers who'll watch this and would shed some tears or one. The emotional level from the perspective Riley's life is like a coming-of-age at a young age adjusting her new life in the city. Also, speaking of coming-of-age, you'll feeling worry for Riley as what she's going through, outside of her and inside of her, during Joy's absence (which is why Fear has the minor role of the \"Inside Out\" viewing experience).But besides those two emotions, the obvious reason why Joy is the main star of both the film and the experience is enjoying what the film has to offer: fun comic and a great, typical, cute heartwarming emotion. Joy's spirit seen in the film was both made perfectly by Amy Poehler's performance, while expressed with gorgeous animation that covers the whole film as Pixar's best job well done since \"Toy Story 3\". The film also builds up to a powerful meaning after some reflections and explorations through more creative ideas under the concept.There's no doubt that this film would win Best Animated Feature, despite the upcoming releases of \"The Peanuts Movie\", which ought to be great as well, and Pixar's second treat \"The Good Dinosaur\", which was postponed from last year. It's also the top contender of Best Original Screenplay since out of all the films that were and not yet released this year, I really don't see any of them, or their stories, that would top the five emotions' adventure within a little girl. It could also be nominated for Best Original Score since it'd signified the older magic of Pixar seen in the older classics.\"Inside Out\" is a definite must-see as it provides something thought-provoking that'll keep you thinking about it even though it was imaginative with high creativity that stayed faithful to both the emotions and the mind's process topic of psychology. Director Pete Doctor, who've done \"Monsters, Inc.\" and another emotional tale \"Up\", done a thorough research to make the concept logically work without a missing gap, which makes this his best work by the look of the end result. The end result of this most recent instant animated classic is great like this year's combo of \"Big Hero 6\" and \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\", and it's one of the rarest of all films to be flawless.There's no reason to not like this - or miss this when it's irresistible and lovable - like there's no reason to not have Joy in your life. (A+)",

This may be my new favorite animated film, though the How to Train Your Dragon soundtrack still has a firm grip on my heart.Edit: After consideration, I've decided that this IS my favorite animated film... but not really. My head tells me this is better, but my heart still loves How to Train Your Dragon. So, I'm only going to admit that this film is the best technically... but How to Train Your Dragon is my all-time favorite.",

      "review": "  If you have daughters - even sons - but especially daughters - you HAVE to see this movie. Pixar never ceases to amaze me with regards to how they can constantly step up the research and writing game. The reason their movies are so damned good and that all ages can appreciate them is simply - the multi-dimensional writing. This movie broke down the complexities of emotional development - especially around adolescence. For me, this could not have come at a more perfect time given the ages of my daughters. if you have young daughters, it will prepare you - if you have older daughters, it will help explain some things.",

The voice casting is superb, and the animation is golden as always, but its premise sets it apart. I can't think of a film that has examined the human mind in such a unique yet strangely accurate way. I'm not sure how much of it will be grasped by kids, but the more seasoned viewers will have a blast.",

      "review": "  I don't think I've ever been this excited to see an animated film. Maybe since it's a Pixar film and that it was in the hands of Pete Docter, who did Up and Monsters, Inc. which I thought were absolutely wonderful. I love films that take on a subject matter about growing up and how it focuses on the mental development of a child. And for Pixar to take on that subject matter, I got even more excited. Words cannot describe how much I adore Inside Out. There are so many things to talk about this film it's hard where to even start. Probably why I love the film so much is that it covers virtually everything I wanted to be done with this concept. I wanted to see how Riley lived her life as a child, how her emotions control the situations in her life, how she interacts with her friends and family, and see how she lets out her emotions. The film covers all of those things and it is executed perfectly.I know that the idea of people controlling the inside of your head has been done many times before. But taking that idea and putting it in a whole new interesting direction by incorporating it in a story about a young girl growing up is what makes this film original, which is what we love to see from Pixar. The amount of creativity and imagination the film has is unbelievable and how they utilize it with the story is absolutely ingenious. It also makes for some really funny jokes. The thing about the film is that, comparing it to other Pixar films, they aren't throwing that many jokes at you. But when they do, it is some of Pixar's funniest. The jokes are so incredibly clever, so well put together, a lot are actually very subtle, and they made me laugh so hard. There's too much creativity involved in the film for me to go into. Michael Giacchino's score has become one of my favorites from him. His soundtrack is very reminiscent of the mind, there's a lot of variety, and it carries the whole film. The film is also incredibly colorful. It has a really vibrant color scheme that makes the film's atmosphere feel very lush. I don't think I've seen a film have this much color. I really love the contrast of the amount of color between the mind and the real world, making it easier to differentiate between them. I also love how the colors in the real world became more bland when they move to San Francisco to be used as a metaphor of how the color has been sucked out of Riley's life. The characters are all so adorable and very relatable. It could've been so easy to make the emotion characters one-dimensional since they're supposedly meant to express only one emotion. But they give them more fleshed out personalities and interesting arcs that helps us connect with them more while also making them more identifiable. Some people may find it weird that they can somehow express more than one emotion, but it's never said that they're unable to do so. The emotion characters portray their particular emotion so well, and they had me very entertained the whole time. Credit must be given to the perfect, and I mean PERFECT, cast! Let alone Lewis Black as the voice of Anger! You couldn't have picked better actors to play these roles. The animation on the emotions is extremely well done. It adds even more character to them and also makes their personalities as well as the setting of the mind even more identifiable. The character arc on Joy makes her especially relatable. She starts out selfish, takes control of everything, and thinks that being happy all the time will straighten everything out, which we can easily think the same thing. But she eventually becomes aware that Sadness is very important, and that acknowledging sad moments will make you feel and appreciate the joyful moments even more, like how we will find that awareness later in life. But my favorite character in the film is actually Riley. I think she is one of the best kid characters of all time. They really made her feel like a real person. She's just your normal everyday girl who's growing up. She goes through the same hardships that everyone else goes through in that period of adolescence, so we can easily relate to her based on what she does and how she feels.Since it is a film about emotions, the most important aspect of the film is that it should have a lot of emotional depth. They really accomplished that aspect. This film has some of the most emotional moments in any Pixar film, or maybe in any film! Maybe I'm exaggerating a little, but there were some scenes that really got me. (SPOILER ALERT) There's the scene where Joy learns the importance of Sadness. We see Joy remembering all the forgotten happy memories and she shows how much she loves Riley and her being happy. When she says \"I just wanted Riley to be happy\" and then just breaks down crying, you understand why Joy had a somewhat harsh attitude towards Sadness because Joy really cares about Riley like she was her own daughter and she never wanted her to feel sad. The way they utilize the moral about the importance of Sadness is absolutely brilliant! And it's mostly done with just a visual representation. It is such a meaningful message for children nowadays because they need that acknowledgement in order to survive. Being happy all the time isn't always the solution to the hardships of growing up and that it's okay to be sad sometimes. I have to admit, that scene managed to get me a little teary-eyed. But believe me, I usually never cry in movies. Then there's the scene that pretty much everyone cried at was the selfless sacrifice of Riley's imaginary friend, Bing Bong. The disappearance of Bing Bong is a perfect metaphor of having to let go of something that was a big part of your childhood, which is necessary for us to keep us mentally healthy. I wasn't quite as devastated as everyone else was, but I was still genuinely moved. And then there's the scene where Riley tearfully admits to her parents how much she misses her old home. Again, I have to admit, this scene legitimately made me cry. Throughout the course of the film, we have related to Riley and we've grown to really care about her. She hasn't been showing how she really feels about her new life and the stress of the situation is effecting her mental stability. When she eventually had to confess she couldn't help but let her feelings out, which makes us relate to her and feel for her even more. The tears streaming down her face, her sniffling, and her breaking voice as she remembers her old life makes for an extremely affecting scene. I felt for Riley so much at this point that I just wanted to give her a hug. Her parents acknowledge that this a really sad moment for Riley and they needed to console her, and she cries into her parents arms. Then Sadness and Joy take control of Riley together, and we see Riley smiling again through her tears creating a new amalgamated and bittersweet core memory. Such a sweet, touching, and meaningful scene. They executed that scene so incredibly well.Honestly, the only nitpick I have with the film is that I wanted to see even more of how the mind works. There are so many opportunities you can do with this concept that I think it could've been explored a little more. But that's a really small nitpick, they can't cover everything. It's still very impressive how much they've covered. I really want to see Pixar make a franchise with this because there are just so many more ideas and opportunities. Like in the Toy Story franchise where we see Andy growing up, I can see them make an Inside Out franchise where we see Riley growing up. The ending kind of indicates a potential sequel, and if they do make one I'm all for it. I want to see more! I wanted to review this film in depth because I want to explain why this film means so much to me. Watching it, I feel like I'm bettered as a person. It came out at a perfect time for me. I was under a lot of stress at the time, and the film taught me that this is a normal part of life and it's best to just deal with it. You're allowed to let your emotions out when you need to. Inside Out has become not only my favorite film of the year, not only my favorite Pixar film, I've considered it as being one of my top ten favorite films of all time! With the exception of Fantasia, it has become my all time favorite animated film. That's how much I love it. That's how much it affected me. This movie will always hold a place in my heart.",

      "review": "  Too often with contemporary horror films we are subjected to a barrage of positive claims. Claims that the most recent one is the best for decades. It almost seems like audiences and critics are desperate for it to actually be the case, such is the lack of any true quality in a failing genre and the desperate demand to be spooked again. Sooner or later, though, one had to arrive where the positivity surrounding it would be genuine. Finally, we have It Follows: a film that can confidently stake it's claim to being that coveted frightener.After a sexual encounter, 19-year-old Jay (Maika Monroe) is told that she will then be followed by a presence - someone or something - determined to kill her. The only way it'll stop is if she has another sexual encounter where she can pass it on. Initially, she's doubtful but soon enough the disturbing visions begin...If you're ever in any doubt that you're being stalked by a malevolent force of some kind, then it's probably best to steer clear of the old rumpy-pumpy. Going by the usual horror tropes, when someone butters the muffin it inevitably leads to their demise. And by that, director David Robert Mitchell cleverly bases his entire horror concept around that promiscuous premise. What works in It Follows' favour is it's homage to films of old - namely, John Carpenter's Halloween. If you consider Carpenter's depiction of Michael Myers, you'll notice that he works slowly and never in a rush to fulfil his murderous intent. That's very much like the entity in this; there's a self-assurance in it's unrelenting pursuit. The setting also takes place in a similar leafy suburban neighbourhood and our protagonist goes by the name of Jay (short for Jamie) - a direct tribute to Halloween's afflicted heroine, Jamie Lee Curtis. Even Rich Vreeland's scaled down music is very reminiscent of Carpenter's classic synthesised score.You could actually spend some time identifying the previous horrors that Mitchell riffs on but that would detract from his own work and his ability to put his own stamp on the proceedings. His decision to shoot with a sombre mood and deliberate pace adds to the overall foreboding atmosphere and allows us to effortlessly enter into any given moment. This works the same in identifying with the characters. Their plight and struggle is all the more involving because it feels like we are getting a glimpse into their lives. It also helps that the cast is headed by reliable, and relatively unknown, faces and as the characters are in their teens, the film works as both an urban-legend horror and a dark coming-of-age tale. Their progression to adulthood and their promiscuity also sets up a clever sub-text that courses through the film in terms of sexually transmitted diseases: a reminiscent 80's setting suggesting the AIDS epidemic, in particular, and channels the deadly nature of that disease as it's psychological device. Mitchell's real trump card, however, comes from his use of space and setting up his shots. The background plays a major part in the film as you never know at which moment \"It\" might make an appearance, leaving you to regularly scan the whole frame for any movement.There's an undoubted ambiguity to Mitchell's film and while some may balk at this I, personally, welcomed it as it added another thought provoking layer. It works on many levels. If you're so inclined, you can adopt a metaphorical approach to the proceedings and delve into it's deeper meanings. But then again, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, right? If your not the type of viewer that wishes to explore the metaphors and just want to be entertained then the film can still be enjoyed at face value and works as a chilling and effective horror yarn, nonetheless. With or without mastication.In only his second film (the first being The Myth of the American Sleepover in 2010) there's no denying David Robert Mitchell's commanding handling of events and his ability to stage a real sense of uneasiness. It's an impressive sophomore effort that has given the horror genre a much needed shot in the arm by delivering substantial terrors and retaining a sincerity in its delivery.Mark Walker",

      "review": "  The horror genre has been on a downward slope for the past couple of decades, as remakes and sequels seem to flood the genre more than any other. Every now and then however, a little independent gem makes it's way into a few theatres and then becomes a loved hit on DVD. \"It Follows\" fits the ladder half of that description, being one of the creepiest pictures I have had the pleasure of viewing in a very, very long time. Make Monroe leads this film, and wow does she ever deliver a raw and true performance. She really makes the audience believe that things like this actually could happen \"in someones mind.\" From the work of art that is the cinematography, to the amazingly eerie score that sent chills down my spine in almost every scene, \"It Follows\" has the rare suspense that you just cannot find in horror films today. I was genuinely creeped out during the broad daylight sequences, and that is saying something. Overall, the film could have been pure perfection if it wasn't for the open ending that I think was great, but left a little too much to be desired. In the end, \"It Follows\" is one of the best recent horror flicks you can find on the shelves today. Definitely recommend, especially to fans of the genre.",

      "review": "  Dear Horror genre, Back in the day, nightmares, sleepless nights, and nightlights were invented because of you. Figures were found in my closet and I was left breathing underneath my blanket, sweating, in hopes for \"it\" to go away because of you. Fast forward to today, nothing has resonated with me. You no longer leave me biting my nails away or pulling me towards the edge of my seat. Perhaps age has gotten the best of me, but \"It Follows\" is the best horror movie to have come out since \"The Cabin in the Woods\".However, there's a huge misconception with \"It Follows\": this is not particularly a traditional horror movie. Some say it's a terrifying masterpiece and others say this is dreadfully boring. So then, let's bring clarity to this debate: what makes a scary movie scary? If loud jump scares does your bidding, this movie is not scary. But let's be real -- the horror genre lost its traction a long time ago. Why? Horror movies are completely dependent on jump scares. Screw tension, screw a nightmarish premise, let's throw in that good ol' violin screech. This very dependency raped the contemporary horror genre. As a result, audiences have bought the lie that scary movies are terrifying because of how high you jumped at these jump scares. You're calling that horror? That's just loud sounds.\"It Follows\" combats traditional horror tropes with inventive devices. Coupled with a slow building tension, it's easy to say that \"It Follows\" is more closely identified as a more moody and chilling creeper than a fright-fest of jump scares. But there's no denying it, this film gave me the goosebumps. Kudos to director David Robert Mitchell for always making audiences feel claustrophobic with its smart use of its score and camerawork. Everything from its 360 revolving camerawork that shows something new with every angle, to its lingering shots, \"It Follows\" has perhaps the best cinematography to hit the horror genre ever alongside the impeccable \"The Shining\". But to be exact, this film does more as a film than a popcorn horror flick will ever do. With ambiguous shots and events that are open for debate, \"It Follows\" transcends higher than any \"Paranormal Activity\" movie will ever do. To say the least, I enjoyed this picture more so as an artistic film more so than a horror film.\"It Follows\" has an incredibly creepy premise harnessed with fantastic cinematography and a genuine tension that left me breathless and waiting to learn more. It does not quite reinvent the wheel, but it sure did rejuvenate a dying genre.",

      "review": "  Indie horror is always looking for the Next Big Thing, and at the start of 2015, that movie was It Follows. Coming out of relatively nowhere, the second film by writer/director David Robert Mitchell was dubbed the real deal, and audiences flocked to see what all fuss was over. I would have been intrigued before the positive word-of-mouth namely because Mitchell made one of my favorite films of 2011, the understated and perfectly yearning ode to adolescence, The Myth of the American Sleepover. I dearly hoped that Mitchell was not another flash in the pan. In retrospect, I did not have need to fear. It Follows is unsettling, suspenseful, and borderline ingenious with its concept, but it also has some faults that mitigate its concluding power. Jay (Maika Monroe) is a normal 19-year-old girl going to college in Michigan until the night she sleeps with her object of desire, Hugh (Jake Weary). In her post-coital mediation, he drugs her, ties her to a wheelchair, and then waits. He wants to show her something, or more accurately someone (perhaps something is actually more appropriate). A woman slowly trudges toward them, the embodiment of a curse he passed on to Jay through sex. It will keep following her until it gets her and kills her. The only way she can protect herself is to sleep with someone else, to pass the curse onto a new recipient. Then the monster goes after them; however, once this newest curse-holder is murdered, the monster moves back up the ladder, attacking the next curse-holder. Once you have it, there's no getting rid of this curse, only delaying it. The top question with a horror movie is whether it provides enough suspense, spooks, and scares to jolt an audience, and in this regard It Follows is quite good; not as unsettling as last year's Babadook but still plenty unnerving and extremely well executed and developed. The opening is engrossing, with a teen girl constantly looking in the direction of the camera and clearly scared out of her mind. The camera has adopted the identity of the monster. The central premise is wonderful, rich with thematic potential about the alienation and anxiety of being a teenager navigating the world, but also intriguing enough that I always wanted a large expository info dump scene just to learn more about the rules or its history. Rare is the film, let alone a horror film, where I'm left desiring lengthy exposition. One of the clever developments of its monster is that it can adopt the appearance of anyone, including people close to you (though it rarely does this for an unexplained reason). That means anyone can be your doom and the only way to know is to double-check whether other people can see this menacing phantom as well. Imagine going the rest of your life always having to look over your shoulder, always having a little nagging doubt in your mind about whether or not this person or that person is real. The premise is well developed with sequences that draw out the tension and make us dread what's coming next or what may or may not be real. Now, slow-trotting fully naked people might not be a scarier monster than, say, Leatherface, but it's still alarming. The premise also allows the audience to imagine what course of action they would do if they were stuck in this situation. Would you doom an innocent human being to protect yourself? If so, would you be upfront about it and the ensuing danger? Would you formulate a plan like Hugh and drive long distances to provide further distance? If you thought you were being followed, would you immediately find a sexual partner? The clever premise gets your brain thinking of what you would do to survive and at what cost.There's a distinct Stanley Kubrick and John Carpenter vibe with the filmmaking, which will enhance the overall mood of the film or drive certain viewers crazy. The camera movements fall into very few selections, mostly slow pans, slow zooms, or long tracking shots with the subject routinely framed in the center. It's hard not to evoke feelings with The Shining, an all-time great horror film that likewise built a sense of foreboding terror. You're conditioned to feel that something bad is about to happen as the camera turns or hovers, waiting for the creepy thing to pop around the corner. It plays into second-guessing everything you see, taking away the illusions of safety, and the steady and controlled camerawork enhances this mood. The entire movie feels vaguely out of time, notably a capsule from the 1980s save for one strange inclusion of a wireless reading device. The musical score by Disasterpeace (nee Rick Vreeland) is another throwback to the 80s, and its fuzzy synth-drenched soundtrack smoothly blends in and enhances the atmosphere. If anyone caught Mitchell's previous film, you'll know that besides a wonderful eye for framing visual compositions, the guy has a very natural feel for developing realistic teenage characters milling about their relatable existences. It Follows is no different, and while I would stop short of saying that the characters have depth to them, they are realistically drawn and portrayed by actors who look and act like scared teenagers. The relatablility of unrequited feelings, or going out on a limb and getting your heart broken, of trusting the wrong people who have ulterior motives, is a universal pain that makes it all the easier to put ourselves in these unfortunate character's shoes. It also helps that, up until the final act, the characters defy the arc of rampant stupidity in horror. After realizing the danger she's trapped in, Jay actually seeks out the one person who she can get answers from, even if he's the same person who doomed her with the curse. It's unfortunate that the movie loses steam when it creeps into its third act and forces a solution and showdown with the monster that makes no sense whatsoever. I understand the need to feel like the teens can regain the upper hand or somehow outsmart the curse that doggedly follows them, but with everything presented, it's just not believable. For the entire movie, we've seen that this supernatural force doesn't really have a loophole in its system of rules. The only way to stave off annihilation is to pass it along and create a series of firewalls as protection with other sexual partners. Otherwise, it's relentless and like zombies the eventuality is what helps magnify the sense of dread. We even see it get shot in a hasty defense from the teens and the gunshots do nothing. And yet, this vital information doesn't seem to register with our band of teenagers. Their third act solution (spoilers): they're going to lure the following terror into a pool and... electrocute it. Huh? Why would a supernatural entity that has no shown any weakness to electricity, or any mortal dangers, be able to be killed? This plan makes no sense and not one character voices a counter-argument to what is proven to be a very bad plan. Maybe the point is that it's supposed to be bad, that it's an example of how desperate these characters have become that they would hold out hope for something that is completely inaccurate. After this failed plan, Jay does exactly what you'd expect with the boy who's been itching to jump her bones for the entire movie. He gets what he wants (physical copulation, being the white knight), she gets what she wants (flimsy security), and then the movie just kind of peters out and ends. I understand that Mitchell's extended point is that there is no happy ending possible and the characters will have to uneasily look over their shoulders for the rest of their lives. However, the point could have been made even without the third act. I wish It Follows could have found a better landing than just shrugging and saying, \"Well, what are you gonna do with curses, you know?\"Before the movie hits the skids in the third act, I was pondering the greater implications and logistics of its sexually transmitted curse. Does \"passing\" it along require some form of genital contact? Does it require fluid exchange? If you wear a condom, does the prophylactic also protect your sexual partner from the transmission? Does the curse function relatively the same for same sex couples? What about people with non-functioning parts below the waste? Can someone who suffers from erectile dysfunction pass the curse along? Can it be transferred onto inanimate objects? Can men ejaculate into some sort of container and then send the container into space via the space shuttle and be protected? Actually, banging an astronaut who's about to live on the space station or go to Mars might be the smartest move. I enjoyed thinking of a stratagem to best protect myself if I was caught in this scenario; even after passing it along and providing a buffer, you still always have to be on guard for the curse to move back up the ladder. My solution: have relations with a prostitute. This is probably a guarantee that the curse will be passed on within a 24-hour period, and even if that john is found and killed, chances are this prostitute may have already passed the curse along to a new client. If one cannot inoculate themselves from a supernatural STD-like curse with the aid of prostitutes, then there's no hope for the rest of us poor mortals. Anyway, my mind wandered a tad. It Follows may suffer due to the hype, the inconclusive resolution, and a third act that deflates, but it's still an extremely well executed horror thriller with a terrific concept at heart. The sense of dread is stark and the camerawork and storytelling draw out the tension until you feel you're about to break. It's more unnerving than traditionally scary, but it has a power that does stay with you, particularly its fascinating premise and the natural relatability of the characters and their choices. I don't know if this premise could sustain a sequel, especially with a villain that appears to be unstoppable, but that hasn't thwarted the horror genre before in its stampede at cashing in on success. It Follows is a solidly entertaining and creepy movie, but it's even more confirmation for me that David Robert Mitchell is going to be a filmmaker who has staying power. I'll be following him.

It does just that, with style and infectious synths to spare. Unlike most current horror movies however, Director David Robert Mitchell's film has been meet with near universal praise. Maybe audiences have finally shown a demand for something different! \"It Follows\" is the antithesis to the house that \"Paranormal Activity\" built. An atmospheric, chilling thriller which strictly abides by the old moniker that \"less is more,\" and (surprise) it most definitely is. Also notable is young Actress Maika Monroe. She's a terrific lead who, with \"The Guest\" and now this film, shows all the makings of a potential go-to queen of the genre. She's great. If there's a single issue that some may have with the picture it's that it isn't terrifying. Factoring in the amassed hype, that may be a deal breaker for the more unforgiving. Though the term is broad, \"It Follows\" is scary both thematically and cerebrally, and as effectively horrific in hindsight as any of the persistent urban legends you've ever heard. It gets in your blood and stays there.",

      "review": "  A teenage woman has sex with her boyfriend and then discovers that a shape-shifting demon follows her; if it catches up, she dies.Here is what this film is trying to do: it's trying to send up the horror movie formula of if a female character has sex, she's sure to die. It's trying to be an homage to (or satire of) John Carpenter's original Halloween film.Here is what the film actually accomplishes: it annoys the living shit out of me. The follow shots and heavy-handed music do nothing to add suspense. Rather, they're almost comic in their over-drawn melodrama. And let's talk a while about this demon. What about hand stuff? Does the demon only get transferred with procreative sex? What if she doesn't come? What about lesbian sex? And why is the demon sometimes one shape but other times another? Why is it only occasionally naked? Why did the demon kill everyone else, but when it catches up to our heroine, it only plays with her hair? Why does it have so much trouble with doorknobs but is capable of flying or climbing on a roof, standing there with Osama bin Laden's beard over its dick? I know the film doesn't want to answer these questions, but they're so obvious.Overall, what's being hailed as \"one of the greatest American horror films in years\" is a dumb piece of shit.",

      "review": "  Incredibly disturbing, It Follows is a creepy and atmospheric low-budget indie horror film. An allegory about STDs (in part), the story follows a young girl who, after having sex with her boyfriend, is stalked by a mysterious shapeshifting creature that can only be seen by those who've had sex with an infected person, and it can only be escaped from (for a time) by passing on the infection to another person through sex. Maika Monroe gives a strong performance that's nuanced and really shows her struggle to come to grips with her situation. However, the director makes some odd choices in creating a setting, as it comes off as a strange alternative reality with a mixture of futuristic and retro fashions and technologies (which is quite distracting). Additionally, the creature effects are rather grotesque; with the creature often appearing mangled and in various stages of nudity. A problematic film, It Follows delivers some effective scares, but the who and the what are so vague that the story ends up being rather unsatisfying.",

      "review": "  The majority of modern horror films are cliche; cheap scares that involve something popping up out of nowhere (loudly), whether it's a ghost, a demon, or somebody possessed. So what ever happened to those classic 70's and 80's slasher films where the two kids having sex die first? It Follows reinvents the slasher flick with style, originality, and ultimately quality horror. A girl is given a curse (through sex) which involves a person who could be random or recognizable, to be constantly walking towards her. The only way to get rid of it is to pass it on through sex. Director David Mitchell is secretly mocking the entire teen sex field, when sex-ed teachers warn us of things like STD's and STI's. In a way, this \"curse\" that is passed on in the film is symbolic for kids catching STD's, and it's just as scary to see it unfold in this film as it was when you were first warned about diseases when you were twelve. With a low budget, It Follows succeeds in the utilization of it's simplistic yet effective horror which revolves around great cinematography, mood, and creepiness rather than the cheap scares we've all come to know today. This is one of the most original horror films I've seen in a long time.",

      "review": "  In \"It Follows,\" Jay(Maika Monroe) has sex with her boyfriend Hugh(Jake Weary) for the first time in his car. Afterwards, he drugs her. When she wakes up, she is handcuffed to a chair and he explains that he just passed on a monster to her that will kill her if she does not pass it on to somebody else by having sex with them. In the aftermath, she has trouble taking it all it in with her being so rattled. But then the reality of the situation becomes clear as during class she finds herself stalked by something inexplicable. So, she goes to her friend Paul(Keir Gilchrist) and sister Kelly(Lili Sepe) for help.On the one hand, it would follow that a modern horror movie like \"It Follows\" would have more than its share of cultural mentions, like say 50's science fiction movies, \"Charade\" and Dostoyevsky. Closer to the present, it could also be said that \"It Follows\" resembles \"Buffy, the Vampire Slayer\" as seen through a Stanley Kubrick lens, which is accentuated by an odd electronic score.(And notice how quickly Jay's Scooby Gang comes together.)Even then, \"It Follows\" is a highly creepy horror movie that more than stands on its own. In general, it seeks to explore boundaries of friendship, suburbia(we get a helpful shot of 12 Mile Road at one point to keep track of how far the characters are from Detroit) and between the real world and a darker, more imaginative one.(This would also explain the woman I saw in the cat costume on Fulton Street after the movie.) Thankfully, the movie never tries to explain the doppelganger(for lack of a better word).At the same time, \"It Follows\" not having an ending does not work entirely against it, as it also prevents the narrative from starting to chase its own tail. That's a consequence of the story falling into the some of the same traps that other horror movies have also faced over the years that also allows the audience to begin second guessing the characters. And then there is the movie becoming a little unbalanced by almost being more about Paul than Jay at times which could also be a symptom of the casting.",

      "review": "  THE RING GETS CHLAMYDIA - My Review of IT FOLLOWS (3 Stars)Often pretentious, overly metaphorical, and uneven in pace, IT FOLLOWS is still writer/director David Robert Mitchell's praiseworthy attempt to inject a little originality into the often stale horror genre. Whereas THE RING was built on the premise that a mysterious videotape would bring death to its viewers, IT FOLLOWS promises being haunted by a shape-shifting specter unless you have sex with someone to transfer the target over to them. Think of it as the consequences of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection, but with more horrific symptoms. As allegories go, it's rich with potential, and Mitchell clearly strives to make the most out of it. He works hard with cinematographer Mike Gioulakis to achieve an endlessly fluid shooting style rife with striking, unusual framing. One unfortgettable shot of blood in a swimming pool is almost worth the price of admission alone. Add a heavy 80s-style synth score, a strange, timeless, quasi-70s/80s production design that mixes cell phones with rabbit ear televisions, old rusty cars, a zonked-out, naturalistic acting style exhibited by its young cast, and the strangest clamshell cameo Kindle device that has never existed, and you're entering John Carpenter Land by way of Terrence Malick. The Malick reference gets its due in not only the unforced, elliptical way our characters converse but in choices Mitchell makes, such as concentrating on a shot of our heroine's hand grazing grass and flowers during a particularly quiet moment right before something awful occurs.The film opens strong, with a twirling 360 degree shot of a young girl racing out of her home dressed in bra, panties and high heels. She's being chased by something unseen and before you know it, she meets an unexpectedly grisly fate. From here, we meet our heroine, Jay (Maika Monroe), who looks like the the product of a fourgy between Kelly Clarkson, Kat Dennings, Reese Witherspoon and Chloe Sevigny, as she wades in her backyard, above ground pool. This is one laid back teen. She's so laconic, she can't even be bothered to shoo an ant crawling across her arm. It's suburban Detroit and Jay's life consists of being observed by her horny pre-teen neighbors, drinking with her friends and family, and dating an easygoing guy. It's at this date where things go seriously and irrevocably wrong. I won't spoil the plot much further, but the aftermath of some backseat sex isn't anywhere close to what Jay imagined. In most horror films, you pay for having sex. Here, sex is the only way out. IT FOLLOWS really turns up the creep factor after this initial sexual encounter, with a shocking cut to the next scene. It seems to be Mitchell's terror equivalent to finding out your partner just intentionally infected you with an STI. With Jay dumped back home looking like a rape victim, those closest to her rally by her side to help her escape her fate. In an almost silent performance, Monroe must convey fear and a certain guilt for the rest of the film. There are a few good scares of the \"jump out of your seat when somebody goes 'Boo!' variety\" and a few haunting scenes where she's being stalked. The framing of the shots truly helps these sequences flourish as you're made to look around constantly to discover the predator. Knowing the threat could be coming from anywhere is part of this movie's simmering tension. Additionally, like a diagnosis of syphilis, our main character has a tough time disclosing what's happening to her. Unfortunately, there's not much else to the film. Our leads run and run and run, stopping sometimes to have sex until they come up with a plan to conquer this \"thing\". Although visually stunning, that big sequence doesn't make a lot of sense, and it feels like the rules changed slightly to justify what happens. Ultimately, it feels like the film is a little light on incident and lacks a satisfying resolution, ending up feeling like a light campfire story instead of a big, hearty meal. More haunting than scary and more metaphor than fleshed-out storytelling, IT FOLLOWS is an admiral homage. Rich Vreeland's score is an acquired taste. It booms in almost every frame in a way that reminded me of Christopher Nolan's DARK KNIGHT and is highly evocative of the score from HALLOWEEN. It feels intentional and will either feel like a propulsive addition to the storytelling (my feeling) or annoy the hell out of you. Same goes with the odd, can't-place-it time in which the story is set. For me, it kept me engaged in the film, with its vague, hazy memories of a time where we would have to talk with each other instead of texting. Others will find it to be a pretentious conceit. Fair enough, but love it or hate it, IT FOLLOWS has a lot on its mind and Mitchell clearly wants to establish a new, methodical voice in film storytelling.",

      "review": "  An original concept with strong execution, It Follows represents the rare horror film that departs from formula and injects something new to the genre. In the film a teenager inexplicably finds herself followed by an entity that won't let her go and can't easily be shaken. Director David Robert Mitchell delivers a film that excels at methodical storytelling. There are no cheap scares, no contrived sequences, and no overtly predictable moments. It's a film that, assuming you get in to the premise, is chilling and also engaging. A film that respects the audience's attention span, and one that has an appreciation for earned scares, and earned horror.The acting is good, though not great, a seemingly rather low budget affair. The methodical pace does get a bit slow and things are never as fleshed out as they should be. Yet that's also part of the fun, this is a horror film that doesn't immediately bog you down with exposition and 'rules' rather revels in the inexplicable nature of it all.4/5 Stars",

      "review": "  Intelligent, entertaining, and effectively scary, It Follows might ape some classic '80s thrillers, but it's a masterstroke of modern horror cinema all of its own. Sure, we've seen virginal teens stalked by homicidal maniacs but never by the stigma of losing one's virginity. This young adult rite of passage proves scary and anxiety-inducing enough without a lead-footed specter attached to it! The title boasts a true Truth in Advertising moment, with this sex-related affliction passed along in the form of a form-changing foot-dragger who never stops moving toward the protagonist. The material works on many levels but stops short of becoming too Meta because it is - at its jackrabbit-paced heart - a brilliantly staged straight-ahead horror flick. It makes you think but not too much because it would take away the fist-pumping fun of having the Bejesus scared out of you. With long takes and synthesized music that would feel at home on USA's Up All Night 30 years ago, It Follows waxes nostalgic but somehow feels timeless. The rotating faces of the unknown terror makes for a monster for the ages, especially considering the fact that the chased (not chaste, mind you) find themselves in a particularly vexing and highly emotional time of their lives. Judgement and comeuppance comes from any direction in an unrecognizable form as your hormones are red-lining? Scary beyond belief.In this R-rated horror flick, a young woman (Monroe) gets followed by an unknown supernatural force after getting involved in a sexual encounter. With an ace cast filled with fresh faced actors devoid of big names and marquee faces, John Robert Mitchell's lean atmospheric thriller nails the genre with every terrifying beat. It Follows looks cheap but the exquisitely staged frights are top shelf. Plus, it takes a skilled hand to make a digital flick purposely look like an 80s video rental creature feature. Youll follow this horror gem anywhere. Bottom line: Teenage Wraith-Land",

      "review": "  For a change, a newer horror movie that not only lives up to the hype, but surpasses it. This movie is very scary, and for the first times in years, succeeded at making me squirm a few times. Sure there are plot holes as some have gone out of their way to shout out, but at the end of the day, this is a horror, and what successful horror doesn't ask you to take a leap of faith along the way? Hence that argument is just plain absurd to me. If you want to hate a movie and find things wrong with it, there isn't a single movie in the world that can stop you from doing so.There's so much about this movie to like: Maika Monroe, wow... wowow... she does a stunning job at making the viewer feel as uncomfortable as she feels in the movie; the entire cast adds up to substantially more than just the sum of their parts - their friendship and concern for each other is extremely genuine; the soundtrack and score is amazing, a perfect fit for the plot and what's occurring on-screen. Overall, everything about this movie is fun and scary, and exactly what the movie promises you it will deliver. Bravo!",

      "review": "  El director David Roger Mitchell nos presenta una extra�a cinta de terror desarrollada en un universo peculiar en el que los adolescentes ven pel�culas cl�sicas por televisores est�ndar, asisten a cines de barrio con m�sica de �rgano en vivo y leen a Dostoyevski en espejos cosm�ticos similares a un Kindle. Adem�s, claro est�, tambi�n tienen sexo sin protecci�n. En \"It Follows\", el terror surge cuando un joven, despu�s de tener sexo con su pareja ocasional, le informa que le ha transmitido una terrible maldici�n, la cual solo se podr� superar si ella tiene sexo con otra persona. Mitchell sabe muy bien que los cuentos de hadas y las pel�culas de terror muchas veces funcionan como advertencias a su p�blico. Y esta pel�cula, que se encuentra en un punto medio entre el kitsch y el avant-garde, es una advertencia (c�nica o no) sobre los peligros de las enfermedades ven�reas, disfrazada de cinta de terror sobrenatural. \"It Follows\" es una trabajo pretencioso que realmente no llega a funcionar, pero la fotograf�a sugerente, su experticia visual y sus momentos aut�nticamente aterradores, la ponen por encima de toda la basura que actualmente se presenta en cartelera disfrazada como \"cine de terror\".",

      "review": "  How this movie gets 97 is beyond me. How so many people think this movie is good is even more puzzling. What is good about it? In my opinion it looked like a sub par student film. Please explain to me why 90% of the camera shots had to be a zoom, pan, tilt, dolly/tracking shot? Is it because the movie is called \"It Follow\" so the camera has to 'follow' all the characters? If so, that may sound clever, but it just seemed well overdone, plus it made the movie's pacing even slower than it already was. And thats another thing...slowest...movie...ever!So what are the rules? We know Freddy can only get you in your sleep, Jason cant do water, dont watch the tape and The Ring girl can't get you, etc. What are the rules of \"It\" other than banging someone else to pass it off to them? We don't know. And that, for lack of a better word, is stupid.But how do we even know that rule? Hugh tells Jay. But how did he find out? He said he didnt remember the girl he got it from, so who told him? If I'm just sitting there minding my business and notice someone walking towards me REALLY, REALLY SLOWLY, I may think its weird, I may think its creepy, I may even run away. But under no circumstances will it just pop into my head that this person is following cuz i just screwed that chick. And even further from my consideration would be sleeping with someone else so that it starts following her and not me.And what the hell year is it supposed to be? Old ass tvs, old ass phone, but cell phones (girl in the beginning), and that weird makeup ereader thing seemed like something relatively current. I'll give it to them that its somewhat original, but it made no sense at all. The kids never have an actual plan of attack. Why not just go to Japan or something. The thing is so damn slow that by the time it walked there you'd be like 90 and wouldnt give a shit anymore.I was honestly expecting this movie to score in the 30s, maybe...MAYBE in the 40s. But 97!

The film is marked as horror, but really it seems to have as much comedy as horror to me - in other words, this isn't about to be the start of a franchise such as a Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Candyman, or numerous other horror flicks. It's more horror to the main character and a couple of her friends. The audience? Not so much. To be blunt, I personally considered this as much comedy as horror, and for the \"critics consensus\" about it being terrifying? Hardly. Worth seeing as a rental, but really not that frightening.",

      "review": "  It Follows is hardly a scary film in my mind. There couple disturbing scenes perhaps, but it cushions the threatened protagonist by always keeping her company with her friends. This is not a film that uses isolation to its advantage for suspense. The menace doesn't care. But how the 'it' manifests itself is irrelevant, it's a coming-of-age film using a stalking terror as an allegory for the anxieties of adulthood. Sure, it could also be about sexually transmitted diseases given its teenage cast and the method of the monster, but the beauty of It Follows is that it works for any interpretation. The former is the one that resonated with me the most, hinted in an early scene where the protagonist hangs out with who later becomes the person who gives her 'it.' There's an odd nostalgia about it, conjured by the vibrant cinematography and retro score, but Mitchell keeps it fresh. The only misstep is the misconceived third act where the characters are essentially asking for the trouble they receive but the humanistic approach Maika Monroe takes to her character saves it from feeling too removed. So in other words this film was amazing. Scary and gritty but most of all real. A total change from the run of the mill middle class American movies.",

      "review": "  It Follows follows Jay, an attractive girl on the verge of her twenty's who sleeps with her boyfriend and contracts a demon as a result (your parents were right about premarital sex kids!)The demon takes the form of people, some of whom she knows or has known, and stalks her relentlessly, intent on killing her for her naughtiness. Now a synopsis such as this can curve one of two ways. Either this is a tongue in cheek horror-com, sardonically wagging its finger at the 'dangers' of flippant teen sex. Equal parts Scream and Cabin Fever perhaps. Or it's a horror that takes itself seriously and truly wants to frighten, but fails, as a result of its silly premise. Amazingly however, It Follows subverts both of these possible routes by being something else entirely. It's a real horror film, with real horror. And while it's message of 'the only way to avoid the demon is to abstain from intercourse' is within the narrative perineum arch of the film itself, it isn't concerned with preaching or educating anyone on anything outside of how to make a really good chiller. David Robert Mitchell is a filmmaker you've never heard of but I suspect will be heard a lot more of in the years to come. He makes films in and about Detroit and while It Follows is his first wide release, it isn't his first turn at the helm of the great ship celluloid. You can tell watching this film that Mitchell had a hell of a ball making it. It's technically interesting without being needlessly flashy. It's visually inventive without being ostentatious, which it had the ability to be if it so chose. If this film were made by Paul Thomas Anderson, the technical prowess that resides in abundance within his frame would have been distracting and off putting. You can tell that Mitchell, while commanding enough knowhow to comfortably move around within his frame, is still feeling his way around it as well, which adds an innocence to the picture that fits this particular tale well. Another big part of this film's effectiveness lies in its musical makeup. Composer Rich Vreeland, according to IMDb, is another relative newbie in the film scene, but his angry strings and neo-nostalgic bursts of synth crunch, grind through the picture, punctuating the dread that a film about demons stalking virgin-less teens asks for, no, demands. If a nude, hell spawn representation of a loved one walking toward you with a murderous glint in their eye isn't enough to creep a crawly up your arm, Vreeland is sure to remind you every time. Without doubt It Follows is a fiercely original film. But it also owes a great debt to the films it exists, at least in part, as a tribute to. Namely, Halloween. In fact, the film comes close to being a remake of that 1978 classic on a number of occasions. The music, the undead demon stalk, the naughty, frisky teens, the sheer relentlessness of the chase. And the look. The characters don't mention Detroit until the end of the film, but what other American city could it be? The neighbourhoods look like drab, forgotten relics of a more hopeful, prosperous time. Others look positively post apocalyptic. Whole city blocks abandoned and left to rot within their own skeletal structures. A city that failed its residents, and whose residents, as a result, left behind in search of greener metropolitan pastures. The exact year, or indeed, decade, of It Follows is also a bit of an enigma. The characters are dressed in modern clothing, but their houses are decorated in the faded earth tones of the 70's and the back projected televisions of the 80's. Some the cars are 2000-somethings, but there isn't a cell phone in sight, even when it would make most sense for the character to use one. And the aforementioned hollowed out city of Detroit itself is a shell representative of its modern bleak landscape, rather than the more fruitful years of twenty and thirty years ago. But while this dichotomy of time and place fits the story well, and harkens it to its genre defining forebears, it doesn't really matter when or where It Follows stalks its prey. What matters is that this film is cool, creepy, smart, brutal, sick, slick and exciting in all the ways horror films should be. It's got good acting, characters you'll care about, and ends just the way I was hoping it would. It Follows joins the likes of House of the Devil, The Innkeepers, The Conjuring and The Babadook in taking its cues from the slashers and the haunters of the second golden age of the grotesque in the 70's and 80's, rather than the over the top exploitation and swish boom cheese we usually see hit horror screens these days. It almost makes you wish one of these young filmmaking wunderkinds would resurrect Freddy Fingernails for one last slash of the throat...",

      "review": "  Woof I definitely let these posts pile up a little too much here... Honestly, I saw this like 3 weeks ago... hereeeee we go.Pro tip: see this movie at night, away from home, alone and then you can experience the real dread the film leaves you with. Having to walk home down 4 darkened blocks, the fear sinks in and you start glancing over your shoulder every couple steps. I was outrageously blown away by this movie: the premise is so simple, and yet so strikingly strong for a suspense horror. This film IS suspense. The monster just follows you until it catches you? How can there be a more suspenseful plot anywhere?? The suspense game has been won, not by Hitchcock, but by It Follows.The other huge success of this film is it's indie release, which has been discussed time and time again. A young no-name cast - the film stands on its own as an excellent piece of filmmaking, which is increasingly difficult in this cinematic day and age. It definitely deserves whatever acclaim it has received.I was mostly blown away by just how creepy the entire movie is; it opens on someone getting got and anyone walking is now a source of fear and suspicion. The set up is short and sweet and the movie gets right into it. The set pieces are simple and timeless - this movie will come to haunt audiences for years to come. See this anyway you can!",

Her patronizing boss(Nobuyuki Katsube) has her take care of his dry cleaning and other demeaning tasks. In response, she spits in his coffee. In her spare time, she takes care of her pet rabbit and defends herself by phone to her interfering mother. That leaves plenty of time to watch the movie 'Fargo' over and over. Not for any aesthetic reason mind you but to look for clues for buried treasure.\"Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter\" is an offbeat and engaging character study, about somebody who is not so much searching for something but running away from multiple somethings. And can you really blame her? While Kumiko's actions might be hard to sympathize with at times, remember how malleable reality can be at others, especially with this movie being inspired by a true story. 'Fargo' itself is a complete fiction that claims to be a true story before it starts. And 'Shogun' which is also referenced is historical fiction.",

      "review": "  It would be one thing if the filmmakers, David Zellner (director) and brother/co-writer Nathan Zellner, were coming up with the idea for Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter out of whole cloth. It's certainly one of the best 'hooks' (or as the industry calls then 'loglines') in many years: a young woman from Tokyo is obsessed with the scene from Fargo where Steve Buscemi hides the suitcase full of money by the fence, buried in the snow, and never comes back for it. Naturally, as she assumes from the opening title card telling the audience 'This is Based on a True Story' that the suitcase is still there, and goes to Fargo to find it. The thing that makes things even wilder to find out (though this is after the film ends) that while the Coen brothers' Fargo is not based on a true case (it was their sort of satire of movies that do the 'true story' for artistic license), Kumiko, strangely enough, is.According to IMDb, a woman naked Takako Konishi actually watched the movie Fargo and went out to try and find it. At least, that's the extent to which the movie and real life connect. Perhaps the Zellners took license from there; certainly it would seem to make sense, but they take this true event (from a not-true event from the film) and use it as a way of jumping off into a character study of this rather lonely woman. Or, one should say, she's perhaps alone but not exactly lonely - except for one aspect involving her rabbit, which should be addressed - as she has this movie to give her hope outside of her dreary job and inquisitive mother.She is not interested in meeting a man or getting married or having kids. In the one of the few moments we get some character development, we see that she considers herself a \"Spanish Conquistador\" going to \"The New World\" (this actually pops up as the title card when she arrives in Minnesota). So she makes a decision one day, not exactly on a whim but after what seems to be much thought (and going through the possible tragedy of a torn VHS tape - how she finds the tape is never explained, same with the ending, but more on that in a moment), and leaves her rabbit on a subway car. This last part - the bunny is Bunzo, can't forget that - seems oddly sad, just by nature of this character having a pet its cared for and now the pet's no longer there. Plus, it's a cute bunny after all.There's a bit of culture clash - apparently there's no one who's Japanese up in Minnesota/North Dakota, Kumiko knows very little English, and the one helpful Deputy in town (played by director Zellner) thinks a worker at a Chinese restaurant can help translate. There's a few moments of sort of awkward comedy here, which if I had to be honest were the parts that worked for me the least. Maybe this is where the Alexander Payne connection comes in (he's executive producer here), and there's one character in particular that seems air-lifted out of a Payne film into Kumiko's journey. But it's ultimately about what Kumiko is going and how she is going to get there. It's predictable stuff to see these sort of folks in this environment, even as it is refreshing to see a police officer depicted as just a straight-shooting, caring person like the Deputy here.This concept could have been delivered in a few ways. This could have gone even more into meta terrain based on the 'real' 'fake' real' 'fake' sort of play at work, or even been more exuberant or crazy; certainly, when one hears about this idea for a story, it has to come down to execution. I think those who hear about it like that may be thrown off or even disappointed by what Kumiko the Treasure Hunter is. It's much more of a film about its own sense of magic realism, that this indicator of treasure is discovered one day in a cave off of a beach (why is she there, what for, who knows it's there), and then when the ending comes, which, spoiler, she DOES find the suitcase in the snow (with Bunzo present), it feels like it's gone off from reality.Is this in her head? I think its ambiguity is not unearned but part of a kind of dreamy logic that is really all about a dreamer. It's most telling that Werner Herzog has a glowing recommendation on the front of the blu-ray; many of his films deal with people trying to find something great that is beyond them, yet the vehicle of cinematic expression itself makes things more realer than reality, that it carries on an extra dimension for an audience member (i.e. Aguirre as an actual Conquistador, or Fitzcarraldo with the ship, or Stroszek, also set in the North Mid-West, which I thought of a few times). It's a downright Herzogian trip, and the lead Rikku Kiuchi (you may recall from Babel and Pacific Rim) is outstanding in scenes where she has to also play it (and even wear that red hood, a fairy tale character with a blanket-shield) as ambiguously as the writers have it: is she crazy? Is she a little 'off'? Who's to say?I don't think the filmmakers ever judge her for a moment, and that's why this story works - on the contrary, if anything she is practically lifted to mythic status, and it will deliver different things depending on the audience watching. Do you want a sad ending or happy ending? Should a dreamer like Kumiko get what she's after? Like the film that Kumiko is obsessing over, it's never quite so clear.",

But much like the movie that served as inspiration for our main charactr and obviously to the filmmakers...the idea of the \"True Story\" is not as essential as the quality of a unique story they wished to tell. Now, this isn't \"Fargo,\" but it is a pretty cool unique film that doesn't look or feel like most films I've seen out lately. Even if it isn't the best film at least it has that going for it.",

It's a cute trope, but I lost interest after too long watching this waif shuffle in a blanket through the snows of the frigid north.

I typically punch in the numbers as soon as possible after watching the film but when I look back I cannot question my attributions. Kumiko is an interesting film about a woman who clearly has some sense of mental illness, probably depression, and becomes entranced with the idea of seeking out and finding the buried treasure from the Coen Bros. film Fargo.The lowest scoring attribute, in my opinion, is the editing. There are times that the film lags on and I feel it could be re-organized to work a little better. It is a good movie, and I expect to watch it again down the line, but I don't really think it is for everyone.",

She is going to find the treasure that the \"Fargo\"-character that Steve Buscemi played buried in snow in the mentioned film. She hates her job and her family, she has no friends. She cares for a little rabbit, but that's about it. She seem like a lonely girl that struggles with her mental state among other things. Her plan is the only thing that matters.This is a great plot. Original and very refreshing! It's based on true events too, that's pretty interesting, even if there never was a treasure hunt going on in the real life story. It looks nice and it got some superb moments. It forces me to hang on to it as we are in for a ride. \"The Octopus Project\" lifts the film with their nice, experimental instrumentals that are layed over the shots.Entertaining film, driven by the very interesting lead. Great acted, lovely shot - spiced with humour and weirdness. It's close to be totally solid and superb, but the true emotions stays out and I feel left out from some mysteries that I really want to know more about.8 out of 10 \"95\" pages.",

Still, if you are in the mood to let this wash over you, it has its pleasures.",

      "review": "  It would be one thing if the filmmakers, David Zellner (director) and brother/co-writer Nathan Zellner, were coming up with the idea for Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter out of whole cloth. It's certainly one of the best 'hooks' (or as the industry calls then 'loglines') in many years: a young woman from Tokyo is obsessed with the scene from Fargo where Steve Buscemi hides the suitcase full of money by the fence, buried in the snow, and never comes back for it. Naturally, as she assumes from the opening title card telling the audience 'This is Based on a True Story' that the suitcase is still there, and goes to Fargo to find it. The thing that makes things even wilder to find out (though this is after the film ends) that while the Coen brothers' Fargo is not based on a true case (it was their sort of satire of movies that do the 'true story' for artistic license), Kumiko, strangely enough, is.According to IMDb, a woman naked Takako Konishi actually watched the movie Fargo and went out to try and find it. At least, that's the extent to which the movie and real life connect. Perhaps the Zellners took license from there; certainly it would seem to make sense, but they take this true event (from a not-true event from the film) and use it as a way of jumping off into a character study of this rather lonely woman. Or, one should say, she's perhaps alone but not exactly lonely - except for one aspect involving her rabbit, which should be addressed - as she has this movie to give her hope outside of her dreary job and inquisitive mother.She is not interested in meeting a man or getting married or having kids. In the one of the few moments we get some character development, we see that she considers herself a \"Spanish Conquistador\" going to \"The New World\" (this actually pops up as the title card when she arrives in Minnesota). So she makes a decision one day, not exactly on a whim but after what seems to be much thought (and going through the possible tragedy of a torn VHS tape - how she finds the tape is never explained, same with the ending, but more on that in a moment), and leaves her rabbit on a subway car. This last part - the bunny is Bunzo, can't forget that - seems oddly sad, just by nature of this character having a pet its cared for and now the pet's no longer there. Plus, it's a cute bunny after all.There's a bit of culture clash - apparently there's no one who's Japanese up in Minnesota/North Dakota, Kumiko knows very little English, and the one helpful Deputy in town (played by director Zellner) thinks a worker at a Chinese restaurant can help translate. There's a few moments of sort of awkward comedy here, which if I had to be honest were the parts that worked for me the least. Maybe this is where the Alexander Payne connection comes in (he's executive producer here), and there's one character in particular that seems air-lifted out of a Payne film into Kumiko's journey. But it's ultimately about what Kumiko is going and how she is going to get there. It's predictable stuff to see these sort of folks in this environment, even as it is refreshing to see a police officer depicted as just a straight-shooting, caring person like the Deputy here.This concept could have been delivered in a few ways. This could have gone even more into meta terrain based on the 'real' 'fake' real' 'fake' sort of play at work, or even been more exuberant or crazy; certainly, when one hears about this idea for a story, it has to come down to execution. I think those who hear about it like that may be thrown off or even disappointed by what Kumiko the Treasure Hunter is. It's much more of a film about its own sense of magic realism, that this indicator of treasure is discovered one day in a cave off of a beach (why is she there, what for, who knows it's there), and then when the ending comes, which, spoiler, she DOES find the suitcase in the snow (with Bunzo present), it feels like it's gone off from reality.Is this in her head? I think its ambiguity is not unearned but part of a kind of dreamy logic that is really all about a dreamer. It's most telling that Werner Herzog has a glowing recommendation on the front of the blu-ray; many of his films deal with people trying to find something great that is beyond them, yet the vehicle of cinematic expression itself makes things more realer than reality, that it carries on an extra dimension for an audience member (i.e. Aguirre as an actual Conquistador, or Fitzcarraldo with the ship, or Stroszek, also set in the North Mid-West, which I thought of a few times). It's a downright Herzogian trip, and the lead Rikku Kiuchi (you may recall from Babel and Pacific Rim) is outstanding in scenes where she has to also play it (and even wear that red hood, a fairy tale character with a blanket-shield) as ambiguously as the writers have it: is she crazy? Is she a little 'off'? Who's to say?I don't think the filmmakers ever judge her for a moment, and that's why this story works - on the contrary, if anything she is practically lifted to mythic status, and it will deliver different things depending on the audience watching. Do you want a sad ending or happy ending? Should a dreamer like Kumiko get what she's after? Like the film that Kumiko is obsessing over, it's never quite so clear.",

But much like the movie that served as inspiration for our main charactr and obviously to the filmmakers...the idea of the \"True Story\" is not as essential as the quality of a unique story they wished to tell. Now, this isn't \"Fargo,\" but it is a pretty cool unique film that doesn't look or feel like most films I've seen out lately. Even if it isn't the best film at least it has that going for it.",

I typically punch in the numbers as soon as possible after watching the film but when I look back I cannot question my attributions. Kumiko is an interesting film about a woman who clearly has some sense of mental illness, probably depression, and becomes entranced with the idea of seeking out and finding the buried treasure from the Coen Bros. film Fargo.The lowest scoring attribute, in my opinion, is the editing. There are times that the film lags on and I feel it could be re-organized to work a little better. It is a good movie, and I expect to watch it again down the line, but I don't really think it is for everyone.",

She is going to find the treasure that the \"Fargo\"-character that Steve Buscemi played buried in snow in the mentioned film. She hates her job and her family, she has no friends. She cares for a little rabbit, but that's about it. She seem like a lonely girl that struggles with her mental state among other things. Her plan is the only thing that matters.This is a great plot. Original and very refreshing! It's based on true events too, that's pretty interesting, even if there never was a treasure hunt going on in the real life story. It looks nice and it got some superb moments. It forces me to hang on to it as we are in for a ride. \"The Octopus Project\" lifts the film with their nice, experimental instrumentals that are layed over the shots.Entertaining film, driven by the very interesting lead. Great acted, lovely shot - spiced with humour and weirdness. It's close to be totally solid and superb, but the true emotions stays out and I feel left out from some mysteries that I really want to know more about.8 out of 10 \"95\" pages.",

The first part is in Japan and it was in Japanese with English subtitles. I don't like reading subtitles but there wasn't much dialog so it wasn't so bad. The second part is in America (Minnesota, North Dakota) and is in English, this was much nicer for me :) To begin with I liked the look of this film. I thought it was very beautiful almost every scene I found attractive and engaging I wanted to travel to these spots and see them for myself.I haven't ever really fit in anywhere. I don't really understand people and they don't understand me. I have spent most of my life alone and afraid trying to find that one magic bullet that will make everything alright. Sometimes I think that it is all just a nightmare and I will wake up to my big house and my loving family. But there isn't any magic bullet and when I wake there isn't any reprieve.I loved Kumiko (the character). On the outside I thought that she was as lovely as the movie itself. On the inside I could very easily identify with her struggles. Things were going wrong for her and she didn't know how to fix them. She was hurting people and she didn't want to.... and she couldn't stop. But then she heard of a silver bullet that could make all the pain go away. She went on an incredible trek in an effort to set everything right. I'm not going to tell you if it worked or not.... I will tell you that if you are open to this type of experience then this particular movie will melt your heart.",

      "review": "  Brett Morgen (The Kid Stays In The Picture) uses archival footage, notes, drawings, and unseen home videos to bring to light the life and times of Kurt Cobain, the legendary singer/guitarist for the band Nirvana. We get a very intimate glimpse of the beloved musician from his early years all the way up to 1994, when he tragically took his own life at the age of 27. Having seen other documentaries produced on Nirvana and Cobain, I couldn't help feel that they were more idol-worship and spent less time focusing on the troubled life this man had. So, I was surprised and in some cases shocked with how much of his past they discussed. The use of home video footage to show how drug addiction drastically changed his mental and physical state, it was extremely upsetting to see. I grew up listening to these guys! Kurt was a gifted songwriter and musician. So, to get this level of intimacy and detail about his life. To see the events that made him the way he was. It was impressive that someone was able to put a documentary together that felt less like a love letter and more of a character study. I think it is the only real way you can effectively tell this story and they did it very well. On top of all this! Morgen utilized the incredible animation skills of Stefan Nadelman and Hisko Hulsing, to bring to life drawings done by Kurt. As well as, brilliantly bringing to life major events in the young Cobain's life. Which included his family troubles and his musical beginnings. The only issue I really had with the film was the exclusion of Dave Grohl, whose omission was a choice the director made. I felt it would have given the film a little more. But, ultimately I had no major issues with this documentary. It is very well done! The animated sequences alone make this worth your time. Even if you don't like Kurt Cobain! This is a great character study that doesn't pull any punches as it focuses on the events that both made and ultimately destroyed an extremely talented musician.",

      "review": "  I will start off by saying, you don't have to be a huge Nirvana fan to appreciate this documentary. I for one am a fan of NIrvana and Kurt Cobain, not a fanatic like some people who grew up in the 90s, but I did enjoy their music. Personally I am more of a metal fan loving bands like Pantera, Kreator, and Slayer. I always respected Nirvana, because even though their music was pretty simple and most of the songs just use the same chords and a lot of distortion, they helped rid the universe of moronic \"hair metal\" and \"glam metal\" bands. Bands like Poison and Warrant with their cheesy rock ballads in the 80s were so ready to be gone, they just needed a little push, and Nirvana gave them that push. And behind Nirvana came good bands like Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, Stone Temple Pilots etc... It was kind of an explosion of everything anti-hair metal. No longer was it clubs on the sunset strip with bands dressing up like women and fans of those bands also dressing up like women, wearing lipstick and putting a lot of hairspray in their hair, honestly it was disgraceful and one of the worst trends that music ever went through in my opinion. So to see it be destroyed by Nirvana and Kurt Cobain was a beautiful thing to me. It was now dress however you want, and let out all the aggression you have inside your body. But on to the documentary. Music documentaries are really hit or miss, it is rare that you are going to see a music documentary that you will enjoy if you are not a fan of the subject the movie is about. VH1's Behind The Music series was pretty good for a little bit when it first started out, doing short mini documentaries on musicians, but even now they are horrible. I saw a Behind the Music on the likes of 50 Cent, Pink and Neyo. Music acts that haven't really even been out that long at all, surely not long enough to warrant a Behind The Music. Just seems rather stupid to me. But Montage of Heck you can enjoy without being a fan of Kurt Cobain. This isn't only a film about the man in Nirvana, but also a pretty strong showing of what drugs will do to you. It does not matter how rich or famous you are, if you are a drug addict, you are equal to everyone else that is a drug addict as well. Being someone who has struggled with addiction in the past, I felt really connected with Kurt Cobain in this documentary. I know some people will say it was almost a little too much to watch him just crumble in front of your eyes as the movie progresses, but guess what, people need to see stuff like this. For too long has the world kind of hid their eyes from drug addiction. Just thinking it is a bunch of losers and down and out junkies who do nothing for society. When in reality, people of all races, sex, class, religion, rich, poor etc are affected by this. This is a great documentary that really takes you truly behind the scenes at one of the more mysterious figures in music. Yes, he is beloved to this day after committing suicide. But its amazing to watch a guy who pretty much had everything he could ever ask for. A family, money, fame, anything he could ever imagine, and he was just flat out miserable regardless of all of it, mostly do to his long time heroin addiction. I don't think Cobain is a musical genius by any means, but he's a polarizing personality and an innovative musician nonetheless. I just wish he would have truly committed to getting the help he needed because its clear as day that he was crying for help.",

      "review": "  Brett Morgen writes and directs Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck. The film focuses on the life of Kurt Cobain, and does not venture much into the aspects of Nirvana. The film starts off with footage of his childhood as well as interviews from his family. Its clear that his troubled teen years led to much of the angst present in his music. The film somewhat loses the documentary sense and becomes more of a myriad of imagery, and splicing together montages to construct what may have been going though his life. Footage of his wife Love also ensues, and the focus of the film really shifts to that relationship. Those looking for more a music based documentary will be disappointed as this film really only mentions the albums being made in passing. The film does not attempt at all to look at the impact or legacy of his life past his death. Overall Montage of Heck is worth watching for any Kurt Cobain or Nirvana fan, but I felt the film had a bit more fluff with the imagery and montage aspects as an artistic film rather than a documentary.",

      "review": "  My first memory of Nirvana was in early April, 1994. I was ten years old. I was at school and we had 'library time' with the kids in my class and class above ours. I came in and saw a group of kids sitting around one of those big, grey, rectangular tape decks with a pair of coil corded, oversized black headphones attached. They were all squeezed together listening to a tape one of them brought in. I came over and asked what was up. One of the older kids handed me the headphones and said 'this guy just blew his head off' (kids are great at exaggerating to induce shock effect). I put the headphones on and 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' was blaring out of them. I had never heard of Nirvana before, never heard the song before, but two seconds in I was hooked. As I grew older and became more educated on the whole Cobain legend, my fascination with this band, and this person in particular, was one of both awe, that someone could be so talented and write songs that were so good, and dark fascination at this person's train wreck of a life. And I wasn't alone. During his life, Cobain was a fascinating figure, for all the right and wrong reasons, and in his death, his legend firmly embedded in the annuls of rock and roll history, his dichotomy laden and troubled personality is part of one of the most interesting stories in popular music. Although there have been a number of doc's on Cobain and Nirvana and their music, Montage of Heck is the first 'authorized' examination of Cobain's life on film. This means his family has allowed maverick documentarian Brett Morgan total access to the Cobain archives, so to speak. And this film is chock full of audio clips, musical sound bites, televised interviews and home videos which attempt to bare all of Cobain in an attempt to better understand him. And it works, for the most part. His mother had the great foresight to compile hours upon hours of home videos of him from birth to stardom. His wife took over where his mother left off, compiling hours upon hours of home videos of him in the thick of his stardom. These are the most disturbing aspect of the film. More so than the twisted drawings and manic depressive ramblings in his notebooks, the wall of horror movie sound collages he compiled on tape recorders and the smear campaign of media reports that attempted to show the world he and his wife were little more than self destructive junkies, it's the home videos that create the biggest impact. Such as an impossibly skinny Kurt doting on his daughter, playing with her and making her laugh and lavishing love on her. And in another scene a few minutes later nodding out in a heroin daze with her on his lap while Courtney Love attempts to give her her first haircut, while admonishing him for being high in front of his daughter. You see, in these sad clips and the interviews he was doing and the skyrocketing success of the band and the exaggerated reports in the media, a man deteriorating in front of your eyes. It's difficult to watch. As we're led through Cobain's short life, a small group of people connected to him throughout give interviews. This includes his mother, his wife, his sister, an old girlfriend (the one he famously wrote 'About A Girl' for), his semi-estranged father and Krist Novaselic. There is no Dave Grohl. Some people have wondered about this and assumed, as the doc was done with the complete support and cooperation of Courtney Love, that Grohl didn't participate due to his (to say the least) difficult relationship with her over the years. In actuality, the reasoning is much less high school drama than that. This is a documentary about Cobain, not Nirvana, and Morgan wanted it to be a personal one with a small group of participants. And Novaselic was there with him from the beginning. So only one former Nirvana member was needed. Also, Grohl was apparently in the middle of a new Foo Fighters album and his own subsequent HBO doc so didn't initially have the time. That's about it. He did eventually give an interview which will probably end up as a bonus feature on the DVD/Blu-Ray release. Because there's a lot of audio and music clips in the film, Morgan had a talented team of animators come in to supplement it with a series of animations. They're well done and interesting, but also a little cheesy. What works much better is Morgan taking Kurt's doodles and comic strips and lyrics and journal entries and animating them to supplement the music and dialogue. It looks very cool and is very effective. I don't know that I would call Montage of Heck, as some people have, the best or most intimate rock bio ever. There are better ones. I would say though that it offers the most complete picture of who this complicated person was, warts and all. It doesn't give him a God complex or idolize him or present him as an avenging hero. If anything it's a good deterrent for people to stay the fuck away from heroin (as if they needed another) and to pity the people he left behind. It also makes you wonder why those around him didn't do more when he was so obviously self destructing before their eyes. As Novaselic says early in the film, with 20/20 hindsight, the warnings were all there for anyone to see. In his journals, in his drawings, in his demeanour, and most certainly in his songs. But too late is too late. A modern rock greek tragedy if there ever was one.",

      "review": "  Hailed as the documentary that would give you the full story of Cobain's life, it's no surprise Montage of Heck not only cant quite deliver, it appears to be missing some essential moments and points of view, I wonder who's fault that could be... For those of you, and I cant believe I'm typing this, who arent aware of Kurt Cobain and his troubled past, his legacy and indeed the impact he had on a generation, Cobain managed to give the youth of the 90's a voice, his monolithic band Nirvana, broke boundries and walls to allow a sense of purpose and importance to a younger generation, who up until that point struggled with growing up, being socially accepted and having a voice. All this came at a price however, when the confines of his dark mind forced him to turn to heroin abuse, which resulted in the man taking his live. Oh and then there is all that Courtney Love conspiracy... Montage of Heck does manage to get some critical moments right, it characterizes Cobain perfectly through video, audio recordings, diary scribbles, art work and indeed a cartoonish style immalgimation of all of the above. It gives a heart gushingly real insight into Cobain, the man behind the ice cool exterior and it just about manages to make his legacy all the more appealing to a new generation. Where it drops the ball however, is not having quite enough contributors, most likely due to the tired nature of exposing Cobain's problems and having a second act that is clearly tampered with , steering the focus away from Cobain and more onto his equally troubled wife, Courtney Love. It's been reported that Love forced film makers to remove footage, how much of that was detrimental or indeed incriminating to whoever, we will never know, but the film clearly loses focus and trajectory the moment she steps into the frame, killing off any form of acceptable resolution. What ever you view points may be on the woman, she is every bit as important to Cobain's story as Nirvana, so her inclusion is needed, but documentaries need to sit on the fence, not be threatened by outside sources. There is a wonderful film in here somewhere, but it struggles with some basic premises that most other documentaries thrive upon. Watchable.",

      "review": "  I will start off by saying, you don't have to be a huge Nirvana fan to appreciate this documentary. I for one am a fan of NIrvana and Kurt Cobain, not a fanatic like some people who grew up in the 90s, but I did enjoy their music. Personally I am more of a metal fan loving bands like Pantera, Kreator, and Slayer. I always respected Nirvana, because even though their music was pretty simple and most of the songs just use the same chords and a lot of distortion, they helped rid the universe of moronic \"hair metal\" and \"glam metal\" bands. Bands like Poison and Warrant with their cheesy rock ballads in the 80s were so ready to be gone, they just needed a little push, and Nirvana gave them that push. And behind Nirvana came good bands like Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, Stone Temple Pilots etc... It was kind of an explosion of everything anti-hair metal. No longer was it clubs on the sunset strip with bands dressing up like women and fans of those bands also dressing up like women, wearing lipstick and putting a lot of hairspray in their hair, honestly it was disgraceful and one of the worst trends that music ever went through in my opinion. So to see it be destroyed by Nirvana and Kurt Cobain was a beautiful thing to me. It was now dress however you want, and let out all the aggression you have inside your body. But on to the documentary. Music documentaries are really hit or miss, it is rare that you are going to see a music documentary that you will enjoy if you are not a fan of the subject the movie is about. VH1's Behind The Music series was pretty good for a little bit when it first started out, doing short mini documentaries on musicians, but even now they are horrible. I saw a Behind the Music on the likes of 50 Cent, Pink and Neyo. Music acts that haven't really even been out that long at all, surely not long enough to warrant a Behind The Music. Just seems rather stupid to me. But Montage of Heck you can enjoy without being a fan of Kurt Cobain. This isn't only a film about the man in Nirvana, but also a pretty strong showing of what drugs will do to you. It does not matter how rich or famous you are, if you are a drug addict, you are equal to everyone else that is a drug addict as well. Being someone who has struggled with addiction in the past, I felt really connected with Kurt Cobain in this documentary. I know some people will say it was almost a little too much to watch him just crumble in front of your eyes as the movie progresses, but guess what, people need to see stuff like this. For too long has the world kind of hid their eyes from drug addiction. Just thinking it is a bunch of losers and down and out junkies who do nothing for society. When in reality, people of all races, sex, class, religion, rich, poor etc are affected by this. This is a great documentary that really takes you truly behind the scenes at one of the more mysterious figures in music. Yes, he is beloved to this day after committing suicide. But its amazing to watch a guy who pretty much had everything he could ever ask for. A family, money, fame, anything he could ever imagine, and he was just flat out miserable regardless of all of it, mostly do to his long time heroin addiction. I don't think Cobain is a musical genius by any means, but he's a polarizing personality and an innovative musician nonetheless. I just wish he would have truly committed to getting the help he needed because its clear as day that he was crying for help.",

      "review": "  After viewing \"Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck,\" you may find yourself hesitant to refer to its titular rock icon as the Godfather of Grunge, the Voice of the '90s, or any other title that might further his status as a figure of generational idolization. Unflinching and uncompromising in its unyielding determination to unveil the hidden psychology of Kurt Cobain, gone is the tepid characteristic of most rockumentaries that continue worship and ignore humanity. I suspect that it might come as an overwhelming shock to Cobain's biggest admirers; you won't be much hearing about MTV success, critical acclaim, the untouchable gauze of his influence. You will, instead, live through the interludes of his emotionally tumultuous childhood, his drug-addicted, oft miserable journey into fame, and his clamorous marriage to the self-obsessed Courtney Love. Directed by Brett Morgen with unorthodox enterprise, \"Montage of Heck\" utilizes the documentary staple that is the one-on-one interview (featuring appearances from Krist Novoselic, Love, his parents, his stepmother, and his pre-fame girlfriend), but is much more reliant on found-footage, rare pre-recorded monologues by Cobain himself, and heterodox animation that both illustrates situations not caught on camera and brings the latter's drawings and writings to life. You really feel as though you standing next to the man himself, consuming his neuroses, understanding of but never able to help heal his most personal demons.  Such idealization has swept the sidelines of Cobain's persona that it makes me like \"Montage of Heck\" all the more. I've always been a fan of the era defining music of Nirvana, but there hasn't been a second of my enjoyment during which I haven't been wary of his still infatuated circle of fans, who irritatingly romanticize every single detail of his life, who hate Courtney more than they hate Yoko, who act like he was a saint when he was, in fact, a damaged human who needed to be viewed as one but never necessarily was. Because \"Montage of Heck\" is so disinterested in broadening the girth of \"Rolling Stone\" level materialism, the effect is remarkable - we thought we had him mostly figured out. Not so. Anyone with an eye for pop culture knows of his lengthy heroin use and his longtime battles with depression, but the film gives us an inside look into these facts with haunting truth. Home videos depict Kurt and Courtney's frightening marriage, characterized within a crumbling apartment, with antics thoroughly drug-fueled; Morgen's spotlight on Cobain's private journals portray him as a man in touch with himself but also as a man ultra-sensitive to criticism, to success, to his emotions. \"Montage of Heck\" sheds more light onto what destroyed Cobain, not what audiences perceive his psyche as, and it's tenacious. You won't find a better documentary this year, perhaps only rivaled by \"Amy,\" who similarly took an immensely talented musician's tragedy and made it into an unromanticized vision. Cobain's biggest fans will be left broken, his sporadic ones, such as me, shaken. \"Montage of Heck\" is extraordinary.",

      "review": "  Brett Morgan has crafted a beautiful and very artistic documentary far from the previously seen material that tended to always indulge into the mystic drama and tabloid headlines of sex, drug and rock' N' Roll. Here we discover a more human side to the man, his wife and his accomplices in the band. We realize that he was only a kid who came from nowhere, got propelled to the highest summits and got crashed and burned by fame without truly understanding what was happening. Weather you like the music or not, the documentary gives a new interpretation of a popular phenomenon that shook the 90's. Immensely researched and superbly edited, the film is a lesson on documentary film making. Fresh, modern, thoughtful and respectful, it finally humanize a myth and brings it back to a more human scale.... Maybe that's all it needed after all, simplicity, respect and love.",

While we flash back and forth between the bands struggles and triumphs, and into the future where he is trying to find love and dealing with Schizophrenia, the film's deep vibes and meaningful visuals made me very emotional. Paul Dano is incredible in his portrayal of Brian Wilson and John Cusack plays his illness very well. Elizabeth Banks really felt like someone who had no idea how to handle this situation. In the end, \"Love & Mercy\" satisfies with brilliant writing, superb direction, and a story that is much more worth telling than I expected it to. I really loved watching this film and it displays amazing performances all around and celebrates their best music in style. This is not a film you should miss. Definitely worth it's praise.",

John Cusack and Paul Dano are at top form, and their performances are the highlights of this strong, interesting, and heartfelt film. Paul Giamatti plays older Wilson's psychiatrist cum legal guardian, who is scamming Wilson for his fortune and talent, and younger Wilson's Beach Boys brethren vie for control of the band, the artistic sense of which Wilson wants to take in new Beatles-imitation directions.For a while, I was so compelled by the pitch-perfect story-telling and wonderful performances that I considered whether Love and Mercy might be the best film of the year, better than Ex Machina, but no, sadly, Elizabeth Banks's role fall in to the \"helping woman\" cliche, and there are some objectiveless, wandering scenes that only Dano's talent makes interesting.Overall, God only know what would be a better Brian Wilson biopic.",

Paul Dano and John Cusack manage to define the man, separating the young persona with a stubborn but evolving artistic vision from his broken down older self, who has ceased to strive for perfection, but now does for acceptance.",

      "review": "  Breaking away from conventional biopic structure, LOVE & MERCY is a well-crafted and deeply-intriguing examination into the life and mind of a uniquely-talented yet tortured individual. While Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys makes for a strong central character - with Paul Dano giving an off-kilter performance that further solidifies his skill in tackling emotionally-complicated subjects as well as a resurgent turn by John Cusack, Bill Pohlad's directorial debut displays a surprising discipline towards characterization as it never allows the narrative to stray too far, thus providing a film that is insightful and sympathetic yet filled with smooth editing, fun music, and a distinct and very fitting visual palette. Specifically, the scenes of Wilson's recording sessions in the studio with both his band as well as the studio musicians are some of the best moments in the film; they effectively give viewers a glimpse of authenticity and a seemingly exclusive behind-the-scenes access despite it being a re-creation - undoubtedly an impressive execution.",

      "review": "  It is 1966. While returning from a successful tour, Brian Wilson(Paul Dano) of the Beach Boys suffers a debilitating anxiety attack on the flight home. So, he opts out of the Japan leg of the tour in favor of recording some new music for the band. Now all he has to do is figure out how to get the horse inside of the recording studio.It is 1985. Brian Wilson(John Cusack) would like to buy a car. And not just any car, mind you. Which Melinda Ledbetter(Elizabeth Banks), a salesperson, would like to help him with. That happens under the very watchful eye of Dr. Eugene Landy(Paul Giamatti).\"Love and Mercy\" is a thoughtful movie about the intersection between madness and genius which also takes the time to redeem the critical reputation of the Beach Boys. The story is set over two time periods which are linked by two surprisingly matching performances from Paul Dano and John Cusack.(Dano plays Brian struggling to communicate while Cusack is the empty husk of what is left.) While each time period is clearly demarcated by its respective fashions, they are joined in one mindbending segment late in the film. The problems arise in how the movie plays out, namely in seeking as pat a resolution as humanly possible for mental illness for which there is no real cure. And I never quite grasped the importance of the will in all of this.",

Like most biopics, it does occasionally get bogged down in needless melodrama but unlike most biopics it never gets lost there. The dual narratives focusing on two parts of Wilson's life compliment each other nicely and the small scale focus ensures that \"Love & Mercy\" never ends up being another montage movie that only focuses on events rather than the characters.",

Surrounded by a strong supporting cast of Elizabeth Banks and Paul Giamatti, who while a great actor needs to not get stuck playing the \"well meaning\" villians between this and Straight Outta Compton, and a unique style by first time director Bill Pohlad that makes the movie more than anyone could of thought.

Watching somebody make art in the movies is typically a hot mess, but here, we see a process, made coherent because we know where it's going. I'm less enamored of the Cusack segments, bringing the story into the 90s when he is rescued from a Svengali huckster psychologist, not only because Cusack's look is so different, but because there was so much missing between the different slices of Wilson's life that the latter felt contrived and conflated. Which it is, if you read Wilson's bio. Oh well, it's not perfect, but the music is, and the scenes where the music is central are just so wonderful for this nostalgic geezer who lived through it all. I used to go to the Beach Boys concert every Christmas. Until, of course, the Beetles.",

Love & Mercy is the story of the Beach Boy's Brian Wilson played by John Cusack depicted in the late 80's and Paul Dano as young Brian Wilson during the 60's and 70's. The movie goes over Wilson's creative emergence during his time with the Beach Boys and the crazy mental illnesses he battled for the rest of his life. The film is told in a series of flashbacks while Wilson meets a lady named Melinda (Elizabeth Banks) who finds Wilson's life style to be super puzzling. Because of his mental breakdowns Wilson is under guardianship by Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti) who is forcing Wilson to take more and more medication and controlling every aspect of his life. It soon becomes apparent in the present time that Melinda and Brian need to break away from Landy. In the past we go over how Wilson discovered different sounds and his downfall with drugs and alcohol. It's a nice little bio pic that works a lot of the times especially the scenes from the past. Each scene from the past sets up something that happens in the present and at these times its a much more smoother riding picture. The present time just doesn't wrap up nice enough. I felt like the movie had another twenty minutes or so. Overall, solid film. If you like the Beach Boys at all give this one a look!",

It's basically the story of Brian Wilson, from Wilson's perspective.I had no idea what Wilson went through; it's really interesting. Love gave this musical artist a new lease on life, after he lost his rights to psychiatrist and manipulator Dr. Eugene Landy. When Brian meets car saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter and falls for her, something special happens for them. Melinda soon comes to see that Dr. Landy exerts an unhealthy control over Brian's life, frequently overmedicating him and preventing him from having normal interactions with his family and friends and making normal choices, and using abusive tactics to control everyone around him, especially Brian.With the help of staff Gloria, Melinda finds the evidence she needs to show Brian's family what's really going on, and basically saves his life. Dr. Landy ultimately loses his long held control over Brian along with his medical license in the state of CA. Brian regains control over the right to choose his own destiny, and he and Melinda choose each other.The movie also takes an interesting look at Brian's younger days, when he was churning out songs, experimenting with drugs, living with his first love, and spending a lot of time with his brothers and the rest of the Beach Boys. It also looks at his relationship with his father, and what living and song writing with his mental illness was like for him. The guy felt some torment, but he found a lot of satisfaction in his craft. He got to do what he loved: make music! And he's still doing it, decades later, with his love Melinda by his side. Brian Wilson's story has a positive upbeat turnout, light at the end of the tunnel.Of course, this is one-sided. Dr. Landy's side is not told.For people with mental illness, those with family and/or friends willing to fight for them have a better outcome, from what I've seen, than those who get sucked into \"the system\" with no one on their side. I know of a lady, a friend of a friend, who, like Brain, lost her right to make her own decisions. Her house was sold to pay for her institutionalization, and she is a lifer in her institution, because she was depressed after her husband died and was lucky enough to receive \"help\". She fills a bed, and social security pays the institution for their services, so she will never be allowed to leave and have a normal life. Her rights to self determination will not be returned to her, for money reasons, although she is not a threat to herself or anyone else and is no longer grieving for her husband. She is heavily medicated, has a poor quality of life, and has no right to decide any of it. If she wanted a second opinion, no one gives her that option, because she has no rights.Too bad every depressed or otherwise mentally ill person doesn't have a Melinda Ledbetter to fight for them.",

      "review": "  A crittically lauded and unfortunately underseen gem by the masses, Love and Mercy is a look into the live of Brian Wilson at two separate points in his life, as he reaches the heights of his productivity with the Beach Boys as his mental health rapidly disintegrates and him gradually emerging in a more subdued way as he is being managed by a seedy manager looking to profit by his ill health after years of his self imposed sit in only to be brought back to the world by the new love in his life portrayed by Elizabeth Banks. Both Cusack and Dano do really great suitaly portraying the twitches and difficulties that Wilson had to battle through, as well as portraying how Wilson came up with some of the most iconic soundscapes of the California rock sound, while Giamanti has the market cornered on corrupt music managers, A must see for all music fans :)",

While critics will rightfully tell of the extraordinary performance of Paul Dano has the younger Brian, don't count out John Cusack as the older Brian. Surrounded by a strong supporting cast of Elizabeth Banks and Paul Giamatti, who while a great actor needs to not get stuck playing the \"well meaning\" villians between this and Straight Outta Compton, and a unique style by first time director Bill Pohlad that makes the movie more than anyone could of thought. The only real flaw may just be a personal opinion of my own in that it kind of feel with the scenes between Brian nd other members of the Beach Boys in the past seemed a little off. Other than that, I feel this is a movie that people should see.",

The best part about this film though is that unlike most biopics of famous musicians, this film concentrates solely on the Wilson character completely. It doesn't vere off to the band or to the \"tough times\" blah blah blah but soley stays with Wilson. The combo of Dano/Cusauck is unbelievably effective showing the progress from child star to completely broken adult. Fascinating film.",

      "review": "  I had a strange realization watching the film... There were a couple older ladies sitting behind me who chatted a little during the movie (not enough to ruin it really), and they seemed very familiar with the events of Brian Wilson's life - when Gene Landy shows up they knew immediately, and a couple other times. But it almost made the film like a MCU movie where there's this world of the film that people are familiar with the characters already. Just a note, seemed like an odd epiphany I had.But! The film itself was VERY good. Paul Dano and John Cusack both brought different but appropriate energies to the different versions of Brian Wilson - eerily so on Paul Dano's performance. It was crazy to see his mannerisms and voice coming out of Paul Dano's boyish face, when Brian Wilson for much of my life has been an older man. Either way, they both brought great skill into portraying the visionary musician.The other stand-out parts of the film were the incredible sound design and the non-linear editing. The story hops back and forth between the 60?s and the 80?s in a way that really keenly tells the story of Brian Wilson's mental decline and later abusive relationship with Landy. The key moments that really triggered some innovative storytelling were Brian's first acid trip, Mike Love's disgruntled reaction to Pet Sounds, the development of Good Vibrations, and then of course, Elizabeth Banks's Melinda Ledbetter taking down Landy with the help of the Wilson family near the end. THE SOUND DESIGN THOUGH. it just so evocatively displays, in tandem with Paul Dano, the \"music in his head\" enigma and really contributes as a tool to the storytelling throughout the entire film.It might be tough to find (limited release I think?) but definitely worth seeing in a theater with good sound so you can be totally immersed. It was great, would definitely recommend!",

Instead, the film focuses on two key moments in Brian Wilson's life: as her conceives of the group's transformative sounds and of his rebirth two decades later when he is saved from the grip of his controversial, 24-hour therapist Dr Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). This is helped by the decision to cast two actors to portray Wilson: Paul Dano and John Cusack, both of who do a good job. Elizabeth Banks, too, gives a good performance as Wilson's now-wife, Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks), who he met inside a Cadillac showroom. The other star is the '80s clothes and d�cor that features in the latter story, which is a retrospective feast.",

This is not just your typical music biopic as it is unique and I'm still not sure how I felt about them casting two different actors in the role. The music is great and Atticus Ross does a great job incorporating The Beach Boys songs into the film and adding his own twist to them at times. But it is Paul Dano who really steals the show here; I've always known him to be a great actor, but he is absolutely great in this. I thought the film did run a little too long and wish they would have shown a little more of Brian Wilson's 70s stage, where he stayed in bed (but not with a 3rd actor). I also felt the ending wrapped things up a little to quickly and wish that would have been a little more fulfilling. Overall a solid film that I wanted to give 4 stars, but I had a few little problems with the film that stuck with me.",

The cinematography for this film is an absolute marvel- showcasing the sprawling outback desert through hues of oranges and reds during the daytime, contrasting it with beautiful midnight blues at night. All this comes together to give the movie a very lively atmosphere. The score alleviates the sense of rush and is smartly used diegetically as well as non-diegetically. The action scenes are shot brilliantly with minimal special effect, furthering its case as a masterpiece. Finally the acting especially that of Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa is top-notch and no character is left needing further characterisation. Tom Hardy's Max is a man of little words, but the performances are so strong that the movie doesn't need dialogue in order to flourish. This movie is definitely not hyped up- go see it and then go see it again.Rating: 5/5",

Whereas the current popular political correctness deems all life as precious, this weekend jaunt through the local park with the baby in the stroller yells to differ (reminding one of exactly what planet one dwells on). Standing ovation for George Miller, whose charming eloquence about the well hidden truth of modern society is jaw-droppingly stunning. The best apocalyptic vision seen for some time.",

      "review": "  30 years after the release of 'Thunderdome' Mad Max is finally back. The lone wolf, the single warrior, the loner, the lone soldier, the outcast, the outsider, the man with no name...errr...named Max. The hype has been stratospheric for this one, I have gone into this expecting truly mind blowing things, the greatest action movie ever made? lets see, I will be brutally honest in every aspect.So the bottom line, this is virtually based around one sequence from 'Mad Max 2' and made into an entire movie. We all know which sequence, the one with that bloody great gas tanker covered in gun turrets and spikes. That sequence was epic on so many levels, a truly award winning vision of distopian science fiction...where all the goodies get killed, awesome. Now, in this tale Max has been captured by the War boys who are all led by Immortan Joe. Your standard gang of barbaric lunatics, only this time not kitted out in S&M gear, no this time they are all painted up in a tribal sort of way. Long story short, Max has gotta reluctantly help out Charlize Theron's character of Furiosa (with the help of Nicholas Hoult's ill War Boy character, Nux) in saving some damsels in distress from Joe whilst trying to reach some fabled lush green lands. This of course equals a whole load of vehicle chases across the outback which basically never stop.The first sequence we see is Max's classic and gorgeous black pursuit special (the now famous 1973 Ford XB Falcon GT) getting trashed, wait what??!! I heard about this before hand and I have to say I don't like it one bit, I wanted to see that fucking car in action once again, damn it Miller! Not quite sure how Max's super fast special manages to get wiped out by the collection of clown cars chasing him but never mind, it bloody happened didn't it, ugh!So one of the first things we see as the real story kicks in is Immortan Joe's citadel which appears to built into a fecking massive cliff. How the hell did they manage to do that? there's like some sprawling catacombs in this rock by the looks of it, I wouldn't of thought anyone had any time in between killing each other and building ridiculous killer automobiles. This is actually one aspect that didn't sit well with me, this whole idea felt way too grand and over the top for a Mad Max movie, it looked like something from the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy...only with cars instead of orcs. Then if I really wanted to be picky I would ask how everyone is so muscular in this dead post-apocalyptic world, meh don't question it. Its here we start to see the strange freakish array of characters that inhabit this new Earth, gotta say I loved what I saw here for the most part. Miller has always been good at creating these bizarre characters for this franchise and he nails it again here.Most of the bad guys are just big rippling baldies covered in white paint for some reason (the War Boys), not much background given but they look intimidating for sure. Other citadel dwellers and bad guys come in various shapes and sizes such as the creepy looking Corpus Colossus, a physically disabled child of Joe with exceptional intelligence (a real person with a real disability). Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones), a huge muscular mammoth of a man, dim-witted and another son of Joe. The Bullet Farmer who is some ugly aging bloke in a suit of bullets and...is a farmer?, hence is name. The People Eater is a big fat bald guy (everyone is bald in the distopian future) who I guess eats people? Again hence is name and the reason he's so fat, he also looks to have lost his nose because he wears some kind of metal plate there. The Doof Warrior who is some crazy blind bloke that rides a war rig (the Doof Wagon) into battle strapped to some huge speakers and playing a fire spouting guitar. This guy seems to have become the new Boba Fett of the movie world but he doesn't actually do anything, in fact I fail to see the point of him or the drummers other than simply to look cool. Admittedly he does look cool, certainly unique with his mothers face for a mask (oh yes), but basically pointless.Lastly we have Immortan Joe who is easily the most effective looking character I've seen in years. His mask appears to be some kind of breathing apparatus that is attached to some kind of bellows around his neck. The mask is slightly reminiscent of an old WWII pilots oxygen mask but with a terrifying line of big teeth like a skeleton. Not too sure about his ending though, was his mask like...attached to has face and skull? He also seems to wear some kind of transparent body armour with medals and whatnot attached, obviously he suffers from some kind of affliction or disease. Visually this guy looks fucking amazing, the makeup really tops it off with his pale ghostly complexion and silver balding, widows peak hair line. All in all the selection of characters gave off a very 'Dune-esque' (1984) vibe in my opinion.The action is virtually constant here, its the trademark of the movie (and franchise), non-stop. The main bulk of the action centres around Max and co trying to escape on the tanker under a barrage of gunfire and explosions. Now yeah, we've seen this before in 'Mad Max 2' but this has been ramped up to maximum overdrive, its insane! There are vehicles being torn up and flipped all over, metal mechanical shrapnel shattering all over the desert, bodies are flying everywhere, War Boys are leaping around on pole vault type things hurling explosives, gunfire, stabbings, fisticuffs...all happening on and off various extreme vehicle creations. It all looks completely real (because all the stunts were real), its highly impressive and shows great achievement in both eruptive action and practical effects. On top of that the location work, scenery shots, panoramas and the crisp, bold colour palette really look nothing short of gorgeous, it almost looks too good for this type of movie. Gives you faith in movies again it really does.That's not to say the action saves it completely, in my view. Amongst all this grade A action you do have to wonder how Max, Joe and others manage to survive some of the horrific fender benders they get into. The good guys battle their way away from the citadel, all that way, only to come back again and do it all again? wut?! The canyon sequence stuck out as a very daft cheesy notion. This biker gang that hides out there, living in and around the canyon walls, which they ride about on...with motorbikes? bit risky isn't it. Also, where did they all get their matching costumes? When the good guys come back through the canyon, do they go a different way? didn't it get blocked off. And it does all seem nuts that all this happens purely because Joe wants his girls back. He unleashes his entire armada and risks everything just for some ass? can't you find more girls in your citadel? Oh and in the end the citadel bad guys just let Max and co into their city and take over? huh? he just killed your leader.The greatest action flick ever? hmmm not too sure about that, its certainly up there but I still find myself preferring the gritty cult classic 'Mad Max 2' with Gibson. I think Hardy does a reasonable job but he is no Mad Max if you ask me. One thing I hated actually was the deliberate lack of dialog from Max, it worked well in the older films (MM2) simply because there was less to explain, 'MM2' was like a bloody 80's videogame it was so straight forward. Here there are things that could use background information plus the amount of times Max gets into a situation (mainly at the start) where I really wanted him to just speak! say something!! Explain your situation to Furiosa then she might not try to kill you...ugh! I found that actually frustrating and it didn't need to be like that.Still, the fact that the goodies went back on themselves towards the end really made me groan frankly. Its like Miller didn't know how to end it so he just made them go back and run the same gauntlet all over again, easy option for more of the same. I won't lie and say I didn't like it, but I won't lie and say I thought it was a stunning movie, the action is monumental at first but after the initial hardcore, automobile, carnage sequence, things felt a little tamer. The initial visual shock and awe that hit my eyeballs, making them swell, started to ease off. So awe-inspiring visuals all round and some great characters...visually at least. Is this a good flick? yes, yes is it, its a very engaging solid action movie, buts lets not get too carried away. Its really a one trick pony if you're honest about it, big gas tanker with goodies fights off hordes of baddies, rinse, wash and repeat until credits. The only real difference is its Furiosa's story, and to a degree, Nux too, unfortunately Max is just along for the ride in his 30 year old reboot.",

      "review": "  Apocalyptic films are usually a hit or miss subject. Many are forgettable or cliched to the point of being one big joke, kind of like the film within the film by the Mackenzie brothers in Strange Brew. Some films get it really right, while others get it really, really wrong with disastrous and silly results.When one thinks of the modern apocalyptic film the template for that genre of cinema was crafted by George Miller. His major debut Mad Max (1979) was less apocalyptic and more a '70's exploitation car chase flick sent to hell and back, making the film an achievement in film making. It pushed the envelope at the end of the decade.It would be the sequel to that film, Mad Max 2 or The Road Warrior here in the states, that would define Miller's vision of the world beyond the end, the people that lived after the \"event\". The Road Warrior is one of those rare films that exceeds its predecessor with a story that, while simple, is presented in a way that is unforgettable and burns itself into your psyche.We'll skip Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. It has its place and its moments, but is really a film that Miller cared very little about as he left the world of Max for thirty years.Mad Max: Fury Road is a return to the supercharged film that The Road Warrior happened to be. Max (Tom Hardy) once again runs afoul of a mutant clan using slave labor and water to control their little piece of a broken world. Led by Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keayes-Byrne, who played the Toe Cutter in the original film) a chase ensues after Furiosa (Charlize Theron in an awesome performance) steals a commodity that is sacred to the enraged leader.A simple story if there ever was one, but this goes beyond that. Fury Road is open to close action with very little time to catch your breath. Some films are called a roller coaster ride, that age old cliche that they slap on posters. Fury Road is like going into hell without any looking back. It's funny that a film set in a fictional version of our world can draw so many parallels to life itself.What really stands out in Fury Road is the role of women. For a film titled Mad Max, the strongest character in the film is Furiosa, a warrior that does not give up, leading her ironic cargo to a promised land that may or may not exist. Distant memories or wishful thinking? There are moments when Max feels like a side character and this is Furiosa's movie. It's an amazing thing to see in film where a woman is neither a pawn nor a gimmick, but an integral piece to the film. She is the center that everything about Fury Road revolves around.I was more than sketchy when I heard that another Mad Max film was on the way. So many returns in the last decade have floundered over the indulgences of these sequels and reboots. It's about a 50/50 split in that arena. Fury Road is probably the best of the bunch and is probably one of the best films of 2015 so far. It is a credit to credit masterpiece that really cuts at the other blockbusters of this year and the almost stagnant world of super hero movies. Fury Road is, ironically, a breath of fresh air in a cinematic universe that tends to regurgitate last years product. Dare I say that this film is Miller's masterpiece, possibly even surpassing The Road Warrior? I don't know, but I really, REALLY want to watch it again.",

      "review": "  Allow me to begin with a confession. I had to see Mad Max: Fury Road again. I knew minutes into the film that my appetite would not be quenched and I needed to see it again, which I did less than 12 hours later. A week later I saw it a third time in the theater. The reason I did this is obvious in one regard - it's a highly enjoyable, pulse-pounding, amazing spectacle of first-class stuntwork and mad genius so rarely accomplished on such a large, splendid scale of destruction. The other reason, from a writing standpoint, is that I needed to see the movie again or else my review of Fury Road was going to consist of nothing but an unending stream of positive adjectives vomited upon the page in excitement. And for you, dear reader, I wanted to do better. Also, I wanted to see Mad Max: Fury Road again and I honestly wouldn't mind in the slightest seeing it again.In the post-apocalyptic future, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) is an aging warlord with his own fiefdom. He controls the water supply and has an army of gearhead warriors to enforce his rule. His trusted driver, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), is leading a caravan for supplies when she goes rogue, driving off into the desert. Furiosa has taken Immortan Joe's \"property,\" namely his five wives. Enraged, Immortan Joe gathers a posse of death vehicles and riders and heads off to reclaim his \"property.\" Max (Tom Hardy) is a drifter thrust into the middle of this conflict when he's strapped to a car and driven out into the desert, part of the Immortan Joe rapid response forces. There are few things more exhilarating in the realm of motion pictures than a well-executed, well-developed action sequence, and Mad Max: Fury Road is a blistering, awe-inspiring masterpiece of brilliant carnage. What director George Miller has achieved onscreen is visionary. The level of execution is so rarely seen at such a large scale, and with so many moving parts, that I was delighted and curious how something this extraordinary could escape the risk-averse studio system. I'm trying my best to restrain myself from sheer hyperbole, but this is an instant classic in the world of action cinema and a definite top five all-time action film (for those keeping track, I would say last year's Raid sequel would also qualify for that status). The movie provided me a font of joy that did not let up until the end credits ushered me out of the theater. The action sequences are epic in their scale, with dozens of different vehicles in hot pursuit, and yet Miller brilliantly orients his audience to every moment of his symphony of demolition. There are so many different parts to the action but the audience knows everything that happens. The sheer sense of momentum and pacing is overwhelming and giddy. The action sequences develop organically, with new consequences throwing our characters into different and dire directions. There's also a startling amount of variety with the action sequences. Fury Road has been described as a two-hour chase film, and that's accurate to a degree, but there are breaks in between the sequences, small moments to catch your breath and learn more about our characters and their hostile world. Each sequence is different enough that the action doesn't ever feel redundant, even when the third act literally requires the characters to backtrack. The adrenaline just doesn't turn off from the get-go, and Miller keeps throwing out new tricks, new stunts, and new cars to astound and amaze. Simply put, Fury Road shames other American film releases. The stuntwork is another facet that just raises the bar when it comes to action movies. Miller emphasized practical effects whenever possible, and the emphasis pay off with a heightened sense of realism onscreen. It's real cars being smashed to real bits, real stuntmen being tossed around. In an age of CGI over saturation, it's all too easy to become numb to big screen spectacle because of how hollow it all comes across visually. Just this past month with the Avengers sequel, I knew that all the fight scenes were mostly CGI or actors against green screens, and it eases off the enjoyment of the moment. Don't even get me started on the deluge of CGI carnage in the last Hobbit film. Real physical objects and physical interaction offer so much more believability in an age of increasing disbelief with special effects. With Miller's focus on practical effects first and foremost, it brings that sense of crazy excitement back and it ensures that Fury Road will hold up better over time. I also appreciated just how much thought Miller and his team put into crafting their world. Every detail feels like it adds to the overall richness of Miller's vision. The designs of the cars, the use of scrap, the fact that a pulley system is operated with children running up giant wheels, it all contributes to making the world better realized and more alive. The level of thought put into weird and deadly concepts in this movie is fantastic. Once the main characters pass through a bog of land, we see people dressed in cloaks traversing the land on stilts, and it's little passing details such as this that make the movie feel more complete. I enjoyed that one of Max's heroic attributes is that he's specified for his blood type, being O the universal donor. The fact that Miller finds a satisfying way to bring this attribute back as a payoff is also appreciated. I also enjoyed how Miller expands upon the family of Immortan Joe, with his bevy of freakish sons and brothers and peculiarities. I enjoyed the fact that Miller isn't afraid to embrace the weird of his dystopia, symbolized best by a blind guitar player attached to a roaming wall of speakers who can shoot flames out of his instrument. Every time the movie cut back to this guitar playing pace setter, I smiled, and I smiled a lot during this movie.Some have grumbled that Max is a supporting player in a movie that bears his name, but I would argue he is a co-lead and the real star is rightfully Imperator Furiosa. Max is not replaced with Furiosa, rather they have an inter-dependant relationship where they're both vulnerable and they both come to trust the other but without a romantic mingling. These are both wounded, shaken, mistrusting, and volatile people, and to watch their shared sense of teamwork and the gradual opening and reliance upon one another, it is itself an affecting and emotionally satisfying relationship. But back to Furiosa, it's really her story because she is the one with the personal connection o the mission. Max has always kind of been a wandering warrior who finds himself in other people's battles. Consider him a post-apocalyptic Man with No Name. Furiosa is the leader who has planned and implemented the escape from Immortan Joe, and it's she that deserves our attention. I enjoyed the fact that Miller doesn't even have to explain her past. We know she's suffered trauma, physical and likely sexual, and he assumes the audience does not need Furiosa's past abuse spelled out specifically for them, or seen in grisly flashback. She's a strong woman who is far from helpless with one arm. This is a story about women liberating themselves from sexual slavery under a corrupt patriarchy (more on the thematic relevance below). Theron is our leader and the ferocity in her eyes is all you need to know you believe that this woman will do whatever it takes for freedom.The other aspect that's very clear is that Fury Road is a decidedly feminist film but it never stoops to preaching or even directly calling attention to its efforts. It's a ruined world where men with unchecked power have exploited the vulnerable, where women are treated as \"property\" and valued for breeding purposes. Our heroes are by and large women who have rejected their roles in this society or are fleeing their impositions. And with Furiosa as lead, it paints a more than convincing picture of women being just as capable and badass in the post-apocalypse (I want to go as Furiosa for Halloween). It's a movie that portrays women struggling against an unjust system that devalues them but Fury Road doesn't wallow in their suffering. It doesn't have to in order to get its points across. It also treats the wives in a manner that lacks sexualization. Immortan Joe has treated them as property but Miller treats them as human beings, even going as far as to give them distinguished personalities. I'm not saying they approach three-dimensional characters but they're certainly not just eye candy. There's a sequence where they wash each other with a hose, and you could see the myriad ways this moment would go tawdry for some cheap titillation. What the Men's Rights Activists (sadly this is actually a thing) seem to have lost in their caterwauling is that feminism is not a zero-sum game; one person gaining stature and opportunity does not mean it's taken away from another. Just because Furiosa is strong it doesn't make Max weak. Furiosa being a compelling lead character does not diminish Max. It makes him an even better character because he recognizes her value and his own limitations, like a scene where he voluntarily hands over a rifle because he knows she's the better marksman. No one has to explicitly point and say, \"Girls can do it too.\"There's also a fascinating commentary on the danger of religious fundamentalism with the war boys. These powder-white young men are Immortan Joe's armed forces and they are promised a swift appearance at the gates of their paradise if they die in battle (\"Witness me!\" is their exclamation before sacrifice). They spray paint their faces chrome (\"Eternal, shiny and chrome\") and then go in for the kamikaze kill. Again, the theme is ripe and obvious but without requiring characters to comment. Nux (Nicholas Hoult, wonderfully deranged and then sincere) actually has the closest thing to a character arc, going from hopeful martyr to independent thinker. He begins as a clumsy yet determined antagonist and becomes a resourceful and unexpected ally. This is practically a flawless film on a technical level. The cinematography by John Seale (Cold Mountain) is bright with lush colors that pop on the big screen. We've been treated to far too many color degraded films, so it's nice to view a movie that wants to use all the colors at its disposal. The musical score by Junkie XL (300: Rise of an Empire) is stirring and pulse-pounding with its heavy percussion, but there's a languid melody that returns again and again that is emotionally resonant. It's surprising how the score will punctuate the bombast and wailing guitars with a lovely string arrangement, like when we rush into the sandstorm and a car is blown into the sky. The editing is outstanding by Margaret Sixel (Happy Feet) and she keeps the audience informed with every new twist and turn, and with so many moving parts and changing dynamics, that is a miracle itself. The production design by Colin Gibson beautifully expands and informs this strange world. There isn't a department in Fury Road that wasn't at the top of their game.If I had to quibble, I could accept the argument that Mad Max: Fury Road lacks the substance to be much more than an exhilarating action ride. The dialogue can be a bit on-the-nose, Hardy mumbles through a majority of his miniscule lines, and the characters aren't as fleshed out as they could be and the plot is rather bare bones. However, I view its narrative economy as a virtue, as there isn't a moment or scene wasted in telling this breakneck tour de force of post-apocalyptic demolition. Rarely does an artist get to work at this level in the studio system let alone succeed with a final product that still manages to be strange, mordant, uncompromising, and completely riveting. This is a near-perfect action movie and a thrilling high-wire act of practical filmmaking bravado. Mad Max: Fury Road is the standard I am going to judge all summer movies by for the rest of the year, and I imagine many will be found wanting. I could continue to heap praise on the movie but the most persuasive stance I can make is that if you fail to see Fury Road on the big screen, you will always regret this decision. I am a disciple of Fury Road and witness my brethren and me. This movie was made for the biggest screen, the loudest sound system, and an endless bucket of popcorn. Nate's Grade: A",

      "review": "  Max accompanies a woman trying to rescue pregnant concubines from a despotic ruler.While there's no doubt that some of the action sequences are well-choreographed and mildly entertaining, the most important part of a film is its story. This one doesn't get started until about thirty minutes in, and the character development is sloppy, uneven, and unnaturally rushed. For example, we're supposed to believe that the frenetic war boy abandons his blind faith because of one embarrassing maneuver and the fact that he got to stare into a girl's eyes for two minutes. Those must be some eyes.The reason that story is so important, especially in action films, is that the audience must be kept in suspense about how the action sequence will end. Here, there's no doubt about who will survive; the only question is how, which isn't that entertaining.This film's champions shouldn't think that I don't get the gender politics here. I understand that the film puts women in positions of power, that it stands against sex slavery, and that its depiction of women is more progressive than many other films in the genre. That's all great and the reason why the film got one star instead of a half.Overall, this story is weak, and all the chase sequences in the world can't rescue a weak story.",

      "review": "  Considering the wave of terrible 90's Scifi sequels/remakes we've had fired our way in the past few years (Terminator, Robocop, Total Recall etc.) Fury Road's success has been more than a pleasant surprise.It takes a lot of very 80's dystopian post-apocalyptic sensibilities and puts it in modern context. The relevant storytelling, characterization and heavy play on social themes make it a compelling tale but it's the barebones, relentlessly unforgiving visuals that make it a thrilling ride through and through.There's more to the world of Mad Max than sand dunes and angry people with automobiles though, with very little screen time Miller manages to convey a very elaborate society full of warrior tribes, caste systems and cultural/religious customs that are intriguing if not visually iconic.Let's also not forget the cast of characters representing a variety of minorities without feeling like forced tokens. A phenomenal performance by Charlize Theron breathes badassery into Furiosa and the manic Nux played by Hoult! It seems the best way to bring back the \"strong silent type\" hero is to in fact keep him silent. (who would've guessed?) Hardy skims by as Max with stern looks, grunts and single syllable words and for that we love him.At the end of the day Fury Road is both a nonsensical, visceral action packed adventure about a bunch of rebels fighting the system but also an intelligent character study with a dab of social commentary. Some of these folks are larger than life (Max) others victims/villains turned heroes (Furiosa, Breeders, Nux) which ever you appreciate more you're both cheering and enamored by the spectacle.",

      "review": "  Over thirty years since the last instalment in the \"Mad Max\" franchise, Tom Hardy takes over the leading role once helmed by Mel Gibson, and takes the character to unseen heights. George Miller definitely waited for the perfect time to release this picture, coming out in an age where every action film relies on CGI. Displaying a perfect balance of practical and CG effects, the action pieces in this film are breathtaking to behold. Everyone in this film gives it their all, injecting fuel into this franchise that was believed to be dead long ago. The two main questions people will ask about this picture is does it live up to the original trilogy and will it welcome newcomers. I will say that you do not have to view the original films in order to know what is going on here, but it definitely will not attract people who have no clue what they are in for. \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is a breathtaking spectacle (better than any I have seen in a long time), but it was a little too short on characters to really care about EVERYTHING that was going down. By the end of this film, I realized that it definitely was spectacle over substance, but the spectacle was so incredible that it will almost overshadow the bad upon every single viewing. In the end, I will say something that I have never said about any movie. It is a flawless film with many issues. My brain was going nuts during my viewing of this film, and I loved that. If you are planning on seeing this, please do so in the theatre, it is worth it. \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is awesome!",

There are enough story details, as needed, but ultimately, it's all there to setup the next incident on \"fury road.\"The violence is erratic, over the top, and highly entertaining. A good combination of CG, as well as real vehicle demolishings come as advertised. There is so much going on, the film manages to leave the want for even more.Tom Hardy is a man of few words, it is no wonder the film belongs to Charlize Theron with Nicholas Hoult following in her footsteps. Seriously, the film could have been called Furiosa road.There's no secret here. Mad Max: Fury Road delivers what is expected of it.",

And I'll be honest, in the first 15 minutes, I had no clue what I had gotten myself into. It was a little overwhelming. The types of movies that just throw you into a world with no explanation always throw me for a minute. But, what I will say is that once I'm in, I am sucked in 100%. And this I was sucked in 1000%. What is this society? Why is almost everyone from it sick? How did Furiosa become the only woman in power? Why is there a flame throwing guitar? Now, these are all questions that are still swirling around my brain, but in the moment, I could have cared less. I was simply along for the ride. The visuals are absolutely stunning (that sandstorm at the beginning. Holy hell.) The acting from the main characters is on point. (Charlize Theron is my queen.) The chase scene in the last half hour had me incredibly stressed out in the best way possible. The storyline was deeper than a typical action movie. I could honestly keep going. I would love to watch this again, now that I understand everything, and just dive in and go along for the ride.",

      "review": "  One of my favorite movies of this year, and possibly of all time!!! This movie was stylistically and visually beautiful. There was some really great world-building in this movie, and I love the subtly incorporated Viking/Nordic cultural influences in the Mad Max post-apocalyptic universe. I actually wasn't a huge fan of Tom Hardy, and likewise was also not blown away by Charlize Theron or any of the other acting in this movie. However, this movie was so beautiful, I couldn't resist giving this movie a resounding 5/5 stars!",

      "review": "  I found this movie to be incomprehensible and stupid - rescued to the two star level only by its stunning art design.Supposedly this is some \"post apocalyptic\" world we're in, but there is no back story presented to create any context for the characters or their motivations. Mad Max gets kidnapped and strapped to the front of a vehicle, and we watch cars blow each other up. There's not that much more going on - until maybe 60% into the movie when the Charlize Theron character explains she's trying to get back home - and eventually needs to return to where the movie started.There are bizarre kings and crazed punks and a few siren slaves whose presence appears, again with little context. People spray themselves with paint, one truck has a wonderful rock guitarist strapped to the front, whose axe shoots flames out of its neck. And this goes on for two and a quarter hours.However, the way the visuals are conceived is stunning. The home city has mammoth levels strung on hyper-industrial styled gears, with muscular percussionists pounding out something - for some reason. It looks cool. But to no intelligent end.",

And for today's standards, with so many companies relying on cgi stuff, it is amazing to see a director/film finally taking the bold step to make an action film the good ole fashioned way, with real stunts and actors. George Miller really knocked this one out of the park. Not to mention a great performance by Hardy & Theron.",

The pacing, action, dialogue, even the way each character moves almost seems surgical now. Don't get me wrong it's a great film and like I said, everything you'd ever NEED but I think we've hit a level of stagnation here.There's no more wow factor, there's nothing iconic that you would recall for years on down the road. Rogue Nation will be remembered by most as a blur of exceptional action film making...I believe the next MI film will need more personal, resonating character moments from the IMF crew if it's going to succeed.",

      "review": "  Not as outlandishly crazy as the Fast and the Furious series, not as beholden to tradition as the Bond series, the Mission: Impossible series doesn't get the same notoriety but I'd declare it the most consistent and best action franchise going today. Each new film is a distillation of their director's strengths, keeping things fresh, and the mainstay is Tom Cruise in prime action hero mode and risking his life like a madman. While not as dizzyingly entertaining as 2011's Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation is another fun and action-packed spy thriller with terrific and memorable set pieces. The plot involves Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team on the run, again, as their agency is shut down for its reckless methods. A rival agency known as The Syndicate is plotting political assassinations, so Hunt and his team (Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames) must work along the fringes to save the day. The newest addition is Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson as a mysterious ally and antagonist for Hunt. She's smart, formidable, and not treated as a romantic interest or overly sexualized (progress). After Alicia Vikander's superb performance in Ex Machina, and now Ferguson's steely turn, it's quite a booming year for Swedish imports. The series' star is still Cruise and his cavalier treatment of his 50-year-old body in the pursuit of the daredevil stunts. The opening with Cruise attached to the outside of an ascending cargo plane is a stunning image jolted by the charge of realism. An underwater vault break-in is wonderfully developed. The snazzy car chases, motorcycle chases, and foot chases all benefit from Cruise being front and center. Say what you will about the man but he's a movie star. The biggest problem with Rogue Nation is much like Ghost Protocol in that it peaks in the middle. The last act takes place entirely in London and it just can't compare with what came earlier, which leaves the movie lumbering to a close with its rather substandard villain. Even with a less than stellar conclusion, Rogue Nation is another entertaining, fun, and thrilling action movie that would be the best the summer has to offer if it weren't for the highs of Mad Max. Nate's Grade: B+",

We've seen car chases and explosions before, and this film has many of those, but it also throws in underwater heists, a man flying on the outside of a plane and some nice humor. Like almost all action flicks, the story itself is not much to marvel at, so in order for an action film to be good it has to make up for it in other ways, which absolutely Rogue Nation does. And despite what people say or think about Tom Cruise, there is no denying that he is a bonafide action star.",

This time, the team is left with nothing as a nation-gone-rogue is after Ethan Hunt. With so many more layers, this film has one of the best stories of the franchise. With a very bond-esque inspiration, this is not one to miss if you are a fan of the series. Tom Cruise is fantastic once again as the charismatic lead in Hunt, and the entire cast (namely Simon Pegg) are all noteworthy here as well. With a very carefully written script, direction that is off the charts, and editing that makes each action piece make your heart pump, this picture has it all.

That's thanks to great direction of excellent action in awesome set pieces, but also thanks to the leading man. People can say about Cruise's private life or religious choices all they want. The man keeps delivering great genre entertainment year after year, while doing as many stunts as he can all by himself. The insane opening sequence is testament to that. Still, one of the best parts of this is how it is an ensemble piece with everyone doing their part. Female newbie Rebecca Ferguson is fantastic, blowing all Bond girls from the last 45 years out of the water. Pegg is likable and funny as always. The pacing is great and especially the two major sequences in the middle of the film in the Vienna opera and Casablanca are absolutely breathtaking. The showdown can't even begin to top that and doesn't try, taking a different approach to a solution instead. Overall a pretty long film for an action thriller but an incredibly entertaining one. With quality as high as this, they can keep making these until kingdom come.",

      "review": "  With such a high bar after Ghost Protocol, this plays more like a Mission: Mediocre for me. The high reviews and praise as being the best in the series really baffle me, because the plot overall was very vanilla and straightforward. I thought they played too many of their cards in the trailers, because pretty much any stunt (aside from details of the third act) has already been mostly revealed over the course of the trailers. The plane stunt is amazing, and the driving and motorcycle stuff is amazing, but aside from those scenes, nothing really leaves a lasting imprint for me. I feel like they strung a bunch of spy and stunt scenes together without much setup, whereas in Ghost Protocol there was dialogue and setup to the scenes and they had more substance. Overall, I'd still say it's a decent, be it a little disappointing, entry into the franchise (my 3rd favorite), but I'll need a re-watch of the original and Ghost Protocol to get my enthusiasm for the series back up to the level it was at.",

      "review": "  IN DE PALMA THEIR HANDS - My Review of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: ROGUE NATION (4 Stars)Sometimes, and I mean rarely, a blockbuster well into its franchise just works. Think about how CASINO ROYALE reinvigorated the 007 Series, with Daniel Craig and director Martin Campbell bringing a healthy dose of gravitas to something that had long-before resorted to trashy silliness. But, again, that kind of thing happens as often as Halley's Comet. Imagine my surprise then when writer/director Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise reunited for this fifth installment and went in guns blazing. This is a thrilling action movie, effortlessly jumping from set piece to set piece with deliciously shifting loyalties and some tightly-wound suspense. It's not going to change the world, but it definitely sends a warning shot to all the other Studio Tentpole makers to up their game and at least stay engaged with the swill they're shilling. MISSION picks up a short time after the Kremlin-destroying events of GHOST PROTOCOL, with our hero, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) desperately trying to get to a plane before it takes off. Yes, the filmmakers blow their poster wad within the first five minutes, giving us that indelible and real shot of Cruise dangling from the side of a plane in mid-air. My instant thought was, \"That's pretty ballsy. I hope they have more tricks up their sleeves or else this thing is an early climaxer!\"Turns out, it was just an appetizer, and when we come back from credits, we find the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) in disarray and losing its power, with Hunt having gone dark in the field. A perfect time for the Syndicate, a band of terrorists hellbent on world domination, to set their plot in motion. Of course they have to go through Ethan and his loyal band of spies, and we all know how that tends to work out for the bad guys. Joined again by Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames, Cruise and company find themselves in a race against time to save the world. The story, as usual, is somewhat irrelevant, but the execution of the thrills and chills thoroughly won me over. Without spoiling anything, we're treated to torture, an attempted assassination at an opera, a thrillingly-edited underwater sequence, and a good half dozen more scenes before the film almost literally dumps you out, spent and exhausted. Bringing an ambiguous dose of tension is Rebecca Ferguson, excellent as the femme fatale who may or may not be on Ethan's side. It's this push-pull that gives the film its effervescent kick. I've enjoyed Cruise's performances in recent years because he's become more willing to give us the aging action star who suffers aches, pains, and real fear. He may ultimately prevail, but there's a cost nowadays. Battle fatigue often plays better than superhuman strength, something the world of MARVEL and DC COMICS could stand to learn. Beautifully shot by master cinematographer Robert Elswit, who ruled 2014 with stellar work on NIGHTCRAWLER and INHERENT VICE, and edited with rare patience by Eddie Hamilton, ROGUE NATION seldom resorts to the style of seizure-inducing scenes in most giant CGI nightmares. Instead, much effort has been put into understanding each location and who is doing what to whom. Trust me, that just does not happen much anymore. McQuarrie also gets credit here, using alternate scenarios to get what's normally droning exposition across to the viewers. The preparation for the underwater scenes, for example, made great use of dispensing complicated information by way of showing Simon Pegg suffering the outcome of a mission that could go horribly wrong. This and the stunning opera scene reminded me of vintage Brian De Palma, who in addition to making such suspense classics as DRESSED TO KILL and BLOW OUT, happened to direct the first MISSION installment. De Palma understands screen geography better than most and he's always infused his scenes with a somewhat winking, knowing, dreamlike energy. McQuarrie seems to pull from the same playbook, perhaps to honor his predecessor's work on the series, or maybe it's because he just thinks De Palma has done cheese correctly. Either way, what we have here is very De Palma-esque. For a director like De Palma, who has often been criticized for being too Hitchcock-esque, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: ROGUE NATION seems to give him his long-deserved due...even if he had nothing to do with it.",

      "review": "  Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation is a brilliant action film, perfectly combining the series epic set pieces with a solid storyline to match. This is a film that was never boring and keeps you engaged thanks to director Christopher McQuarries sharp direction. Everything from the opening plane sequence, to the fantastic bike chase, this has all the action and intensity you want from a Mission: Impossible film. The story isn't anything groundbreaking, but its a cool idea thats executed very well. It gives the opportunity for the great characters to develop further and to see them do awesome stuff. It also works very well to give the incredible action scenes a lot more impact. Tom Cruise continues to prove he is one of the best action stars in the business, no matter the age. His performance shows yet again that he was born to play Ethan Hunt, bringing all the charisma and fun to the role that we expect. Ving Rhames is a much welcome return to the franchise, although I had almost wished he had more to do amd more interaction with Ethan. Simon Pegg is great as usual, using a likable personality and humor to make a fun character. Jeremy Renner also continues to prove that he is just awesome. Rebecca Ferguson really came out of nowhere and blew me away, and I hope this leads her into new roles I get to see her in soon. The villain was a solid baddie to take on, as I liked his cold and calculating personality. He at least was better than the majority of other villains in this franchise. Overall, I love the Mission: Impossible franchise and I think the argument could be made that Rogue Nation is the best yet. These films only seem to be getting better. But thanks to brilliant action sequences, a great cast once again proving their brilliant chemistry, a well done script, and a new director who blends all of this together perfectly to create one of the best films of the summer. Whether or not you are a fan of spy films, you definitely should go see this.",

The casting was excellent, and the camaraderie was obvious. The film was very well paced, and packed with good humour, great action, and great direction. Loved it.",

      "review": "  Mission Impossible is back again! The first 3 installments of this series, led by Cruise, set such a high bar that to try and continue the series without him led to an utter flop. But with Cruise back at the helm, the movie picks up right where part 3 left off, and continues the successful story.The action scenes are genuinely epic, the supporting cast definitely add up to more than just the sum of their parts, and the whole production just has a nostalgic feel to it that's very appealing. Sometimes it's hard to imagine how the next instalment will fare compared to the ones preceding it, but MI-RN does more than enough to uphold the reputation of the original MI movies.",

Though, I wish the story was much better. It's a kind of steriotypical story. IMF was shut down, and there is the revenge, and then Ethan was hunted, so was Bond. Hence, it was a good time. though I probably won't find myself watching it over and over again.",

      "review": "  This is a smart movie, both from performance and technical achievement. I adored the director's and producer (also starred) Tom Cruise's vision.Tom Cruise knew what he was doing as a producer. Most of the decision was made by him. You can also see one of his extreme decision to perform all of the stunts with his own body. And yes all of the stunts were true. Tom Cruise really flew on a military aircraft!Ferguson's performance was also a highlight of the movie. From half of the movie we really don't know whose side she was on.I also like to note Alec Baldwin's comeback in the acting industry. I think the last time he looked fresh as in the movie was in 'The Hunt For Red October' (1990). Now, he was also a key plot of the film (or SPOILER: the franchise in the future).But from all of its achievement I would like to salute the movie because it was shot on film instead of digital. This type of filmmaking are very rare now. The traditional ways are always the best way to create the best movies.Shooting on film is always my dream.From all of the good things, there was only one thing I hated - the antagonist of the movie. They were not very iconic. Syndicate was the nemesis of IMF in the TV series. So, I was expecting a group of antagonist, which was very very very hard to take down.Just like Benji said to Ethan, \"Nahhh.. it's not so hard.\"The verdict:MI: Rogue Nation achieved many things that I hadn't expected to achieve, it's a great summer blockbuster movie and they keep the franchise fresh.",

So they had to improvise with the help of a old colleague that is in another city to help with there hacking to retrieve the package from inside the aircraft.By doing so the plane is just about to lift off but what happens is that it does and Ethan jumps on to the plane before it does and hangs in the balance of the side door up in the air. Benji now hack in to the plane has to open the door from the side and open it. He gets in and retrieves the package and does what is necessary! afterwards we get a scene where Ethan Hunt is in London and in a vinyl store to get his next mission only to be compromised and to find out there is a rouge agency like the IMF To Be continued.......... when you watch it anyways short little story background.My thoughts fun spectacular and exciting is what I call it was rather surprised that this film was good in story and good in intelligence the stunt work was absolutely amazing I give it that but the film just good with chess pieces going from a to z and it really felt like a good old spy film. If your waiting to watch a good old spy film give this ago and if you excuse me this message has been on long enough cut the curtains.",

It just tends to have a good little spy thriller plot with lots of goofy fun action scenes, and it never seems to take itself so seriously that you get annoyed with it. It knows it is ridiculous, and winks a little at you, but it never verges into camp territory...just a perfect tone for these kind of movies. The fact that they also employ lots of real stunts by Cruise is certainly a plus too. I'm not the biggest Cruise fan (as he is always playing Tom Cruise), but this series is really the perfect vehicle for him to play that Tom Cruise character and showcase his wacky stuntwork. This wasn't quite as good as the last film, but it was pretty close. I was glad they brought back most of the supporting cast from the last movie and gave Rhames a better role to play. My only complaint is that they seem to fallback on the \"we're all alone without Government backing for some reason or another\" trope. Just make an action/adventure and not need to be lone wolves having to prove the need for the IMF.",

      "review": "  Many describe this Canadian film as an emotional horror show, and make no mistake, Mommy will leave you shaken. Writer-director Xavier Dolan debuted six years ago with I Killed My Mother and Oedipal issues are still on the menu in Mommy, in which a 15-year-old, omnisexual, possible bi-polar boy named Steve (Antoine Olivier Pilon) is more than his widowed mother, Diana 'Die' Despres (Anne Dorval) can handle.A new law taking effect in Quebec will allow for a parent to institutionalize a child without a court procedure, which gets Die to thinking. She's only about 50, and her tight pants and tall heels suggest she's not ready for retiring from life anytime soon. The trouble is that blond, blue-eyed Steve is very charming when not setting things on fire or threatening people with violence. Die seeks help from her neighbor (Suzanne Clement) a delicate looking teacher who only thinks she can contain Steve.One thing about Mommy: Even when Dolan hits you over the head with his themes, he puts on a show that burns in the memory with images that are unforgettable. Pilon is firing on all cylinders, but it's the tour de force from Dorval that transcends language and cultural barriers. Hers is a performance that dares you not to watch.",

      "review": "  Wunderkind Dolan (25 years old & this is his fifth movie) builds wave after wave of intensity in this shattering character study of damaged families trying their best to fit into a society which just seems impossible to navigate. Anne Dorval is amazing as the fierce and wacky Mommy who improvises her parenting and providing skills as a recent widow without much going for her but looks and love. Pilon is amazing as the explosive adolescent Steve, a singular creation for such a young actor. Dolan's sense of pacing, framing, scoring and use of music, and his work with actors is pretty remarkable. This is a career to watch.",

It was the first time I saw such approach in films, to be honest. Then, there is the actors performance, which is brilliant trough the whole movie, mainly the main actress' performance, but the performance of the main male actor is a standout to point too. This plot addresses some interesting points, such as a dysfunctional mom-son relationship ala Nornam Bates and his mother, a maladaptive behavior of a person with ADHD and its percussions to the people around him, simple themes as love, friendship. The whole movie is just filled with emotions. Not to mention the soundtrack of this film, it is indeed proper for the scenes, well chosen and great. I certainly hope to see more of these cinema art pieces from this director.",

As for this movie, I thought this movie was well-acted and shot. I find Die and Steve's relationship as a mother and son was a little frightening and very complex.

      "review": "  Small in scale, but ferocious in feeling, \"Mommy\" is another astonishing feature from writer-director Xavier Dolan. A fitting companion piece to his debut \"J'ai tu� ma mere,\" Dolan continues his exploration of combustible mother-son relationships. While Dolan mainly holds an attitude of angst toward the maternal figure in \"J'ai tu� ma mere,\" he views the mother with a far more compassionate gaze in \"Mommy.\" The eponymous matriarch is Diane 'Die' Depr�s (Anne Dorval), a widow struggling to look after her son Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon), who suffers from ADHD and other undiagnosed mood disorders. While Die looks for work, Steve is home-schooled by their reticent neighbour Kyla (Suzanne Cl�ment). The three central performers are outstanding. In Dorval and Cl�ment, Dolan has secured himself two complex and fascinating female leads. Both are expressive actresses who can communicate tremendous emotion and subtext even in the absence of dialogue. Newcomer Pilon offers contrast to their subtlety with his exuberant yet sincere performance. Steve is a heartbreaking character, who possesses this pure and unconditional love, but is often unable to express it appropriately. His frustration quickly gets distorted and fuelled into fits of rage and aggression. Dolan writes from a personal place, which often makes his work painfully honest and real. He makes these private, intimate moments not only cinematically compelling, but also emotionally resonant and relatable. There's a hand-sewn originality to Dolan's work that captivates and sets him apart as an artist.",

Both leads are captivating and you find yourself really hoping that things are going to turn out well. There is a stand out, dream / wish fulfilment sequence whether the mother finds herself imagining one possible future and the ending was unexpected, worth watching for something different from the norm.",

Though I had to pause many times just to take a break from reading the subtitles, it is a really riveting family drama full of great heavy dramatic material but still some really joyful moments including many well crafted montages. It has a weird style of cinematography being shot in a very tight frame like you are looking through a crack of a door the whole time but when it does extend into full screen, it's like you can feel the tension break in the movie. Xavier Dolan is a very interesting director that I want to look into more of his work and excited for his future work. It also has a great soundtrack including a beautiful finale involving one of my favorite songs by Lana Del Rey",

      "review": "  Perhaps Xavier Dolan's best film yet, and his most difficult to watch. Every moment is full of tension because of the 15-year-old Steve (played with charm to spare by Antoine-Olivier Pilon) who has ADHD and perhaps other behavioral issues. It is never certain when he is going to lash out in violence or some other inappropriate action. HIs mom \"Die\" (the always fantastic Anne Dorval) is forced to take him back in after he is kicked out of a youth detention center after he causes a fire that badly burns another child. Adding to the stress, she loses her job and her car is totaled. She puts on a brave and hopeful and vivacious face, but she might have some behavioral issues at well, though she is much more high functioning. After Steve nearly strangles her and she escapes to hide in a closet, the woman from across the street, Kyla (the also always fantastic Suzanne Cl�ment), intervenes and seems to have a way with him that calms him down. She soon becomes a part of their routine, providing home-schooling for Steve and another adult to engage with for Die. With Steve, though, his next behavioral outburst might be just a scene away.Dolan films the movie in a claustrophobic square frame, with huge black bars on the sides on a widescreen TV. Once in a great while, when there seems to be hope that things are turning around for the better, the frame suddenly widens to fill the full rectangle. When it tightens again...By the end of the film, it was unclear to me what other options were available for this woman and her son. It was also unclear to me exactly what was going on with Kyla, a woman of quirks that suggest a difficult recent occurrence that is never explicitly stated. Despite the difficult material and the horrifying situation, the movie is full of warmth and humor and sharp dialogue. Dolan dials back his signature artistic flourishes, but only a little, and it is always wonderful to see what he can do with his camera, filters, shots, and editing. After four of his five movies to date as writer/director/editor and sometimes actor (he does not appear in this film) he has become one of my most favorite artists. I'm looking forward to watching Tom at the Farm which comes out in the United States soon, and he is busy working on his next films, including It's Only the End of the World and his English-language debut as director, The Death and Life of John F. Donovan.",

Despite his failing memory, Holmes attempts to retrain his brain to renew his deductive capacities, and yet in the lines of McKellen's face, we see the emotional toll these additional intellectual acrobatics work on him.The mystery plot is pedestrian, with a payoff that does not rival some of the classic Holmes mysteries, but in fairness, the film is about age and its ravages, not necessarily a typical whodunit. Overall, I like this take on Holmes, though I pray that they don't take it too far with an uninspired sequel.",

On the other hand, if you're looking for superb acting and drama focused on issues of aging, look no further. It doesn't take a brilliant sleuth to reach the conclusion that \"Mr. Holmes\" is an exceptionally well made film. The acting and script are beyond compare. At times, Sir Ian McKellen seems to channel Sir John Gielgud, in all the best senses. I would be shocked if Ian McKellen does not get a nod from the Academy for his performance in what is one of the best films of 2015. Hair, makeup, costumes, locations, cinematography, sound and directing are all excellent. With a slightly mischievous score and meticulous attention to texture and color in the visuals, \"Mr. Holmes\" is an elegant and rich feast for the senses.I cannot recommend this film highly enough -- just don't watch it expecting action, adventure, or anything beyond mild mystery.",

Ian McKellen stars as an infirmed Sherlock Holmes who's retired to the countryside and is working on a memoir about his last case. McKellen's performance is rather interesting, and is quite different from the usually portrayals of the Holmes character. However the storytelling is rather weak, with a lot of nonlinear flashbacks that make the mystery kind of hard to follow. And the mystery itself doesn't seem to pose that much of a challenge or to be of any series importance. Somewhat of a subdued thriller, Mr. Holmes is a daring new interpretation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's beloved character but it's not very engaging.",

Though the reasons for making a film that shows an elderly Sherlock Holmes is initially kind of baffling, what Bill Condon has done is invigorate the narrative with a composed visual style along with a very patient (but not slow) pace that only strengthens its themes of retrospection and life.",

Otherwise, he looks after bees in his house in the country. In return, he is looked after by Mrs. Munro(Laura Linney) and her young son Roger(Milo Parker). That's because he has deep concerns about his memory, as he tries to recall his last case.Grounded by a masterful lived-in performance from Ian McKellen, \"Mr. Holmes\" has a deceptively complex story structure, namely combining several different stories and mysteries seamlessly. To that effect, the movie makes special use of time, moving backwards and forwards at will. For this deeply humanized version of the venerable character whose time has not yet completely passed him by, what matters most is setting the record straight before it is too late.",

      "review": "  Subtle, easy-going, and charming, Mr. Holmes is a pleasant diversion which will cater to certain crowds turned off by most summer fare. Largely playing like a glacially-paced BBC television movie (it was produced by BBC) the plot revolves around an elderly Sherlock Holmes living in the country, suffering with memory loss, befriending an intellectually curious young boy, tending bee hives, and occasionally having flashbacks. That's pretty much it. And that's all it really needs to be. I would be remiss not to compare this to Still Alice, which also features a protagonist with genius level intellect succumbing to Alzheimer's despite their mental tricks and stubborn refusal to surrender. (Though this is far less depressing.) A significant theme in Mr. Holmes is reality vs. myth, as Holmes tries to distinguish himself from the heavily fictionalized version with mixed results, while trying to desperately remember his last case and why he retired from his chosen profession. This is Sir Ian McKellen's show without question and an example of how excellent character acting and star power can hold most films afloat. He fits into the character like a glove and he easily could have played Sherlock Holmes decades ago, or his spiritual grandson James Bond. The flashbacks to the last case and post-war Hiroshima were interesting and the film's ending managed to complete any lingering character arcs in a way most movies utterly fail. An excellent rental or download to watch on a calm, relaxed evening with a glass of wine.",

McKellen gave me a glimpse of Sherlock Holmes in his later years. Instead of the typical confident Holmes, McKellen created a hesitant old man who'd disappeared from the limelight. He was assisted by Milo Parker, a seemingly up-and-coming actor who stood out as well. I wouldn't tell my typical summer movie fan friends to see Mr. Holmes, but it's a very good film that certain people are going to enjoy immensely.",

      "review": "  The casting of Sir Ian McKellen as an elderly Sherlock Holmes, battling the onset of dementia, is a stroke of genius. He is simply captivating in the role and totally believable as the short tempered and increasingly frustrated detective. Set in the late 1940s, Holmes has lost all of his established references and is living a lonely life in a cottage by the coast with only a housekeeper and her young son, Roger, for company. Holmes is desperate to try to combat his increasing mental frailty and embarks on a strange journey to find a cur. He is also haunted by fleeting and fractured memories of his final case. It is the persistence of Roger and the developing bond between the two that becomes central to the plot and it is beautifully played out by both McKellen and the young actor Milo Parker. This is a nicely observed movie and the viewer really sympathises with the confusion and anger that the Great Detective feels at his own increasing frailty. Gradually, he is able to pull together the missing pieces of his final engagement and make sense of his memories and, in doing so, makes peace with his past and faces up to the future with a new hope. Bill Condon, who also directed McKellen in the equally good Gods and Monsters, can be duly proud of this little gem of a movie which also has a beautiful score by Carter Burwell.",

      "review": "  As I was joined in the theater with oh so many elderly citizens, I think I kind of missed some of the intent of the themes of aging and dealing with death and mortality - but I will say the inclusion of the young boy, Roger, and his wonderment at the presence of THE Sherlock Holmes and his excitement to hang out with and help him made for a really good lens for younger audience members to get into the story - as well as injecting some energy into a slightly tedious-at-time slow burn mystery unfolding plot.I think the plot mechanic of Holmes losing his memory as he ages and trying so hard to recall the specifics of his last case, that may or may not have ended well, was a really compelling way to tell a mystery story. I think it made the final reveal and unraveling of the story really gratifying and a true hero moment, as an old man overcame his failing health - especially as he struggled to overcome the popular image being painted of him in pop culture and fiction novels by John Watson.Definitely a really solid film; great casting and performances and it weaved with really good melancholy, especially lacing in some WWII storytelling.Get to the theater and catch this one while you can!",

      "review": "  Mr Holmes is a gentle story of an aging Sherlock, struggling with remembering a case from many years before that pushed him to retire and the life he leads now. The film moves along quite well with some nimble direction and story telling, but this is not so much a story in which much happens so much as one where we learn about Ian McKellen's fantastically portrayed Holmes. With Watson's novels of their adventures having been popularized, there is fantastic insight in how Holmes tries to reconcile his faded memories against the dramatized accounts he can't relate to as being accounts of his life. There is a wonderful chemistry between him and his suffering house keeper and her son. As she wishes to leave, her son wishes to stay and find out more about the elderly Holmes and this all drives some fantastic dialogue atmosphere to frame Holmes's investigations in to his own mind. Maybe not for everyone, but a good solid piece of drama with some rewarding emotional payoff and a mystery worthy of the original books whilst avoiding any cliche.",

      "review": "  An intriguing crime-drama, Mr. Holmes explores the elderly years of the world's most famous detective. Ian McKellen stars as an infirmed Sherlock Holmes who's retired to the countryside and is working on a memoir about his last case. McKellen's performance is rather interesting, and is quite different from the usually portrayals of the Holmes character. However the storytelling is rather weak, with a lot of nonlinear flashbacks that make the mystery kind of hard to follow. And the mystery itself doesn't seem to pose that much of a challenge or to be of any series importance. Somewhat of a subdued thriller, Mr. Holmes is a daring new interpretation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's beloved character but it's not very engaging.",

His housekeeper Laura Linney and her son are his only real contacts outside of the visits of his doctor and it seems to be on fairly shaky ground until he starts forming an unlikely friendship with the son which does wonders for his memory and helps him recount his last case which he was hopping to revisit and make a more accurate dippiction of his efforts. Very decent and BBC like as one might expect with decent country side cinematography and reliable peformances that if had been released in the wintertime as opposed to late summer might have been tossed in for a token nomination or two.

      "review": "  In a lot of ways, Paddington is the epitome of the PG family-feel-good genre. Despite a very basic plot and several familiar archetypes following tried and true formulas its never a dull affair.Through masterful direction, an exceedingly clever script, imaginative set pieces and a colorful cast it quickly unravels as an undeniably entertaining experience. But it's more than that, it's friendly and wholesome without being overly sentimental. It's childish, without treating it's viewers like children. Paddington simply wins you over with smiles, laughs, warmth and ultimately, a whole lot of wit.",

      "review": "  Not having grew up with the original children's television show, I went into this film with fresh eyes, and I must say, you definitely do not have to be familiar with this story to enjoy it. Out of nowhere we receive a January film that jumps right from the screen and puts a smile on your face. Once a bear loses his father and is abandoned by his mother, he but fend for himself and find a new home in London. Meeting a family whom he begins to love, this picture deals with family loves and hardships throughout, while still managing to keep a consistently humorous tone. I must say, for most of this film, I was loving every second, until Nicole Kidman \"kidded\" it up a bit too much. She was fun to watch in the film, but her storyline felt the most tired and boring. Overall, \"Paddington\" is probably the best January film you will see this month and I highly recommend it. What a pleasant surprise!",

When his home in Peru is destroyed a young bear cub is sent to London to find a new home, and is taken in by a human family. Unfortunately the writing is rather poor, and relies mostly on stereotypes and clich�s. And the comedy is pretty rote; using a lot of standard jokes and slapstick gags. However, Paddington isn't bad really; it just uninspired and settles for being a formulaic family comedy.",

      "review": "  A kindly and laugh-filled bear hug of fun family entertainment, this British production Pads a classic children's book with a generous amount of mirth, merriment, and - yes - marmalade--just not to excess. In fact, the movie gets just about everything very right, serving the storied stories for all-ages exceedingly well. Notice the words \"all-ages,\" as this is something that the movie gets right as well. From script to cast to CGI execution, this bear boasts a bite that kids AND adults will enjoy.In this PG-rated family flick, a family befriends a talking bear (voice of Ben Whishaw) at a London train station. Oh, it assumes a lot of the same attributes that plague other half-animated kid flicks...only doesn't lose its stuffing as a result. Perhaps, the production learned what NOT to do from three failed attempt at achieving the warm 'n' fuzzies. Like Alvin & the Chipmunks and The Smurfs, it uses some juvenile potty humor but - unlike them - not to the same overbearingly sickening degree (save for one scene involving toothbrushes and ear wax...ew). For the most part, Paddington keeps it classy. Like Beverly Hills Chihuahua and Marmaduke, it uses celebrity pipes and celebrity live action performances but - unlike them - not just as gratuitous sales-over-substance selling points. Rather, Paddington's beautifully chosen talent roster services the characters letter perfectly (especially Nicole Kidman playing up the big bad to a delicious degree). Like Garfield and Yogi Bear, it keeps the action modern but - unlike them - never roots itself in disposable pop culture references. Instead, Paddington assumes a classic feel, successfully positioning itself for longevity (they even recast Ben Winshaw as Paddington after Colin Firth reportedly wasn't working in the roll, which shows its dedication to quality--not marquee quantity). A lot of the credit goes to producer David Heyman, who likewise shepherded the Harry Potter series to a beloved status in moviegoers' hearts.Bottom line: Bear Neccesity",

      "review": "  Lovely film that is touching and also at times very funny. It has something for youngsters and adults alike with some good action sequences.Paddington is forced to flee his home in Peru after what is probably the result of deforestation. A relative puts him on a boat to London after a visit many decades before from a British explorer who regaled them with stories of how welcoming and friendly it was. Upon his arrival he discovers that life in a big city can be distant and cold. That's until he meets the Browns who whilst suspicious of him in the beginning learn to accept him as a part of the family. I'm of an age and nationality that grew up with Paddington Bear and have always been a fan. This film certainly does it justice but I don't think that you have to be aware of the series to enjoy it. The cast is very good and I'm beginning to like Sally Hawkins in almost everything she turns her hand to. It has a good villain in Nicole Kidman (obvious comparisons to Cruella deVille) but one minor criticism is that I didn't think that there was enough of her.",

The London in the film isn't the one I'm familiar with but that's not surprising as it's made by the same team that made Harry Potter so the film has the same sheen. Bonneville is great as Mr Brown and is ably supported by Hawkins as his kooky spouse. The only sour note comes from Kidman as Paddington's nemesis and her story seems at odds with the charm of the rest of the film. Besides that I think Paddington is a bit of a triumph and I wouldn't be surprised to see a sequel in the pipeline soon.",

His adopted family does their best to keep the troublesome young bear at ease as they search for him to have a new family. If things were not bad enough, a villain (Nicole Kidman) is out to have him killed and stuffed. Paddington was excellent, and he was designed perfectly. The comic mishaps and film is without a doubt enjoyable for all ages and I highly recommend this film.",

At least, it wouldn't be garbage. AND BOYYYY was I right!If you're an asshole, don't go see this movie. You probably don't want to anyways. And good on you for being honest with yourself. But seriously, if you have an appreciation for really good characterization, lighthearted and silly humor, a little adventure, and some pretty quality bear animation you've gotta check this movie out. The theater I saw it in was packed with parent and their kids, and it was just really great sitting and watching with kids who were thoroughly enjoying themselves, and I was too! the movie is really quaint and doesn't pull it's punches. there's humor snuck in here and there all throughout and it's good for kids and adults. the cinematography wasn't your pretentious beautiful film ala a PTA film or other 'good' movie but it was still interesting and told a really unique story - a story of a Darkest Peruvian bear forced to head off to London and look for a home, all while avoiding being stuffed for the Natural History Museum. the real strength lies in Paddington's animation: his face is so humanly effectual, but also characteristically stoic at times. it really is something.if you find the time, go give it a chance! you'll have fun! it's cute and nice and filled with marmalade!",

Also in the movie who makes a appearance is the doctor himself known as Peter Capalidi. Who had some of the funniest scenes in the film. This is one of the most charming movies you could ever watch.",

      "review": "  A cleverly constructed film that manages to be charming and quaint whilst being silly and childish. The caricature of London is artistic and thanks to the little touches and light-hearted atmosphere, it looks and sounds great. The story does lack some cohesion and its hard (as a cynic) not to see the political undertones of immigration, but the big names are well used in their cameo roles.",

      "review": "  Probably the most enjoyable G rated movie. The only real critique is that it was sometimes too childish. Most of the gags were things like watching the bear get tangled up in sticky tape or misusing a toothbrush as an ear cleaner. Perfectly funny to a kid, but too simple for adults.For what it was though, it was oddly enjoyable. There was enough of a character arch in the family for you to actually care to see how it ended. And the villain (a taxidermist who wanted to stuff Paddington) was actually kinda evil, which made it all the more interesting. It's short and sweet (90 mins). Overall, I recommend it as a the perfect family movie. One that will keep kids throughly entertained and hold parents interest all the way through.",

      "review": "  Paddington, a small little Peruvian bear with a big heart and an extremely fuzzy face. Paddington the movie is the big screen film all about well Paddington the bear whose quest to live in London is both heart warming and pretty funny, I do though find some parts of this not that great. Featuring a cast with the likes of Hugh Bonneville, Nicole Kidman and Julie Walters the film you would think and many do that this is a great old romp and one for the ages, for all ages yes very true but I did feel this a little basic, don't get me wrong it is perfectly OK and I would recommend it but I still expected more from a movie with such high praise.Basically Paddington is a bear going to seek a home in London because his auntie told him to; we then follow him as he becomes a stowaway on a long trip to stereotypically rainy London where he comes across a family of various personalities. Hugh Bonneville's character Henry Brown is the dad and is very stuck up, works in risk assessment and his work follows him everywhere he goes. The mum Mary (Sally Hawkins) is really quite free and not like her husband at all for that matter, she is really the one who welcomes Paddington with open arms. We then have the children Judy and Jonathan with Judy being a teenager completely embarrassed by her family and not exactly happy by the furry arrival.Paul King directs and brings a very fast tone, the movie speeds along like a bullet and every scene seems to suddenly become an adventure in itself. I think a lot of the things I did like about this come from the writing also from King, it is funny and every joke is set up in a way that not only the kids will laugh at. On that previous point I think one massive part of the appeal of this movie is the point that this is for adults too and charming and humorous enough to be enjoyed truly by all the family. Like I said at the beginning this movie does feel pretty basic, I mean the story plays out pretty normally, the main characters all go in the exact direction you'd predict, but I think what made people like this was the heart to it. This is one movie where I think the trailer truly made peoples expectations a lot lower so when they came round to watching it they found it a pleasant surprise. Now don't get me wrong it is fun all the way through but still I feel this nowhere near as excellent as some proclaim, but take nothing away from it, this is still a satisfactory experience.Overall Paddington is a movie I would say go and watch, and if you have kids then even more so because not only you might enjoy it but the young one's will too. I also want to add some more on the acting, basically from a concluding point Peter Capaldi is the best of the cast in his role as the always complaining Mr Curry, Nicole Kidman is not good in her role as Millicent the museum taxidermist, she felt too dull in her role and very atypical of the kind of character she is playing, I'm not saying she is completely to blame, the character is just not a good one.",

At no point did she throw her hands up in the air like \"WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU\" - she didn't look significantly different from before after her reconstructive surgery so it seemed very strange to me that he meant so much to her that she wouldn't give up trying to be subtle with him.The other thing I really loved about the film came during the entire third act and ESPECIALLY THE END. What a button. Credits roll and you want to cheer for her character. Definitely worth your frustrations with her character for such a stinging end.",

At no point did she throw her hands up in the air like \"WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU\" - she didn't look significantly different from before after her reconstructive surgery so it seemed very strange to me that he meant so much to her that she wouldn't give up trying to be subtle with him.The other thing I really loved about the film came during the entire third act and ESPECIALLY THE END. What a button. Credits roll and you want to cheer for her character. Definitely worth your frustrations with her character for such a stinging end.",

It doesn't matter how desperate anyone is to get back a semblance of the life that used to exist before the concentration camps; there's no coming back from that. When she arrives, she notices her reflection in shards of glass. She shudders as a train goes by, hauling those awful carts. The identity of the woman and the nation in which she lives has been changed forever, and in order to move on, she must build something entirely new. She can't forget the past, but must look forward anyway.",

      "review": "  It's hard to think of a more emotionally grueling and uplifting movie this year than Room. It drops you right into a scary world and, thanks to its carefully balanced tone, the film eschews sensationalism and gets at the beating heart of its survival story, namely the love and protection of a mother for her son. It is an emotionally powerful story that hits the big moments, the small moments, and everything in between. It left me analyzing it and rethinking it for hours, the repercussions still reverberating through me. Ma (Brie Larson) has been held in a single soundproof room for seven years, the captive of an older man who is termed \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers). Complicating matters is that Ma has a five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) born into this captivity. It is the only world he's known. To spare him the full horror of their circumstances, Ma has created an elaborate world for him that only exists in Room. After his fifth birthday, Ma tries speaking honestly to her son, lifting the veil of kind fabrications. Together they will scheme to escape their one-room world, but it comes with tremendous cost. It would be easy to fall onto the more seemly elements of this harrowing story and linger on just how bad things are and the horrifying lengths that Ma has to go through to survive. Director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) doesn't have to wallow in depravity to get its point across. There's a sensitivity that manages to temper some of the abuse in a manner that won't make you run out of the room screaming. When Old Nick enters the room for his special time with Ma, we don't need explicit detail to understand what is happening and what Ma is shielding Jack from by demanding he stay in the closet. The reality of their captivity is enough without underlining the worst of the worst for the lowest common denominator. The emotional weight of everything is clear without having to be bludgeoned. The implications are always just peaking around the corners from the safer version of reality Ma has proposed to protect her child. As the audience, we can see the cracks, we can see her front, and we can see the effort and the toll it's taking on Ma. The stakes are clear as well, and so when Ma is instructing Jack and preparing him on their joint escape plan, you'll start to feel waves of anxiety travel through your body. I was shaking with suspense that something could go wrong but also because Ma and Jack are such vulnerable characters that rely upon one another completely. I knew what was going to happen in broad strokes but I was still on the edge of my seat and that's because the movie made me deeply care about the characters and their plight. The escape scene was on par with some of the better suspense sequences in the equally brilliant Sicario. It's not really a spoiler to say that Ma and Jack do get out of their one-room prison because the second half of the film deals with the ongoing consequences and challenges of adjustment. We'd like to think that we can be plugged into our old lives after spending time away, but that's just not how things work, let alone for people who have experienced substantial psychological and physical trauma. Ma is struggling to readjust to her old life under the care of her mother, Nancy (Joan Allen). She looks through old high school pictures and you can tell she laments \"what could have been\" and even bears some resentment for her old friends who got to live the lives she should have had. Just because she's free doesn't mean she's better. Her father Robert (William H. Macy), since divorced from Ma's mother, can't even look at Jack because of the pain it causes; Jack is a child of rape, but Ma demands he be acknowledged as her flesh-and-blood, and even that can be too much too soon for Robert. He's more about seeking justice through the courts and as a result stays on the peripheral of the story for most of the movie. There is no exact time table for PTSD and Ma goes through highs and lows, none lower than when pressed with the question of why she held onto Jack after he was born. Would he not have had a better life in someone else's care, assuming Old Nick would have abandoned him rather than kill his own blood? It's a hard question and it stings. For an obviously punishing story about the worst of humanity, I am not kidding when I say Room is an uplifting film. The darkness is easy to identify and Old Nick is a fearsome and all too real antagonist, one who could roam our very streets in anonymity. However, what stays with me several days after watching Room is not the suffering but the resiliency of spirit, the knack human beings have to persevere amidst the worst. Ma's recovery is rockier but more understandable for us to trace and relate with. Hers is an experience where she can finally begin to focus on something other than her child's safety and deliverance, namely her own well-being. For Jack, there is no playbook. He's spent his entire life inside a small room and never seen the outside world. His sense of understanding has been extremely limited and yet his sense of exploration is alive. Jack slowly and surely builds trusting relationships with Ma's relatives, engaging in other activities, and acclimating to his new surroundings, reforming his sense of the world. It's ultimately Jack who is able to make the greatest breakthrough to his mother, and it's this moment of sacrifice and love that unleashed the last torrent of my tears. Previously I had cried two times over the horrors and Ma's love as her strength, and it was this final moment, this sharing of his \"Strong,\" that let loose the happy tears. It should go without saying but Larson gives an exceptionally powerful performance. After 2013's stupendous Short Term 12, I knew this actress was destined for great things, especially the way she can zero in on a character and inhabit them fully. With Ma (she's never given any other name) Larson is able to convey a multitude of emotions, many of which she has to hide from her son out of loving deference. He can't know just how scared and exhausted she is, though these emotions do take over at time. Larson is tremendous as she exhumes maternal might as she does everything in her power to save the two of them. Early on, she's the character we empathize with the most because she's had her world taken from her and hoping to return. She's so resourceful, from the way she's able to answer her son's questions about the world, to the way she's able to practice and drill their escape plan to a child with no concept of \"outside,\" this is a powerful woman driven by the instinct to endure. When Larson's fa�ade breaks down with Jack, that's when the movie started stabbing me like daggers. In the second half, her character has a long road to go to recovery, if that's even an appropriate word, and Larson gives sensitive and empathetic consideration to every exhausted development. She is easily going to be the one to beat this year for the Best Actress Oscar.Paired with Larson is the remarkably natural child actor Jacob Tremblay, and his performance is worthy of awards consideration itself. At first his worldview is precocious because of how unique it is, which makes him more a figure of fascination than tragedy. He's bright and active with the world around him, turning household items into useful toys and emotional attachments. The film uses parts of his narration to give better insight into just how he's processing the world he knows versus the world as it exists. These bouts of narration never come across as cloying. As the movie continues, he learns more about how his preconceptions of the world are wrong, but he's more intrigued than frightened. During the escape plan, when Jack gets to see the outside world for the first time, it's a transcendent emotional moment. His guarded behavior around others is necessary as Jack builds positive associations with men who are not Old Nick. Tremblay is utterly magnificent; there is no hint of artifice to his performance, which is especially rewarding considering his is a role that could have been suffocated with eccentricities and tics. You feel like you're watching a child grow before you through supportive nurturing. Within the first twenty minutes of watching Room I already knew this was one of the best films of 2015. It just connects so vividly and succinctly, effortlessly powerful and yet skillfully avoiding sensationalism and exploitation while telling an entertaining survival story that still resonates with emotional truth. The performances from mother and son are outstanding and Larson and Tremblay form a heroic duo that take hold of your heart. It doesn't mitigate the darkness or the cruel realities of its premise but Room also doesn't dwell in the darkness, castigating its characters as hapless victims forever broken from their incalculable suffering. They are resourceful and resilient and while their trauma is will not be forgotten it is not the one defining moment of their burgeoning lives. It may sound maudlin but it is the power of love that resonates the longest with Room. That love at first is about protecting the innocent, and then it transforms into healing and acceptance. I hope everybody gets a chance to see Room, a remarkable film with two remarkable performances and plenty to say about the humanizing benefit of love. Nate's Grade: A",

      "review": "  Simple yet profound, small yet grande, \"Room\" is one of the most complex and thought-provoking films I have seen in a very long time. Maybe not complex to everyone, if you look at the imagery, camerawork, and script choices, there really is something incredible here. After being raised in a room for five years, with no outdoor contact, Jack and his Ma Joy escape and see daylight for the first in a long time. Told through the perspective of the child, he is seeing the world, people, objects, and nature, all for the first time. The emotional impact that has on the story is breathtaking. Brie Larson gives a gut-wrenching performance and I believed every single scene she was in. Starting from a confined room, you really begin to see what the world is truly like and how we take everything for granted that is in it. I loved \"Room\" from start to finish. Although I believe this is a brilliant film overall, I have to complain about the way they were able to escape. It felt a little too easy and then that tension was gone throughout the rest of the film in order to focus on the emotional heft, i.e. the family. In the end, \"Room\" has a very raw and true screenplay, incredible performances, inspiring visuals, and a story that is once in a generation, and we do not get many of those. I wish it did not have an easy way out in the opening act, but overall, I feel I can still give it a perfect score. See this film!",

      "review": "  Room is a masterwork that tells a story of captivity and the wonders of the real world. Its a very sad story, but also a hopeful one. Brie Larson gives one of the best performances I have seen in quite a long time. She is a revelation. Her dark, truthful, scared and emotional performance is something truly fascinating. She puts her soul into this character, and it pays off in spades. A few months ago I honestly didn't know much of her, but now I see her as one of the most promising new actresses in the business. Jacob Tremblay further proves my belief that child actors can truly make our jaws drop. Tremblay deserves all the praise in the world for his heartwarming and complex performance, completely capturing the mindset of a young boy being introduced to the world for the first time. Its something truly spectacular, and I kept going back and forth trying to decide if he or Larson stole the show. They both really worked perfectly together. Joan Allen is another underrated performance, as she gives a sweet and loving performance as the grandmother. Her giving a brilliant performance as a mother who lost her daughter and attempts to have a relationship with her grandson is heartwarming. The script from Emma Donoghue is something truly spectacular. She gives us a terrifying real look into the minds of these characters and bringing life to their situation. There was a moment halfway through the film that had me in tears and cheering. Its amazing that a fictional story could feel so much like a true story. Director Lenny Abrahamson",

      "review": "  STUCK HOME SYNDROME - My Review of ROOM (4 Stars)Don't let the bright wonderment of the poster fool you, ROOM is one of the most emotionally devastating films of the year, anchored by beyond stellar performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, a young Canadian actor whose focus and range rivals that of Tatum O'Neal in PAPER MOON. Prepare to be gutted. It's almost impossible to describe this film without spoilers, but I'll do just that. If you've read Emma Donoghue's novel, of which she adapted for the screen, then you already know the basic premise of a mother (Larson) raising her 5-year-old son, Jack (Tremblay) in a tiny room. Shielding him from the world for reasons that become clear upon viewing, he doesn't know that any type of life exists beyond his four walls. Think of this as a much more emotionally vibrant and more honest sister film to LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, which also explored the lengths a parent will go to in order to protect their child. Much of the first half of this film is fraught with unbearable suspense, with the mother doing everything she can to resolve their situation. Danny King, whose work on LES MISERABLES did not make me a fan, employs a live camera and a lot of shallow focus to put the point of view squarely on the shoulders of our two protagonists. Yes, it's a claustrophobic experience, but to feel otherwise would be doing the subject matter a disservice. Director Lenny Abrahamson has made an intimate film about big ideas, and there's very smart economy in its storytelling. It's overlong by at least 20-30 minutes, however, and with such a generous running time of almost two hours, you would expect a little more to William H. Macy's lightly sketched in, barely there character. It's not that he's incapable, but he's given way too little to work with here. Not so of Joan Allen, who digs deep with limited screen time as well. Also tremendously effective in supporting roles are Sean Bridgers, who has a knack for keeping an audience on edge, Wendy Crewson as a journalist who prods just a little bit too much, and Amanda Brugel, as a woman who has to assert herself in order to cut through the muck. I could have done without the tin can-style of recording the voiceover, which certainly feels unsettling, but was truly difficult to comprehend at times. The score by Stephen Rennicks is certainly beautiful and heartfelt, but he could have dialed it back a hair with the final music cue. There was so much sap in it, I was tempted to call the film MUSHROOM! Far from it, this is a challenging experience, often seen through tears, and not an easy sit for any parent who worries about their child. Larson and Tremblay should be firmly in the mix come Awards season. Larson continually surprises me with her performances. Looking like Reese Witherspoon's sister, I keep expecting her to act goofy and self-conscious, yet her instincts are so vibrantly attuned to the material, she seems incapable of making a false move. Whether he has natural abilities or was heavily directed, Tremblay is a highly sympathetic actor whose ability to annoy, infuriate and warm an audience's heart, sometimes within the same scene, is something special to behold. ROOM is very dark, sad, and sometimes without a shred of hope, yet this tale of a Herculean bond between mother and son is well worth all the sobbing you'll likely find yourself doing afterwards.",

Though Room has a few minor errors, such as a final act that feels like it could have benefitted from an additional scene or two of development, there are very few films that have had me as emotionally invested in a story as Room, making it one of the best movies of the year.

      "review": "  Based on a bestselling Emma Donnaghue novel, Room (not to be confused with the cult B-movie THE Room) tells the morbid story of a young woman who was kidnapped, held inside a small, soundproof dungeon of a room, raped, and gave birth to her captor's child. The film opens up in medias res with this young mother in her seventh year of captivity, trying to survive in squalid conditions with her young son and teach him about a world he has never seen. The first act shows some of the most claustrophobic and focused filmmaking this year. We are stuck with these characters in this doomed situation, with only hints of the outside world. Brie Larson impresses us as the young woman who was denied years of her life and we see how her imprisonment and its aftermath have worn on her. Jacob Tremblay also deserves some recognition for convincingly playing a boy who has never traveled more than five feet from where he was born and never met a person other than his mother. Room loses steam toward the end and fails to recapture the engrossing magic that had us at the edge of our seat for the first 35 minutes, but it still has a simple and definitive end that most awards season fare denies the audience. A must see.",

It's dramatic, emotional, suspenseful and a phenomenal film. The story is intense and heartbreaking (times 4 or 5). The acting performances of Brie Larson and young Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscar recognition. While I haven't seen all the performances nominated thus far, young Jacob Tremblay is jaw-dropping. I was excited to see Brie Larson, one of my favorites, finally show her stuff, and that she did. I hope she gets the win. However, Jacob blew me away. There were no words to describe how incredible his performance is for someone so young. Better than any adult actor I've seen this year. I'm serious. There is an incredible career in the making there. The screenplay, based on the novel of the same name, is beautiful. Aside from one scene that bugged me a little, the dialogue is so real. The director did a masterful job pulling the screenplay, performances and the perspective of \"Room\" against the much larger world Brie and Jacob are denied for so long.

      "review": "  How many times in your life have you been forced to finish a bad movie, book, or story, all the while just wishing it would end? Rarely is that longing as desperate in our reality as it is for the characters in Room. When Jack screams at his Ma, \"I want a different story!\", you know there's more to it than just a hunger for a different bedtime yarn. Her response, \"No! This is the story you get!\", punctuates their situation, and ultimately our own desires, with such force it nearly knocked me out. Room, a powerhouse of horrifying drama and real-life suspense, breaks out from its confining premise with enough gentle moments of love to make it one of the year's best.If you can't tell, I'm being careful with the details of the plot. However, know that it's a setup that's about as bleak as one can imagine. Director Abrahamson (maker of the criminally underrated Frank) creates an atmosphere of intensely palpable desperation in his small sets. In lesser hands, Room could've been either an oppressively gloomy downer or dishonestly optimistic hack-job. Instead, it's both strikingly candid and beautifully grace-filledThis compassion for its subjects is thanks in no small part to the much-deserved-Oscar-nominated Larson, and young actor Tremblay. His character, in particular, presents such a powerful look at childish na�vet�, he gives us one of the most amazing examples childhood trauma and perseverance I've ever seen. That theme (determination through suffering) creates an experience that harbors as much exhilaration as it does tears. Piercing and gut-wrenching, Room is a film you may want to escape, but will be glad you endured.",

Instead the movie mainly relies on the love of a mother for her son and her ability to go through almost anything just to keep her son alive and well. The acting is brilliant, especially Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley (this boy is definitely going places!). It is a bittersweet movie, hard to watch at times, but a great piece of modern cinema. 4/5 stars",

He is how we experience and learn about the world that is Room. Though I'm not gaga over the film I did enjoy what was presented and how it was presented.

But somehow they pulled it off and made one of the beast movies of the year! It was great to see how the story unfold and how exciting, heartbreaking and harrowing it was told. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are fantastic and have great chemistry together. Also a shout out to Joan Allen doing great job as Brie Larson's Grandma. It can be really sad but could have been really depressing where it is almost unwatchable, but there is so much hope and that is where it really shines!",

Oyelowo could and should have easily swept awards season (since McConaissance wasn't in the picture :-P) with his resonant basso and gut-rumbling delivery of MLK's marcato articulation. His dynamic gestures as well as his wide, knowing eyes carry the wins and losses of the Selma protest march and almost foreshadows the tragedy to come. Ava DuVernay's perceptive direction interweaves several concurrent threads: from the earth-shattering bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, to Annie Lee Cooper's stalwart struggles to vote, to MLK and Coretta Scott's marital strife.",

      "review": "  Combined review of Selma (2014) and Black or White (2014).There's a reason that race is regarded as the \"third rail\" when it comes to American politics. A half-century after the marches and protests, chief among them the influence of Martin Luther King Jr., the world feels just as fractious as ever when it comes to race relations. The inauguration of America's first black president was seen as a significant touchstone, but optimism has faded and recent headline-grabbing criminal cases, and the absence of indictments, have prompted thousands to voice their protest from assembly to street corner. Race relations are one of the thorniest issues today and will be for some time. Two recent films take two very different approaches to discussing race relations, and they're clearly made for two very different audiences. Selma is an invigorating, moving, and exceptional film showcasing bravery and dignity. Where Selma is complex, Black or White is a simplified and misguided sitcom writ large. In 1965, Alabama was the epicenter for the Civil Rights movement. Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) has his sights set on organizing a march from Selma to the sate capital in Montgomery. His wife, Coretta (Carmen Ejogo), is worried about the safety of their children, as death threats are sadly common for MLK. He needs to turn the tide of public perception to light a fire under President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to get him to prioritize legislation that would protect every citizen's right to vote. Without question, Selma is one of the finest films of 2014. It is powerful, resonant, nuanced, political, immediate, and generally excellent on all fronts. It's a rarity in Hollywood, namely a movie about the Civil Rights movements without a prominent white savior. This is a film about the ordinary and famous black faces on the ground fighting in the trenches for their freedoms. There are compassionate white people who heed the call, don't get me wrong, but this is a movie told from the black perspective. I suspect the portrayal of President Johnson had something to do with Selma's poor showing with the Oscars, though I can't fully comprehend why. Yes, Johnson is portrayed as a man who has to be won over, but he's on MLK's side from the beginning. He is not opposed to legislation to protect voting rights; he's just hesitant about the timing. Johnson says, \"You got one issue I got 100,\" and the pragmatic reality of pushing forward legislation through a divided Congress was real. Johnson was not opposed to MLK's wishes; he just wanted him to wait until the political process would be easier. In fact, in my eyes, Johnson comes across as compassionate, politically savvy, and he clearly makes his stakes on which side of history he's going to be associated when he has a sit-down with the obstinate Alabama governor, George Wallace (Tim Roth). Like the rest of the varied characters in Selma, it's a nuanced portrayal of a man in the moment.The march in Selma is a moment that seems like an afterthought in the narrative of the Civil Rights movement, dwarfed by the Montgomery bus boycott and the March on Washington. The movie does a great job of re-examining why this moment is history is as significant, an eye-opening moment for the nation to the brutal reality of oppression. The opposition is entrenched, thanks to a stagnant system that wants to hold onto its \"way of life.\" It just so happens that way of life meant very different things for black people. The movie is politically sharp, with dissenting perspectives arguing over the next course of action in Selma and the national stage. Selma is another in the current crop of biopics eschewing the standard cradle-to-grave approach to highlight a significant moment that highlights exactly who their central figure is (Lincoln, Invictus). With Selma, we get a battleground that allows us to explore in both micro and macro MLK, the man. The courage of ordinary citizens in the face of violent beatdowns and police bullying is effortlessly moving and often heartbreaking. There is a moment when an elderly man, reflecting upon a recent family tragedy, cannot find words to express his grief, and my heart just ached right then and there. I teared up at several points, I don't mind saying.There isn't a moment where I didn't feel that director Anna DuVernay (Middle of Nowhere) was taking the easy road or pulling her punches. The screenplay respects the intelligence of the audience to sift through the politics and the arguments, to recognize when MLK is igniting a spark, and just how complicated and fragile the Selma situation was back then. Here's a movie ostensibly about MLK but spends much of its time on the lesser known individuals like James Bevel and Congressman John Lewis, who walked alongside the man, taking time to flesh them out as people rather than plot points. MLK's wife is also given an important part to play and she's much more than just being Wife of Great Man. DuVernay's direction is impeccable; you feel like she has command over every frame. The sun-dappled cinematography by Bradford Young (A Most Violent Year) makes great use of shadows, often bathing its subjects in low-light settings. The score is rousing without being overpowering, just like every other technical aspect. This is a prime example of Hollywood filmmaking with vision and drive. With respect to the Academy, it's hard for me to imagine there being five better performances than the one Oyelowo (Lee Daniels' The Butler) delivers as the indomitable Martin Luther King Jr. It is rare to see an actor inhabit his or her character so completely, and Oyelowo just sinks into the skin of this man. You never feel like you're watching an actor but the living embodiment of history made flesh. This is a complex performance that shows refreshing degrees of humanity for a figure sanctified. He was a man first and foremost, and one prone to doubts and weaknesses as well. An excellent scene with top-notch tension and peak emotion involves MLK and Coretta listening to a supposed tape of Martin's infidelity. In the ensuing tense conversation, both parties acknowledge the reality of his affairs. It's a scene that's underplayed, letting the audience know she knows, and he knows she knows, but not having to rely upon large histrionics and confrontations. It's the behind-the-scenes moments with King that brought him to life for me, watching him coordinate and plan where to go with the movement. Oyelowo perfectly captures his fiery inspirational side, knocking out every single speech with ease. It's a performance of great nuance and grace, where you see the fear in the man's eyes as he steps forward, hoping he's making the best decision possible for those in desperation. There isn't one bad performance in the entire film, and this is a deep supporting cast including Wendell Pierce (HBO's The Wire), Tessa Thompson (Dear White People), Common, Giovanni Ribisi, Dylan Baker, Lorraine Toussaint (Netflix's Orange is the New Black), Stephen Root, Cuba Gooding Jr, Jeremy Strong, and Oprah Winfrey. It's been weeks now since I watched Selma but there are still many moments that I can recall that still have a tremendous power on me even in mere recollection. The opening sequence of the Birmingham bombing, a moment of horror frozen in chaos and debris, is a gut punch of a way to begin a movie about human beings fighting for equality. The sheer brutality of the response from the Selma police force and associates is horrifying, and a true pivot point for the movement in the eyes of the public. More so than anything else, Selma brilliantly and beautifully recreates the suffocating reality of injustice that was so prevalent for many African-American citizens, especially in the South. This is an era where people are being lynched with impunity just for being \"uppity.\" There was a supreme danger in simply standing up for equal rights, and many suffered as a result. The movie recreates this mood, this permeating feeling of dread and outrage and sorrow, so expertly and so artfully. From an early scene with a middle-aged black woman jumping through hoop after arbitrary hoop just to register to vote, you quickly realize that this vehemently hostile environment was never going to settle things on their \"own time,\" as apologists are prone to citing in lieu of federal intervention. Selma makes it abundantly clear why MLK felt the movement just could not wait, as Johnson requested. People are senselessly dying and being beaten al for the right to fairly vote. You feel the same sense of urgency with every scene, whether it's cold-blooded murder, noxious intimidation, or reciprocation that goes above and beyond any sense of responsibility, you understand exactly the terror it was to be black in the South during this time period.Another potent point of acclaim for Selma is how relevant it is to our own world today. While 12 Years a Slave was an often stirring and very professionally made biopic that exposed the ugly reality of slavery, it was not a film that screamed \"immediacy.\" Slavery ended in this country over 150 years ago, and while we're still dealing with the repercussions of treating other human beings as property, it's an easy film to dismiss in a backhanded, \"Well, that was so long ago, and we've come so far\" manner. The actions of Selma and MLK are still being felt to this day. We live in a world where many feel the justice system has its own separate-but-equal division, and the recent controversial grand jury decisions in the cases of Michael Brown and Eric Garner cannot be ignored. The reality for many black men in this country is statistically far more dangerous than others, fueled by a culture of entrenched racial bias that assumes the worst at first. The transit officer who executed Oscar Grant (detailed in the harrowing 2013 film Fruitvale Station) served eleven months in prison for a crime that had scads of witnesses. Garner's death is captured on video, and yet even the Staten Island coroner's report of \"homicide,\" wasn't enough to convince a grand jury that there was sufficient cause to at least go to trial. It's been noted that prosecutors could get a grand jury to \"indict a ham sandwich.\" According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, of the 30,000 cases that were not prosecuted in this country, only 11 were because a grand jury did not return an indictment (.0004%). However, grand juries rarely indict when a police officer is accused (In Dallas between 2008 and 2012, there were 81 grand jury investigations of officer shootings and only one actual indictment). It's hard not to feel like these things don't add up.Then there's the all-important struggle of voting, central to Selma and the plight of African-Americans in the South. You would think with Johnson's passage of the Voting Rights Act that we wouldn't be litigating the same issues of the past, but the Supreme Court determined that this country is far different then it was in the 1960s and there was no need for the Voting Right Act today. Within hours of striking it down, scads of new legislation appeared in the (primarily Southern) states that had been limited beforehand because of their past history of discrimination. The right to vote is just as relevant as it was during MLK's time and there are forces trying to stifle that right, to throw up new obstacles, new hoops, new challenges, all in the name of \"polling security,\" never mind that the cases of in-person voter fraud are so rare as to be one in every 15 million voters. It's a solution without a cause, and it's why many see it as a disingenuous political ploy. It's the twentieth-century, and yet the struggle for equality frustratingly repeats too many of the same battles. It's this historical and contemporary context that gives Selma its extra surge of relevancy, of reminding how far we still have to go, reminding the world that MLK's work is by no means complete and that it is up to the rest of the populace to fight for the kind of country that he spoke of in his \"I Have a Dream\" speech.It is this complex, complicated, and dire reality that hobbles another movie that tackles modern-day race relations, Mike Binder's imprudent Black or White. The plot of the film, inspired by a true story reportedly, centers on Kevin Costner as Elliot Anderson, a rich lawyer who has custody over his biracial granddaughter Eloise (the angelically adorable Jillian Estell). Now that Elliot has lot his wife, Eloise's other grandmother, Rowena Jeffers (Octavia Spencer), wants joint custody so Eloise can spend time around \"her own people.\" The two of them push and pull and lock horns over what's best for their grandchild, which gets more complicated when her biological father (Andre Holland, who is actually in Selma as well) comes back into the picture. Right away you can tell very early on that there will not be anything approaching subtlety in the world of Black or White, its own title serving as the first clue. The characters are sketched broad and the premise feels like a weird mishmash of Archie Bunker appearing in a court drama. And because it ends up becoming a court drama, you know where a majority of its third act will be spent. It's a preachy movie that doesn't have a deft hand when it comes to crafting a message that rises above easy observations disguised as something deeper. Eloise's father, Reggie, is so poorly underwritten that he feels like he stepped off the set of some after school special. He's addicted to crack, a lifelong screw-up, and a general disappointment that has never been present for his daughter's life. He even smokes crack out in the open on the front porch across the street from where his mother lives. At one point, Anthony Mackie's character berates Reggie for being a walking stereotype. Just because Binder calls attention to it doesn't excuse it. But he's not alone, because Spencer's sassy black matriarch character and Costner's gruff and frequently soused character are right there with him. The frequent arguments feel like they should be punctuated by studio audience hoots and applause, that is, if you could hear them over Terrence Blanchard's relentlessly overpowering musical score instructing the audience exactly how to feel with every clunky moment.In a way, the overbearing musical score gets at the major problem of Black or White, which is that a complicated case is being told from the safest point of view. Elliot is more akin to Clint Eastwood's character from Gran Torino then, say, Archie Bunker. He's irritable and prejudiced and old-fashioned and wary but balks if you call him a bigot. I mean he's polite to his Hispanic housekeeper. The more you examine the character you more you realize this is a movie designed to coddle an older generation (my tiny theater was packed with patrons over 60). The movie doesn't challenge anybody and actually rewards Costner's character and his outdated viewpoints. The opening conflict over his refusal to share custody with Rowena makes no sense. She's an excellent grandmother, caring, nurturing, a fine role model as well for her perseverance and starting several small businesses out of her home. Not only that but Rowena is surrounded by a large family of relatives that adore Eloise. It's contrived that these two could not agree on shared custody when they both have much to offer the girl. The only way any of this works is if Reggie is somehow responsible for the death of Eloise's mom. Perhaps he introduced her to crack and she overdosed. Unfortunately, it's never explained in the slightest, and so Elliot's hostility for the entire Jeffers clan seems petulant, especially with the happiness of his granddaughter in the balance. Without better context, his rampant anger seems to be guilt-by-association overkill. To his credit, Rowena has a major and annoying blind spot when it comes to Reggie's stability as a parent. In fact he's so obviously still on drugs that her ongoing refusal to accept reality harms her character irreparably.I the end, Black or White isn't so much a film that about race relations as it is about privilege. Costner's would-be bigot doesn't have a problem with black people, just as long as those black people abide by his rules of conduct and expectation. It's the same kind of qualification he's never had to consider for himself, and one the intended audience will likewise miss. He comes from a wealthy position and Rowena and her family are likely lower middle class at best. He has a world of class privilege at his disposal that the loving Jeffers family does not, and because of that he feels they are less suited to raising little Eloise. Perhaps he's worried about Reggie re-entering her life, but what animates Eliot Anderson is spite. He's consumed with the overriding assumption that he must be right in all things. While the film draws many heavy-handed parallels between Reggie's drug abuse and Eliot's alcoholism, it clearly presents the both of them on completely different planes of judgment. One of them is ultimately redeemable and the other less so. Eliot's perspective is essentially he can provide more and therefore more has to be better, but his definition of more is a private school, a housekeeper, a tutor who is treated as a caricature of initiative. Rowena provides a large and loving support system, but apparently they are less valued in the eyes of Eliot. And if you needed any more of a clue that Eliot and his sense of privilege are the unbeknownst star of the movie, he gets to deliver the big speech at the end that Says Something Meaningful. It feels a bit odd that the one character that uses the N-word in the film (albeit there is context) is the one telling lower-class black families how to live. I don't doubt the sincerity of writer/director Mike Binder; I don't think he purposely made a film to make older primarily white Americans feel better about thinking what they do about these troublesome times. It's not a nefarious movie but it is misguided and will provide cover for a certain selection of audience members who wonder why nobody is asking the old white guys their opinions on modern race relations. Even overlooking this charge, Black or White is just overblown melodrama that has to constantly explain everything to you at all times and guide you through every strained point. Selma and Black or White are both aiming at hearts and minds, looking to add to the conversation on contemporary race relations, but only one of them works as both an eye-opening message of empathy and as an exceptionally made film itself.

      "review": "  Martin Luther King organizes protests against Alabama's unequal voting laws.One of the best films of the year, Selma features a profoundly affecting performance by David Oleyowo, a wonderful script filled with rousing speeches and perfectly composed scenes, and some interesting directing choices by Ava DeVernay. Oleyowo was certainly robbed of a Best Actor nod as he embodies King's compassion, heroism, and flaws. His rousing speeches, with pitch-perfect delivery, could compel even the most hard-hearted out of his/her chair, and one scene in particular, where King visits the father of a slain protester, is so well-written and well-played, that despite its subdued tenor, still manages to be deeply haunting. DeVernay often frames her actors in the smallest corner of her shots, and while I didn't understand the reason for these choices, I found myself liking her choices.Overall, this is an important film without \"insisting upon itself,\" truly moving and compelling filmmaking.",

      "review": "  There is not a misstep in this entire picture! Had to honor Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy on the holiday dedicated to him. The Golden Globes gave Ava DuVernay and David Oyelowo nominations. It is a shame the Oscars didn't nominate more people involved in this film. Oyelowo delivers King's powerful speeches well. He also shows King's human doubt and the film briefly explores King's infidelity to his wife played by the stunning and bright Carmen Ejogo. The ensemble cast is multifaceted and this important period of history was a great one to portray on the screen. It is a more important lesson to listen to African American leadership, rather than denying it and trying to maintain white control over HIStory (the white male story). It is surely not beyond reason to see that political red tape and maneuvering could have caused President Johnson to repeatedly delay speaking about legislation that activist Martin Luther King, Jr. wanted action on much earlier. The marches King led definitely changed the nation and brought many people together, though there is still work to be done.",

      "review": "  With this movie, director Ava DuVernay crafts a remarkable feat of telling the story of the protest marches in Selma, Al in 1965 that resulted in the historic Voting Rights Act from as many points of view as possible while keeping the issues that are still relevant front and center through some electric debate scenes. At the focus of the action is Dr. Martin Luther King(David Oyelowo, who is superb). But this not St. Martin we are talking about here. Rather, what we get is a rather human interpretation, with King having serious doubts and haunted by thoughts of mortality. So, it is no wonder that at the moment of his greatest triumph, namely about to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, he confides to his wife Coretta(Carmen Ejogo) about the possibility to start over at a country parish. But even then, he still goes on to serve as an inspiration to so many, with the film also recognizing the acts of everyday courage and heroism that took to make the marches possible.Where \"Selma\" falters is in the White House scenes and not in the way you may have been led to believe. Aside from the specifics, on the one hand, you can see the beginning of the rift between King and President Johnson(Tom Wilkinson) that would widen as Vietnam would consume Johnson's presidency and which war King would oppose vociferously. At the same time, these scenes are undermined by a woefully miscast Wilkinson who can never quite get the right Texan intonation. And the referred to, but never seen White House demonstrations, only serve to have the movie's modest budget serve as a distraction.",

      "review": "  Selma is a masterpiece, and I don't use that word lightly. Powerful doesn't begin to describe this movie. It seems every year we get some sort of film that touches on racism but no movie I have personally seen has effected me quite like this. This tale of Martin Luther King Jr. doesn't follow his entire life, but it doesn't need to. It follows a very important moment in his fight for equal rights in Selma, Alabama to give blacks the same rights to vote as whites. While the story was indeed engaging and had me in it from start to finish, its the respect they give the characters that really shines. David Oyelowo delivers a tour de force performance as the great man himself, but it was his interaction with his followers and the grand speeches that really made my jaw drop. Few performances can actually leave me speechless, this was one of them. He undoubtedly needs to recieve some attention come award season. You could fight about what is accurate and what wasn't, but at this point I have come to accept that no biography in cinema will ever stick completely to the true story. If it means a more entertaining experience, I am all for it. This film had me involved emotionally, it didn't shy away from the truths of violence, it delivered its messages respectfully, and best of all it gave us the best portrayal of Martin Luther King Jr. to date. David Oyelowo should be commended, as should director Ava DuVernay for giving us a real depiction of bravery and what a true hero really looks like. Selma is a work of cinematic art in my opinion, and it never once backed down from the reality of life and the life of a great man.",

      "review": "  A RELEVANT REVELATION - My Review of SELMA (4 Stars)So many biopics succumb to piousness, reverence, and a bland, straightforward \"this happened and then this happened\" approach to their subjects, that it's thrilling when one comes along with passion and a true directorial voice. Such is the case with SELMA, directed by the very talented Ava DuVernay, wonderfully written by Paul Webb, and featuring an astounding, commanding and sometimes surprisingly subtle performance by David Oyelowo. Covering a three month period in 1965 where Martin Luther King led civil rights marches and lobbied President Johnson to sign the Voting Rights Act, the filmmakers paint a broad canvas over a limited time period. At times overstuffed with characters and famous actors in small roles, SELMA benefits from looking at this historic and important struggle from a myriad of angles. While the details of the struggle are well known and etched in the memories of anyone who cares about the Civil Rights struggle, what surprised me was what a joltingly visceral and cinematic experience SELMA offers. In the opening minutes, a surprising event occurs, and without spoiling anything, it knocked me back in my seat. From there, I knew I was being guided by a director with the ability to get your attention. What kept me watching was the serious but accessible tone. Beautifully shot by Bradford Young, who along with Oyelowo have A MOST VIOLENT YEAR to their credit, SELMA presents complex characters whose intelligence, deliberateness, and bravery, rather than the typical noble victimhood, is given a chance to truly shine and be deeply felt. Although they did not get permission to use any of King's speeches, the writing replaces them with thunderously impactful orations nonetheless. Oyelowo makes you want to stand and cheer in these moments, but his quieter scenes show a vulnerable, flawed man. One particular scene with his wife Corretta (a wonderfully self-possessed Carmen Ejogo) turns on a dime with just a simple pause between words. It's a recurring motif in which DuVernay allows for extended takes, sometimes holding on a character's face as they think before speaking. The cumulative effect is to build power with a rare patience, where other filmmakers would choose to pace things up more. DuVernay's choices, her command of intimacy, her refusal to devalue the power of its subject while avoiding pretension, are what makes this film a cut above the usual movie of the week this could have become. SELMA feels at times like LINCOLN's more tense and exciting cousin. Both films detail minutiae surrounding the passing of laws, but while LINCOLN felt like a very good stage play, SELMA is riveting. The march scenes are suspenseful and heartbreaking. You feel every baton hit, every frightened reaction, the horror of people running from racist cops on horseback. This film has tense set pieces and memorable dramatic exchanges. In addition to our leads, Tom Wilkinson and Tim Roth do excellent work as President Johnson and George Wallace respectively. Oprah Winfrey in a small role as a woman who bravely seeks to register as a voter makes an indelible mark. She truly is a wonderful actor, in addition to producing important films such as this. Wendell Pierce, Niecy Nash, Common, Lorraine Toussant, and Jeremy Strong make lasting impressions. Relative unknown Stephan James emerges as a true star here as John Lewis, with his smart, soulful performance, although at times it feels like DuVernay accommodated everyone who wanted to do the film, rather than trimming the fat here and there. A minor quibble. The end credits song brings the past to the present in an astonishlingly relevant way, making SELMA required viewing for anyone with a pulse and a heart.",

Essentially a chronicle of the events leading up to, and the aftermath of, the famed march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, Selma is a film that looks at the civil rights struggle from a mature perspective. We are not treated to villains or saints, but instead people in a real-life struggle. We see MLK not as a pure man, but a flawed man with astute political calculations. We finally get a depiction of LBJ which is at least somewhat unflattering, a man whose treatment in history is much to whitewash.An overall even-handed and emotionally compelling film.4/5 Stars",

      "review": "  An electrifying presentation of real events that never feels like a history lesson, Selma's authenticity and timeliness make for a rousing spectacle that feels present and not unreachably epic. The director puts you wholly in the moment, never letting style (and the film boasts a good deal) get in the way of passing down an imperative piece of our country's narrative. Even with so much attention to period detail and historic figures, Selma speaks so truthfully in the present tense not just because current events eerily reflect the story to a startling degree but because the characters come alive to such a degree that you feel like you know them. These are characters, mind you, that have been blown up to mythic degrees on everything from inspirational posters to coffee mugs. Plus, screenwriter Paul Webb's multidimensional characterization of all involved articulates the still-ongoing struggle for equality. Ava DuVernay's PG-13-rated drama chronicles Martin Luther King's (Oyelowo) campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965. As realized by David Oyelowo in a brilliantly layered performance wrongly denied an Oscar nomination, Martin Luther King has never been represented on screen so letter perfectly. In fact, everybody from Carmen Ejogo, who looks like news footage of Coretta Scott King come to life to Tim Roth's on-the-racist-nose portrayal of George Wallace rings completely true...except for Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon Johnson. Why DuVernay would go to extreme lengths to flawlessly present the events leading up to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and NOT have the actor nail down LBJ's distinctive Texas drawl is beyond comprehension. Still, this mostly British contingent (Oyelowo, Roth, and Wilkson hail from the UK) gets it damn right. Just like with the production team behind 12 Years a Slave (also mostly British), sometimes it takes an outsider to hold up a proper mirror to our society. Regardless, you don't have to be American for this tale to resonate and echo in your heart and mind...and it does.Bottom line: Civil Righteousness",

      "review": "  Built and centered on an admirable topic, Selma proves to be a surprisingly weighty historical drama in a season of underwhelming Oscar bait hopefuls. I actually always wondered what a well-made film about Martin Luther King, Jr. would look like that was NOT about the march on Washington, the Montgomery bus boycott, or his assassination. In addition to a different setting than we are used to seeing him in, we also are allowed to look at King the human being, i.e. the flawed man who used politics and arm-twisting in order to achieve his goals. The script avoids pandering hagiography in a similar manner to Lincoln. King understood, both here and in reality, that any struggle would have to be public and caught on camera for Middle America to see, and this helped steer his choice toward demonstrating in Selma, Alabama where resistance would be fierce. We also have David Oyelowo giving an underplayed King, while displaying more assertiveness than we are used to seeing. Oyelowo probably gives the best depiction of MLK we have seen to date and I must join the chorus of voices arguing that this actor was robbed by the Academy for a nomination. There are some problems with accuracy regarding the role of President Johnson, which some historians have rightfully pointed out. Namely, this version of LBJ comes off as a bit cowardly and downright obstructionist toward civil rights. He is shown yelling at King in most of his scenes, conspiring with J. Edgar Hoover to damage King's marriage by releasing evidence of his infidelities to his wife, and only pushing the Voting Rights Act to protect his legacy after it becomes clear the way the wind is blowing. I got news for ya. Johnson, like most if not all U.S. Presidents, probably hated J. Edgar and often avoided him if he could. The wiretapping of King and other Civil Rights leaders predated LBJ, and Hoover often acted unilaterally on that kind of behavior and without oversight. Furthermore, Johnson for the most part approved of King's actions, and specifically in Selma. This is not to say Johnson was an angel. He could be a gigantic asshole. But he was not a coward and he certainly didn't act to obstruct MLK, even if they disagreed on many issues. On that note, they definitely got George Wallace right. He really was a creepy, racist self-absorbed douche - largely unconcerned with the future or his legacy...until he got shot and paralyzed years later.But I digress. This is the kind of low-key, unpretentious, honest story telling I wish I saw more of. The stellar portrayal for our protagonist, competent direction, tight writing, and simple but relevant message make this a must see. Get chill bumps listening to the speeches. Cringe every time nightsticks are brandished and George Wallace opens his mouth. Easily one the best films of the year.",

      "review": "  \"Selma\" looks at a short (six month) period in the life of Martin Luther King, where he invests his influence in a movement to establish real voting rights for blacks who have been systematically disenfranchised and intimidated. It is an important movie about significant times and events and, as such, in includes some shocking, confronting scenes that, quite frankly, make you ashamed to be a part of the human race. And, thankfully, it didn't canonise its subject matter, including reference to his marital infidelities. As King, David Oyelowo gives an outstanding performance that makes you wonder why he was not recognised by a Best Actor Oscar nomination in 2015.",

I have watched many such films, movies and made for television, and, this is the most disappointing, boring take on telling his tale that I have ever encountered. However, I read, in an article, that Oprah Winfrey starred in this movie and she was not in it, when it was rented from Red Box. And, the thing that I saw was so boring that there is no way 86 percent of anyone would like it, ever. So, that does make me wonder what they saw versus what was released in other places. That sort of shenanigans happens, you know?",

While black citizens of Alabama constitutionally have the same voting rights as whites, they are hamstrung by racist local registration officers, politicians and lawmen. Dr Martin Luther King and his followers go to Selma, Alabama to attempt to achieve, through non-violent protest, equal voting rights and abilities for black people.A great telling of a great moment in history. Interesting from an historic perspective and powerfully and emotionally told.Great performances help too. David Oyelowo is superb as Martin Luther King. Excellent supporting performances too, especially from Tom Wilkinson (as President Johnson) and Tim Roth (as Governor George Wallace).

      "review": "  Without wanting to sound ignorant of how far we've come since, it's hard for me to imagine a so called civilized nation like America in the 1960's being so backward and full of hate that it would require a leader like Martin Luther King, Jr. to stand up and fight for equality. Really, it's hard for me to imagine in any respect hating another human being so much due to nothing but the colour of their skin. You would think that the Holocaust would've awoken people to the senseless, utter pointlessness that hate on that level accomplishes. But while we've come a long way in some respects since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's, there are still examples of hatred and judgement amongst people who just don't and aren't willing to understand what they perceive as different or wrong (gay and transgender rights come to mind, though we've made some strides on that front as well).Selma looks at a very important moment in time, not just for America, but for Canada and the rest of the world as well. It looks at a man who decided that enough was enough and at the struggles and triumphs that followed that resolution. This movie is filled to the brim with the stuff good movies are made of: great writing, great direction and cinematography, a fascinating, important story, and acting that will blow you away. I don't know who this David Oyelowo is, though a quick search on IMDB shows he's had a busy and impressive last couple of years as a supporting actor. But he shines in his portrayal of Martin Luther King, Jr. He looks like him, he acts like him and he sounds exactly like him. Which is impressive given that Oyelowo is from the U.K. The film follows King and his band of supporters as they appeal to president Johnson to pass a law stating that African Americans be given full and legal right to vote. Of course, African Americans already had the right to vote, but, particularly in the southern states, they more often than not are given no more right to vote than a salamander. When the president tries to take the easy way out; i.e. 'I don't have time to pass a bill about voting right now, I'm far too busy. I'll hit you back next year on it.' King takes to the streets in peaceful protests that eventually finally awaken the world, and the president, to the kind of brutal mistreatment African Americans have been suffering in certain parts of our 'civilized world.' These are powerful themes to tackle and Selma is a powerful film. Martin Luther King, Jr. was one of the greatest humanitarians the world has ever known. A man of self sacrifice who burned with a passion that, as all men were created equal, all men should be treated as equals. Black or white. You have to be careful when adapting such men and women to the screen. This film could be an introduction to King for younger audiences and you wouldn't want to misrepresent such an important figure. And for my money, Selma does a fantastic job, giving us a portrait of a man who was humble and selfless, who cared deeply for fundamental human rights, but who was human and was someone you could see and touch. Not a celebrity. Not a rock star standing on a stage miles away surrounded by body guards and riding around in limos. He was a man who called people to action, but lead the charge once the masses were gathered. This was a man who's story and accomplishments deserve to be told again and again. Selma does justice to this man, and this moment in time that it's extremely important we don't forget.",

      "review": "  Hoo doggy! after seeing this I really got the same vinegar everyone else has about the Oscar snubbery - it was SO good! I'll freely admit I had no idea about these marches or the political landscape immediately following the Civil Rights movement. Martin Luther King Jr. was this crazy constant in American news so I'm sure while there was all this pushback from LBJ, it's no surprise how many people traveled down to Selma for the black voting cause when the call was put out.the film is pretty incredible - the beginning seems a little bit of a scattershot of the world of the early 60's and the climate before the focus on MLK really ramps up, which was hard to get a good grasp on, but from there it really takes off and MLK begins leading the charge in the film. David Oyelowo bring such a powerful voice to the role of arguably one of the most competent leaders and figures in American history. the production design was something I kept taking note of; the recreation of all the sets in historical pictures is something I stand completely in awe of. the detail is staggering.The other thing I really appreciated was the looks at MLK's relationships and all the planning that went into intelligently forcing the US govt's hand. it's crazy how much discussion between the committee there was, including the local Selma voting advocate group, and that it wasn't all totally coming from MLK.but yeah, seriously, this movie is pretty incredible and powerful (and not in a totally white guilt kind of way). the story was a really satisfying slow burn, just an edge-of-the-seat pleasure. do yourself a favor and go see it - make the Academy regret their decision by pumping this puppy chock full of profits!",

This is a Hollywood trend that seems to be hitting biopics and period pieces really hard, and that is if there is something about a true story you don't like just change it to make your movie better.The movie falsely portrays President Lyndon B. Johnson as an enemy of MLK, going as far as using the FBI to discredit him. In reality this couldn't be farther from the truth. Selma was LBJ's idea, he considered the Voting Rights Act his greatest legislative achievement, he viewed King as an essential partner in getting it enacted, and he didn't use the FBI to disparage him. Did they really need to create lies in order to tell MLK's story? No, it's already good enough in full truth.",

I honestly expected a bit more from the film and instead ended up watching every other Martin Luther King movie ever.Now this movie does have a few things going for itAn amazing soundtrack- One that really goes with the impact of the story A few deep and emotionally gripping scenes. Yes there really powerful in many ways.However we have seen these emotional scenes before and for a Oscar caliber movie it didn't bring anything new in the way 12 Years a Slave did. it kinda just felt like the Oscars wanted a 'black lead' film to be in the running so they said....Selma.. there happy.But I am not happy and really don't think this is a Oscar caliber film at all.I never got into the actor playing MLK. David Oyelwow just didn't capture me. I also think Ava needs more time to become a better director and don't get some first time writer in the chair as well, because it did not go all that great as far the story was concerned.There are just other movies that do Martin more justice-Our friend, Martin - Bringing King to ChinaThis film also had many chances to go deeper and darker with Martin Luther King, but instead it runs away and tries to play it all safe.Overall there is some good here, and if this is your kids first look at Martin Luther King then hey let him watch it, but I have seen too many Martin Luther King documentaries and movies and this just doesn't do it for me.",

How Martin Luther King Jr. despite politics and his the risk of his marriage decided to create publicity to help secure voting rights. The campaign puts Martin Luther King Jr. and President Johnson at odds with one another, and it all comes to point where one must pick what side of history they want to be on. The campaign to March from Selma to Montgomery meets with conflict and danger, but Martin Luther King Jr, holds everyone together as they make history on this march for Civil Rights. Brilliant direction, superb acting, and great story that makes you feel how it really must of been like to be there.",

      "review": "  Of all the nominees, I was the most surprised by this film.� Coming off last year's \"12 Years a Slave\", I expected this movie to be similar in tone and themes.� However, Selma is actually the antithesis of that movie.� Instead of focusing on the struggles of King and the pioneers of the civil rights movement, it celebrates the movement as a whole and the power that a group of people can have when they are of one mind.� The tone is overwhelmingly positive and uplifting.� I cried for sure, but not for the reasons I expected.� Additionally, the story is streamlined and even educational, and most importantly, never once succumbs to the melodrama that is so typical of historical dramas.� And David Oyelowo... oh my god, the man's performance is breathtaking and it's a crime that he is not among the Best Actor nominees.� He plays King with a quiet but firm serenity among family/friends, but once he gets in front of an audience, you can actually see him transform into the powerful leader that we all know.�� He captures all the power, emotion, and charisma of King, to the point that if Oyelowo ran for office tomorrow, I'd probably vote for him.",

      "review": "  Not having seen the television series that these loveable characters are based on, I went into \"Shaun the Sheep Movie\" cold. I can say without a doubt that it is one of the best films you will see all year. From no dialogue throughout the entire film, to it's story of sheep just wanting a break from their boring daily routine, this film has it all. Helming and embracing it's visual gags, cliched gags, and clever gags all the way through, the laughs are constant and never let up. It was almost overwhelming how charming this little film became by the end, and it is not just the mindless sheep-filled adventure that the trailers make it out to be. There is an emotional undertone to the story that really makes it stand out above most animated films nowadays. What always impresses me the most from Aardman (the company behind these claymation films) is their ability to bring a realism to their animation. It is so maticulously handled that it seems flawless, and that is always the most commendable thing. There are times where you just completely forget you are watching a claymation picture. \"Shaun the Sheep\" get's every point across with it's silent style of filmmaking and I absolutely loved that. This is the definition of \"show-don't-tell.\" If I had one quip it would be the fact that they have a few too many fart jokes that become a little too juvenile, but the film is for kids as well, so I forgave that. \"Shaun the Sheep Movie\" really is a work of art for it's genre.",

      "review": "  Coming from Aardman studios (who gave us Wallace and Gromit and the truly excellent Chicken Run) we have Shaun the Sheep based on the series of the same name. The plot is simple: a clever sheep and his friends have to find their amnesiac owner who is lost in the big city and return him to their country farm, while avoiding animal control. But the execution is beyond clever - it's fucking genius. The movie is completely rendered using clay animation and not one word of dialogue is used. If it wasn't a children's movie, I would be tempted to call it a wordless work of existential art. But beyond the concept, Shaun the Sheep is an adorable experience for children and their parents and for the odd filmgeek like me who can enjoy the sincere, touching moments in addition to all the slapstick.",

      "review": "  When Aardman Animations puts out a new movie, there's no resisting. Their Wallace and Gromit franchise is stop-motion animation at its finest, a studio that can rival Ghibli and Pixar for visual dazzle and wizardry.Adults will delight at every ironic and twisted gag that will go right over the heads of the kids. No way they'll get the shout-outs to The Night of The Hunter, the Silence of The Lambs and Scorsese's version of Cape Fear. Shaun The Sheep Movie began life as a short-form British series where both animals and humans speak in indecipherable gibberish, so the emphasis is squarely on the visuals, much like Sylvain Chomet's Triplets of Belleville. Writer-directors Mark Burton and Richard Starzak deliver in high style. Just look at the pig that throws a party worthy of the Kardashians.The action starts out on Mossy Bottom Farm, where Shaun (voiced terrifically by Justin Flatcher) and his flock make loads of mischief for the Farmer (John Sparkes) and his sheepdog Bitzer (Sparks again). Soon the flock takes off to the Big City and end up dressing as humans to eat in a fancy eatery. As for the Farmer? He gets amnesia after suffering a concussion and then uses shears to cut human hair and ends up as a celebrity stylist. And Shaun, first introduced in the 1995 Oscar-winning short A Close Shave, he is always a delight. Sure, the movie drags a bit and the soundtrack, featuring Eliza Doolittle and Rizzle Hicks, might be a bit too hip for such an old-style feature, but Shaun remains a real party animal.",

In what is essentially a silent film, the wonderful takedown of societal acceptances in favor of being yourself is akin to the greats (Tati and Chaplin). An expressive and alive animated treat.",

      "review": "  Short, simple, and ridiculously cute. Shaun the Sheep tells its story with zero dialogue. The humans talk, kind of, but it all sounds like gibberish, putting you into the animal's world. I really liked this silent method of storytelling, and it was surprisingly able to be held over the runtime of the film. It relies solely on sight gags and cuteness, but they all work. It's a profoundly silly movie but I had a lot of fun with it. Some of the gags seem a little been-there, but they're done with enough of a clever twist that I didn't mind. If I really had a criticism of the movie it would be that I still don't like the way Aardman studios animates people where they always look so creepy, and the villain of the movie is horrendously clich�d and boring. Sill I recognize that this is a kids movie, and for a lot of kids this will be the first time they see a villain like this, and he gets enough laughs that I'm willing to give it a pass. It's a simple, fun movie that left me with a smile on my face. It will easily entertain anyone from age 8months to 80 years, and I can't think of any other movie that can claim that feat.",

Not to mention if you've ever taken a liking to Chicken Run (2000) or Wallace and Gromit there's something here that you'll like. The movie follows Shaun the sheep who after day after day of the same thing he believes its time for him and the other sheep to have a day off. On accident they get rid of the Farmer that takes care of him and his trailer is whisked away to the big city. It's up to Shaun and the Sheep to travel to the city and find out where Farmer is and bring him home. The stop animation is fantastic as it always is in Aardman films. I enjoyed the warmth of the film and the overall meaning it brings by the end of the film. I'd say the pacing is well done, but at times it slogs just slightly too much for me (especially early on). Overall, though I highly recommend giving this one a look!",

This is an exceptionally brilliant exploration of visual storytelling. There are only grunts, no dialogue whatsoever. It's totally insane how hilarious and evocative physical action is when done right, and the characters tell so much story in a normal amount of time. It's so crazy and entertaining.The humor is definitely aimed at a younger audience, which is what I knocked a little bit but there's certainly chuckles throughout, with some big laughs mixed in.The story is definitely nothing special, but it's really entertaining all the same. I was so surprised by how good it turned out to be. You have to see it for yourself, with an audience if you can!",

There are more complexities that come from the lawyers and head hunters, but that is the least interesting portion of the story in my opinion. We follow Emily Blunt's character who is not used to this kind of field work, but the team she works for interested me much more. \"Sicario\" benefits from a very solid script, a tension-filled story, and terrific performances. I do think this film is slightly overrated, but it's concept is worth the price of admission alone. In the end, I really enjoyed watching this film. I did not buy into everything that happened, but in the end, it became one of the more interesting films of 2015.",

She our doppelganger, our stand-in, who ushers us in into the horror of real life, the horror that horror is necessary. Once we are assured of her street worthiness and credibility - and she's plenty badass - we are then introduced to the real star of the film and the subject of its focus. The movies and their audiences (hey, that's us!) love the Myth Of The Double O's: sauve, debonair, lady killers who can handle themselves in a fight, in a car chase, in other countries, in other languages, with any weapon. Center stage in every scene. \"Bond. James Bond.\" But what might such individuals be like in the real world, not in the movies, but in the world we live in and know? When we meet Del Toro as the secret agent he is most noticeable for his deliberate efforts not to be noticed. \"I'm just sitting here. I'm just a regular joe. I'm just like you. Don't look at me.\" By the film's end we know that this MF is the MF other MFs have nightmares about, and if you notice him, if he is center stage then its already too late for you. A really good film, and with my highest recommendation: worth more than one viewing.",

      "review": "  The word \"sicario\" is Spanish for hitman, we're told in a helpful opening text. It's a term that has greater meaning in the landscape of the war on drugs, a war that has ravaged the Mexico and its citizens. Sicario, the film, is a grim and gripping and director Denis Villeneuve doesn't hold back from the brutality of its reality. Sicario is a flat-out tremendous film. It's the most intense film I've sat through since 2012's Zero Dark Thirty, so much so that for long stretches of the 121-minute film I was literally tearing my hair out with delicious anxiety.Kate Mercer (Emily Blunt) is a Phoenix FBI Agent called in by her superiors with a very special offer. Matt (Josh Brolin), a government agent whose affiliation is classified, has a task force that he would like Kate to join. She'll be taking it to the drug cartels by destabilizing their chain of power. Kate accepts the job. Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) is a foreign agent in alliance with Matt, and he seems to be deeply knowledgeable of the cartel and their practices. As the chaos swirls and the team gets closer to the cartel bosses, Kate has to reckon with what she is part of. Let Sicario be a blueprint for how to brilliantly develop suspense sequences in mainstream cinema. I've written about it before but the key to suspense and horror is simply characters we care about and the worry of what will happen next. Sicario places our characters in the middle of an ongoing battle and serves them up as the change agent, the proverbial stick rattling the hornet's nest of deadly cartels. There's a wonderful sequence when Kate joins up with the team for her first mission. She's been told she'll be based in El Paso but in reality she and a team of Army Rangers are venturing across the Mexican border into Juarez. They're picking up a high-level cartel informant and transporting him back to American soil. The ride into the country sets the stage as the caravan of black SUVs tears through the streets of Jaurez, bracketed by Mexican state police vehicles. We've previously been told at what points a likely trap might be staged, and so we wait, taking in the terrain, the distance, the exits, the personnel. We're already sizing up the Mexican state police cars; is that one on the take? It's at the end that the scene coalesces into an even stronger whole, as we literally have a climax in traffic. The border entrance is backed up, and so Kate and our team wait, all the while identifying some suspicious armed men in traffic lanes parallel to their vehicles. They're told they cannot fire until deadly force is used, and so they wait and we wait. It's a top-notch sequence where you're nervously waiting for the boil, waiting for the explosion. Writer Taylor Sheridan (best known as Deputy Chief Hale on Sons of Anarchy) has taken what could have been an empty Michael Bay-styled drug war thriller and given it a soul. Sheridan's structure is ingeniously tied into his larger message about the moral futility of the escalating war on drugs. As Kate becomes more immersed into the costs of her new role, of the mounting ethical compromises and legal loopholes, she becomes a background player and Alejandro takes center stage. Rather than simply harden up and sacrifice her ideals for the sake of her mission, Kate holds true to her principles, even if she might be the only one continuing to stick to the rules and a need for oversight. It makes her a far more interesting character and it all comes to a terrific climactic scene that hinges upon two characters at a forceful crossroads, each with diametrically opposed viewpoints. For all the action, Sheridan has found a great way for his story to have a character-based climax that hits harder than simply killing the Worst Bad Guy. As we learn more about the reasons Kate was selected, her literal marginalization in the story makes thematic sense, especially as she's unwilling to become a \"wolf\" in a \"game of wolves.\" Alejandro is that wolf, and in the last act he becomes the film's focus as the pieces of their destabilization plan fall into place. There's a scene with Alejandro that is so cold-blooded yet badass that it made my audience gasp. As the bodies drop and blood is shed, Sicario doesn't lose sight of its characters even to the very end.Sheridan's script tackles its subject with a propensity for acknowledging the messy reality. There are no easy solutions and perhaps the best solution is really one that is at odds with conventional legality. The United States is losing the war on drugs, and innocents are suffering in droves. Matt's cavalier attitude is in response to the overwhelming evidence that the war on drugs has done little except to enshrine certain violent elements into power. He's trying to clear a path for Alejandro, but for what aim afterward is ethically questionable. When you've got nothing but bad solutions, perhaps the best option is still one that's a step too far. Sicario tackles the harsh realities of the war on drugs without ever dragging out a soapbox. The messages and debates are suffused in every frame, every taut sequence, even pained expression. It's a message movie where the morality and the escalating action go hand-in-hand.With Prisoners and now Sicario, Villeneuve has proven to be one of our finest directors when it comes to making adult movies that get your palms sweaty. The execution of these suspense sequences left me breathless. Villeneuve uses long takes of aerial photography hovering over the topography of Mexico and the American southwest. It has the effect of feeling like you're surveying an alien planet. Added with the ominous score by Johann Johannsson (The Theory of Everything), the tension can feel overwhelming at times. The menacing and percussion-heavy score makes it feel like an army is approaching. The movie also looks absolutely beautiful thanks to the cinematography from Roger Deakens. There are several lovely shots lit with the dying rays of sunlight, which I would admire further if my heart weren't in my throat while watching. Villeneuve also knows when to pump the brakes, letting his film breathe, and letting his actors take center stage. There are several moments of restraint that allow the actors to flourish. From top to bottom, Sicario is a technical marvel that impresses as it continues to horrify. Blunt as a badass is nothing new after her killer turn in last year's epically underrated Edge of Tomorrow, but there's way more to her than being a superhero with a gun. She's the moral conscience of the movie and you may discover, as she does, how irrelevant such a stance may be in this underground world. She's trying to make sense of it all, trying to go along with what she thinks is right, or at least making a difference, and swallowing her frustrations. She saves the best for last in a finale scene that pushes her character to the breaking point of her ethics, and Blunt floors you. While Blunt is our entry point into this world, and Brolin is amusing as a cavalier rogue agent, this is very much Del Toro's movie. Alejandro could easily be the slick movie-cool hitman, a soulless killing-machine, but he's a haunted man who knows he's damned and goes about his business with steely resolve. Benicio Del Toro can often be confused for doing little acting because he so naturally underplays his characters, but keep watch and you'll see a man who inherently knows his character. There are subtle shifts and small reveals that open up his character, who is so hardened that this will be all you get. There have been some complaints citing the film's lack of perspective from the Mexican side of the border, which is fair but also overlooking Sicario's complexity. With its fear of cartel war violence spilling over into American neighborhoods, it's not hard to see this film becoming supposed evidence in a xenophobic political campaign. Surely Donald Trump will be talking about Sicario. There is a small degree of representation with a minor character involved in the drug trade. The movie flashes back to him and his family a few times, setting us up to expect he'll return at a pivotal moment later. He's a completely unremarkable character and the brief scenes we spend with him made me anxious to get back to Kate and the main story. I didn't care, and then he did reappear and I was quite surprised to find myself actively caring for this minor character's well being. In a scenario where it seems like there's a lack of vulnerability, this character provides it. He's not a bad person per se as just another cog in a corrupt machine trying to provide for his loved ones. It's a window into the larger ramifications of Kate and Matt's actions. The very last bittersweet image doesn't feel like victory, more like a warning of impending consequences that will befall innocents, and they aren't Americans.It's rare to get a Hollywood thriller that excels at what it does and exceeds lofty expectations, but Sicario is that movie. Here is a thriller that excites, unnerves, provokes thought as well as terrible anxiety that you sweat in buckets over. The general feeling while watching Sicario is one of disquieting dread. The challenging and disturbing reality of the war on drugs blends with the brilliantly executed suspense sequences. The characters don't get lost amidst the clatter of violence, the direction enhances the actors and allows them to better inhabit their engaging characters, and the overall orchestration of all the many moving parts is so polished, so in tune, so electric that Sicario often does more than just entertain, it forces you to react. Leaving my theater was akin to coming down off an adrenaline high and I wanted to tell everyone I knew to see this movie. That's the power of great cinema and Villeneuve has created a compelling feature that deserves to be soaked up and studied. This is exhilarating moviemaking, folks. Nate's Grade: A",

      "review": "  SICARIO is a thrilling film that plays like a gradual punch of adrenaline; it places and lingers the tension for a gripping experience - courtesy of the original score's strong presence and top-notch directorial and cinematographic execution. Not for the faint-hearted, this film truly aims to make viewers feel the weight and is great in many ways once some glaring flaws are overlooked (including a script that by the end wasn't as expansive and fulfilling as initially indicated as well as some rushed but important moments of decision and protocol); it employs high stakes and tense scenes that effectively utilize the tools of cinema, and does so in a way that admirably and provocatively explores the conflict between morality and serviceability.",

      "review": "  Sicario is a masterwork of filmmaking that gripped me in everything from the performances, direction, writing and action. Directeor Denis Villeneuve has proven himself once again to be one of the best filmmakers in the business, creating a gorgeous world that I completely immersed myself in. Its a very gritty and real film that looks absolutely beautiful in a way that you have to see to believe. Emily Blunt just keeps getting better and better, with her performance here standing out as possibly her best. Its a very emotional and dark role that she absolutely killed, showing new range in her talents. Josh Brolin has only convinced me of his acting abilities in the past, but it's always nice to see him give another great performance. He captures all the subtle characteristics about his character that make him unique, and we always get a feeling he is more than he appears. Benicio Del Toro is the man who steals the show here, giving his best performance in years. His dark, ghost-like performance is unnerving and took me completely by surprise. Unraveling the puzzle of this man was a beautiful little mystery and his performance, and character, were the best in the film. The writing was fantastic, giving us a great and layered story about the hunt for a cartel kingpin and the lengths these people will go to find him. It was a great way to present its themes of morality, control, fear and more. I will admit that sometimes the film could drag, but it was never boring. Sicario is an excellent film and one of the best of the year, delivering a brilliantly styled and intense thrillers mixed with a fantastic",

      "review": "  MAY I BE BLUNT? - My Review of SICARIO (3 Stars)Denis Villeneuve has demonstrated an effectively slow-burning, formalist approach to filmmaking in such features as PRISONERS and ENEMY, allowing suspense to build and screws to turn slowly to ratchet up the maximum levels of tension. In many ways, his somewhat classical style reminds me of M. Night Shyamaylan's, only with better scripts. His latest, SICARIO, from a script by Taylor Sheridan, feels of a piece with his prior films, but with more kinetic sequences and a cipher of a lead character highly reminiscent of Jessica Chastain in ZERO DARK THIRTY. Emily Blunt plays Kate, an FBi agent who is enlisted by a mysterious group of men, led by Josh Brolin and Benecio Del Toro, to fight the drug cartels near the Texas/Mexico border. If you're thinking this sounds a whole lot like the short-lived series, THE BRIDGE, you're pretty close. Nothing is what it seems, loyalties seem to shift constantly, and the notion of good guys vs. bad guys goes out the window. Drawn into this plot with a murky plan, Blunt seems to be the driving force of the film, until it starts to dawn on you that as good as she is, there isn't much of a character here for her to play. We know she's divorced, smokes, is great with a gun, and experiences horniness as a weakness...and that's about it. What's missing is the shattering of her world view. Sure, she's world weary, but the rug gets pulled out from under her so frequently in this film, that I expected a shivering mess or a deep catatonic state by film's end. Instead, we're given as rich and emotional performance as is possible when dealing with such thin details. In all actuality, she's our window into this world, but the action is mostly driven by Del Toro's Alejandro. He's great in the role as a Hitman whose actions and motivations reveal layers to his character. He's a brutal man you come to truly understand, and he runs away with the film. Brolin gives a delightfully relaxed performance that lives somewhere in the Lebowski universe, surprising us with a memorably incongruent approach to what is usually a stern, stock character. In fact, there's so much that's great about this film, from the taut, tense opening raid to the night-vision voyage into a scary tunnel, which feels like a nod to ZERO DARK THIRTY's big set piece. Roger Deakins, who shot Villeneuve's PRISONERS, does another great job with this film. You feel as if you know these dusty, burned out landscapes and your stomach is in knots with each taut, stomach churning composition. J�hann J�hannsson's score also adds immeasurably to the tension, reminding us that his Oscar nomination for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING was no fluke. Here is a composer completely in sync with a director, adding a feeling of dread to almost every scene. Despite surprising scenes, shocking turnarounds, and a fairly propulsive yet controlled style of storytelling, SICARIO comes up a little short for me. There's nothing here that we haven't seen in other drug trade expos�s such as TRAFFIC and MARIA FULL OF GRACE. Yes, we know there is no easy solution to the problem and that innocent victims are continuously caught in the crossfire. I applaud Villeneuve's commitment to his unique style, finding the breathing room he gives his scenes to be refreshing in this time of attention-deficit filmmaking. Had he insisted on spending a little more time and care with his leading female character, this could have been something even more emotionally devastating than what we're given.",

      "review": "  Exceedingly bleak, brooding, violent and yet unapologetic, Sicario is a mature film conceived and executed by mature filmmakers. When tensions rise on the US-Mexico border, a task force is assembled, enlisting a passionate yet na�ve FBI agent (Emily Blunt) to aid in its efforts. The goals and actions of the task force represent a departure the young agent is not yet willing to make, yet feels inexplicably logical in an illogical world.With Sicario, talented director Denis Villeneuve takes on the drug war in really an unprecedented way. Its' political overtones, realism, and cynicism is reminiscent of the great Traffic, yet without the overwrought indignation. It's a slow burn, with a methodical build up and a matter-a-fact way of examining the brutality and carnage that cartels engage in, without glossing over government complicity. Vilenueve pulls no punches, and succeeds in making a film that is both enthralling and cerebral. It has a point of view, yet the viewer has to make their own interpretations. Shades of gray abound, a laudable departure from a genre that otherwise can succumb to less nuanced stories.The film's ensemble cast is second to none, featuring marvelous performances from all involved, including Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and Benicio Del Toro. Toro, for his part, showed a depth I haven't before seen from him. The chemistry between the cast is palpable and the direction brings the best out of the actors, whose complex characterizations all bring a much needed wrinkle to a the story.Toward the end, one would wish for more exploration of the film's major revelation, feeling a bit unsatisfying in the last act. Yet it still manages to bring something to the table that past genre pieces have not, a very real sense of hopelessness that, if never confronted, will never be defeated.4/5 Stars",

Much like those two previous films, this film contains exquisite cinematography from the great Roger Deakins, along with outstanding performances from a great cast whilst attending to it's very thoughtful and intense story. I can't even go on to mention how much of a career high point this is for almost everyone involved. The characters played by Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro are incredibly fascinating and compelling at the same time anyone in a minor role is memorable enough. With incredibly effective thrills, enduring tense character development added to that with such immersive substance, to go with how beautifully shot and neatly directed this film really is. Sicario is not a film not worth missing out on especially on the big screen, as is by far one of 2015's best, highly recommended.",

      "review": "  Killing audiences like its Spanish namesake, tightly coiled thriller Sicario might be topical by proxy but boasts a white hot Who-Done-What at its red hot center. If Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock made a Mexican terrorism actioner, it would look a lot like this. Call it Crosstown Traffic, Steven Soderbergh's already timely drug drama made even timelier by an escalating narcotics war down south and framed with direction that's every bit as knowing and edgy. Though the set pieces stop your heart, your mind can't help but keep going at a feverish pace, always on the lookout for the next double cross or stray bullet. It constricts you from the get-go for a long con but Sicario's serpentine scheme never disappoints. In this R-rated thriller from director, an idealistic FBI agent (Blunt) gets enlisted by an elected government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs along the U.S. and Mexico borders. Through the eyes of the sometimes naive but rarely helpless agent Kate (an ace and award-worthy performance by Emily Blunt), Taylor Sheridan's script pits filmgoers in the midst of a deadly war that oftentimes seems pointless but the drive of the characters keeps you fully bullet-proof vested. Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro likewise give powerhouse performances, though the latter is inarguably the showier of the two. Denis Villenueve's taut atmospheric direction takes center stage, however. The Prisoners' helmer makes a Hitchcockian thriller without a Hitch. It's his own baby, killer turns and all. Bottom line: Wonder Drug",

      "review": "  With the plethora of popular fiction devoted to the doomed drug war, it's slightly hard to get excited about a movie retreading the same ground as Traffic or similar films in this genre. But Sicario is, for a lack of a better way to express this, pretty fucking great. The plot centers on a female FBI agent specializing in special tactical breach and clear missions who finds herself recruited by a shadowy team of DEA agents planning to go on the offensive against Mexican drug cartels across the border in Juarez. Emily Blunt subtly and emotionally plays this protagonist as she finds herself in over her head and struggling to maintain her moral compass amid the carnage. Josh Brolin plays a slimy CIA agent so easily that perhaps we should worry about what he does with his time when he's not acting. But it is Benicio Del Toro who steals the show. His icy, murderous double assassin acts as a sword of vengeance and a warning about those who fight monsters. Notably there is a dichotomy between the FBI characters who attempt to operate in civilian legal procedure with arrests, investigations, and public transparency, and the DEA/CIA team who are heavily militarized, use direct force, torture liberally, manipulate the criminal underworld, and engage in Special Forces style assaults.Sicario is a notably beautiful looking film for being so riddled full of grotesque violence and it demands the viewer's attention. While others may find comparisons to Traffic, I personally feel it has more in common with Zero Dark Thirty, in terms of the strong female protagonist, the direction and cinematography, and final night vision fueled spec ops raids. Of course, where Zero Dark had an uplifting, bittersweet ending, Sicario makes a salient point about the failure and futility of the drug war. It's about as on the nose as you can get, but it doesn't prove to be a fatal artistic flaw. The cold, violent nature of this piece may deter some viewers, but the rest are in for a hellish but rewarding and entertaining journey into the heart of darkness.",

      "review": "  Denis Villeneuve's powerful compelling dark drama about a naive FBI agent named Kate Macer, played brilliantly by Emily Blunt, in a physically demanding turn here that is filled with true grit, she is a real badass in the role. Kate is assigned to a special elite task force led by its leader Matt, played superbly by Josh Brolin, to help in the never ending bloody battles against the insidious Mexican drug cartels, she crosses into Mexico on a clandestine mission into a lawless border area where headless corpses of murdered victims dangle from highway overpasses, with her mysterious mostly silent team companion Alejandro, a special \"consultant\" with a tragic past, played terrifically by a scene-stealing Benicio Del Toro. Kate will find soon question everything she believes in and her faith will be tested as the operation continues, in a land where anyone is a potential target or perpetrator. To say anymore about this film is to betray its sense of paranoia. Astute direction by Villeneuve, with magnificent pulse-pounding action-set pieces that are brutally intense and memorable. A taut script by Taylor Sheridan, Roger Deakin's ravishing sun-parched cinematography is very impressive, and Johann Johannsson's grandiose haunting score is superb. \"Sicario\" which means \"hitman\" in Spanish is a most remarkable motion picture in every sense of the word.

Emily Blunt is a SWAT team captain with a Jessica Chastain-like exterior--only better. Josh Brolin delivers some great lines as the sly, flip-flop wearing CIA agent in charge of the operation. This is a rough cut jewel of a movie, and a must-see if the genre appeals to you.",

With veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins, he made something suspenseful.I like how this film brought a simple idea about the Mexican border drama into something scary and very satisfying thiller-drama.Emily Blunt was right for the cast - as a person that can be identified as us, who always tries to do something \"by the book\". Especially Benicio Del Toro, he made a comeback from playing some high-dude collector in Guardians of The Galaxy (2014). His mysterious character made the film looked more than a simple thriller. My dad, usually predicts what a character might do, but he couldn't predict him. Watch the climax of the film, you'll know what I'm talking about.Also the cinematography was great. The technical side of the film was very complex, but yet looked realistic. The old man really knew what he was doing since the 1980's.Besides that, I really like to hear the film's sound design and foely, it sounded so realistic. It build more of the suspense.As for the writings, there were plot twists all over the place, but the most surprising one was on the climax. We really don't know what Benicio Del Toro's and Josh Brolin's character motivation for 3/4 of the movie. Once we knew it, OH SHIT, this is fucked up.I bet this film would be in one of Oscar's nomination.The Verdict:Sicario is one of the most suspenseful film of the year, with strong cast, plot twists, and technical (cinematography and sound).",

Through sheer determination, grit and mostly just pure dumb luck, Jay has advanced as far as Colorado in 1870. That luck has just run out when he encounters a group of Indian hunters who are really not that picky who they kill. And that's where Silas(Michael Fassbender) enters the story, saving his life and then making a deal to guide him the rest of the way.\"Slow West\" is a wildly unpredictable and beautiful movie about the old west that shows the immigrants' dilemma in this new land of widespread violence.(This is a UK/New Zealand co-production which might account for the unique perspective.) So, while there was opportunity to be had for those willing, it did not come without more than its share of risks.

      "review": "  An exercise in subtle, quiet, and poetic filmmaking, Slow West is a familiar western story done in an unfamiliar way. The film follows a teen boy, recently emigrating from Scotland, in search for a woman he loves. That woman, Rose, becomes that center of attention for numerous bounty hunters as her and her father become wanted over a supposed murder. First time director John Maclean gives an impressively mature feel to the film, which features a number of impressive performances, headlined by Michael Fassbender. He is able to find a unique tone of the film and stick with it, one that is matter-of-fact, oddly cold, and peculiarly disinterested with the triumph or failure of the characters. It's a movie that deals with themes of love and death, but in a nearly nihilistic way, with a sort of forlorn sensibility that permeates the story. There's fairly sparse dialogue, but some humor. It's a slow build, but also accented with moments of peak action.It's never dull, but Slow West is also never really enveloping. It borders on too detached; we don't feel tied to any one character. It's almost as if we're watching a documentary, we appreciate the realism, but fail to identify with the heart of the story.3.5/5 Stars",

But even if some of the dialogue is a bit stilted, the film builds to a brutally funny second act. It's only 85 minutes, and while it doesn't quite scratch the Western itch, its interesting and entertaining in its own way.",

      "review": "  Slow West is the debut feature film from writer/director, John Maclean and though the Western genre has been bled dry, the third act adds just enough to throw a twist on the familiar formula and the conclusion is shocking to say the least! The film stars Kodi Smit-McPhee as a Scottish teen (though he mysteriously has no accent) who's on a quest to find the love of his life, who is on the run due to her father's wrongdoings. Along the way, he crosses paths with Michael Fassbender, an outlaw who agrees to protect him; though he has intentions all his own and he is easily the best performance in the film. The movie is very grim and in many ways is a black comedy; the violence comes across as a mix between the Coen Brothers and Tarantino's styles, both startling and darkly funny. The film is pretty standard for the first two acts, but holy crap did the third act ever impress me with a climactic shoot-out that was filmed well and the resolution of McPhee's character is AMAZING; my jaw was on the floor for a solid minute. It's not a film I'd revisit anytime soon as the story is pretty basic and slow-moving (hence the title), but whenever there is on-screen violence, in particular, a scene in a trading post and the final shoot-out, it is extremely engaging and the cold irony of the ending is masterful!",

      "review": "  Westerns are better off when they're bleak, unrelenting, and quiet, introspective in their every move and always sweating from the violent anticipation that surrounds them. I'll take a Sergio Leone spaghetti western over a cheery Roy Rogers show any day; while I like the bright-eyed, Technicolor phoniness of the latter, the western doesn't feel like a genre one can truthfully execute without hanging gloominess mixing into the cocktail of bullets, black coffee, and unbreakable attitudes.  So \"Slow West\" is made all the better because it combines the best qualities of both, presenting us with a dreamy, roundly pigmented world where everything looks as pretty as an Old West Norman Rockwell might have envisioned, but, in reality, still holds as many murders and double-crosses as the world Billy the Kid lived in. It is an example of conscientious filmmaking that holds grittiness in as high of a regard as stylistic, Douglas Sirk artifice. The film is opulent on the eyes and is often times provocative in its storytelling characteristics. But I'm more infatuated with \"Slow West\" on a visual level than I am on an emotional one; I hold its fashionable exterior in higher esteem than I do the film itself. But that doesn't dampen what it achieves artistically. It focuses on Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee), a Scottish teenager roaming the Western frontier in hopes to stumble upon Rose Ross (Caren Pistorius), his alleged love who has gone missing for reasons muddled to him. His trek finds a companion in Silas Selleck (Michael Fassbender), a bounty hunter whose motivations are unclear. During their journey do they run into various suspicious personalities as threatening as they are to each other; their partnership is hasty, and neither knows much about the other - their getting acquainted promises an eventual (and perhaps mandatory) violent showdown. A perceptive ambience keeps \"Slow West\" from turning into another seen-it-all-before western, its picturesque coloring and tendency to delve into black comedy territory making it a cabinet of curiosities that stands as one of the most memorable directorial debuts of the year, coming from musician turned filmmaker John M. Maclean. Comparable to Tarantino in the sense that there is an unmistakable admiration for cinema deep within his soul, every shot in \"Slow West\" is sensorily delicate, the landscape of the Old West appearing as a detailed canvas painting of intimate refinement. The story doesn't always match the astounding elegance of the film's sheen, but the actors are well-cast, and Maclean's compact handling of everything leaves an impression. There is no doubt that he'll go on to make bigger, more impactful films - just wait until he's in the shoes of a Colin Trevorrow or a Rian Johnson, starting off small until the big time hits him like a mallet.",

      "review": "  When this started and the logos for Film 4 and BFI faded onto the screen, my expectations were immediately lowered because British films are, well...British films. By the end of the movie though I was nicely surprised. I think it's a little too short and would have liked some expansion on the two lead characters, as they aren't given much time, if any at all to develop. But the film itself blends quirky humour and landscape porn with really unexpected but satisfying graphic violence. Even I was a little taken back with how out of hand things got. There's also a bit of editing at the end where shots of all the lifeless, bloody bodies of characters who were killed during the story are stitched together nonchalantly, which I found quite brilliant and impactful. The story itself is told in such a casual way you almost feel like you're watching a dream or desert mirage. This is sharply contrasted whenever violence breaks out and it really wakes you up. Quite a strange viewing experience but I liked it a lot. My main criticism would be the performance of Kodi Smit-McPhee as the young lead. I thought he was wooden and could have been more expressive, and I didn't really buy him. Overall though this is an odd but fulfilling film that will leave an impression.",

      "review": "  Slow West is a movie I had heard a lot about when it came out, and due to it being a Western I thought well there isn't the greatest chance I will personally like this... but wrong I was. It came onto Netflix in the UK recently and I decided to give a shot, no pun intended. I had a lot of fun with Slow West and to be frankly honest it is one of the better smaller movies I have seen in a long time. Slow West is roughly 90 minutes long and because of this it doesn't drag along at a slow pace it just keeps on moving which is a good thing. Michael Fassbender does what he does in every movie and that is completely beast everything, by god that man is a force to be reckoned with on the acting front. Kodi Smit-McPhee is also great in this movie and gives a very mature and layered performance. Another great thing about Slow West is the location settings, they are so beautiful. There were so many shots in this movie that I was in awe at due to the beauty of the landscapes, and it added a lot to the spectacle of the movie.The main thing I loved about Slow West was the back and forth between Fassbender and Smit-McPhee it was so natural and believable. The back and forth was also hilarious at times which surprised me even more. The action in Slow West was also handled very well and impressed me especially in the third act of the film. If you are a lover of western style movies you will love Slow West. If you also a lover of comedic road trip movies you will also love Slow West. Give this movie a chance, I'm glad I did!",

Bad directing, bad camera work, lifeless characters, poor acting with unconvincing accents and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a rain forest in New Zealand!

      "review": "  Spotlight is the true-story behind the 2002 expose into the Catholic Church's cover-up of decades of sexual abuse and it is unflinching in its focus and animated by its outrage, which is the best and worst part of this awards-caliber movie. Writer/director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, Win Win) is a splendid curator of unlikely movie families, and with Spotlight he follows the titular investigative team (Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, Brian d'Arcy James) at the Boston Globe as they go about their jobs. That's really about it. Over the course of two tightly packed hours, we watch as the Spotlight team chases down leads, goes through archives, interview subjects and know hen to push harder and when to fall back, and day-by-day build their case to expose the massive corruption within the Church. It's invigorating material and worthy of the careful and sincere reverence that McCarthy and co-writer Josh Singer have afforded, though the flurry of names can be difficult to keep track of. However, that's about the extent of the movie. We don't really get to know any of the journalists on much of a personal level or as a character; they are defined by their tenacity and competence. We don't get much time for reflection or contemplation on the subject, especially its psychological impact on a majority Catholic city/staff, and the culpability of those within systems of power that chose to ignore rather than accept the monstrous truth. I don't need more \"movie moments\" or emotionally manipulative flashbacks, per se. With its nose to the grindstone, Spotlight is an affecting and absorbing news article given life but it feels less like a fully formed movie of its own. It's confidently directed, written, acted, and executed to perfection, and I feel like a cad even grumbling, but the ceiling for this movie could have been set higher had the filmmakers widened its focus.Nate's Grade: B+",

Luckily, this is a story worth telling, with a smart script and terrific performances all around. \"Spotlight\" revolves around the true story back in 2001, when a newspaper investigated the story of multiple priests that had been accused or assumed child molesters. This film keeps you engaged the entire time, but the main gripe I think many moviegoers will face, is that it has a slow pace and seems to go on a little too long to hold everyone's interest. What helps the pace is that the story always stays interesting and I was always enthralled with the story. Whether it was a brutally honest and tragic scene or some comedic relief, this film had it all. From a story and acting standpoint, this is a stellar film all around. The pacing is really what bogs this film down. In the end, \"Spotlight\" is a terrifically made film that I definitely recommend for people who are intrigued by this story. I do not think it will gain an audience outside of that crowd. \"Spotlight\" is a great watch.",

      "review": "  ALL THE RESIDENT'S BOYS - My Review of SPOTLIGHT (4 Stars)Investigative journalism seems like such a thing of the past in our current quick soundbite, click-bait culture, but SPOTLIGHT deftly and understatedly makes its case for slow, steady, methodical grunt work. Perhaps eclipsed by the events of September 11th, the film looks at how the Boston Globe's 4 person Spotlight Department worked their butts off to expose the sexual molestation cover-ups within the local Catholic church. In doing so, they ignited a worldwide scandal by clearly demonstrating an outright conspiracy to protect their priests while hushing the victims and their families. Director Tom McCarthy (THE STATION AGENT, THE VISITOR, WIN WIN) is having Sandra Bullock's 2009, the year she won the Oscar for THE BLIND SIDE and the Razzie for ALL ABOUT STEVE. For him, he has one of the year's best with his latest film and one of the worst with THE COBBLER, further proving that you CAN win them all! Along with co-writer Josh Singer, SPOTLIGHT feels deliberately artless and unfussy. It opts instead for a large ensemble style of storytelling, drab settings such as government buildings and blue collar homes, and a laid-back, 70s style of framing. Many films have tried to emulate ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, from ZODIAC to TRUTH, but SPOTLIGHT comes the closest to that understated masterpiece's aesthetic and passion. Having said that, I'm not sure it's a compliment to say there isn't one memorable shot in this entire film or that anyone gives a standout performance. Everyone does their job really well, ensuring that nobody pulls focus from the real story. John Slattery, Rach McAdams, Brian d'Arcy James, and Mark Ruffalo make a cohesive team as the main reporters, and John Slattery, Live Schreiber and Michael Keaton ably carry most of the exposition as their superiors. Only Ruffalo gets a loud, shouty scene, but it felt appropriate after the ridiculous amount of obstacles his character had to overcome just to gain access to a sealed file. I would have definitely had one of those \"Let me speak to your Supervisor!\" meltdowns too. For anyone who has ever rushed to get somewhere before they close and gets tripped up by slow drivers, pedestrians, or bureaucrats, these scenes will ring true.What this film truly excels at, however, is its steadily building sense of dread. Despite the fact that we all know where the story's going, seeing it through the eyes of these reporters has its own power. About midway through, there's a stunning, jaw-dropping scene between McAdams and a priest where all of the cards get laid on the table. Because the entire film is told from such a specific point of view, I felt her quiet, perfectly calibrated reaction. This is one of McAdams' finest bit of acting in her entire career...ok, maybe with the exception of her MEAN GIRLS \"I love your skirt!\" scene. Eschewing what could have easily been an endless series of maudlin confessionals, the film favors phone messages, evasions, scrawled notes, microfilm, and lots and lots of closed doors. Without hitting its audience over the head, we see children at play in the corners of frames, to subtly remind us of what's at stake. Sure, the journalists, while quirky or downright odd if you happen to be Live Schreiber here, come off as purely heroic, but it seems earned. Its quiet power may ultimately be unmemorable, but there's something beautiful and rare in seeing hardworking people professionally doing a good job.",

It's a nice ode to the elbow grease and determination of journalism and the forces that beat on integrity along the way. It also humanizes the focal journalists enough to see how a story that big - the now infamous child abuse scandals in the Catholic church - affects each one of them in different, jarring, personal ways. With that grounded approach for our protagonists and the narrative momentum inherent with needing to pull the curtains back on this awful phenomena, the movie was engaging and mostly stirring throughout.

Aside from all of this, both the creative force and the true facts behind it, Spotlight is simply a terrific cinematic story about the truth, getting closer to the truth, and the collective efforts that it takes to get to the truth... or not. Regardless of background, regardless of beliefs, and regardless of how much you do or don't care about this story... this is a film that is absolutely worth seeing.

      "review": "  A prestige picture of the first order, Spotlight concerns the real life story of a team of investigative journalists from The Boston Globe and their efforts to uncover the cataclysmic sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church. Spotlight is primarily a character study and uses its runtime to showcase the talents of its ensemble cast. Of particular note, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, and Mark Ruffalo present relatable human characters whose motivations and backstories are unraveled in parallel with the abuse scandal. The central theme is the power of intrepid, probing journalism in the face of overwhelming opposition, so in a sense it bears much in common with All the President's Men. The heavy subject matter may shock some, but the presentation is quite objective and tasteful. It does suffer from some overly indulgent and pretentious moments, but solid dramas can be forgiven for those. I personally did not find it to be the year's best film, but I suspect it will be widely credited as such.",

      "review": "  A vital presentation of vital moment in modern reporting, this expertly made film perfectly Spotlights the uncovering of a national travesty with minimal - if any - yellow journalism. Comparisons to All the Presidents Men are inevitable. The utmost of compliments, it just makes sense. That chronicle of the hard-hitting workmanship of two attack-dog reporters unraveling a duplicitous office break-in that ultimately topples a presidential administration defined straight-ahead storytelling, never discoloring their efforts by discussing home lives or their feelings on the politics of the institution itself. Likewise, Spotlight rarely - if ever - bends to subjectivity. The success of both films can best be summed up by the oft-quoted catchphrase of Sgt. Joe Friday (played by jack Webb) in Dragnet: \"Just the facts, ma'am. Only the facts.\" Spotlight dwells very little on the private lives of the reporters in question. When these straight-shooting characters do voice their indignity, it comes off as an authentic venting of frustration when they disagree on when to go public with the truth brought to light by their investigation. Their quest is not a takedown of religion, but of the many community institutions that helped to bury a nefarious conspiracy-not just the Catholic church.This R-rated drama presents the true story behind how The Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core. Tom McCarthy, the writer-director behind beautiful character pieces The Station Agent The Visitor, provides filmgoers with a riveting tale that tries not to editorialize the despicable events at its center. The reporters themselves get handled in the same fashion, neither heroes or villains-just people. The A-Level lived-in performances behind these characters make this all the most a heartbreaking work of genius. Even though one name after another boasts marquee star power (Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci), this ensemble honors their craft by making this dastardly affair unsettlingly real.Bottom line: Right Hand of God",

      "review": "  By Ricky MillerI am rarely left speechless when I go to the movies. \"Spotlight\" was one of the exceptions. In this based-on-truth story, to see, let alone hear about what happened to young boys, was reprehensible. Michael Keaton headlines as Walter \"Robby\" Robinson, head of a team of Boston reporters who band together and spend every moment delving into their story. Other members of the team include Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James).The team works feverishly every waking moment at the Boston Globe, where they fight to put the story to bed by the end of the day.As the story moves on and weaves its tableau, the amount of wrongdoings by various members of the clergy is shocking and downright disgusting. During the team's inquiry into the Catholic Church, it is surmised that more than 70 higher ups within the church were in the wrong. On the lighter side of things, Stanley Tucci (\"The Hunger Games\") is stellar as attorney Mitchell Garabedian. When his persona is on the screen, one listens to every nuance and bit of dialogue he utters.Even McAdams' Sacha character mentions she does not join her grandmother anymore at daily mass for the sheer principal of it all. Because of the events occurring at the church, Sacha feels that even attending mass would be a slap in the face to all of the victims. Also integral to the story is Liev Schreiber's Marty Baron, the Boston Globe's editor-in-chief. He wants to know the nitty gritty of it all, down to actual concrete proof.Filling in the blanks of bureaucracy and all-around corruption are Billy Crudup's Eric Macleish, an attorney representing the Archdiocese of Boston, who was integral in part of the cover-up.Another person fueling the cover up is Paul Guilfoyle's Pete Conley, who tries to shed various church clergy from embarrassment due to their improprieties.In the end game of things, this hardcore drama will leave you with a feeling of disbelief and amazement on how this cover-up has gone on for so many years. In the end game of things, the Boston Globe walked away with multiple Pulitzer prizes for reporting on incidents that occurred in the city and it turns out all over the world.Grade: A",

      "review": "  By Ricky MillerI am rarely left speechless when I go to the movies. \"Spotlight\" was one of the exceptions. In this based-on-truth story, to see, let alone hear about what happened to young boys, was reprehensible. Michael Keaton headlines as Walter \"Robby\" Robinson, head of a team of Boston reporters who band together and spend every moment delving into their story. Other members of the team include Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James).The team works feverishly every waking moment at the Boston Globe, where they fight to put the story to bed by the end of the day.As the story moves on and weaves its tableau, the amount of wrongdoings by various members of the clergy is shocking and downright disgusting. During the team's inquiry into the Catholic Church, it is surmised that more than 70 higher ups within the church were in the wrong. On the lighter side of things, Stanley Tucci (\"The Hunger Games\") is stellar as attorney Mitchell Garabedian. When his persona is on the screen, one listens to every nuance and bit of dialogue he utters.Even McAdams' Sacha character mentions she does not join her grandmother anymore at daily mass for the sheer principal of it all. Because of the events occurring at the church, Sacha feels that even attending mass would be a slap in the face to all of the victims. Also integral to the story is Liev Schreiber's Marty Baron, the Boston Globe's editor-in-chief. He wants to know the nitty gritty of it all, down to actual concrete proof.Filling in the blanks of bureaucracy and all-around corruption are Billy Crudup's Eric Macleish, an attorney representing the Archdiocese of Boston, who was integral in part of the cover-up.Another person fueling the cover up is Paul Guilfoyle's Pete Conley, who tries to shed various church clergy from embarrassment due to their improprieties.In the end game of things, this hardcore drama will leave you with a feeling of disbelief and amazement on how this cover-up has gone on for so many years. In the end game of things, the Boston Globe walked away with multiple Pulitzer prizes for reporting on incidents that occurred in the city and it turns out all over the world.Grade: A",

      "review": "  This journalistic drama recounts a pivotal 12 months of an investigative research team from the Boston Globe, who uncovered decades of systematic abuse against children by the Catholic Church. With subject matter so infuriating and gut-wrenching, it would have been easy for writer-director Tom McCarthy to create a good versus evil arc and give the audience a clear-cut bad guy to despise and deplore. But McCarthy opts for a more intelligent route and keeps the individual offending priests faceless (barring one unsettling and revelatory scene), instead homing in on the atrocities committed by the institution. Unravelling like a journalistic thriller sans the glee, Spotlight is an insightful, methodical and utterly compelling film that provides a window not only into the earth-shattering monstrosities at its core, but also into the mechanics and minutiae of old-school reporting. Understanding that the interactions between the key players is critical to maintaining a level of reality in what would otherwise seem completely unbelievable (despite being true), McCarthy keeps his direction unflashy, allowing the high calibre cast to flourish. Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Brian d'Arcy James, Live Schreiber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci are all at the top of their games with fleshed out and layered performances that favour subtlety over grandstanding. Spotlight is a brilliantly told true story that captivates from beginning to end, deserving each of its six Academy Award nominations and a place on everybody's must-see list.",

The events have their own inherent power and the extent of the Catholic Church's coverup of the widespread abuse of children is just too astounding for words. There are no lurid details presented and the victims are treated with respect - as are we, the audience. The focus is on the journalists and how they went about their investigation. A very significant story that still hasn't ended.",

      "review": "  A hard-hitting, factual, and emotional ride that doubles as a look into how the field of investigative journalism for print used to work. The Spotlight team (a four person intensive investigative journalist team for The Boston Globe) stumbles upon the conspiracy/cover-up of the century when they investigate a sexual abuse claim involving a catholic priest and discover that this kind of thing has been going on for decades, involves many more priests than originally expected, and it goes all the way up to the top of the Catholic church. This is more of an ensemble film, and our leads do fantastic jobs. Mark Ruffalo (Who slowly boils over into a raw, intense, driven, emotional performance) is Mike Rezendes, Rachel McAdams is Sacha Pfeiffer, Michael Keaton is Walter \"Robby\" Robinson (the editor and head of the Spotlight team), and Brian d'Arcy James (Who also portrayed Shrek on Broadway. He blends seamlessly into his role here) is Matt Carol. They all shine as our Spotlight team. Liev Schriber as new editor Marty Baron (The man who sets it all into motion by assigning the Spotlight team onto the story), Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian (A lawyer who had filed some of the first claims of sexual abuse against the catholic church), and John Slattery as Ben Bradley Jr. are fantastic as well. Some of the imagery is a bit haunting (plenty of shots of Catholic churches that loom over both our heroes and suburban houses), and there are a surprising amount of moments where the floor drops out from under you as the true scope and extent of the damage is revealed (A great example is the closing text crawl that left my jaw dropped in horror). Spotlight sheds light on one of the most important news stories of the past several decades, and it is to be commended for tackling it's subject material with passion while still remaining faithful to the truth of the story. Simply put: Spotlight is an incredible film. It's enough to make you mourn the death of print journalism.",

Not just because of its sickening support of the terrorist murderers of the IRA, or its overly-sentimental dewy-eyed oirish heritage, but because its fans and adherents always seemed the sort of people who are long on arrogance and short on morality, and this film kind of sets the record straight. As one who was at a school loosely linked to similar scandals in the UK, it is important that a decent account is made of these disgusting clerics and their corrupt church. Spotlight is well-meaning and although almost marred by Ruffalo's insufferable scene-chewing performance, makes a decent fist of telling the story but with notable omissions in that we see few survivors and - apart from one jaw-dropping all-to-brief scene - no abusers. But although it rattles along, it doesn't climax and there's nothing here that comes close to All The President's Men, the benchmark by which such a movie has to be set.",

The movie speaks more to the systematic cover up not only by the church but also by the judicial system and pretty much everyone else involved which for me was even more disturbing. One moment in the film really struck me - a victim explains that they didn't just lose their innocence, they lost their faith. For me that was so powerful. I also appreciated that they showed what a personal struggle it was for the reporters involved to reveal something so disturbing about the church they had all been raised in. As a Catholic I was concerned that the movie would turn out to be a condemnation of Catholicism as a whole but it isn't.

Not the acting tour de force I was hoping for, but the film will blow you away, based on the content alone.It is a well made, well executed film. Keaton, Ruffalo, Mc Adams amd Tucci are solid as always and a film based on the molestation of children by priests and the mass cover up involved is heart breaking. The film is solid in its depiction of the events and the journalists who uncovered the truth. My only problem with it is- it just too damn humorless. Forget the fact that the subject matter is extremely relevant and humorless. I just don't think that a film as well made and as well acted as this one- has to be without humor- in order to be taken seriously. The film itself needed an extra zing, and not just rely on the story to get you there... especially when you have actors of this fine caliber. Either way- regardless of my opinion- I prefer the movie to the Revenant as an Oscar Contender any day of the week and it should be seen by all. I highly recommend it.",

      "review": "  A frumpy CIA analyst is forced into the field when a nuclear terror plot blows the cover of all the other agents.Melissa McCarthy and Jason Statham are as unlikely a comic duo as one can name, and yet they work wonderfully together in this fun spoof of the spy film genre. McCarthy is hilarious, and Statham's deadpan delivery never misses.While there is a lot to like about this film, it stretches the suspension of disbelief to its limits. At times it tries to walk the tightrope of pseudo-realism and Naked Gun-style farce but totters back and forth confusingly. Also, there are some wells that the film goes to too many times, as though all the writers' brainstormed lines had to make it into the film.Overall, it's a fun diversion and a fine comic turn by many of its stars.",

      "review": "  Director Paul Feig once again teams up with Melissa McCarthy in this comedy/action flick. While Melissa McCarthy has had a somewhat bumpy road after the hilarious Bridesmaids, we finally get a return to form film from her. I was genuinely surprised by this film thinking it would be played as a spoof of spy movies- and to a degree it is, but it also has heart, giving McCarthy a lot of material to turn CIA agent Susan Cooper into a capable and smart spy, without compromising the characters' integrity through unneeded character development in previous films such as Tammy. The supporting cast is also on form, with Rose Byrne, Jason Statham and Jude Law all hilarious in their own right and providing a hysterical back and forth rapport with McCarthy. The action scenes are surprisingly well shot, and the violence and swearing are mainly played for comedic effect. All in all I quite enjoyed the film.4/5",

      "review": "  OK, so this looks like an interes...oh my God! its another bloody Bond parody!! seriously!!! Yes the modern age feminist hipster, Paul Feig, takes a swing at the Bond genre, and oh what an original concept that is, gee I wonder what we'll see here...ugh!So naturally its an adult comedy with lashings of semi-serious action, CGI blood, swearing and a whole heap of Melissa McCarthy and other actresses. Basically the plot revolves around McCarthy playing Cooper, a desk jockey CIA analyst who helps the very suave, completely cliched character of Fine played by Jude Law. Yep, if you ever wanted to see what it would be like having Jude Law as Bond, well here you go. After a botched mission Fine is supposedly killed off and the CIA need someone to take his place, an unknown, hence they can't use Statham who plays another totally cliched agent character we've all seen before. We then follow Cooper around as she slowly but surely sinks deeper and deeper into a mission, which she was never really suppose to get into in the first place (she was only meant to be surveillance).Oh geez where to start, the plot is unoriginal sure, we all know that, but how about some original ideas...oh too late. From the very first scene I had a good idea what this film was aiming at and how the characters would play out. Spoiler alert! but the minute you see Law as this debonair spy, you know he's obviously gonna die early on, he's clearly the plot setup for McCarthy's Cooper, I mean come on, who didn't see that?! But wait! as the film progresses and more and more characters are introduced, we start to see double agents and characters popping up outta nowhere who are suddenly spies or assassins. All of sudden characters we saw at the start who appeared to just be the butt of a joke or background fodder, are now main characters out to kill the protagonist. Its at this point you know that anyone is fair game and anyone can surprisingly come back from the dead when you thought they had been killed off. So I quickly realised that Jude Law probably wasn't dead at all. Seeing as we didn't actually see him die, clearly he can come back, and he did...*groan*The plot is a mess of characters bouncing back and forth between the goodies and the baddies. Seriously, there are characters popping up all over the place, getting whacked, and then replaced minutes later by new ones, only to get killed just as quickly. The ones that don't get killed, you just know are probably gonna turn out to be secret agents, but on either side. I honesty thought Law's character of Fine was gonna keep flippin' sides! he was a goodie, then a baddie, then a goodie again, but at this point I genuinely suspected he would turn on Cooper yet again right at the death, and then get properly killed off. Amazingly the film beat me on that one, but this film could of kept spinning these characters round and round, one double agent twist after another.The actual characters are a completely mixed bag of nuts that all had one thing in common, none of them managed to actually make me laugh...at any point. McCarthy was...well, pretty much like McCarthy is in every bloody movie she's ever done (whilst looking oddly like Dawn French at one point), whilst her sidekick, played by Brit Miranda Hart, was just simply annoying and unfunny. I swear, an early scene near the start has McCarthy and Law in conversation at dinner, they are both talking about themselves and offering basic foreshadowing of things to come. Now initially there are moments that made me smile (as there were throughout this film), but this obviously intended funny sequence just went on and on and on...it just didn't fucking stop. Like seriously, the moment has passed, the joke is over, its not funny anymore its just awkwardly embarrassing, stop flogging this dead horse!!The only characters that did offer some genuine giggles were Statham as a dumb, cocky but tough agent, nothing gobsmackingly funny mind you, but reasonable. Next to him I quite liked Peter Serafinowicz as the slimy Italian (yet another secret agent) Aldo who can't keep his hands off the ladies. Sure this character felt like a cheesy 'Carry-On' character (something I would of thought was beyond the realms of acceptance for Feig), but his antics were amusing. Other than that everyone was just there, doing exactly what you expected them to be doing with these character types. Get a load of Law by the way, how much flippin' makeup?? Oh and both Statham and the main baddie fall into the lake from that helicopter at the end, so why does only Statham survive?I know this movie was relatively successful but I don't really understand why. Yes some parts were good such as the gadgets sequence near the start which is obviously yet more parodies of a certain franchise, and I did quite like how the main female villain was a spoilt bratty Princess type, although again that did become annoying at times too. But in general everything just felt very generic to me and relied far too much on feeble visual gags including male genitals and slapstick, lots of profanity and lots of weight/looks shaming jabs. Even the inclusion of lots of blood and a bit of gore didn't do anything for me, that just felt unnecessary and shoved in to appease the male audience. I would say this was more enjoyable than 'The Heat' which was pretty dire, but at the end of the day, I found this to be an infantile, factory assembly line, cookie cutter of a flick.",

Everyone in the cast, too, gets a fair chance up at bat, unlike so very many Hollywood efforts, so that you get a real feel of all the characters. The emphasis though is on the ladies, both as protagonist and antagonist, and so w/o peddling WOMEN'S LIB it manages to do so more or less. An enjoyable affair from title credits, a riff on the Bond franchise openings, till the end, but I got the most fun out of McCarthy's heated verbal sparring contests w/bad guy Rose Byrne.",

      "review": "  Melissa McCarthy's meteoric comedic rise hasn't been without its missteps, mainly the complaint that she seems stuck in a rut playing aggressively weird and foul-mouthed characters that are growing tiresome. McCarthy is never better than when teamed with her Bridesmaids' director Paul Feig, and Spy is a welcomed return to form for a great comic actress who relishes being outlandish. The best part of the film is that it's a character-centric comedy, with McCarthy as Susan Cooper, a CIA agent who works as a handler, the voice on the other end of the earpiece, guiding her partner the handsome Agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). When Fine is compromised on a mission, Susan unexpectedly finds herself in the field to track down some very bad people. McCarthy does get to be vulgar, but fortunately it's only one persona she adopts as a mask, and it's cleverly utilized. Feig's screenplay makes sure to find different comic beats as it goes, rarely repeating itself and, like any good action movie, finding twists to further develop conflicts. Part of what's so enjoyable about Spy is how comic scenarios will evolve while staying true to the characters and the central conflict. Also, Feig acquits himself more than well with the film's semi-slick action photography. The supporting cast is nicely tied into the story and matter and each actor has material to cut loose, none more than Jason Statham (The Expendables) as a hilariously boastful and incredulous agent. His boisterous chest-beating about his past deeds are some of the film's funniest moments. Consistently funny, witty, and mildly progressive with its heroine, Spy is a vehicle that makes perfect use of McCarthy's talents and then some. Nate's Grade: B+",

Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham, Rose Byrne, Jude Law, Miranda Hart, and the rest of the cast all have such perfect comedic timing that the film feels effortless. After the death of her colleague, Susan Cooper joins the CIA as a spy and hilarious ensues as she works toward taking the bad guy down. That is the broadest and best synopsis to give this film, because it really is all about the comedy. My one complaint about this picture is that it feels about 20-minutes too long, and when you have a film relying solely on comedy to keep you engaged, that can be a little tiresome. In the end, I had a great time at the theatre with this film, even though it felt it's length. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of comedy or who is just looking for a nice romp between people who have starred in action films in the past. \"Spy\" is great!",

The action set pieces are put together with style and many of the more intense, up close action sequences feel extremely fluid. The knife fight were \"Coop\" tries to fend off an enemy by use of various kitchen equipment is funny and very impressive to watch.The comedic aspect of this film is also perfectly captured through character dialogue and visual gags, the cast chemistry also adds to some truly laugh out loud moments.Statham's \"Rick Ford\" proved one of my favorite characters. His crazy tales are used to improve upon his super spy status and are gut wrenching throughout as he always seems to pop up to ruin Susan's plans. As for negatives with Spy other than Rose Byrne's character \"Rayna\" the villains are very one note and quite forgettable. Also the plot gets a little too convoluted towards the end and the few twists are extremely clich�.Overall I had a very enjoyable time watching Spy and at times it had me bursting out with laughter.",

      "review": "  THE WOMAN WITH THE GOLDEN CHARM - My Review of SPY (3 1/2 Stars)Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy are kind of having a moment right now. Perfectly matched as director/writer and actor respectively, this Dream Team delivered big laughs in both BRIDESMAIDS and THE HEAT. With SPY, the don't disappoint, in fact, they've added some terrific filmmaking to their repertoire. SPY plays like a Bond film, but with McCarthy's brand of outrageous, fearless and funny underdog added to the recipe. What I love about all three films are those extended diversions from the main story, where characters get stuck on a minor detail, effectively stopping the plot for a few delicious moments. It's something Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder excelled at in the 70s and it's in almost every scene in SPY. The opening sequence is a killer, with McCarthy's Agent Susan Cooper talking into Bond substitute Bradley Fine's ear. He's played by a very game Jude Law, who clearly enjoys towing the line between suave and douchey, sometimes within a single line of dialogue. I could have watched McCarthy be his office bound eyes and ears for the entire film, but there's that pesky thing called a story to tell. After a crazy inciting incident, the plot mechanics dictate that poor, put-upon Susan needs to get out into the field to help solve a crime. With her assistant Nancy in place, played by the extremely entertaining Miranda Hart, Susan receives a dumpy undercover assignment from her tough-as-nails boss, the always reliable Allison Janney. After a very funny gadget scene in which Susan and Nancy geek out hilariously over the oddly disappointing tools at their disposal, off we jet to Paris. It's the dark, seedy underbelly of Paris, so don't expect glamour. Besides, McCarthy settling into her \"crime scene\" hotel room is better than a tour of the Louvre. Feig's script does a wonderful job setting up Susan's character, with McCarthy bringing just the right amount of pathos and confidence to the material. It's so easy to fall in love with her, because she clearly has great detective skills and refuses to let anybody box her into a corner. At some point, a spy thriller needs its super-villain, and Rose Byrne fills those 6-inch stilettos perfectly as Rayna Boyanov, a condescending, rude, big-haired monster. Byrne has become a bit of a comedy secret weapon after years of honing her dramatic skills, and here she steals every scene she's in, sometimes with just a sneer. Watch for her response to a toast, and you'll feel you've gotten your money's worth from that moment alone. With BRIDESMAIDS, THE NEIGHBORS and now this film, Byrne has proven she can take a stock role and turn it into gold. Also along for the ride is a surprisingly funny Jason Statham as a shadow agent who continuously insinuates himself into McCarthy's investigation. His lines aren't the funniest, and truth be told, it becomes a little one note, but I enjoyed how much he threw himself into it, especially the end credits tag. Sure, SPY brings the laughs, although I could have done without 50 Cent's awkward, unfunny extended cameo, but the surprise here is the thrill of the action sequences. Feig directs these with such muscle and gusto, I wanted to applaud. Whether it's a chase scene through the streets or an epic kitchen fight using knives and pots and pans, Feig understands kinetics and momentum, which is rare in a comedy director. It's exciting to see a writer/director with one type of talent stretch and excel at another. Underneath this 007 splendor is a message of female empowerment and bonding, something usually lacking in Bond's universe. SPY takes back the night and makes you root for women in a way that feels exhilarating. That's no small feat for a dopey comedy.",

      "review": "  Melissa McCarthy plays a CIA analyst Susan Cooper who guides the super spy Jude Law around as he performs his dangerous undercover missions. One mission goes awry and soon a ruthless villain (Rose Byrne) knows the identity of all the agents. This forces the hand of the CIA director as they must put Cooper out into the field. This scenario writes itself as you have a overweight nonathletic woman doing one of the most dangerous jobs. Spy has its moments of comedy for sure, and for me Jason Statham who is one of the other agents steals every scene and offers more comedy than McCarthy did. Spy has many forced offense scathing jokes between McCarthy and Byrne to try and keep the film on all cylinders as well. Spy is a good enough action comedy, but I would not recommend it to everyone.",

      "review": "  Melissa McCarthy finds a perfect vehicle for her talents, and it works beautifully. Once again, she teams up with Paul Feig, who is the writer, producer, and director here. Feig seems to know how to get the best out of McCarthy. The two worked perfectly together on Bridesmaids and The Heat, which are Melissa's strongest efforts to date. Spy lives up to and may even surpass the duo's previous projects. McCarthy's role utilizes her physicality, high energy, and her uniquely aggressive mouthy behavior. Her character is also rounded character with depth. She is a kind person, with self-doubts and emotions to make her vulnerable. McCarthy is at her best when she is not just playing a fool and lets her lovable soft sideshow. It is an exceedingly funny movie. It pokes fun at the spy movie genre, but does not reduce itself to a full-fledged spoof. More surprisingly, it is also a good action spy movie in its own right. The plot is not the typical flat action-comedy format. It has a few surprises and action scenes that really deliver thrills. Melissa McCarthy may look harmless, but she is kicking butt in this movie. Sure, it is ridiculous and it is fun to watch. Rose Burn plays a terrorist villain who is a deliciously exaggerated uptight snob. She provides a straight character to banter with McCarthy and her deep bag foul mouth comebacks. Perhaps the greatest pleasant surprise is funny performance from Jason Statham. He plays an idiotic loose cannon antihero messing up at every turn and has a never-ending stream of terrible ideas. Statham is completely self-deprecating and self-aware. He relentlessly makes fun of the roles he typically plays. Feig and McCarthy are a winning team and a joy to watch. It is unusual for a comedy movie to deliver legitimate fun thrills, but this movie does both extremely well.",

When an arms dealer learns the identities of the CIA's top operatives, the CIA sends untested data analyst Susan Cooper into the field in order to track down the location of a nuclear weapon that the dealer is selling. Starring Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, Jason Statham and Jude Law, the film has a strong cast. And, the comedy is quite clever, and does a wonderful job at lampooning the genre tropes and clich�s. However, McCarthy's brand of humor gets a little tiring after a while, and is kind of crass. Still, Spy is tremendously entertaining and delivers a lot of laughs.",

      "review": "  Spy is a spy spoof comedy from writer and director Paul Feig. He has put together a fun cast, with Melissa McCarthy in the lead as agent Susan Cooper.Especially for me as a heavier woman, it's gratifying to see McCarthy kick lots of butt and ultimately save the day. While Cooper starts off as sidekick to agent Bradley Fine, upon his unfortunate demise she ends up being called upon to go out into the field, for the first time. Hot shot agent Rick Ford isn't going to let her do it alone; he wants the glory for himself, but somehow Cooper ends up saving Ford's butt, over and over. It's fun.Cooper ends up saving the life of ruthless criminal Raina Boyanov, whom she is supposed to be shadowing. Her relationship with Raina gets more complicated; they even seem to be bonding. Eventually Cooper's friend and coworker Nancy from the basement shows up in the field to help her, so there is some girl power going on.Just as James Bond tends to romance some of his opposite sex coworkers, Cooper has some connecting moments with her male coworkers, moreso toward the last half (in the first half, agent Fine ruthlessly dashes any hopes for something more with him). Near the end, after Cooper miraculously saves the day, guess which lucky coworker gets to take her out to celebrate.Just when you think it ends on a happy girl power note, there's one more surprise James Bondlike scene. Hilarious!",

The film doesn't discover anything new, the jokes are for the most part unoriginal and Melissa McCarthy plays the same role she always plays. On the plus side, the action portion is filmed well with Statham and Serafinowicz being the funniest and biggest highlights of the film. Fresh jokes are just far too rare to make this anything more than a watchable film if you really don't have anything else to do or watch.",

      "review": "  I've heard people say that comedy films are the hardest films to make. They are tough to translate for international markets (because a lot of comedy is cultural), they are hard to act out (because actors need to have comedic timing to pull them off), and if they're not funny, the whole film becomes a disappointing waste of time. The last part is a bit tricky too, because comedy is such a subjective thing that it's hard to draw the line where something is too offensive, or too juvenile, or too centered around toilet humor, and who that will appeal to, and who it will turn away. It is because of this, that the best recent comedies have just had funny actors in them, delivering dialogue that they think is funny, which has been a successful formula for folks like Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jason Segal, Paul Rudd, etc. When Spy came out, a lot of people were talking about the film, hyping it up as the best comedy of the summer. If you're reading this review, I bet you want to know \"well, is it?\" The answer is. No. The Martian is more of a comedy movie than this, so it's no wonder it won the Golden Globe. Spy is about a fat woman working at the CIA who acts as some sort of desk jockey/intel liaison who feeds the field agent mission details on the fly through an ear piece. She has access to omniscient levels of information, and it's unclear how or why that works, but I guess we're just supposed to accept it. Ugh, fine. So she's working with Jude Law, who plays an effeminate version of James Bond, and doesn't realize or care that the fat woman in his earpiece is in love with him. Because of plot shit, all the CIA field agents end up getting outed, and in order to stop the nefarious plans of some dastardly villain, they need someone who has never worked in the field and could fly under the radar. So the CIA head, who looks like a female version of JK SIMMONS, decides that the super overweight American who doesn't speak a second language will be a good person to send to Europe on this mission of great national security. Do you see what's happening here? They're justifying a fat person being a spy, none of this is really that important. They just needed a setup for all the wacky fat jokes, interspersed with insult jokes, and then peppered with sad moments where they talk about how difficult it is to be different and made fun of for it. This movie is comedy for the sort of people who like sitcoms and modern day SNL. That is to say, it's not the worst, it's something you can watch and laugh a couple of times, or have a smile on your face. But it better be in the background because there are a lot of groan inducing moments that will make you wish you had something else to occupy your mind with. TL;DR - 4/10 Fat jokes can be funny, and shitty spy jokes can be funny too. But when a movie cycles between fat, fat, spy, spy, fat, can't get a man cause I'm fat, spy, jokes for two hours, it becomes a tedious exercise. There's also so many inconsistencies, like the fat spy woman being extremely acrobatic and aware of the matrix when it comes to gun fights, but then clumsy and oafish when trying to jump over a car hood, because, fuck it, I bet we can stick another fat joke in here, right guys? LOL *fart*.",

With 'Kingsman' coming out recently, which is in my opinion one of the greatest spy spoofs of all-time, Feig had some competition in creating something original yet effective. With Melissa McCarthy, Jude Law, Jason Statham and Miranda Hart, 'Spy' boasts a brilliant and talented cast, supported by a well-executed plot and some stunning locations across France, Italy, Bulgaria and Hungary. A definite improvement over Feig's previous collaboration with McCarthy on 'The Heat', 'Spy' is a rip-roaring spectacle of laughs.",

      "review": "  Let's be real: I wasn't totally on the Melissa McCarthy train... I'd seen her do some funny stuff, but for me, it seemed about half funny, half painfully not. BUT LET'S ALL JUST HOLD THE PHONES.This movie really surprised me; maybe it was the marketing or something, but I was just suspecting a stinker that needed the cast to get a fighting chance in the theaters - but it was INSANELY hilarious. Laugh a minute from all characters in the film - Melissa McCarthy is the lead and leads the charge, but the supporting cast is so strong and comedically skilled.Paul Feig's script is so finely tuned - the room was laughing over probably half the jokes. The huge thing I loved about the characterization is that most of the characters (Peter Serafinowicz's Aldo not included) took their turn as both a cartoon and the straight man from scene to scene, which is insanely refreshing in a fish out of water ensemble comedy. More so than I ever felt like I was missing out on. Of course, there's issues with the various production: VFX, etc. but it never didn't serve the character interactions and pushing the plot forward. The story was incredibly lean, and actually filled with some twists and turns I didn't see coming.Do yourself a favor, catch this in theaters when it opens this weekend, where the seats will be packed with laughter.",

      "review": "  A frumpy CIA analyst is forced into the field when a nuclear terror plot blows the cover of all the other agents.Melissa McCarthy and Jason Statham are as unlikely a comic duo as one can name, and yet they work wonderfully together in this fun spoof of the spy film genre. McCarthy is hilarious, and Statham's deadpan delivery never misses.While there is a lot to like about this film, it stretches the suspension of disbelief to its limits. At times it tries to walk the tightrope of pseudo-realism and Naked Gun-style farce but totters back and forth confusingly. Also, there are some wells that the film goes to too many times, as though all the writers' brainstormed lines had to make it into the film.Overall, it's a fun diversion and a fine comic turn by many of its stars.",

Since it is only the first piece in a new three-part journey it can't help but feel incomplete.

      "review": "  Rey, a young smuggler, is thrust into a battle between the First Order and the resistance when she teams up with a storm trooper who suffered a crisis of conscience.The new entry into the Star Wars universe is profoundly derivative, essentially an updated retelling of A New Hope, and while ignoring the backstory about the First Order largely mutes the events of Return of the Jedi, the new characters are interesting enough that J.J. Abrams has successfully made me excited about the new installments, rather than cringing, as I did after The Phantom Menace. It's a fun, popcorn film, returning to its roots, and this isn't all bad, even if it fails to advance the scope of the original films.I especially like Daisy Ridley as Rey. Ridley gives Star Wars a feminist character, one whose hand should never be held and whose life isn't dependent on others, but the film doesn't allow Ridley to explore enough of the character because it withholds so much information in the name of suspense.Also, Star Wars as a series is based on the struggle between good and evil. In the original trilogy, we accepted the empire as evil and the rebellion as good - the bad guys had red light sabers and the good guys had green or blue light sabers. In the second trilogy, George Lucas bungled a political plot, which by necessity forced the film to explore intricacies of good and evil and descent into evil. Obviously that failed. In order to deal with the rise of the First Order, we needed a political plot, but yet the film disavowed itself of this responsibility, and as a result, the film's antagonists are hollow and the series doesn't hold together as a narrative whole. Star Wars has to get better at politics, not just for the sake of Episode VIII but for the continuity of the series as a whole.Overall, I liked this newest film if only because it manages to return the franchise to the rails; now if only Episode VIII can get the train moving again.",

This film derives a lot from the first Star Wars, and just goes along as you might expect, yet it is still very enjoyable because it's Star Wars. The old faces were cool to see, and the new ones do very well. As a standalone film there's nothing great about the plot, directing or dialogue, but the hype, nostalgia and sentiment made this a great movie going experience.",

      "review": "  Well, I always thought A New Hope was the best Star Wars movie... Episode 7 has kept the style of the original movie, its soundtrack, not just the score - the entire sound scape, but it should have left it at that. What we have feels like a fan remake of the original; re-hashing every plot element, every character, every scene, even ripping off several lines of the dialogue directly. I was half-expecting Rey to do the Obi-Wan sound diversion trick at one point. Alas, the new plot seems like it's in far too much of a rush at times, and thus each re-hashed scene fails to deliver the impact of the original whilst also feeling unoriginal. The characters' journey's don't touch you as much, and there's no strong emotional scenes such as when Luke stood watching the two suns rising over his home world in the first movie. Still, it has a strong female role and it was fun to see the old Star Wars well and truly return to continue the story; hopefully the next movie will do something original and do it well!",

      "review": "  \"The Force Awakens\" is a good and enjoyable film with all the excitement of the original, but without the poor script writing. Unfortunately, \"The Force Awakens\" overuses references to the original film -- meaning that nearly every plot twist is telegraphed almost from the first 20 minutes of the film for anyone who has seen the original. Liked the Death Star in the original? We got it -- but different! Liked the cantina scene in the original? We got it -- but different! Liked Darth Vader in the original? We got it -- but different! Liked the Jawas scavenging droids? We got 'em -- but different! Same goes for the \"I am your father\" moment, the Luke Skywalker character innately strong with \"the Force\", the entire plan for attacking the new Death Star, R2-D2, \"emperor\" communicating only via hologram, and smuggling messages in droids to keep them from the \"First Order\" (it's the \"Empire\" -- but different). Heck, nearly the entire original cast and the Millennium Falcon itself make appearances! It's hard to argue that \"The Force Awakens\" isn't largely a remake of the original, but somehow, it's still effective. It's certainly a galaxy far, far ahead of the previous lame trilogy. Seeing \"The Force Awakens\" is worth your while, just don't expect any surprises.",

      "review": "  May 19,1999 is a day that lives in infamy legions of Star Wars fans. The day hoped died. I remember trying to convince myself that The Phantom Menace was good but a second viewing confirmed my earlier fears. These movies were not going to be the same as the original trilogy, and George Lucas confirmed that with each successive release. I've had debates with teenagers who swear that the prequels are better films. They aren't. This isn't a matter of opinion; this is fact. After Revenge of the Sith was released in 2005, you could sense that Lucas was burned out and had no desire to further awaken the ire of the fandom. Then in 2012 he surprised everyone by selling the Star Wars empire, along with other properties like Indiana Jones, to Disney for four billion dollars. Immediately Disney let it be known that they wanted to get new Star Wars movies into production ASAP. They tapped J.J. Abrams to spearhead the first steps in a new direction. No other movie has felt the weight of hype and expectation like Episode VII: The Force Awakens. Fans don't want to be hurt once more by someone they loved. For millions of fans that grew up on the original trilogy, The Force Awakens will be the Star Wars movie they have long been waiting for. It erases the bad feelings of the prequels and recalibrates the franchise. However, it is also flawed and seems too indebted to nostalgia. It's certainly good but I cannot put away my nagging reservations (far, far less than what I felt with the prequels).Thirty years after the events of Return of the Jedi, the First Order has risen in place of the evil Empire. The First Order is lead by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and aspiring sith lord Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). They're searching for the droid BB-8 and its own, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). The droid has a map that leads to the whereabouts of the last known Jedi - Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil). A Stormtrooper who adopts the name of Finn (John Boyega) runs away from his mission and joins forces with Rey (Daisy Ridley), a scavenger waiting for her family to return to her world. The duo finds BB-8 and seeks to return the droid to the Resistance. They run into Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and a few other familiar faces on their journey to the Resistance base and to escape the reach of the First Order. Abrams has captured the essential magic of what made the original trilogy so enjoyable and timeless. The prequels carried the burden of setting up characters we had come to love, and so as we watched younger versions of them or characters integral to their development, it was hard to ignore just how little we cared. It didn't feel like Lucas himself cared that much, more content to direct his green screens than his actors. The special effects had improved but for much of the three prequels it felt like watching disinterested actors recite poorly written lines while they run around fake environments with no semblance of reality. The details that Lucas emphasized were ones that were unnecessary, like treaties and trade tariffs and the notorious midichlorians, which made the force into a blood disorder. The prequels harmed the legacy of the franchise. It takes only seconds for you to feel like you're in better hands when you read the opening text crawl. No trade disputes. No galactic senate. It sets up its central chase and the important players in three brief paragraphs. And then we're off and the movie rarely lets up.We pass the torch to a new generation of characters and it's here that Force Awakens is able to leave the large shadow of the original trilogy. The characters are great. Finn gives the viewer an entry point into a world we've never explored onscreen in any real depth, the life of a Stormtrooper, the cannon fodder of the series. He has moral crises and goes AWOL from the duties he has been raised to do. He doesn't want to be a mindless killing-machine and forges his own destiny. Watching him embrace a sense of individuality is entertaining. He's charming and excitable but also fearful of what may catch up to him. Then there's the hero's journey with Rey, a plucky heroine who comes of age over the course of the movie's 135 minutes. Ridley has the presence and poise reminiscent of Keira Knightley, and the screen just adores her. It also helps win her character is easy to root for. Boyega (Attack the Block) and Ridley are terrific and even better paired together. They have a great chemistry and much of the humor is born from the characters rather than lame visual gags like in the prequels. It's fun to hear characters verbally spar with actual good dialogue. Driver was the first actor hired and it's easy to see why. If you've been watching the man on HBO's Girls, you'll know that he has a magnetic presence that separates him from the herd. He plays a villain that so badly wants to follow in Vader's footsteps but the thing that holds him back is the \"temptation of the light.\" In one moment, a badass and imposing villain with super force powers had now also become an interesting character wrestling with his influences. Isaac (Ex Machina) is suave and cocksure as an ace pilot. His affection for the other characters is touching, particularly the robot BB-8. This little guy is going to be the toy that every child on Earth demands for the holidays. BB-8 is adorable from its first moment on screen and made me forget about R2D2. The big worry with Force Awakens was that its new characters would be compelling on their own. After one movie I'm looking forward to more adventures with the new kids on the block. Abrams has restored the sense of fun and awe that resonated from the original trilogy and the biggest compliment is that Episode VII feels like a Star Wars movie (more on which below). The action sequences are quick and filled with great visuals and shot arrangements. For those worried about Abrams' penchant for lens flairs in the Stark Trek reboots, they are completely absent in Force Awakens (Fun fact: for Star Trek Into Darkness, computer effects had to go in and take out lens flairs because Abrams later admitted he had gone a bit overboard). There are some beautifully orchestrated shots and sequences all around here. The first 40-minutes is the best part of the movie, before the older stars come back for their due. The rest of the film is enjoyable, no doubt, but I was more pleased with the original material. The technical expertise has never been higher. Like Mad Max: Fury Road, there's a joy with watching characters interact with a real world of practical effects. Watching the characters run around real environments and real sets rather than immense green screens just makes it feel more real and vital. I enjoyed how worn and weathered the technology in this world comes across. The special effects are judiciously utilized and are excellent as anticipated. It's easy to sense the reverence that Abrams and others have for the series as well as their determination to not repeat the mistakes of the prequels. The first mission for Episode VII is to reset the course, to wash away the bad taste of the prequels that haunt many. Abrams has gone back to what works with these movies and recreated the playbook. It's a movie that will satisfy the hardcore fans and reawaken their love for the series. And yet it almost feels like Force Awakens is a swing too far in the other direction, an overcorrection to the prequels that turns a reboot into a loving homage that approaches facsimile. I was amazed at just how closely Episode VII follows the plot beats of A New Hope (mild spoilers to follow - for real, if you don't want to be spoiled in the slightest, and I'm no monster and won't dare include anything that would substantially deter your viewing, skip to the spoiler safe area). Here goes: once again we start with an escape from an evil starfleet ship, only to land on a desert planet. The hunt is for a droid with valuable information. Our dispirit band of characters collect on the desert planet and flee, only to be eventually pulled back to the evil base of operations, which once again is a giant floating orb that specializes in planet destruction and this orb seems to have the same pesky design flaw that plagued Death Star 1.0 and 2.0. How does this one design flaw still exist? Are there not backups and redundancies? It would be like Titanic 3.0 going down by hitting another iceberg. There are more parallels involving the characters and personal revelations that mirror Episode IV but I won't go into detail on those (end of spoilers). Suffice to say, it felt like I was watching a cover act remind me how much I enjoyed the first Star Wars release. Perhaps Abrams felt his rabid audience needed to go backwards before going forward, pay homage to what had been built by practically reliving its plot in a galaxy not so long ago as it once was (it still is likely the same distance: far far away). It's a movie that cannot escape the nostalgia of its predecessors, and so it indulges it instead. In deferring to fan demands, Force Awakens has moments that waver into the dangerous territory of fan service. This will harm its overall staying power once the glow wears off from audiences overcome with fan relief. Thankfully, the new main characters are compelling and I'll be happy to follow their continuing adventures with Episodes VIII and IX and who knows. Abrams and company have set up the next generation of fan favorites that have the chance to grow out of the sizeable shadow of the original cast. However, not all elements are given that same nurturing care. The Force Awakens is so briskly paced that it rarely has time to establish the new history of its universe. We get character relationships and reunions but I couldn't help but feel that the larger plot they inhabited felt rushed. The First Order seems rather vague and their rise to power needed at least some explanation. Instead we're dropped right into a timeline with an Empire knockoff. It's just easy fascism placeholder. Why are the Republic and the Resistance two separate entities? The villains with the exception of Kylo Ren are pretty one-note and also callbacks to the bad guy types from Episode IV. Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) is in the movie for a lousy three minutes. I'm also not a fan of either of the two motion-capture performances from Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave) and mo-cap pioneer Andy Serkis (Rise of the Planet of the Apes). I hated Nyong'o's character and her performance. The character design for both of those creatures is rather weak and weirdly unimaginative. There's also a habit of characters being naturals at things that would ordinarily require expertise. The worlds we visit and the creatures we encounter are all a bit too similar to earlier sources and distinctly unmemorable. We don't learn much via our locations and geography and so it feels a tad interchangeable and meaningless, which is a shame. The Force Awakens is a mostly exciting return to the rich world of Star Wars with characters we care about, old and new, lively action that feels substantial and real, and a sense of fun that isn't at the expense of your full brainpower. Abrams had two missions: 1) eliminate the disappointment over the prequels, and 2) set up new characters and stories for future installments. Both have been accomplished. Abrams may have been the perfect candidate to restart the Star Wars series as he has a history of making films as loving homage to his cinematic influences. Super 8 was Abrams' homage to Spielberg and Episode VII is very much homage to Episode IV. The well-trod story allows for the series to reset comfortably while setting up its new characters to take a greater storytelling burden from here on out. I hope future installments give us more development to make the worlds and the history matter just as much as Rey, Finn, Kylo, Poe, and BB-8. This may be an unpopular opinion but I feel that Abrams' rollicking 2009 Star Trek reboot is a better Star Wars movie than The Force Awakens. Abrams and company has proven you can make a new and good Star Wars movie. Now my own new hope is that writer/director Rian Johnson will be able to steer the franchise into a fresher direction with Episode VIII. In the meantime, fans can sleep well once again.Nate's Grade: B+",

This feels like the original trilogy, which is both good because it feels like it belongs and bad because they literally rehashed most of the plot points from the original trilogy. That would be my biggest complaint. It was exciting to reunite with the original cast and also see how they will transition to new characters. I am excited about the prospects of where they are going to take this story now that the setup is out of the way. It wasn't perfect, but it was a nice start to a new trilogy.

      "review": "  \"Star Wars\" is back! Walking out of the theatre, there really is not much else to say until you give it quite a bit of time to sink in. As a starting point for these new characters entering this universe, I really do not believe (give the story at hand) that it could have been handled any better than it was. Beginning right off the bat with fresh faces and hilarious comedy, we were given a glimpse at what is to come in this new trilogy. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" follows Rey, as she uncovers a droid owned by Poe Dameron, an X-Wing pilot whom he forms a bond will ally Finn. These three catalysts of this new trilogy are all incredible characters and I cannot wait to see where their adventures lead. Kylo Ren is amazing as the new focus, even though there is much more to the dark side this time around. With more character depth than I was expecting, this film soars on multiple levels. If I had to complain about one aspect, it would be that when familiar elements come into play, calling out moments from the past or nearly copying them, it felt a little risky; However, they make everything work and I bought into everything. Once you can get past that this film is just a starting point and of course there will be similarities, then you will have an experience at the movies unlike anything in years. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" is Hollywood at it's absolute best and J.J. Abrams has definitely brought us back into a Galaxy Far, Far Away, in more ways we could have ever asked for. I can praise the hell out of this film all day, because that is just what this film is. A crowd pleaser all around, it welcomes newcomers with it's fresh characters, and it will blow minds of the die hard fans. It really is everything fans have been asking for. There are so many spoilers to be said by talking about the plot, so I will simply say this... This film does not disappoint. In the end, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" is amazing entertainment, and even though things may feel familiar at times, there is no denying the sheer greatness that this film truly is. Amazing comeback! Big screen filmmaking at it's finest!",

      "review": "  Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is the continuation of the saga started by George Lucas almost forty years ago. Since then the franchise has grown beyond its beginning to crave itself out a huge place in popular culture not only in the United states, but across the globe. There have been dark times for this franchise when it has lost its way (Episodes I, II, and III), but it has continued to thrive with three generations. The Force Awakens signals the start of not only a new trilogy, but new creative forces and new ownership of the Star Wars universe. The film follows a trio of new characters Poe Dameron, Finn, and Rey (Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, and Daisy Ridley) each coming from a different background, yet they all find themselves on the same quest. Along the way they encounter heroes from the previous films such as Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) as they come in conflict with The First Order, a resurgence of the ideals of the Galactic Empire. Led by the Force wielding Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) they continue terrorizing the galaxy in that classic Imperial way. There are many winks and nods throughout the film that doesn't seem like blatant fan service except at a few points in the film. The Force Awakens is the film that we had hoped the prequels would be. The audience genuinely cares about the new characters as opposed to Episodes I, II, and III. People in this film are not as wooden as they were in those films and there are many contribution factors that could affect that fact. Poor acting, poor writing, performing in front of nothing but a green screen probably all contributed to that fact. This film harkens back to nonstop action and adventure that doesn't turn down at all during its 2 hour and 15 minute running time. The story is a great continuation of Star Wars lore that develops patterns in the story, just like human history. We all keep making the same mistakes over and over again. The question is did we learn from them? That will be seen as this trilogy plays out.",

Whereas the original trilogy was figured out as they went. Good new characters. Returning favorites used well. It does have that modern day pacing though, which is almost breakneck. It's nice to slow down and breathe sometimes. Extra half star for the cliffhanger ending, making me more excited for episode 8 than I was for episode 7",

      "review": "  Sorry to say, I found the movie to be a bit lacking. Still a good movie, but in my opinion it was barely better than Jedi (thanks to the stupid Ewoks) and not as good as Sith (fight scenes were the tie breaker for Sith). That puts it #4 on my list of all Star Wars Movies.There are a lot of small issues such as how adept new users can be with, well everything. However of these minor issues, the biggest issue was with the light saber. Apparently training isn't necessary. With that said, instead of listing the remainder of my minor issues item by item, I'm just going to touch on my two biggest irreconcilable issues. First and biggest of my issues is that in their attempt to go back to the \"winning formula,\" they \"borrowed\" too much from previous movies. There's good familiarity that makes you feel warm and fuzzy. Then there's been there done that, got the t-shirt familiarity that makes your commitment to the franchise feel insulted. If you've seen all the movies, you know what I'm talking about.**SPOILER ALERT**Second major issue was how easy a storm trooper could just break away from the First Order during his very first battle after being taken as a child, brainwashed, and reprogrammed. Some would argue that scene somehow humanizes the Stormtroopers. OK let's go with that. So you are asking the audience to then believe that this human character, who drank the kool-aid his whole life, but had an epiphany after seeing one of his brothers in arms killed, then had no problem killing so many of them moving forward? #nofriendsgrowingup. Beyond that, the rebels just welcomed him in without question or suspicion? #nospiesinspace.Sorry JJ Abrams, I am disappointed. It's sad that I could be disappointed in a good movie. But you had a great franchise, and a great track record, so yeah, a good movie is a disappointment. You did such a masterful job with the revisioning of the Star Trek franchise that maybe I was expecting too much. I will submit that I'm as much of a Star Wars fan as I am a Star Trek fan so there is no bias here. My litmus test is simply that if I'm not ready to leave the theater and immediately get back in line for a movie from the biggest franchise in history, you have failed sir.",

Her life changes when she encounters a droid, a secret Storm Trooper, and a broken-down hunk of metal that is the Millennium Falcon.Rey lives on a dangerous planet, and in a dangerous universe, a universe where the new dominant power is not a force for good but a force for evil. It is called the First Order, and it is the spiritual and political successor to the Galactic Empire. It is headed up by a mysterious figure named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who is the primary agent of an even more mysterious figure who calls himself Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis).The droid she encounters has within it a secret message for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the Rebel alliance's \"only hope\" to save the galaxy. Rey makes it her mission to get this secret message to Skywalker, who has been missing since the rise of the First Order.This film is almost as great as \"Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), and yet still crucially depends on that film and the original trilogy for its understanding. Nevertheless, a newcomer to the franchise will no doubt enjoy this film, which hopefully is the inauguration of a whole new beautiful trilogy.",

      "review": "  \"Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens review The Good, The Bad, & (in some cases) The Greedy\" IntroductionIt's here! Finally! Star Wars: Episode VII. 32 years after the release of Return of The Jedi, and 10 and a half years after the release of Revenge of The Sith. It's next to impossible to be excited for this release, or go to the theater without having any sort of expectation. For the last year, I've ignored all rumors surrounding The Force Awakens. I only pay attention to trailers, posters, and TV spots which have all been promising. JJ Abrams takes over the director's chair, promising classic return and old school style approach to making Episode VII. Also including some original cast members, writers, and crew members. Less use of heavy CGI, and more focus on using practical effects, costumes, makeup, models, and real sets. Before even being released, The Force Awakens was already a breath of fresh air to the Star Wars series, which has unfortunately fallen victim to its prequel trilogy amongst most fans and audiences. However, The Force Awakens comes with a lot of nit picking, but the fact that you have to nit pick the film says it's a really good film. Really good!The Force Awakens StorylineThe Force Awakens takes place 29 years after the fall of Galactic Empire. The film opens with a new evil force in place of the fallen Empire, called The First Order. Led under the guidance of the evil Kylo Ren, a fallen Jedi apprentice who desires to be Darth Vader. The First Order and Kylo Ren are under the leadership of a new mystery Supreme Leader by the name of Snoke, who wants the Jedi destroyed for good. In light of everything Luke Skywalker, the last of the Jedi, has gone into hiding, leaving Kylo Ren in desperate search for the map pieces that lead to Skywalker's location and ultimate demise. Also searching for Skywalker is the Resistance. A Republic military group deep in the fight against The First Order, and led by General Leia Organa. The missing map piece is in the care of a droid, BB-8, on the desert planet of Jakku. He's rescued by Rey, a scavenger girl who was abandoned on Jakku over 20 years ago. She remains hopeful that her family will return for her one day. Rey and BB-8 cross paths with Finn, a young ex-Stormtrooper who abandoned The First Order and their cause. Finn agrees to help Rey return BB-8 to The Resistance, and to make sure the map to Skywalker doesn't fall in the hands of Kylo Ren. However, in the shadows of the galaxy The First Order have completed their new ice planet star base called Starkiller. A planet like Death Star with the capability to drain the power of near by stars. Thus using that energy to destroy multiple planets with one single strike. Along Rey and Finn's journey they receive help from Poe Dameron, the best fighter pilot in the Resistance, as well as Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, and many other new and old familiar faces. On their journey to not only finding Skywalker but also stopping The First Order, Throughout the course of Rey's journey to delivering BB-8 safely to the Resistant she discovers a hidden power in her. The Force. Rey is strong with the Force, but this power and her family past remains a mystery best saved for Episode VIII. The Force Awakens, as said by a very old familiar voice in the film (Obi-Wan), is Rey's first steps with letting the Force in. The Pros The Force Awakens comes at you bursting with Star Wars excitement and thrills. JJ Abrams stood his ground strong from day one of Disney and LucasFilm hiring him to take on the great challenge of being the film's director. Disney originally slated Force Awakens for a May 2015 release, giving Abrams only a year and a half to complete a script, cast new actors, find locations, build sets, shoot, post-production effects, editing, scoring. Abrams demanded an extra year from Disney to avoid a rush production and to ensure a spectacular new chapter. Disney gave him 7 extra months, which was the absolute right decision. Can you image what Episode VII would've looked like if it had been released back in May? A mess! In the wake of Return of The Jedi's conclusion, we lose some major players of Star Wars, mainly Darth Vader, Darth Sidious (The Emperor), and Yoda. The Force Awakens does welcome back old familiar names and faces, Han, Luke, Leia, Chewie, Threepio, R2, even Admiral Ackbar! The real joy of Episode VII is in the enjoyment of the new additions. Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo Ren, Snoke BB-8. The new characters of The Force Awakens are a key element to the start of this new Star Wars trilogy, which was missing in Episodes I-III. Not to say I did not like Ewan McGregor or Liam Neeson or Natalie Portman. Unknown to most audiences who are too quick to highlight these A-list actors with their acting in the prequels with, \"They were so wooden. Lacked depth. Their scenes were too one dimension\". Yeah, these poor actors were A) Not allowed to see the script until the day of the shootB) Were only allowed to access to the scene they would be shooting, not the complete scriptC) Were only allowed 3 takes for each scene. D) People seem to forget. Star Wars is a space opera. AKA, a soap opera set in space with loads of action! Soap operas are cheesy, campy, and filled with terrible acting. These limitations in the production of the prequels were to avoid crazy fans leaking out details about the films. However, The Force Awakens has more mystery and sets up for more future surprises the previous 6 films combined! I'm sure the actors of The Force Awakens had some restrictions with access and details to the plans of the new trilogy, but their performances are good. Really good! In fact, it's the best performances Star Wars has ever had! Believable, genuine, character depth, and yet there is still a touch of the old school space opera acting we grew up watching. However, despite all the security measures taken in production, I expect Abrams to allow his actors more scene takes and more script time. Every performance looks, sounds, and feels like time and thought was carefully executed. One of the biggest surprises in The Force Awakens comes from the character side of BB-8. Yes, a droid, which has also been a major marketing symbol for the film. It's hard to even think of replacing C-3PO and R2-D2, let alone have one single smaller droid stand in for them. BB-8 is not only a great addition to the Star Wars saga, but he is a wonderful character who alone can re-create the same charm C3-PO and R2-D2 displayed in the deserts of Tatoonie in A New Hope. The promise return of practical model effects, make-up, alien costumes, and real sets rather than just all out green screen with CGI left and right in The Force Awakens was the absolute right decision and best way to get fans back on board with continuing the Star Wars saga. Abrams admits to being a long-time fan of Star Wars, and his execution to story, characters, and details proves his childhood love. The Cons Which Should Never Have BeenThe Force Awakens is bursting with excitement, thrills, and great fun. It's a worthy new installment into the Star Wars film franchise. Was I completely satisfied with the film? No. The problem lies in the bar level The Force Awakens has long been aiming for. The target is to be on the same level of greatness as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. The prequels never had this in mind which made them easy for me to come out of the theater saying, \"That was great, I loved it so much!\" The Force Awakens has had it sights on being a return to a similar level of greatness, which has made A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back timeless, unlike the prequel and even Return of The Jedi. However, whenever a film aims to be great, you find yourself noticing every little detail and nit picking. This is not nit picking such as, \"Why did they make Snoke CGI, he should've been more realistic looking\" If your critique of the film is picking at something like this, then your not standing back and looking at the whole picture here. I have little nit picks, but also some that may end up being greater than just a little nit pick.1. Slightly disappointing editing which drops the Star Wars scope 2. So many unanswered questions & the Disney problem3. Leave the damn mask on!4. The musical score lacking the Star Wars magicEditing Leaves Out Star Wars ScopeMany will argue that The Force Awakens has a thin plot, yes but so does A New Hope. Or that The Force Awakens also has a lot of unanswered questions, true but so did A New Hope. Do you think anyone in 1977 knew what the hell the Clone Wars were? Most of the answers to The Force Awakens will come in Episode VIII and IX. My biggest dissatisfaction comes from the film's editing and the scope of the film, something that should've never been a problem. JJ Abrams and his team have come through on their word of using practical effects and going back to the elements which made Star Wars so classic, but why was The Force Awakens not fully edited to the scope of Star Wars? I'll be the first to admit this, but I preferred so many of the shots in the trailers to the ones used in the theatrical cut. Trailer 1 - the beautiful shot of the 3 X-Wings flying across the water. Trailer 2 - the wide shot of the Tie Fighter tied up in the Star Destroyer hanger while flying around and blasting Stormtroopers, one trooper even gets tossed into the air. Key shots like these completely sold me on the studio's promise to film Force Awakens in the same scope as the original trilogy. They looked and felt like classic Star Wars and old school Lucas filmmaking of the 70s and 80s. The decision to go with lesser impressive angles and shots was not only a distraction, but also slightly upsetting. I am not saying I did not find any joy or magic in these scenes, I still found myself smiling from the visual thrills. However, I would be lying if I said that I was satisfied with the scope, editing, and pace of each flight action sequence. There are too many action sequences in which shots jump too quickly without giving the audience time to process the grand imaginary. The already fast pace dogfight battles were too rushed. The shots of the Falcon being chased by Tie Fighters on Jakku were paced perfectly in the trailers. TRAILER 1, the first time we got to the see the Millennium Falcon dodges out across the sky then dips down to avoid a pair of in-coming Tie Fighters. The exact same sequence was in the final cut, but the frame rate was sped up greatly in the film making it difficult to even know what was going on. TRAILER 2, the shot of the Falcon flying inside the engines of the crashed Executor Star Destroyer was trimmed down a few frames making it a quick flash of the Falcon followed with immediate explosions, rather than cut to a single shot looking down the long engine shaft with the rear of the Falcon flying out while laser blasts from the pursuing Tie Fighter hit parts of the old ship creating head-on explosions. Why??? The editing of the dogfighting scenes was not edited with the scope of original Star Wars trilogy in mind. The trailers clearly showed us months, even a year ago, these spectacular widescreen scope shots done for the film, only to be thrown onto the cutting room floor for less impression replacement shots. In the final film, early scenes on Jakku had the scope I'm referring to. However, the dogfighting action scenes suffered tremendously from using more quick cuts, sped up frames, and shots which would rather put us as close as humanly possible rather than sit back and watch in awe all the visual splendor happening all across the screen in one grand sensational shot. This is not a small nit pick, this one is crucial, because it makes the film feel less like Star Wars. The same can be said about seeing the film in 3D. The 3D for The Force Awakens is good, but having the 3D makes the film feel less like Star Wars and more like Iron Man. Plus, add in the editing changes of speeding up frames and making cuts quicker than they originally were make watching The Force Awakens trickier to watch in 3D. You can't easily sit in the movie theater and process what it is your seeing in the film's action scenes.  Another technical flaw in the film, which was explained to me before my second viewing of the film comes in the director of photography (DP)/cinematography department. For the scenes inside the space station Starkiller, the film's DP crafted and used a special lens filter to help make give the space station a similar gritty, steel, and hazy gray look to the space station environment. However, because of DP's self-satisfaction with the final result of those scenes, he applied the same filter to the scenes with The Resistance. The result had many of these scenes looking out of focus and fuzzy. The biggest stand out involved Leia being completely out of focus when she approaches Han to talk about his involvement in the assault on Starkiller. Unprofessional. Completely unprofessional. The DP used filters designed for a completely different location involving the film's villains, and decided to use for something completely opposite in the film. Was there no testing prior to shooting dates to see if this would work? Rather than assuming everything be great looking in the end? I have to be upset with this, because the cinematography's job is highly critical. Why do you think Scotland looked so stunning in Skyfall? Why do you think Hoth looked so cold and desolated in Empire Strikes Back? For the amount of money a DP would make on Episode VII, and trust me it's an insane amount, this was not a professional grade A job. So Many Unanswered QuestionsThe Force Awakens does have a lot of unanswered questions. As it should have, but there comes a point when around every corner of the film is yet another unanswered question.How and why was The First Order able to achieve and pick up were the Empire left off? (This question kills me) Can the giant Starkiller planet actually move? After it drains up the power of all nearby stars can it travel to a new location? It's a planet, how can it travel? If it can't move, how is it able to re-locate to other stars once it drains up all the nearby stars? How was The First Order established? When did The First Order rise into power?Why are they supported in the galaxy when they directly stand on the same practices as the Old Galactic Empire?Who started The Resistance? Is the Republic without an army or is The Resistance their army? The Rebel Alliance was started by a band of militia style fighters and those committed to the Old Republic, easily explained in A New Hope, not so well in The Force Awakens. Why did Han leave Leia and the Resistance? I assume it was because of Kylo Ren? For Han to abandoned everything when the conflict involves him seems very unlike Han Solo. The film made it seem like there was another reason for him leaving. How did Supreme Leader Snoke come into power? Who is he really?How was Kylo Ren able to be seduced to the Dark Side by Snoke while being trained by Luke Skywalker. Did Kylo and his Knights of Ren kill other Jedi Knights?Darth Vader was the evil Sith Lord who redeemed himself by saving the Jedi and destroying the Sith Emperor, so why does Kylo Ren want to follow in the footsteps of Vader so bad?Is Captain Phasma important? Why was she only in the film for about 5 minutes? Maz is an old friend of Han Solo, but how and from when? One line of dialogue would've solved this.How was Maz able to retrieve Anakin and Luke's lightsaber, which fell from Cloud City? I loved that Maz acknowledged that the answer to the saber's discovery will be saved for later. Is Rey related to Obi-Wan or is she a Skywalker?Say what you want about the prequels, but the prequels properly set up the birth of the Empire. The Sith tricked the Republic into having a Galactic Empire, by using pawning the Trade Federation into a dispute with the Republic over the layout trade in the galaxy which led to war and their formation of the Separatists droid army which led to the great Clone Wars. The Force Awakens does more than slightly ignore, the film does very little to explain how we've arrived to the point in the saga's timeline. 29 years after the events of Return of The Jedi is a pretty big gap to cover, and to not explain anything and skip over 29 years to pick up Episode VII here is unfortunate. I'm all for mystery and letting things go unsolved until the following Episodes. However, there comes a point where I should not have a pile of bothering questions while watching the film, take for example the new Starkiller planet base. I like Starkiller, but while it's bigger than the previous two Death Stars it's place in Episode VII is minimal and does not give it the impact or nearly as much dread as compared to the first two Death Stars. Both previous Death Stars were mobile space stations which could travel to a near by planet and destroy it with the station's core firepower. Were over halfway through the film and within 10-15 minutes of the climatic finale assault by the time we fully see Starkiller and its full power potential. And as I said before, can the giant Starkiller move? This is question I should not have to ask, which bugs me to death! After Starkiller drains up the power of all nearby stars can it travel to a new location? It's an ice planet converted into a space station, so does it have the ability to travel? If Starkiller can travel, we never hear this mentioned or see this happen. If Starkiller is not able to travel, its pointless once all the nearby stars have been drained. Another possible reason for the massive pile of unanswered questions, and probably the main reason why is Disney's greed. Before The Force Awakens was released Disney announced their intentions to make Star Wars the first ever forever franchise. Sounds awesome! Until you hear what that entails. Disney plans to release a new Star Wars movie every year. Whether it is another spin off film or another official Episode in the Star War cannon. You would think I would as excited as a kid on Christmas morning upon hearing this. I wasn't. In fact I was disgusted. In the past, the time span of the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy was a new Episode every three years until the trilogy was done. Disney plans to release a new Episode of this trilogy/saga every two years with spin off films in between. The marketing for The Force Awakens was the biggest movie marketing ever. There was not a single place you can be without seeing something Star Wars related. TV, radio ads, Malls, grocery stores, department stores, billboards, pet stores, everywhere! It got to a point where I just wanted the film to be released so things would calm down. I was finding myself a little tired of being a fan. A Star Wars movie every year! I don't think I can take this every year. Disney does the same with Marvel films, and I've been sick of those for the last two and a half years. Disney will do to Star Wars what George Lucas never did. Disney may end up killing Star Wars not just for me, but also for everyone. Leave The Damn Mask On!With the redeeming death of Darth Vader in Return of The Jedi we lose one of the greatest villains of all-time. That's a lot to live up to. Enter Kylo Ren a mystery-masked villain of The First Order with Jedi-like training and strong training with the Force. Kylo is the body and fighting skills of Darth Maul with the mask, voice, and temper of Darth Vader. Midway through the film it is revealed that Kylo Ren is the son of Han Solo, trained by Luke Skywalker, turned to the Dark Side by the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke, and desires to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather Darth Vader. Why follow is evil grandfather when he actually redeems himself by destroying the Sith Lord/Emperor and saving the galaxy? No clue! However, Kylo Ren is a pretty badass villain. His dark shadow of mystery and anger is intension and fun to have back in Star Wars. However, Kylo Ren removes his mask, twice in the film. The second time he removes the mask is 100% fitting. The scene has him and Han Solo, face-to-face, father and son. The removal of Kylo's mask to reveal is undamaged young adult face would've bettered this scene if he had not removed it earlier. During an interrogation scene between Kylo Ren and Rey, he removes the mask. No! No, No, No! The minute the mask comes off and his face is revealed, Kylo Ren is less of a villain. Which makes perfect sense when he displays his struggle to his father. However, having him remove his mask makes him a wild card young adult playing dress up and trying to be something he's not. What if Darth Vader revealed his Anakin face in The Empire Strikes Back? The Dark Side has taken him, and Anakin Skywalker is lost. He would be less Vader. Once he takes the mask off in Return of the Jedi to be face-to-face, father and son with Luke, he's no longer Darth Vader he's Anakin Skywalker once again. The decision to have Kylo Ren remove his mask a few scenes early when it wasn't critical was wrong, very wrong.The Hardest Comment to MakeOne of the biggest problems I have with The Force Awakens is one I never thought in a million years I would be down on. John Williams' is the simply the best, I love everything this man does. Even his scores for films like Always and 1941. I hate to admit this was even a problem, but it was. The score for The Force Awakens is missing the thrill, the excitement, the joy, the triumph, but most importantly the magic heard in every prior Star Wars score. Not saying the score here is not good at all. It's a good and solid score for an action adventure, but this is Star Wars Episode VII and it's missing all the wonder and triumph of the epic space adventure. The score is more suited for a series like Indiana Jones, or a film like Hook. The key musical factors missing are themes and dominating action music. Don't freak out, the music has the classic Star Wars theme, the Force theme, Han and Leia love theme, but the original material here is a little flat. Take Episode I, you have Duel of Fates, Anakin's theme, the Droid Invasion March, Jar-Jar's theme. Episode III, you have General Grievous theme, Battle of Heroes, Anakin's Seduction and Betrayal. The Empire Strikes Back, you have the Imperial March, Han and Leia's love theme, Yoda's theme, Cloud City's theme. With The Force Awakens you have Rey's theme, the Resistance March, maybe possibly a theme for Snoke, and this is pretty much it. No Kylo Ren theme, no First Order theme, no themes for Finn, Poe, Maz, or even BB-8! In every Star Wars film the score has been fantastic in every scene, with new original material in each Episode to add a great finishing shine to the visuals. This time around the score is not very memorable. The music sinks in without jumping out at the audience, unless a classis theme suddenly comes up. The score often carries a repetitive non-pulse feel from scene to scene. If you listen carefully the music is different throughout the scenes, but it does not sound any different. In other words the score does not aid in telling the story at key times. In every previous Star Wars Episode you could listen to the soundtrack and knew without seeing the film what kind of action was happening, or what the characters were feeling. Duel of The Fates - a grand lightsaber battle. Anakin's Betrayal - the destruction of the Jedi.Anakin's Dark Deeds - the complete fall of Skywalker into the power of the Sith. The Pit of Carkoon - feelings of intensity for our captured heroes until they break free and Luke unleashes his Jedi training for the heroic rescue. The Force Awakens' key action scene is the Millennium Falcon's chase on Jakku, which returns us to the old gunner nest of the Falcon from A New Hope, as well as the classic feel of the asteroid chase in Empire Strikes Back, and yet the music has none of that sensational thrill to light up the screen with the sound of adventure. At the very least someone should've added a nod to The Asteroid Field track as the Falcon races through the wreckage of the upside down Executive Star Destroyer. No Star Wars film would be complete without a climatic lightsaber battle, and The Force Awakens does have a solid saber duel. However, the music playing with the duel goes unnoticed. Williams has always scored big with creating a grand lightsaber duel music track. Episode I - Duel of The FatesEpisode III - Battle of The HeroesEpisode V - The Clash of LightsabersEpisode VI - Vader and Luke's Final Fight (track \"The Battle of Endor II\") For the climatic lightsaber duel in The Force Awakens between Kylo Ren, Finn, and Rey the music on the soundtrack comes and goes without the listener even realizing what they just heard was a duel. This was the first time I walked out of the theater after seeing a new Star Wars film and had no idea what the music was during a fight scene. John Williams has always been brilliant and consistent with his scores. The first act of Force Awakens has a solid score, with the exception of the Falcon's chase on Jakku, but the score for the last half of the film becomes almost completely forgettable. What happened with The Force Awakens? Was it his old age? Is Williams tried of doing these scores? I don't believe it to be any of these. What was missing was his collaboration with George Lucas. Yes! Lucas and Williams have collaborated on the musical score for all 6 previous Star Wars films. The Force Awakens was scored without Lucas' involvement. Which not only greatly shows, but also adds something greatly disappointing to George Lucas not being involved anymore. Some magic has gone missing already in Star Wars. The music of Star Wars has always been a factor. Whether the film was good or bad, the music was always masterful! The score for Episode VII is the weakest of all 7 films, and makes viewing The Force Awakens feel less Star Wars.  ConclusionFor better or worse I have a love/dislike for The Force Awakens. So many of the promising shots I saw in the trailers were substituted with lesser impacting shots, the film presents too many unanswered questions, the collaboration for the music of The Force Awakens was not there. However, I love the characters of The Force Awakens. The acting is some of the strongest I've seen out of 7 films. In the end the film is fantastic. Did The Force Awakens miss its mark of being as great as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back? Yes. The beauty of a film like The Empire Strikes Back wasn't to be as great as A New Hope, but to continue the story in superior fashion. The Force Awakens overall production was spot on with how to return to the fun old school cinema approach of shooting Star Wars. However, Disney and the modern style of movie making need to be more mindful for the scope and magic of Star Wars for Episode VIII and IX.Where does Episode VII fall in the rankings of Star War films?1.

It's really an Aaron Sorkin movie above all else, which means we get absurdly intelligent characters walking and talking at rapid-fire with brilliant one-liners and snappy dialogue that bristles with musicality to it, the kind that your ears perk up for. It's a feast for the ears; however, Steve Jobs is really an emotionally cold stage play on film. Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) is the director but the staginess of the conceit is too much for the visually nimble filmmaker to overcome. There are a few small visual flourishes as inserts but the star is Sorkin's verbose screenplay. We get a glimpse into the prickly, egotistical, bullying, visionary, and curious man that was Steve Jobs. His continual denial of being the father to his daughter is a source of great contrarian insight. The structure of the script lends itself to repetition and artificiality. All these characters keep turning up and having these important conversations at these moments? After a while it feels like the characters are talking in circles and waiting for catharsis, and the concluding ten minutes is a detour into unearned sentiment. The movie and its major themes just do not come together with the clarity or force that the filmmakers believe. Michael Fassbender is superb as Jobs and there isn't a bad performance in the bunch. It's an engaging movie in the moment but I don't feel like I know Jobs any better than before. In attempting to tell the life of one influential man, Sorkin has made the movie about himself, but The Social Network this is not. Nate's Grade: B",

      "review": "  With a screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin, you really shouldn't be worried. Once again, he writes a tight, tense script, that highlights the most interesting moments in the life of the late \"Steve Jobs.\" Choosing very carefully, this is a very well-crafted biopic in the strangest way. Michael Fassbender is terrific in the title role and Jeff Daniels, Kate Winslet, and Seth Rogen (surprisingly) play off him extremely well. This is a character study and nothing more. Unlike the film \"The Social Network,\" which focussed on both the characters and the entire process of the creation of Facebook, \"Steve Jobs\" is even more dialogue driven, but it begins after Apple has been created. Danny Boyle definitely has his direction stamp on this one and it shines beautifully through the images on screen. Overall, \"Steve Jobs\" is a great ride for what it is, but nothing is all that exciting about it. I would give some nods to the writing and acting that this year's Oscars, but I think that is where the amazement ends. In the end, I had a great time with this film.",

I completely loved the way the Aaron Sorkins script captured the legend of this imperfect man who changed the world forever. But its director Danny Boyle who brings the script to life, giving us a stunning film that brings the story and actors to life. Michael Fassbender has risen as one of the best and most capable actors working in Hollywood. He may not resemble Jobs, but he plays the man so well that I believe most will ignore this pointlessly issues. He has the timing, grace, enthusiasm and brutality to pull off playing the man. He is able to cast him in a likable and unlikable picture yet never losing that charisma. Kate Winslet is fantastic as always, bringing us one of her best performances in years. She is humorous, fascinating and brings a lot of life to character. Seth Rogen blew me away in his more serious performance as Steve Wozniak. While there is a fun side to the character, this actor shines in his emotional scenes with Fassbender. You can feel a strained but strong friendship between the two, and I am glad Rogen was able to finally show some range as an actor. Jeff Daniels continues to prove that is a force to be reckoned with. He brings so much power to the screen that its almost staggering.",

      "review": "  WORDMAN: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Being An Asshole) - My Review of STEVE JOBS (3 1/2 Stars)Aaron Sorkin must have shit a brick when BIRDMAN came out, because STEVE JOBS, as audaciously entertaining as it can be at times, is THE SAME DAMN MOVIE! Told in three parts, all located backstage at significant product launch events in the Apple co-founder's career, the important people in his life congregate for their turn to yell at this difficult, arrogant, strategic, cunning, neglectful, impossible man. No, it's not told in a single shot and no, Michael Fassbender, who excels at letting us into the energetic mind of Jobs, doesn't levitate or sprout wings, but the dissection of a man as told by his coterie remains the same. Pairing Sorkin's wall-to-wall dialogue with the kinetic, visionary director, Danny Boyle, sounds great on paper. While written like a stage play, Boyle's hiring brought with it the possibility of infusing it with his boundless energy. Unfortunately, this is Sorkin's film all the way, and Boyle's stamp can barely be seen. In the trailer, there's a shot of the back of Jobs' head as he waits in front of a door, a pause, and then he bursts through. It's what I was hoping for from Boyle, this tension between stillness and action, but those moments are so few and far between. There's a beautiful wide shot in a hallway with a projected image that feels tacked on as a heavy-handed afterthought. A not-so-subtle rainstorm takes over the background of a key boardroom scene. It feels like Boyle is doing everything he can to get an \"ahem\" in there, but it's a losing battle against Sorkin's vision. It's not that the film is lousy. Far from it. It's just a one-sided marriage. This is tricky, adult, smart, vibrant storytelling, albeit the very type that won an Oscar a year ago, and wholly the work of its writer. In addition to the electric Fassbender, Kate Winslet, as Jobs' Polish Marketing Exec Joanna Hoffman, who can go toe-to-toe with him more than anyone else, gives a furious, committed performance. The heart and soul of the film, however, belongs to Seth Rogen as Jobs' former partner, Steve Wozniak. Rogen finds the humanity in the man who would eventually become overshadowed by the CEO in the glasses, turtleneck and Mom Jeans. Michael Stulhbarg, so great in A SERIOUS MAN, plays Andy Herzfeld , Apple's Chief Developer, with great underdog bravado, firing snappy one-liners back at Jobs with great skill. Same goes for Jeff Daniels as John Sculley, a one-time Apple CEO, who has to bring the hammer down on Jobs on more than one occasion. Katherine Waterston, so good in INHERENT VICE, proves that performance was no fluke, with her turn as Jobs' ex-girlfriend and impoverished welfare mother. They have a daughter together, Lisa, and Jobs' inability to recognize her as such is, along with Wozniak's storyline, the emotional arc of the film. STEVE JOBS shines a light on a man's fight to excel in business and innovation while his fundamental decency erodes. The baby steps Jobs takes towards his own humanity are presented in true fashion to its subject, without a shred of overt sentimentality. Instead, we're left with a warts-and-all portrait of a megalomaniac struggling with such things as gratitude and selflessness. Had it not been done before and so recently, I would be jumping up and down more for this film. Sure, it's less a biopic and more of a compact look at a man trying to get his way during the key moments in his professional career. I appreciate that it doesn't look at his entire life, intending to get at his essence instead. Sorkin refuses to dumb down his non-stop dialogue and characters, forcing the audience to stay alert. Cinematographer Alwin H. K�chler, who also shot Boyle's SUNSHINE, works overtime to make these backstage rooms sing, but there's no disguising the Broadway play just itching to get out from under the movie treatment. A film about a marketing master who, along with the real geniuses, has changed how the world interacts, is worthy. I was hoping, however, for a little more innovation, instead of the very \"Sorkin-y\" walk and talk on display. Still, I highly recommend STEVE JOBS, because movies about smart people almost never happen anymore. Jobs seemed to know that the only way to realize his vision was to be a complete jerk. Perhaps Boyle, who is known for being a truly nice guy, could have put his foot down and inserted his voice a little more, then STEVE JOBS could have been a brittle masterpiece. We'll have to settle for really, really good instead, and that's something Jobs would have never done.",

The performances are spot on, the dialogue is as snappy as any Aaron Sorkin movie I've seen, the structure keeps the pace going, and Danny Boyle gives the film an energy that compliments Sorkin's writing perfectly. All in all, even if just judging on individual scenes alone, Steve Jobs has some of the best moments in any film I've seen this year.

      "review": "  A high performance machine sporting an operating system that's at times brilliant but at times slow, Steve Jobs proves a remarkable upgrade from its glitch-filled predecessor and boasts some award worthy hardware besides. Not that the software comes completely riddled with bugs, mind you. The three-act design - set backstage at iconic product launches and ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac - proves to be the greatest and most irksome portion of the film. Rather than present the man in a cradle-to-grave slide show, the film integrates a lot of facts, figures, and (emotional) core processing into three key moments that capture the human factor behind this genius like lightning in a bottle and doesn't completely feel like data processing. Like any multiple storied production, however, some chapters emerge stronger than others and Steve Jobs suffers the slight indignity of the weakest link playing out last. Aaron Sorkin punctuates the goings-on with some super-intelligent zingers (indeed, he has given filmgoers one of the most quotable films of the last decade) and heartfelt back-and-forths (despicable at times, his interactions with his assistant, daughter, and former partner make this a phenomenal performance piece for all involved), but his third act becomes a bit dull before hitting audiences with an engrossing and deeply vetting curtain closer.An R-rated drama based on Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography, this bio-pic takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint a portrait of the man (Fassbender) at its epicenter. Michael Fassbender flirted with Supporting Actor Oscar before for 12 Years a Slave, but Steve Jobs posits a good reason why he didn't get it: He's a lead performer and deserves Best Actor accolades all the more for this, his best turn yet. Director Danny Boyle deserves a good deal of the credit, however. Despite limited locations, the action always feels fluid and the arena grand. Of course, it helps that the settings compliment Sorkin's walk-and-talk style, pioneered on NBC's The West Wing and put to excellent use here too. Bottom line: Big Mac",

      "review": "  People have asked frequently what I thought of the film Steve Jobs, most of them expecting a long-winded, nuanced answer full of qualifiers, as is my custom. Everyone has been floored by my simple and firm response. It's fucking PERFECT. I have hesitated to pen this review for fear of sounding pedantic, fawning, or trite. But there is is no avoiding the inevitable. Steve Jobs is finest example of acting and screenwriting we are to receive this year. Period. This film takes a theatrical approach and delivers a variation of a traditional three-act play. Rather than try to take on the broad narrative of our protagonist's life story while worshipping Apple (as the overly hagiographic Jobs did a few years earlier), each act takes place directly before a public launch event. This particular choice is no accident, as Steve Jobs is widely recognized for being a master of theatrics and stagecraft. Steve Jobs is channeled in fine form by Michael Fassbender, who has quietly become the world's best underrated actor. His Jobs is deeply intelligent, narcissistic, manipulative, ambitious, and a committed and uncompromising strategist. It's no mistake that Steve silently looks upon a painting of Napoleon Bonaparte and ponders his future. We also see much of his philosophy and business strategy, such as accessibility over versatility, design over function, and aesthetics over hardware, to the chagrin of many of the supporting characters. Independent film queen Kate Winslet manages to issue great back-and-forth, rapid-fire dialog as Jobs' long suffering assistant. The direction by Danny Boyle is fantastic and micro-focused, not a scene wasted or needed. The script, curtesy of Aaron Sorkin, represents his best work since The Social Network and it's hard not to see the parallels in terms of the themes presented and the real life giants they tackle. One particular scene stood out to me in which Jobs and his former CEO, played by Jeff Daniels engage in a brutal argument. While most would see only two white guys in suits arguing in an empty room with a few chairs, I saw a vicious lightsaber duel to the death. The dialog give a no-holds barred gritty feel and the scene had me more tensed and riveted than any action movie thus year, save Mad Max: Fury Road. One might be tempted to call this ACTING: THE MOVIE.Other subplots proved to be rewarding as well, such as the odd relationship between Jobs and his daughter (three different actresses) which gives him a true arc by humbling him, forcibly, and bringing him full circle with his life decisions. He also shares a critical trait with the main characters of Citizen Kane, Raging Bull, and the Social Network in that the skills and abilities that make him succeed professionally, doom him in his personal life. Jobs even admits that he is \"poorly made.\" There are numerous other performances by character actors such as Seth Rogen that complete it so perfectly, but it would take another 3 paragraphs to do them justice. I can simply reiterate that Steve Jobs is lean, well-crafted masterpiece that deserves more attention and every award that it will be nominated for. See it. Absorb it. Think different.",

A lot of Petty drama that while I'm sure is important to the man Steve Jobs, but is entirely unnecessary in the film of that title. I mean, is the movie about Steve Jobs road to success or his daughter? I really don't know.

Every major character in this movie is smart, quick-witted, and fast-talking, which makes them nearly indistinguishable from one another as people. There is no room for subtlety, nuance, or reflective silence. It all seems like it's just a bunch of Aaron Sorkins walking around talking to each other very quickly, and considering that this is supposed to paint a portrait of a real man, it only succeeds in leaving the viewer with the impression that he -- Steve Jobs -- acted like an Aaron Sorkin character.",

And the supporting cast is all around fantastic as they take Fassbender's consistent sport for verbal assault. The only thing that was remotely negative about this film for me was its inherent \"repetitiveness\", which is likely intended to be that way because of the film's super-focused plot and meticulous structure; The filmmakers were trying to tell this story in a different, compelling way.

      "review": "  Aaron Sorkin gives the Apple co-founder some close scrutiny in this unflattering portrait, cleverly framed around three key product launches. Caught at his most over-stressed, Jobs often comes off as both the smartest man in the room and the most heartless, a difficult mix that's expertly managed by Michael Fassbender in the leading role. Fassbender doesn't even remotely look the part, but his ruthless conviction and forceful, melting gaze make the act easy to swallow despite that. It's also true of Seth Rogen, actually, who seems a bizarre choice to play celebrated engineer Steve Wozniak, but pulls it off against all odds in several tastefully limited appearances. This isn't the typical biopic, spanning a figure's entire life and weaving it all into one grand, epic journey with a happy ending. Instead, it's a concise, efficient peek through the window at three turning points in the man's history: his biggest gamble (Macintosh), his greatest spin (NeXT) and his ultimate redemption (iMac). The products get their moments to shine, as does Jobs's infamous penchant for micro-management, but the real story focuses on his relationship with an unwanted, unaccepted daughter and the betrayal of an adoptive pseudo-father. There's warmth in the script, and in its focal figure, but also a terrible, heartbreaking coldness on both fronts that seems painfully real. It may not be the whole story (several heavy moments are fabricated in the name of plot) but it's enough to convey a better understanding of its subject as a human being, warts and all.

      "review": "  Slick, captivating and driven by outstanding performances, Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs is an incredibly focused, tensioned and well-paced biopic. Far from being a \"dream story\" of a cult \"tech-hero\", the movie is a provocative depiction of an arrogant, rude genius who found his own way to make things happen the way he has dreamed. The success of Danny Boyle's delivery is hidden in two main factors which wonderfully compliment Boyle's directing: the actors and the screenplay of Aaron Sorkin. Just like The Social Network, Sorkin's screenplay is direct, aggressive and dialogue based. Rather than a whole life story, the movie covers three specific events from Jobs' life in order to create a complete depiction of his character. Each scene is minutes before the presentation of a new product inspired by Jobs and just minutes before it all corporate, private and personal sides of the main character are being revealed to the audience. The second reason why Steve Jobs is a must see movie is the performance of Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet. The former delivers a mesmerizingly manic performance which truly deserves the Oscar nod which it received (although its chances of winning are quite small) while the latter is most deservedly considered to be among the favorites to actually grab the award for Best-Supporting Actress. Winslet gracefully remains in the shadows of Fassbender while she shows the same determination and dedication to success and Jobs' dreams as Jobs himself. If asked, why I would not consider Danny Boyle's latest aspiration to grab some Oscar Awards, the answer would be simple. While the screenplay and the direction make it possible to have a wonderfully tensed movie, the lack of emotional load and actual involvement by the audience with the characters is present at every moment. In addition to this, the final \"redemption part\" simply does not match the rest of the content and seems a bit awkward in the end. In conclusion, Steve Jobs is a brilliant movie which despite its minor flaws will be potentially a serious Awards-contender (at least Alan Sorkin has a real shot at winning for Best Screenplay, as well as Kate Winslet for Best Supporting Actress). A captivating, thrilling and completely enjoyable, the movie is one of the highlights of 2015.",

      "review": "  So I've finally got a chance to watch \"Steve Jobs\" over the weekend and I thought it was pretty good. Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet both gave a terrific performance, as the chemistry between the two was convincing and enjoyable to watch. The writing and the directing is this movies biggest strength, because the movie is non-stop talking and that's what this movie really is, and I know this isn't going to be for everyone, but for me, I was engaged all the way through and I honestly can't recall being bored while watching the movie. My biggest praise that I have for this movie has to go to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin, because filming and writing a movie like this isn't easy (trust me). The problems I have for the movie are very small and many people wouldn't be bothered by this, but this is just me. The little kid actor in the movie (Who plays Steve Jobs young daughter) she wasn't bad, as I thought she did alright for the most part, but there were a few times when I noticed some slip ups. But that's just a mini problem and the rest of the performances from everyone was great.Overall Steve Jobs is a well made film with clever writing, outstanding acting and directing. It's a shame that this movie was pulled from many theaters because nobody wanted to see it. Jem and the Holograms and Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension, both sh*t movies that managed to stay in cinemas, but this movie didn't.",

      "review": "  Steve Jobs is really a movie that would have been better served as a TV miniseries, at least in this way of telling the story. It's really 3 chunks of movie, each taking place before the launch of a notable Apple product. It's an interesting idea, and allows us to see Jobs at his most stressed and vulnerable levels, but it makes the movie feel a little choppy. It also means there's a lot of technobabble that I didn't understand and simply didn't care about. We do however get to see a lot of how Jobs handled things in these stressful periods. How accurate these representations are I have no idea, but they are interesting nonetheless. Aaron Sorkin's dialogue is fast and witty, which should't be any surprise, and while Fassbender really doesn't look much like Steve Jobs he gets a lot of the mannerisms and attitude down very well. All the actors do well, including a virtually unrecognizable Kate Winslet and a sadly underused Seth Rogen. The best scenes in the movie are these actors playing off each other, whenever Rogen and Fassbender have to argue with each other it's damn intriguing. There isn't enough of that though, with too much focus on the technical stuff and not enough on the people. I liked how they show Steve's eventual growth into a decent human being, but by not focusing on that aspect enough it feels a little forced. There's stuff I liked, and stuff I didn't, but nothing I really hated about this movie. Ultimately I was never bored, and I learned a few things about the man.",

      "review": "  \"Musicians play their instruments. I play the orchestra.\"Danny Boyle might have been the director of this biopic, but the true orchestrator of the film was Aaron Sorkin who once again delivers a powerful and engaging screenplay that makes the entire cast look fantastic. There is no denying the genius of Jobs, but it is so hard to encapsulate an entire life into a two hour film (several attempts have been made but failed to do so until now), but Sorkin masterfully pulls it off by focusing the film in three stages; each one involving a product launch. The first act takes place in 1984 during the launch of the Macintosh computer. Here we are introduced to Jobs's vision and his stormy relationship with his co-workers as well as with the mother of his daughter who he refuses to recognize. Jobs is an intriguing man with a unique vision who can't seem to balance his personal relationships with his creative genius. Through witty dialogues and fantastic character interactions we get a glimpse of who this man is. The second stage takes place after Jobs has been fired from the company he co-founded, for the launch of his new creation: NeXT in 1988. And the final third act is where he is finally consecrated as a genius during the launch of the IMac computer after having been called back to save the almost bankrupt company.The performances are fantastic, but you couldn't expect less from such a rich script. Michael Fassbender is superb as Jobs. He delivers an outstanding performance of such an iconic public figure. But the rest of the cast never falls behind. Kate Winslet plays his head of marketing, Joanna Hoffman, who is brilliant and shines in every scene she shares with Fassbender. Apple's CEO, John Scully is interpreted by Jeff Daniels, and there is a fantastic parallel scene where he and Jobs go off at each other during two specific moments that changed their relationship. Then there is another powerful scene where Jobs and Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) have a disputed argument where they finally let all their feelings out in the open. Every character in this film has his or her moment and each one is key to unravelling who Jobs was and how he thought. The film is perfectly written and I don't think anyone will take the Oscar away from Sorkin.",

      "review": "  It's a premise that on paper really shouldn't work, lock in a talented cast, a director in need of a hit and a writer who is capable of creating some of the most captivating dialogue on the planet and Steve Jobs quickly goes from an average affair to an extremely captivating one. Steve Jobs is a fast paced biopic of the late icon, who notoriously changed the world of computing for better or worse. Like him or loathe him, Jobs was famous for being a pioneer and infamous for his alienating demeanor and his ability at being intolerable for a large portion of his life. Sorkin does a brilliant job, pardon the pun, at balancing the bipolar nature of the man, showcasing him as an extremely troubled genius, who has the ability to infuriate as well as resonate. Luckily Boyle's cast is more than capable of pulling it off. Fassbender is on fire as Steve Jobs, firing through the quick paced and venomous dialogue at a frightening speed, all the while crafting a wonderful character. Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels and indeed Seth Rogen are all on point also, giving Fassbender the support he needs to be able to pull off such a feat. In fact Sorkin's material is so character and dialogue driven, it sets up barriers for Boyle to perform within, utilizing the directors frenetic style in a more mature and focused manner, Boyle himself hasnt been as on point for many years. It's a wonderfully shot, brilliantly acted and masterfully written piece of drama, that will offer insight and emotion into an icon that has just as much fans as he does enemies. The problems lie however in a formulaic approach, Steve Jobs has such a clear beginning, middle and end that each defining moment we are subjected to feels so prominently titled, that any sense of getting completely lost within it is tarnished as act 2 begins. The film also follows a typical biopic set up, having Jobs hailed as a demi god and forgiven for his sins all too easily, its enough of a niggle to hurt the final product, as all the drama leading up to the finale is so cut throat and indeed impossible of complete ignorance. Problems aside, Steve Jobs is a brilliant character piece, that you will happily find yourself getting lost in, time and time again.",

      "review": "  Julianne Moore is pretty dang good as a fifty-year-old linguistics professor who learns that she has Early-Onset Alzheimer's. Moore's eyes are simultaneously blank and frightened, and her naturally strained smile really works for this tension-filled character. The narrative is rather choppy, but there are some truly great moments: the five-minute-long close-up of Alice ever-so-slightly struggling to complete the doctor's memory quiz, the scene of Alice panicking because she can't find the bathroom and ultimately wetting herself, the harrowing and suspenseful sequence of Alice trying to end her suffering by following the directions she recorded for herself when she was still lucid. All the supporting characters are somewhat superfluous, save for youngest daughter Lydia, played to varying degrees of competency by Kristen Stewart. Her rocker hair is a cool style choice, but KStew can't stop playing with it, and the beachy waves don't work at all for the Chekov play. She tsks before most of her lines, indicating a lack of breath support, which is even more noticeable when she's trying to deliver classical theatre monologues. She shrugs and shakes her head and shivers like a Chihuahua. She only transcends her crutches when she delivers Harper's monologue from \"Angels in America\" in the last scene, and even that's not a great barometer of her acting skill because while she's very good at playing Lydia's objective of connecting with her mother, I doubt that her unfaltering gaze and rapid pace would actually work for the role within the role.",

      "review": "  Driven solely by the character of Alice, there is nothing really remarkable about this film aside from the performance of Julianne Moore. There is a very impressive script written here, aside from a few questionable moments, but the plain camerawork and \"television\" feel the film has throughout, makes it a weird viewing experience to those were hoping for this story to be told in a \"Hollywood\" way. Does that hurt the film's story? No, but may make your mind meander throughout it's 102-minute running time. It's themes really does make you feel for these characters' emotions, and you will probably have a few tears trickling down your face, but what bothered me were the off-putting technical aspects. Overall, it is a very powerful and moving character study that is extremely well-acted and well-written. Those are two of the necessities in a great film, so I will give it a lot of credit for that, but there are a few undeniable set-backs, including an extremely abrupt ending. In the end, not having read the novel that this film is based upon, \"Still Alice\" is a moving picture that I highly recommend.",

      "review": "  \"Still Alice\" is one of those quiet dramas that is eye opening and heartbreaking at the same time. Julianne Moore stars as Alice, a brilliant college professor who is diagnosed with Early-Onset Alzheimer's. From there it's the about the impact of the disease not only on her, but her family. Moore is fantastic and will no doubt get a bunch of award nominations, and could easily win. Alec Baldwin plays her husband, and this is probably his best film performance in a long time. He isn't your typical husband in one of these movies. It's a very real and honest portrayal of a man who is losing his wife and doesn't know what to do. Even Kristen Stewart is good as Alice's daughter. I don't think she does that lip biting thing very much. Good movie with a great performance. But, it can be uncomfortable to watch, especially if you have a loved one battling alzheimer's.",

My own mother exhibits signs of the disease and her mother became afflicted in her final years. The acting was superb, and justified the Oscar for Julianne Moore for me. Kristen Stewart demonstrated once again what a fine young actress she is, in spite of her bad reputation because of the Twilight franchise. One scene that really brought home for me what beginning to lose one's memory must feel like. Alice is out for a run through the streets of New York, in the vicinity of Columbia, where she taught Linguistics for many years. She suddenly stops running and the camera pans around her, showing the confusion on her face while the background remains out of focus for what seems an eternity. The image finally resolves on the facade of the building in front of her and one realizes she is on the campus of Columbia. A powerful image that struck home with me. This one had me on the emotional edge for it's entirety. The only thing to keep it from perfection, for me, was Alec Baldwin's portrayal as Alice's husband. I would have liked to have seen a more sympathetic character (or maybe a more sympathetic actor) in the role. But otherwise a pitch perfect portrayal of a woman who winds up losing herself to this horrible disease.",

It takes a deep look at the tragedy and horrors of Alzheimer's disease, and how it effects Alice and the people closest to her. The film shows us themes such as cherishing life and the memories of the people and things we love. I am still completely in awe of Moore's epic performance, truly becoming following each stage of Alzheimer's with perfection. I have had family members who have suffered from this tragic disease, and all I can say to Moore is bravo and that her Academy Award was well deserved. She gave every ounce of her soul and mind into this role. Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart also give noteworthy performances, each giving real and emotional performances that helped feel for them and our protagonist. Everyone will have a different reaction to this film, wanting a happy ending with everything handed to them easily, but Still Alice isn't a simple movie and it shows the reality of life and commend them for it. Thanks to a great script and perfect performances, especially from the flawless Julianne Moore, this film soars.",

      "review": "  On a trip to California to see her actress daughter Lydia(Kristen Strewart) and to speak at a conference, Alice Howland(Julianne Moore), a university professor in linguistics, trips over a line or two in her speech. Concerned that this could be a symptom of something more serious, she sees a medical doctor who after running a wide variety of tests, diagnoses her with early onset Alzheimer's disease. To make matters worse, the disease is genetic, putting her three children at risk of developing it.While \"Still Alice\" may not exactly excel in showing Alice's deterioration from her point of view, that's really not the point of this otherwise fine movie. What the movie is much more interested in a keenly perceptive way is the dynamics of the Howland family that is so overachieving that one of the daughters cannot just give birth, she has to have twins. Okay, okay, I know it does not work that way but it could look like that to an outside observer but not to Lydia who is comfortable with opting out of the race. However, for her mother, who remarks at one point that she would have preferred cancer, that is not an option, having overcome so much already in her life. Frightened by what she witnesses at a nursing home, not the state of the patients but the lack of visitors, she Rube Goldbergs her own euthanasia. In the meantime, Alice takes the opportunity to reconnect with Lydia who she had otherwise been at odds with before it is too late.",

      "review": "  UNFORGETTABLE - My Review of STILL ALICE (4 Stars)Tremendously moving, heart wrenching and credible, STILL ALICE puts you right into the head of a relatively young person struggling with early onset Alzheimer's disease. Julianne Moore, in a role certain to garner her first Academy Award, gives the performance of her career as Alice, a sharp linguistics professor who slowly but surely sees everything she has known and cherished dissolve away. Writer-Directors Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer (QUINCEANERA) have adapted Lisa Genova's novel, and despite its flaws, give us a bracingly methodical experience. With few signposts to indicate the passage of time, the audience rides along with Alice as memories and tasks grow blurrier. Cinematographer Denis Lenoir keeps things tight and uses shallow focus to create an unsettling glimpse into Alice's fading mind. Beginning with an almost imperceptible moment of forgetfulness, the story moves along its inevitable trajectory with a quiet sense of foreboding. Some have criticized the Lifetime treatment at play here, but I found it understated and lovely. The score by Ilan Eshkeri could have been more dynamic and edgy, yet it settles instead for the tinkly, overt themes of your standard disease-of-the-week film. It's a minor quibble in a film that brought me to tears, the sobbing, uncontrollable ones often reserved for personal family losses. Because Alice is such a strong, intelligent woman, her decline feels that much more tragic. Her family, particularly strong work from Kristen Stewart as her challenging daughter and Alec Baldwin as a husband who tamps down his own feelings for far too long, may feel sketched in, but that's the point. This film is entirely from Alice's point of view. We have to consistently catch our bearings from scene to scene, much like our protagonist. The repetition of her exercise routines, her recordings, and her doctor visits act as markers for us, slowly chipping away at her (and our) sense of security.An early scene, in which Alice discloses her disease to her husband, is that Oscar clip moment one would expect. Moore infuses it with unexpected rage, and it's some of the best work she has ever done. Strangely enough, she bests that in a latter scene in which she has to give a speech. Standing in front of a group of people, highlighting her prepared words with a yellow marker as she goes, so as not to skip any lines, Moore is matter-of-fact and stunning as she talks about the hell she's living. She fills the moment with surprising joy, utter simplicity, and throws down a Master Class in film acting, the likes of which I have not seen before. Speeches like this do not usually have such a profound effect on me. I typically respond to real exchanges between two people, but this memorable moment cuts so deep, gets to the strange dichotomy of being able to find joy and despair in the same breath, that the aforementioned bawling commenced from the top of the scene and carried into the next few. As Alice's world gets stripped away bit by awful bit, her essence becomes more and more pure, and it affects everyone around her. Stewart does some of her best work in these late scenes, proving that despite the TWILIGHT saga's numbing boredom, she has considerable depth of feeling. The final scene in particular absolutely wrecked me. Stewart's commitment to the moment and Moore's utter transformation will stick with me for a long time. Sure it's a film that will be remembered for Moore's acting rather than as a masterful cinematic experience, but sometimes a beautifully realized window into someone's soul is enough.",

      "review": "  Showcasing a heartbreaking brave performance by Julianne Moore, Still Alice presents a truthful and heartfelt account of harrowing disease. There have been decent dramas about Alzheimer's before, most notably The Notebook and Away from Her. What this latest such film offers, however, is a deeply personal trip down a disheartening rabbit hole that somehow never feels tragic. Still Alice feels so deeply personal because Julianne Moore imbues our heroine with such character that youre drawn into the drama from the outset. The audience becomes ridiculously sympathetic because they seemingly know Alice like an old friend, which is a credit to the actress for informing her life with such detail and verve. And then, filmgoers go on this perilous journey with her.In this PG-13-rated drama based on the novel by Lisa Genova, a linguistics professor (Moore) and her family (Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth) find their bonds tested when she gets diagnosed with Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. Screenwriters-directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland do an excellent and economical job at condensing a 350 page book without losing resonance or relegating supporting players to stock characters. Indeed, despite being a performance piece for Moore, Baldwin, Stewart, and Bosworth likewise shine as some not-always-likeable family members. Still, make no mistake about it, this is a certain actresss show. Its seems improbable that Moore never won an Oscar before this film. Despite a career bursting at the seams with memorable roles (The Big Lebowski, Magnolia, Hannibal, Children of Men, A Single Man, The Kids Are All Right) and past Oscar nominations (Boogie Nights, The End of the Affair, Far From Heaven, The Hours), she had never taken home this prizebefore Still Alice. Not only did she win Best Actress, but she totally deserves it for this vital inspirational role. Bottom line: Courageous Beauty",

      "review": "  A hard-hitting and underplayed portrait of what Alzheimer's can do to the best of us, Still Alice depressed the hell out of me and that's okay. What makes this even more tragic is the fact that our protagonist (Julianne Moore) is exceedingly brilliant and watching her slow drift into cognitive oblivion despite her best efforts and clever mental tricks was a bit hard to take. Moore commits to the point it puts Eddie Redmayne to shame and it's quite fascinating how in each scene (and I mean EVERY scene) we see some new hint of mental decline and the person who we are familiar with begins to fade. The film itself is tastefully shot and the soundtrack will often give clues as to the state of her mind, especially when she is about to suffer an attack. The supporting performances are beyond excellent with Alec Baldwin as the silently suffering husband and Kristen Stewart (yes, HER) as the closest of the children to the mother and understanding her feelings. I'm still going to go on record and say that Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl) and Reese Witherspoon (Wild) had Julianne Moore dead to rights as far as a leading performance is concerned, but that should not hinder your appreciation of what she does here. And let's be honest - Moore is a veteran, no bullshit actress who consistently brings her abilities to the screen in everything she appears in - whether it be critically acclaimed character studies or hack popcorn action movies. So recognition is deserved in one way or another. Approach this film with respect and fair warning of its heavy subject matter.",

      "review": "  'Still Alice' takes viewers on an emotional roller coaster, following the life of Alice, a middle aged lady who unfortunately discovers she has early onset Alzheimer's disease. An interesting concept, and one that I think has been useful in opening the public's eyes as to the disease itself. It feels as though the presence of Alzheimer's disease has gradually been increasing in recent years, whilst never truly being considered a threatening illness, but rather just the case of memory loss. This is is simply not true, and it is important that it is viewed as a serious illness and efforts put into both assisting those with the disease, and most importantly working on remedies for the future.'Still Alice' does a great job of depicting Alice's struggles and how her life is quickly altered. Scenes are undoubtedly powerful and emotional, with Julianne Moore portraying the lead character quite brilliantly. Whether or not the film is overall enjoyable, it certainly delivers what it intended - a powerful, eye-opening drama with great performances all round",

Alice is a highly regarded academic at Columbia University until, at barely 50, she is diagnosed with early stage Alzheimers\". Julianne Moore does an amazing job in the title role and absolutely deserves her Oscar. Her portrayal of all range of emotions as she succumbs to the disease is wonderful. But the film is also about the different reactions of her children and her changing relationship with her husband. And as he husband, Alec Baldwin is an excellent supporting actor.",

It doesn't try to do much more than to humanize a horrific illness, and certainly it accomplishes it. When somebody you love is terminally ill, the knee jerk reaction is to avoid them in order to avoid the sadness and the guilt. Still Alice does a wonderful job of not only empathizing with its entire cast, but embracing all of those emotions in order to help define what exactly being alive even means. I wish the rest of the cast as as good as Moore, then you could have had a really perfect movie. I commend Still Alice on not falling into manipulative and flat 'terminal illness movie' waters. I don't know that I'd recommend this movie to just anybody, but certainly a stand out from this year.",

      "review": "  MIDNIGHT COWGIRL - My Review of TANGERINE (4 Stars)I spent the years from 2000-2005 working as a health educator inside the LA County Mens Central Jail, primarily in its notorious \"K-11\" dorms where LGBT inmates were housed. I've often been asked to describe it, and my go-to answer has always been, \"It's as if they rounded up everyone on the corner of Santa Monica Blvd. and Highland and threw them in a cell together.\" For those out of the loop, that intersection is notoriously where transgender prostitutes ply their trade, with Donut Time being a place to rest their feet.I share this to contextualize the opening minutes of writer/director Sean Baker's (along with co-writer Chris Bergoch) propulsive, engaging, hilariously grimy TANGERINE. Just out of jail and sharing a Christmas Eve morning donut with her pal and co-worker Alexandra (Mya Taylor), Sin-Dee (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) quickly learns that her pimp boyfriend Chester (James Ransone) has been cheating on her. Immediately, I thought, \"This film is soon K-11\", expertly capturing the lingo, confidence, smarts and outrage of its inhabitants. Like any good screenplay, the story is expertly set in motion as Sin-Dee and a drama averse Alexandra hurtle their way through the tough, sunlit streets of Los Angeles in search of the pair who did her wrong.Shot on tricked-out iPhones by Baker and Radium Cheung), TANGERINE may be a no-budget indie, but its style and feel for the streets of LA couldn't be more dead-on. Basically one long extended chase sequence, our cinematographers keeps the cameras moving and swooping around our subjects, a perfect way to capture our strutting divas. This is the underbelly of the city, you know, where people do more walking than driving and are actually used to interacting with each other. Along the way, Alexandra continuously hits up acquaintances to come to her show that night at Hamburger Mary's, while Sin-Dee badgers anyone and everyone as to the whereabouts of Chester and a woman whose name begins with a \"D\". Yep, that's all Sin-Dee has to go by, yet this ferocious survivor knows how to find her way. A somewhat random \"B\" story emerges involving a taxi driver Razmik (Karren Karagulian) and his many fares. For a while, I didn't know why we were watching these vignettes, but I was glad I stuck with it, as connections start to emerge. Regardless, there's an unforgettable moment when the driver encounters the worst kind of drunk passengers imaginable, which will force me to bring 409 with me whenever I get into another cab. Eventually, Razmik's story helps weave the fabric of the story together as everyone faces the inevitable question of whether they prefer to be alone in this world or not.Believe me, it's a tough world at best, and TANGERINE captures anger, desperation and the need to connect with another human being in ways I haven't experienced since John Schlesinger's classic MIDNIGHT COWBOY. Like Ratso and Buck, Sin-Dee and Alexandra need each other more than they know. The glaring light, street sounds and reliance on percussion on the soundtrack evoke an LA more common than its glamorous cinematic counterparts. I felt every bead of sweat and every step of their journey. There's a bravura sequence in which Alexandra busts into a seedy motel room and literally drags one of its occupants all over the city. The push-pull of their relationship is fascinating, never knowing which one is really playing the other. The emotions in this film play on so many different levels, I was astounded. Our leading pair can be quite theatrical when necessary, but there's real tenderness underneath the surface, especially during the stunning final scene. As the harsh light of day turns to desolate night, your heart comes to ache for this pair. If you're gonna live in a world where everything and anything can be your enemy, you could do worse than have a Sin-Dee or an Alexandra on your side. Laughing one minute and then cringing at how dark and combative their world can be, I came to care about the people of TANGERINE. It's a buddy movie with street smarts.",

At the same time, Tangerine's first thirty minutes become repetitive, the characters and events can become annoying, and at times, the movie is excessive without having a legitimate reason for being so. Tangerine is still good on a thematic and story level, but I didn't find it to be a particularly \"enjoyable\" film. I won't go out of my way to see it again.",

While she does have one bit of pertinent information about her, she does not have a name, leading Sin-Dee to start furiously looking for him. Alexandra agrees to help her, just as long as there is no drama. Which lasts all of five minutes, until they talk to Nash(Ian Edwards).With \"Tangerine,\" writer-director Sean Baker combines elements of neo-realism and screwball comedy with a superb use of locations for a winning combination. While the movie could be thought of as a holiday film with its focus on love, friendship and family, it does not look the other way, either, when it comes to the dangers of living and working on the streets. For Alexandra, her try at singing in a nightclub could be a sign of her reconsidering her options.",

As is the subject: a bitch-match between street trannies, johns and assorted street folks radiating out from the core pair, Cind-ee and Alexandra. The former has just gotten out of jail on Christmas Eve and splits a forlorn donut with Alexandra who promptly rats out Chester, the boyfriend/pimp, who seems to have been boning a real girl with a vag. And we're off to the races, a startling, very real-feeling journey into the sun-bleached sadness of the working life. We meet a married Armenian cab driver who has a thing for chicks with dicks, and soon enough, his entire family. We meet the blond 'beeatch', who gets dragged along, literally, for the ride. And Chester, who is especially believable as the white trash, tatted up pimp who rules the world from a dollar donut shop.

      "review": "  Unique little movie about transgender prostitutes, including one who spends her first day free from jail searching for her pimp and boyfriend who she just found out cheated on her with a white girl. It's a funny film that looks into a subculture that you don't see in many movies, and it looks surprisingly cinematic for a film shot entirely on iPhones. I enjoyed this, it was weird and funny and unique...worth checking out if you aren't terribly conservative.",

      "review": "  A great slice of life film that chooses to see the humor in what could have been a much more depressing film. However, that jovial spirit took away from the characters, teetering towards tired stereotypes a little too often for my taste. I think I would have preferred some more honesty throughout the entire film, instead of just at the end. That said, I loved Alexandra, she was really the best character in the film.Also- It's impressive that this was shot on iPhones but I found the camera work to be inconsistent, especially towards the beginning.",

      "review": "  The two tenets I hold when watching a movie is it needs to be engaging and entertaining. Many films have the ability to sustain these principles for the entirety of the film. This film was not only not engaging or entertaining but it sincerely challenged me to give up and stop watching. The acting is sub par, most of the heart of film I found was carried solely on the shoulders of Mya Taylor's performance but the scenes without her were either uncomfortable and unpleasant to watch, to the point where I needed to brake away from the film to regain my trust in human decency, other scenes were dull and lacked of substance to the point where on reflection I ponder if this was better off to be a short film. Some films skip the character developing aspect for an intricate story-line. Others do completely the opposite. This film did neither. Instead, this film was 80 minutes of one characters walks from the donut shop to find another character, finds her, then takes her back to the donut shop, during which I guess stuff just happens, for example, the taxi drivers character isn't developed further then he just prefers transsexual prostitutes and has a family and Mya Taylor's character goes around handing fliers for her performance, then you see her perform, and thats it. Credit where credit is due, the film has some great camera shots and the supersaturation of yellows at times gave the film a unique contrast of colours that where downright beautiful, and though I say this film was not engaging there were little times when I thought this movie was boring. There was constant movement and walking, but for me the bad parts of the film really spoke louder then the good, simply to the point where looking for anything good was like trying to find a hay in a needle stack. In conclusion this film wasn't made for me. I don't know who this film was made for. I think this could be considered a slice-of-life type film, where all the action in the film is done in one night, creating a naturalistic progression, and if you are into that stuff, fair enough. To others, this film will test you to point of considering walking away. Some films are so bad their good, others have a charm to this film. This film was just vile to watch. I wouldn't recommend it to people of similar taste to mine.",

You basically have a very vibrant looking film, a great aesthetic, and some very good acting; but the story is extremely basic and, well, just not that interesting.

Filmed entirely on an iPhone Tangerine also proves that you don't need big movie histrionics to make something compelling. Hell, all you need is the smart phone in your pocket! In that way, Tangerine is revolutionary and certainly indicative of the future of film making. It doesn't hurt that the characters are all well drawn and well acted. This is a very specific movie about a very specific group of people but, at the end of it all, they behave and want like any other person you'd come across.",

A story about the day in the life of two tranvestite prostitutes, the film will definitely strike familiar with Harmony Korrine's audience, although Tangerine is a far more fluid and energetic film compared to something like Kids. Frequently graphic, but just as fun as it is gritty, Tangerine avoids being exploitation, and ends on a rather heartbreaking note. With non-conformist video editing, and story-telling, and shot on a practically nonexistent budget, director Sean Baker has deftly proved himself to be a hot new talent to look out for!",

I have read and heard so many people commenting on how excellent the acting was, but I found everyone aside from Mya Taylor to be uninspiring. It should mean more than to just have people say words on screen to be considered great acting, hence why we don't parade Tara Reid and Adam Sandler around as the cream of the crop. Between the gimmick of shooting on an iPhone, which didn't add to the film experience in anyway, to the overall lack of quality in the edit, story, and acting, this film is tailored for the \"festival crowd\" who will always seek the oddities in art and herald them as masterpieces.",

      "review": "  There's a charm to Tangerine's extremely low-budget, iPhone look, its radical style standing out amongst the standard glossy, mainstream fare that is championed come awards season. As an actual film, it mostly works, the two leads turning in consistently hilarious and genuinely heartfelt performances (Mya Taylor especially) to great effect. This aside, it can't keep up its initial explosive pace, lapsing into repetitive scenes where a character walks from place to place while aggressive music plays in the background to the point that it all starts to feel long at only 88 minutes. The subplot involving the cab driver is less compelling than the central narrative, and while it works for the most part, time spent away from the two leads is time that the audience doesn't get to spend in their presence and subsequently feels less interesting. While these problems hold Tangerine back from being something truly great, they can't snuff out its humor or its passion, a story of two transgender sex workers vital in an age where the stigma surrounding non-cis gender identity is still frighteningly pervasive.",

      "review": "  Tangerine is the independent film of the year, and it's very obvious to see why. It was completely filmed on an iPhone. That's right, the same things that we use everyday, almost at ever hour of the day, made this movie. Guess what? An iPhone can make a really good movie. This is a groundbreaking moment for cinema. This opens the door to thousands of independent filmmakers who don't have the finances to make a great looking feature. It doesn't matter anymore. Anyone can make a great movie. Anyone can tell a great story. These are the golden ages, my friends.But what of the movie? What makes it so great? It's a down and dirty Christmas story about two transgendered prostitutes in the middle of a love triangle between a white-trash pimp and an Armenian cab driver (who tragically is a family man). The two main character of the film come across as loud and largely obnoxious, but you grow to kind of like them. They are proud to be walking the streets, and selling their bodies. Had these characters appeared in an early John Waters film, they might've been able to eclipse Divine. Speaking of Waters, this whole movie really reminded me of his work, and it's no wonder he placed it on his year-end list.The armenian cab driver is by far the most fascinating part. You just feel so bad for his family, and so bad for him. As his addiction unfolds right before their eyes, you just want to roll up in a ball and cringe.This movie is not without it's flaws, but it's also not without it's incredible moments. Just when I think i've seen everything from \"Tangerine\", the end sucker-punches me from behind. This film has many, many tricks up it's sleeve. It's a great, but very dark, comedy. Your 2015 movie list is truly not complete without seeing this.",

      "review": "  Better known for his comedy films like Anchorman, Step Brothers and Talladega Nights, The Big Short is a big leap for director Adam McKay. Going from improvised Will Ferrell gags to dealing with the true story of the global financial crisis of 2008 is quite a departure from his usual comfort zone. If truth be told, I'm not a fan of his comedies and had some strong reservations about this but it was hard to resist seeing such quality actors sink their teeth into a very personal subject that has affected us all. Hedge fund managers Michael Burry (Christian Bale) and Mark Baum (Steve Carell), trader Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) and retired banker Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) all work within the financial sector. However, they see a problem arising; the housing credit market is about to collapse and no-one but them can see it coming. They see it as a perfect time to invest against the banks and make money from what turns out to be the fall of the global economy.First off, The Big Short is not an easy film to like. It's so dialogue laden that the bankers and brokers jargon can leave you scratching your head in bewilderment. There's really only so much talk of C.D.O's, Short's and Subprime's that a person can take but that's exactly the point. McKay knows this and he's clever enough to point out that the bankers want it this way. They want the ordinary, every-day working stiff to think it's only them that know how to manage our money for us. McKay doesn't pull any punches and goes straight for the jugular when it's comes to the inner dealings of these immoral and reckless financial swindlers who brought down the world economy. He depicts their carefree avarice in such a detestable way that you're left infuriated. If this was his intention (which I'm sure it was) then you have to say that his film is a success. However, the manner in which he does it can be off-putting. There's a kinetic energy to McKay's direction and, although impressive, it's a little messy with too many jump cuts and forth-wall-breaking moments. Despite his best efforts, his stylistic devices don't always help you to understand the complexity of these events and he finds it tricky to fully transcend the confusion by employing a frantic pace to everything. That said, this is a hugely difficult subject to tackle and he does deserve some credit for managing any form of coherence at all. McKay is clearly angry and it's an anger I, wholeheartedly, share. His scathing attack on the fraudulent activities of these people is potent. His message (and conscience) is clear and his attempt to bring it to a mainstream audience, with quality actors in tow, is an admirable one. It's a good ensemble he's put together and they all deliver fine work; Pitt is the one who takes a back seat and seems underused but Carell proves that his dramatic chops from Foxcatcher was no fluke while Bale has some fun with his eccentric glass-eyed turn. From the leads, I found Gosling to be the most comfortable with his cocksure wolfishness and it's always a pleasure to have the likes of Melissa Leo and Marisa Tomei make an (all-be-it brief) appearance. I can only hope that with such a recognisable cast that the masses wake from their slumber and pay attention to, not so much the disjointed film itself, but the message and teaching behind it.It's not an entirely successful endeavour as it struggles to entertain without getting bogged down in investment lingo but it's an important morality tale with a message that still resonates. If Joy is this year's film to embrace the capitalist system then The Big Short is the indictment of it.Mark Walker",

      "review": "  Adam McKay is not exactly the kind of name you associate with a prestige picture that's building serious Oscar heat. McKay is best known as the director and co-writer of Will Ferrell's best movies, from Anchorman and its sequel to Talladega Nights and the underrated 2010 buddy cop movie, The Other Guys. If you stuck through the closing credits for Guys, you were treated to an animated education lesson on the size of Wall street's greed and accountability in regards to the 2008 financial crisis. It was impassioned, angry, and an interesting note to end an otherwise goofy comedy. The Big Short is based upon Michael Lewis' (Moneyball) best-selling book and it's a disaster movie where the biggest disaster is the world economy. The movie McKay co-adapted and directed is bristling with intelligence, indignation, and a clear purpose. He wants to make you very angry, and by the end if you're not, you haven't been paying enough attention.In the wake of the financial collapse in 2008, the fallout was so tremendous that many people felt nobody could have seen this coming. There were a few and they made out like bandits while trying to warn others about the impending doom. In the early 2000s, Michael Burry (Christian Bale) is a hedgefund manager who sees warning signs that the housing market is a bubble ready to burst. He sees the toxicity of the majority sub-prime mortgages wrapped together and sold as a seemingly safe security, a CDO (collateralized debt obligation). His bosses think he's mad and they're furious when they discover Burry has gone from bank to bank making big bets against the housing market. The banks are eager to take what they believe to be easy money from a sucker. How could the housing market burst? Other Wall Street investors take notice of Burry, notably Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) who pitches the plan to \"short\" the housing market. Nobody takes him seriously except Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and his small team who works for Goldman Sachs. Baum is curious how something so large could go unnoticed, so he and his team fly to Florida and Vegas to investigate the realities of the market and what they find does not match the rosy cheerleading from Wall Street. A pair of wannabe traders (Finn Witrock, John Magaro) stumbles across Burry's analysis and try to make their own bets, except they need a bigger name to make the trades. They reach out to an ex-Wall Street trader (Brad Pitt) who agrees to shepherd them on this quixotic quest. Are these men righteous defenders of fraud or just people trying to get their own cut of the pie?The brilliance of The Big Short lies in its accessibility and the virulent passion that McKay has for the subject matter. The movie is structured like a heist and an underdog story, suckering in the audience to root for the upstarts trying to fleece the big banks and profit off their greed and stupidity. For the first 90 minutes or so, the film comes across like a caper and we follow our group of misfits as they fight against the conventional wisdom that the housing market could never topple. These guys see the signs and the risks that others could not or would not see, especially since the flow of money was rich and the good times could be shared, which lead to collusion from the very same agencies designed to regulate and enforce the financial laws. For those 90 minutes the movie flies by on its sense of whimsy and are-we-getting-away-with-this good fortune, putting our band of misfits in position to win big on the losses of the ignorant and fraudulent. And then, in one swift move, it all comes down and you're reminded, rather indignantly by Pitt's character, that what they are benefiting from is the meltdown of the U.S. housing market and by extension the American economy. What once felt like a celebratory caper now starts to feel queasy, and it's in the last act that The Big Short reminds you just how awful the events of the 2008 financial crisis were and how these guys did nothing more than benefit from mass misery. These are not heroes, though Mark Baum is given plenty of moral grandstanding moments that present him as the closest thing we have in the picture. These were a bunch of guys who got rich betting on a lot of other people's bad bets, bets that almost destroyed the world's economic systems. The concluding half hour feels like a sudden stop after a sugar rush, where you're left to question your decision-making but also come to terms with the reality of what seemed like a fun time. McKay lures his audience in with the guise of a heist/underdog story, appealing and accessible avenues of cinema, and then serves the cod hard medicine in the concluding moments.McKay is admirably trying to educate and advocate while he entertains, but he truly wants the audience to understand why they should be sharpening their pitchforks. At several points, characters will break the fourth wall and talk directly into the camera, admitting that certain events didn't happen exactly as we saw, or occasionally they'll remind us that what we watched was exactly how it happened. It's a measure that isn't overplayed and helps juice the spirits of the movie, becoming something of a confidant in the schemes with the onscreen participants. When things gets a little hard to understand with the mountain of Wall Street lingo, McKay will cut to celebrity cameos to help explain the more arcane instruments of the financial system. Margot Robbie luxuriates in a bubble bath and explains sub-prime mortgages, Anthony Bourdain explains CDOs, and Selena Gomez, in a rather cogent analogy, explains synthetic CDOs as an endless chain of side bets being made off one hand of blackjack. The movie goes pretty fast and a viewer might experience information overload, but McKay knows when to slow things down and provide a well-timed assist, so that his learned audience will see the true extent of the corruption and greed rampant in how Wall Street handled its business.Of the three storylines, I found Mark Baum and his team easily the most interesting and I think McKay and co-screenwriter Charles Randolph (The Interpreter) agreed, which is why he's the biggest part of the movie. Burry gets things started but he recedes into the background after the first act, and that's where Baum and his financial team step into the spotlight to further explore how unstable the housing market just might be. I think this is Carell's best dramatic performance to date (I wasn't wowed by Foxcatcher). He's playing perhaps one of the angriest people seen on screen but that's because he has a moral center and the bad business practices, let alone the sociopathic greed of his \"peers,\" constantly enrage him. He's something like a flabbergasted crusading journalist who keeps shaking his head in stupefying revulsion at just how deep this whole thing goes. Having Baum as our entry into the moral morass of Wall Street allows the audience to feel a sense of ethical superiority, and then like Pitt's character, it can all go away with one perfectly articulated retort. There's a moment where Baum is lambasting a mortgage ratings officer (Melissa Leo, her only scene too) after she admits that if they don't rate bad mortgages as good, the banks will just go to their competitor, and then she accuses Baum of being a hypocrite. His reason for the office visit is not that his outrage at the fraud but the fact that this fraud is holding up his winnings. He's not the crusader he may wish to be. Bale (American Hustle) and Gosling (Only God Forgives) are perfectly cast and provide strong supporting work in small doses spread throughout. There is a bevy of familiar faces (Marisa Tomei, Rafe Spall, Max Greenfield, Karen Gillan) appearing in small moments as if everybody in Hollywood wanted to get in on McKay's party.There is one annoying misstep in the movie and it occurs about halfway and it's made to stretch out the stakes in a haphazard manner. The Big Short is a disaster movie where the audience knows exactly when the disaster is coming, and yet there's a section in the middle where the characters are all left in doubt whether their big bets will pay off because of the ratings fraud. Burry is threatened with losing his job. It's silly because we know the economy is going to crash in 2008, but the movie throws out a weak obstacle that, hey, maybe it won't crash. It reminds me of the Hinderberg movie from the 1970s. There were several moments where it looked like that zeppelin full of hydrogen was going to go up in fames... except students of history know that moment is fated in New Jersey, so all the close calls were foolish fake-outs for a major event that was well anticipated. We all know the economy is going down so there's no need for the manufactured doubts.McKay and company want to wake up a fairly apathetic general public about the crimes and negligence of the Wall Street robber barons that risked the world's economy and then managed to skip out on the tab. The tones can juggle wildly, and I'd credit McKay's background in comedy for his ability to maintain a reliable and firm comic footing for the film without losing the significance of his message. It's hard to nail down a genre for the movie; it's a dark comedy, a drama, a true crime picture, and a wake-up call. You have moments that feel like a heist flick and moments that feel like a sickening journalistic expose. It's got highs, lows, laughs, groans, and plenty of human emotions, though the most prominent would be disgust and disbelief. The Big Short is advocacy populism as pop-entertainment, and it succeeds ably. It's an economics lesson for the public. At the end of the movie, the closing text informs us about \"bespoke tranches,\" which are investment opportunities that banks are flocking to ($5 billion in 2013 to $20 billion in 2014). It's just another name for CDOs. Unless an informed public demands action from the system, it seems that Wall Street is doomed to repeat its same high-risk mistakes and that same vulnerable public is doomed to clean up the mess.Nate's Grade: A-",

Surprisingly, I was able to follow this film with ease. \"The Big Short\" follows groups of people as the statistics of the housing market, leading up to the crash in 2008, are uncovered. The major thing you have to accept in order to enjoy this film, is definitely it's editing style. The shaky camera and quick edits represent the raw feel of the story at hand, and I thought that was fantastic. A terrific screenplay, a stellar cast, and great direction by Adam McKay all make this a film worth watching. It deserves every bit of praise it is getting, even though it's snail pace can become tiring at times. I had a blast watching this movie, as I was able to see all of the behind-the-scenes facts that I did not know about. In the end, if you have patience, this is a terrific film, but that is a necessity to watch this film. \"The Big Short\" is powerful for what it sets out to say, and nothing more. To me, it is incredibly crafted, but it certainly is not for everyone. Great film!",

A tale of human greed, made even scarier by the fact that it was all true, is compelling and quite infuriating. \"The Big Short\" boasts an impressive cast and they all deliver. Christian Bale and Steve Carell have the showier roles and they revel in them. Brad Pitt is understated yet strong, Gosling is appropriately smarmy. The performance are important to emphasize as without them \"The Big Short\" would have had a tough time working.The film is definitely politically planted to the left and while that helps with the tone of exasperation it needs, it diminishes the impact the film needs to fully reach all of its audience. The film does sheepishly skirt the fact that our protagonists ultimately benefited from this disaster - and despite the admiration they deserve for spotting a big problem - all they did was make money from it and did not attempt to actively change it. By exposing that raw truth, \"The Big Short\" could have been scarier.With that said, it is still an incredible film and one of the best of the year. It's a film to be watched by all despite the fact that at the end of the day - it didn't change things one bit.",

Steve Carell gives another sensational performance in this film proving that Foxcatcher was no accident. He brings a funny and emotional performance with an underlying sense of tragedy. Carell shows that he is a force to be reckoned with in cinema, and he should get some serious notoriety come award season. Christian Bale also brings a fantastic performance to the film. His take on an autistic and socially awkward man was great, and he really captures his unique characteristics. Ryan Gosling was the energy in the film, bringing a fun and slick performance and showing once again that he and Carell work perfectly together once again. Brad Pitt gives a sweet performance that I think the audience will be able to relate to the most, even while he didn't have too much screen time. He did a great job. John Magaro and Finn Witrock also gave underrated performances and were a great duo in the film. The script perfectly captures the financial crisis of 2007â\"2010 brought on by the build-up of the housing market and credit bubble, and the men who profited off it. While you can't sympathize with many of their actions, especially if you were harmed by these events, you strangely still want them to succeed in their endeavor. Its a very funny yet emotional film, and seeing the events leading up to it is nothing short of fascinating. Adam Mckay is a fantastic director. He brings energy and life to these depressing events and interesting characters, and brings his best film to date. Sometimes the film can be hard to follow and loses focus in some scenes, but overall I really enjoyed the film. The Big Short is a very unique biopic, and thanks to the cast, great script, and Adam Mckays brilliant direction its one of 2015's best films.",

      "review": "  THE WHOOPS OF WALL STREET - My Review of THE BIG SHORT (3 1/2 Stars)Writer-director Adam McKay, best known for such zany comedies as ANCHORMAN and STEP BROTHERS, has teamed up with writer Charles Randolph for his shot at something more substantial with THE BIG SHORT, based on the bestseller by Michael Lewis. He mostly succeeds with this funny, confusing, exasperating, artful yet repetitive look at a major financial crisis. Following a group of misfit financial investors who predicted and bet on the fall of the U.S. housing market, the film has a rough start. There's lots of cross-cutting and business lingo thrown at you. If, like me, you just don't understand Wall Street operates, fear not. Once all of the main players are introduced and the predictions of doom have been spelled out, along comes Margot Robbie in a bubble bath to explain it all to you. Breaking the fourth wall, the filmmakers provide a FINANCE FOR DUMMIES moment, the first of many. Stylistically audacious and hilarious to boot, here is where the film finally took off for me. By acknowledging the impenetrability of its subject, I felt able to participate in the story. Although 2011's MARGIN CALL told a similar story, albeit with a much more sobering tone, and WOLF OF WALL STREET turned the investment banking world into one long rave, THE BIG SHORT, a true story, feels unique. Much of that credit goes to editor Hank Corwin, who cuts scenes off mid-sentence and crams in stock footage while juggling a large number of story elements. It's an impressive display from a professional who is no stranger to fast cutting (see NATURAL BORN KILLERS). The cast, particularly Steve Carell and Christian Bale, have a field day with their roles, getting to live out their BOILER ROOM/GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS dreams in this mostly all-male, testosterone-driven fever-pitched battle of subterfuge. While Brad Pitt (in full late 70s Robert Redford mode here) and Ryan Gosling have their moments, Carell and Bale own this film. Playing a short-fused man who feels the hopelessness of taking on the 1%, Carell excels. Imagine if his OFFICE alter-ego, Michael Scott, had lost everything, including his will to live, and gained a terrible hairpiece, and you get his Mark Baum. Bale's Michael Burry exists outside of the main story, yet his presence is essential. Sporting a glass eye and a wardrobe that even The Dude from THE BIG LEBOWSKI would shun, his character plays drums and heavy metal in his basement while figuring out how and when the housing market would crash. Socially awkward yet impressively prescient, Burry becomes our hero of sorts.Here's where my relationship with THE BIG SHORT went from \"in love\" to \"it's complicated\". I found myself rooting for men who profited off the backs of people who lost everything when they defaulted on their loans. Yes, one of the main characters offers up this sobering news, but it makes the entire experience of watching this film feel a little icky. Still, I love seeing a filmmaker use his blockbuster capital to stretch. McKay still has a little of that populist huckster in him, that need to entertain, and with a film ultimately as depressing as this one ends up being, that's not such a terrible thing.",

      "review": "  I find it interesting that despite how catastrophic the global recession of 2008 was, few movies of quality have centered on the topic. It's probably to do with how confusing the inner workings of Wall Street are to the average person. Even if said workings are all utter bullshit. (See: The Wolf of Wall Street.) This is probably why The Big Short is framed partially as a heist movie with plenty of celebrity cameos to explain exactly what the hell is going on. Big Short is about three different teams of Wall Street investors who notice that the sub-prime mortgage market is headed toward imminent collapse and then decide to do the unthinkable - bet against that market (and therefore the American economy) by shorting their stock and get rich while everyone else reenacts October 1929. Christian Bale succeeds as an anti-social polymath who notices the trend and makes little room for those less intelligent than he (everyone else) and sees his limited group of comrades dwindle further due to his bold decisions. Ryan Gosling does a little too well as a slimy banker who wishes to profit off other people's misfortune. I personally found Steve Carell the true hero of the film both as an actor and character. He is a complete misanthrope who hates the system he is a part of, but at the same time he is a crusader who is deeply wounded by the narcissistic and damaging actions his fellow investors are inflicting on the world economy, despite all of the warning signs. He is a man of lovely contradictions and Carell has fun conveying them. The film is 15 to 20 minutes too long and many of the details are hard to keep track of at times. The dialogue is excellent, and the film goes to great lengths to make the material more enjoyable, such as when characters break the fourth wall and speak directly into the camera. And the message they have is clear - Wall Street screwed you over. And it doesn't care.",

      "review": "  Boiler Rooming advanced economics into crazy stupid unlovely shop talk that all filmgoers can understand, pointed morality tale The Big Short qualifies as a drama but the pure lunacy of the story and slick fourth wall-breaking presentation re-package sad true events as one of the sharpest comedies in years. As straight-ahead as the storytelling and stripped-down as the performances are in Spotlight, this film goes the opposite route, making its real-life figures purposely hyper-realistic-just like the ridiculous position they find themselves. Giving the audience gratuitous cheatsheets by having its characters occasionally address the audience directly and, in one example, having alluring actress Margot Robbie explain credit default swaps from a bubble bath, this whipsmart adaptation of Michael Lewis' whipsmart book by the same name winks and nods to the utter madness at hand. In effect, it's not that The Big Short laughs WITH and not AT you, the taxpayers who are still suffering through the fallout of this travesty, it's that the film gets you to laugh at this bubble bursting at all.In this R-rated account of the financial meltdown catalyst of 2008, four denizens of the world of high-finance (Bale, Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt) predict the credit and housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000s, and decide to take on the big banks for their greed and lack of foresight. Usually known for capturing Will Ferrell's unique man-child brand of sophomoric clowning, director Adam McCay improbably but brilliantly takes a complicated stock tip and turns it into a savagely funny payout where a marquee ensemble never outshines the unbelievable insanity of the oft-kilter narrative. Bale and Pitt dial it down, making understated performing an art form, while Carell and Gosling go bigger (appropriate to their respective characters). No one showboats, however, for the sake of stealing the spotlight. After all, who could pull focus from the dramatization of a Doomsday Machine? Bottom line: The WTF of Wall Street",

Clever editing and amusing performances make for a film that is consistently entertaining. However, as much as McKay tries to get the audience up to speed, there are many terms and phrases not familiar to a casual audience. At a certain point, it becomes impenetrable to grasp all the concepts. Still The Big Short is intelligent filmmaking, and quite thought provoking to boot. Rating: 72",

      "review": "  A scathing indictment, a penetrating character study, a political satire, and alternatively a funny yet serious drama, The Big Short is 2015?s most unique film. Based on the book by the same name, the film follows a group of cynical, shrewd, and opportunistic fund managers and Wall Street brokers as they uncover what will soon become the worldwide economic collapse of 07/08. It?s a film that both explores, explains, and revels in the absurdity that lead to the mortgage collapse- condensing a incredibly complicated financial instruments in to a human drama that sifts through all the bravo sierra to the heart of the matter?fraud and greed.Director Adam McKay takes a pretty stark career turn with Big Short, a film with a profoundly serious subject, yet one that McKay manages to find humor in. It?s entertaining, thought-provoking, and yet relentlessly brutal in its pursuit of the truth. The film?s cast is nothing short of exceptional, featuring an ensemble including Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, and Ryan Gosling. All bring a unique style to the film and inhibit their roles, with an especially impressive showing from both Bale and Carell, enough to garner some award buzz to be sure. The film?s pace is solid, and McKay does a great job interweaving the different subplots to create one over-arching storyline that is secondary to what we all know is about to happen. The film?s moral outrage is palpable, yet justified, a bit preachy, but not singular in its blame. What keeps it anchored is a very intelligent script filled with rich dialogue, smart humor, and attention to detail which refuses to oversimplify what occurred.For some, the film?s eccentricities can be a bit much. It breaks the fourth wall often, which is unsettling at first, and often employs devices such as on-screen definitions, supplied with randomly assorted celebrity break-ins to explain some financial instrument. This contributes to the film?s uniqueness, yet also can result in a disjointed feel from the overall narrative. All in all, McKay?s indulgences as a director pay off more than they don?t, yet there is some inconsistency. The tone is a bit hard to decipher, a comedy in one sense and a drama in the other, yet McKay navigates this by finding dark, cynical, and authentic humor. Simply put, it fits, the cast seems to be thinking??if I didn?t laugh, I?d cry? and we get that.A must see. 4.5/5 Stars",

      "review": "  The challenge for me walking into a movie with a script based off a true story is to decide whether or not I have been convinced to a certain level that what I saw was at least truthful to the source material. It makes it even more of a challenge for me to go into a movie blind without having a firm grasp on the source material. What's great about The Big Short, is director Adam McKay acknowledges that I am probably one of many thousands of people who in truth never understood exactly what the housing collapse of 2008 meant to the world. I'd say after just over two hours, not only was I intrigued by the tale and recount of one of the darkest times in American economic history, I was also a bit scared.What we get here are essentially four different approaches to how a few bright and/or hungry minds figured out how to take advantage of the mortgage housing collapse of 2008. We start with Christian Bale's somewhat chaotic character first before moving onto Steve Carell's and Brad Pitt's as we are strung along by the narration of Ryan Gosling. I'm not entirely sure why Gosling was chosen as the narrator, or if one was really needed, but because of it we get some really funny segments when it comes to explaining the complicated concepts of the banks doing what they did.While the acting was pretty solid from this ensemble, unfortunately, it was a little disappointing we didn't get to see more of them interact with each other. The trailer led me to believe this was a group effort to bring to light what the banks were doing, but instead it was more like four individual crusades. You can't really say there were any good guys. There were certainly bad guys.I think what separates this film from being just another ho-hum look at a bad period in American history comes from director McKay. Usually we associate him with comedies like Anchorman. So what we get with The Big Short is actually a movie teetering on the edge of black comedy and drama, though you can certainly feel the disdain of the director for what happened through the dialogue and quick cuts as some real-life stuff is spliced into the film.So while we get four very interesting stories of how these group of bright guys figured out the doom and gloom settling upon us in 2008, the lack of cohesion among our main actors sort of left me wanting a bigger sense of payoff in the end. Not to say it was tough to keep track of, but there was a bit of jumping around. But as I said in the beginning, the attention to detail is staggering and you can't help but feel rotten inside to know something like this was allowed to happen. Surely it can't again. We don't need another one of these well-done movies in the future.",

      "review": "  The real villains behind the great depression we are still somewhat crawling out from under are put on trial for all to see by this hilarious, angry, hugely entertaining and brilliantly scripted movie. Rather than being a preachy chore, it's actually an energetic, breathlessly paced treat. It draws your attention to a topic that is not something you would actively try to find out more about, and makes you realize the full, terrible impact of the credit crisis and the lives it ruined and how the perpetrators, who are all pretty much balf faced criminals who got caught in the act, somehow got away with it all, and are currently probably on a yacht in the Caribbean, champagne glass in hand laughing loudly, whilst people at the bottom and in the middle struggle more than ever. The Big Short is a very funny and very howl of rage that will grip you, entertain you, enlighten you and really piss you off. It points a finger at the guilty principles and says \"i know who you are you fuckers and now so dose everyone else\". Lets hope this genuinely important movie elicits change in some way, so that this never happens again and so that those bastards get theirs finally. Did i also mention the cast? Steve Carrel spectacularly leads and incredible ensemble, in a frankly oscar worthy role for the actor, Christian Bale, a hilarious Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt also give incendiary, mesmerizing performances as they deliver the deliciously complicated and dizzying machine gun dialogue from the masterful, head spinningly loquacious and sometimes intimidating screenplay. You need to see this film.",

      "review": "  The Big Short: Comes Up Short ***Having read and laughed throughout The Big Short, I was ready to love this film adaptation of Michael Lewis's account of the 2008 Wall Street crash.Lewis has an unmatched talent for exposing prejudice and idiocy in Wall Street and he has been very successfully adapted before in Moneybag (baseball)and The Blind Side (American football). Those tales focussed on one hero and had a clear story arc. I wondered how anyone could take the three heroesof the Big Short and make it work - added to the incredibly complicated machinations of the investment community.On the plus side, you will understand better what the Wall Street idiots did and what they got away with. The comedy director McKay was a good choicebecause he uses every post-modern technique for making it clear. Characters explain to screen, even the gorgeous girl from the Wolf of Wall Street explainsone piece of the puzzle naked in the bath while drinking champagne. It kind of works, but it does not exactly build emotional involvement. On the down side, the 3 plots hang separately - Christian Bale as loner Dr.Burry, Steve Carrell as Baum and his NY team of moral crusaders, and Brad Pitt and his garageboys - all independently work out what was going wrong and decided to short the US mortgage market (deliberately bet against) while everyone else was bettingfor it. Of course, they were right. Now there is progressive complication in all 3 tales, and that's where the film fails to grip. It is emotional overload. Only a few timesin the film did you realise the massive ups and downs the characters were feeling, even after all the clever explanations. I read the book and I could not follow all of it.Someone coming fresh to the film well, good luck.The performances are all good - for once, Bale's weirdness serves him well, Carrell is solid as Baum (with a terrible hairpiece!) and Pitt is outshone by the youngsters in hissegments. The film does not fail to engage and bounce you around for 2 hours and 10 minutes, but never hits the intellectual or emotional heights.It is one of the best films about the financial crisis because it illustrates a Lewis truth - even the losers get lucky sometime. But not that lucky.",

      "review": "  Engaging, if you can understand it. Not the typical fare most people will enjoy. But I liked it because of the way director McKay tried to make even the most complicated concepts in finance a tiny but understandable. Granted, even this dumbing down would still make a lot of eyes glaze, as the explanation still seemed hard to grasp without basic understanding of how money works.I'm kind of disappointed McKay chose to focus on the economic side of the story. Brad Pitt and Steve Carell's character have a lot going for them and they could have used a bit more development, in fact, they could probably stand as their own stories. Ben Rickert is especially interesting.",

      "review": "  It is no small achievement to make digestible and accessible to a mainstream audience the complicated and technical subject of the 2008 sub-prime mortgage meltdown, so it is predominantly to writer-director Adam McKay's credit that he never loses the audience throughout the 2hrs+ duration of his film. Using every single trick in the book to do so: he breaks the fourth wall and utilizes metaphors to keep the jargon and exposition-heavy dialogue fun but not frivolous; he utilizes famous and pretty faces for cameos and amongst the main ensemble not only to help us keep track of the numerous characters swirling around but also to keep us engaged. There's the guy from New Girl and the cute one from American Horror Story. Look, there goes Amy Pond from Doctor Who and is that Ryan Gosling or Ryan Reynolds? Batman's here too, playing Rain Man and Michael Scott from the Office plays Angry Guy (the only character with a bit more background and nuance). But the real MVP is McKay. The light touch he brings in both the writing and the presentation is what makes the film works: a visualized dissertation, in the style of a faux documentary with celebrity re-enactments, where the 'comedy' derives from the totally ridiculous and absurd situation our economy finds itself in. Characters unfortunately do come across as a little one note, but this simplification is the price to pay in order to get the important message across effectively and entertainingly so that the film will get the widest audience it so richly deserves and demands.",

      "review": "  Lewis' book is a rollicking good read, so I was interested to see how the craft of a film-maker could translate the intangibles implicit in the book into film - how they would make abstract concepts concrete. Initially, the attempt was interesting - break-out cameos, graphics, etc - but ultimately the film gets lost in the intricacies and the jargon.Just as in Twelve Years a Slave, Pitt's character is the liberal social conscience, but he nicely underplays his character here. The effect is less obnoxious than the in earlier film. Also, the film's denouement flirts with mawkishness and oversimplified lessons-learned. The there-are-no-winners vibe is almost ironic.Ultimately this film is, or at least should be, about how those who have the fortitude to think independently (personified by Burry, Baum, et al), can transcend the psychology of the mob and perceive truths which are often staring at us in the face.Also, seek out the excellent documentary The Inside Job as a companion to this drama.",

She plays a curmudgeon recreating the role she performed on stage written by Alan Bennett who also wrote this screenplay.The story is of an old woman who lives in a van, parking the vehicle in the driveway of the author. Alex Jennings plays the author and his alter ego who fight over art versus life which presents a distraction throughout the film.The film opens with a loud crash on a black screen and then seeing the window of the van cracked and bloody. Little by little we find out who this homeless, aimless lady was and what brought her to this point in her life. We, also, find out about the crash which really adds nothing to the story but does add to the running time as does a piano concert scene.The supporting players are all excellent English actors who add a touch of class including Jim Broadbent, Frances De La Tour, Deborah Findlay, James Corden and Roger Allam.\"The Lady in the Van\" certainly must have been better in the theatre and this film is only for truly devoted Maggie Smith fans.",

Car enthusiasts will enjoy spotting the changing metal on the streets around Bennett's house.Smith however is simply exceptional, proving that in a well written and sensitively directed work good actors can bloom magnificently. Without doubt she deserves a vanful awards for this.There aren't huge guffaw inducing set piece jokes, but more laughs that build before being immediately pricked by a needle of sharp social comment.Yes it tends to veer in the direction of 'Talking Heads' as all of Bennetts work does, but it's none the worse for that.

Shepherd's past is shrouded in mystery and one day she pulls up into a middle class street in a suburb in London and decides that is going to be her place to settle and subjecting the local residents to her unwelcome company in the process. One of those residents is real life author and playwright, Alan Bennett (played by Alex Jennings) whose mundane life is turned upside down when she makes his driveway a permanent fixture for her four wheeled dwelling.The film is supported with a host of British talent from the big and small screen with the likes of Jim Broadbent (Hot Fuzz) and and Frances De La Tour (best known for playing Miss Jones in the 70's sitcom Rising Damp). And this is a very British film, mingling the subject of class with a great deal of pathos and dry humour which Bennett's work is synonymous with.The screening I went to was packed with people from what I like to call the \"Silver Dollar\" crowd and the inclusion of Maggie Smith will certainly draw them in. However this is a both a moving and touching story as we see the love/hate relationship between Shepherd and Bennett grow and the mystery surrounding Miss Shepherd unravel as the story unfolds.",

The picture's excessively tedious opening 45 minutes, coupled with an overwritten, gimmicky narrative and an unfocused script that overemphasizes certain elements while slighting others, make it painful to endure, trying the patience of even the most stalwart moviegoer.

      "review": "  + \"The Lady in the Van\" stars Maggie Smith in a trifle English story that has one of the longest drawn out endings I can recall in a long time and the movie is only 103 minutes! She plays a curmudgeon recreating the role she performed on stage written by Alan Bennett who also wrote this screenplay.The story is of an old woman who lives in a van, parking the vehicle in the driveway of the author. Alex Jennings plays the author and his alter ego who fight over art versus life which presents a distraction throughout the film.The film opens with a loud crash on a black screen and then seeing the window of the van cracked and bloody. Little by little we find out who this homeless, aimless lady was and what brought her to this point in her life. We, also, find out about the crash which really adds nothing to the story but does add to the running time as does a piano concert scene.The supporting players are all excellent English actors who add a touch of class including Jim Broadbent, Frances De La Tour, Deborah Findlay, James Corden and Roger Allam.\"The Lady in the Van\" certainly must have been better in the theatre and this film is only for truly devoted Maggie Smith fans.",

Mrs Shepherd was a rancid old bat ,frankly, but we never knew her back story and it's to Bennett's credit that our sympathy is gradually stirred towards her. I can vouch for the authenticity of the staging ,every scene is filmed where it happened and for those of us who were there at the time it's almost unsettling. A marvellous film made with integrity and style.",

Car enthusiasts will enjoy spotting the changing metal on the streets around Bennett's house.Smith however is simply exceptional, proving that in a well written and sensitively directed work good actors can bloom magnificently. Without doubt she deserves a vanful awards for this.There aren't huge guffaw inducing set piece jokes, but more laughs that build before being immediately pricked by a needle of sharp social comment.Yes it tends to veer in the direction of 'Talking Heads' as all of Bennetts work does, but it's none the worse for that.

So instead, I am going to praise the rather amazing Alex Jennings who plays him. The film script opens up the story by having 2 Bennetts talk to each other. It is an intriguing and effective narrative device that not only delivers some of the best lines in the film, but also avoids having him talk to himself in an artificial and somewhat theatrical manner and we get so much more from this inverted monologue as to who Bennett is: as an insecure writer, a closeted son caring for his mother and a compassionate person who just wants to help. Add on a few \"Historical\" cameos and a bittersweet ending that is befitting the lady in question, you get a cozy and often thoughtful film that verges on sentimentality but never dwells on it.",

Veering from laugh out loud funny to heartbreakingly sad this definite quiet and calm approach echoes veddy English sensibilities and might be difficult for many who appreciate the loud and explosive mainstream American take-it-to-go film aesthetic. Barring that, if taste means as much to one as quantity, this is a rare and unique film experience. Kudos to the superlative cast, writers and director.",

It's one of those movies you ask yourself, \"what the f**k am I watching?\" I can certainly say it's one of the most original and most offbeat film I've seen in a while. But sometimes this film is a little too dark for my taste as it touches into some grim visuals and characters. Definitely an aquired taste and won't be as accesible to most general audiences.",

      "review": "  I loved the concept and the message of this movie but the execution felt clunky and it loses itself in the second act (but ends strong). Loved the commentary about the arbitrariness of how to be in a relationship vs how to be alone. The idea that not only is your romantic life is meaningless without following the set rules- but the only way to follow those rules is to lie, cheat or literally carve yourself up to fit in. I wish Lanthimos had kept the energy up throughout. The humor drops off fairly dramatically and then never really regains in my opinion. Maybe my opinion on this film will rise over time though.. I really did like the message.",

      "review": "  Yorgos Lanthimos' debut, \"Dogtooth\" was highly praised by both critics and arthouse audiences, it did so well, that is earned an Oscar nomination for \"Best Foreign Film\". Therefore, I decided to see what's the hype all about and I was greatly disappointed. I thought the film had some good ideas here and there, I noticed its director's offbeat sensibilities and his fascination for making the implausible seem real, but the lack of involvement and the misguided aesthetic choices(if I could call them so) made the whole material tedious and silly. Five years later, Lantimos returns to the \"distosyncratic\" grounds of his debut, but this time, he pulls a different approach, a far more effective one. In every aspect. I find \"The Lobster\" to be far superior to its predecessor: unlike \"Dogtooth\", this flick displays great craftsmanship, while, like in \"Dogtooth\", the acting here is rather wooden, mechanical, sometimes deliberately bad, the material is engaging enough for the viewer to see that there's a method behind the \"madness\". In simpler terms, those who are likely to enjoy this kind of flick, will understand that the Orwellian setup demands exactly this type of performances.Again, the fascination for the making the seemingly impossible palpable, is present, but this time Lanthimos' efforts show results, because \"The Lobster\" manages to be tense and convincing enough for the viewer to accept that an ordinary dog is somebody's brother(for example). The use of narration works like a charm again, because it makes the film more believable, it gives the audience the feeling that they are viewing the contents of a novel.\"The Lobster\" is a fairly strong satire against the automatisms and commodities indulged by society, against some deeply rooted, yet silly ideas about \"soul-mates\", the importance of companionship and so forth.There are plenty of funny moments and the overall material is drenched in irony, which makes perfect sense. However, the ending is not exactly the most inspired, but on the other hand, which one would have been, given \"The Lobster\"'s unusual plot? Also, sometimes the \"wooden acting\" goes a bit too far, but it doesn't really matter.Overall, what I admire most at this is the way Yorgos Lanthimos took a highly unusual plot(not only the idea itself, but there are plenty of bizarre moments in the film), a plot that apparently would have demanded and highly surreal approach, and made it work by using a rather traditional one. Because, if you take out the eccentricities, you have a pretty standard narration pattern, the visuals, while great, are quite familiar, and the director doesn't try to confuse the viewers with non-sequiturs. Yet, still, this is not a film made for mainstream audiences, so those unfamiliar with unusual/unconventional plots or movies are best advised to stay away. My two cents: 4/5",

There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments but also plenty of thought-provoking ones - the world of The Lobster is surreal but also uncomfortably real. Ever pretended to be happier in a relationship than you really are, or to have more in common with someone than you really do, to not rock the boat? Thought so.",

      "review": "  Despite the surrealistic realisation of the story we do not see anything unusual in terms of social patterns. There is one group of people, those inside the hotel seekingly desperately to find a mate in order to avoid being transformed into an animal. And the second group, those that live outside in the woods alone but at the same time among others fighting to keep their individuality. What's happening in reality. In the first group belong those people that thing companionship is the cause of the human. Dualship is what were designed for, finding the other half, the significant other to spent the rest of the life with. Unless you don't do that you are an animal. For animals only mate, stay with the female/male for a while and then move on for the next mate. And that is how the second group is seen in real life. Single people are lonely wolfs, unfit savages who have denied societal norms and move on with their life without the companion of any other. They are the proof that people can survive alone or at least in a broader notion of companionship (friends could be a substitute). Those two groups in the movie (and in reality) act like two separate societies in one world; the one doesn't accept the other, they challenge each other, posing a threat and attacking one another. And in the middle of it a couple that fall in love: not because they had to fall in love with somebody or because they didn't want to be alone but because simply they fell for each other. Love is what brings the complications in a calculated and shaped society.",

The use of narration works like a charm again, because it makes the film more believable, it gives the audience the feeling that they are viewing the contents of a novel.\"The Lobster\" is a fairly strong satire against the automatisms and commodities indulged by society, against some deeply rooted, yet silly ideas about \"soul-mates\", the importance of companionship and so forth.There are plenty of funny moments and the overall material is drenched in irony, which makes perfect sense. However, the ending is not exactly the most inspired, but on the other hand, which one would have been, given \"The Lobster\"'s unusual plot? Also, sometimes the \"wooden acting\" goes a bit too far, but it doesn't really matter.Overall, what I admire most at this is the way Yorgos Lanthimos took a highly unusual plot(not only the idea itself, but there are plenty of bizarre moments in the film), a plot that apparently would have demanded and highly surreal approach, and made it work by using a rather traditional one. Because, if you take out the eccentricities, you have a pretty standard narration pattern, the visuals, while great, are quite familiar, and the director doesn't try to confuse the viewers with non-sequiturs. Yet, still, this is not a film made for mainstream audiences, so those unfamiliar with unusual/unconventional plots or movies are best advised to stay away. My two cents: 4/5",

There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments but also plenty of thought-provoking ones - the world of The Lobster is surreal but also uncomfortably real. Ever pretended to be happier in a relationship than you really are, or to have more in common with someone than you really do, to not rock the boat? Thought so.",

      "review": "  Despite the surrealistic realisation of the story we do not see anything unusual in terms of social patterns. There is one group of people, those inside the hotel seekingly desperately to find a mate in order to avoid being transformed into an animal. And the second group, those that live outside in the woods alone but at the same time among others fighting to keep their individuality. What's happening in reality. In the first group belong those people that thing companionship is the cause of the human. Dualship is what were designed for, finding the other half, the significant other to spent the rest of the life with. Unless you don't do that you are an animal. For animals only mate, stay with the female/male for a while and then move on for the next mate. And that is how the second group is seen in real life. Single people are lonely wolfs, unfit savages who have denied societal norms and move on with their life without the companion of any other. They are the proof that people can survive alone or at least in a broader notion of companionship (friends could be a substitute). Those two groups in the movie (and in reality) act like two separate societies in one world; the one doesn't accept the other, they challenge each other, posing a threat and attacking one another. And in the middle of it a couple that fall in love: not because they had to fall in love with somebody or because they didn't want to be alone but because simply they fell for each other. Love is what brings the complications in a calculated and shaped society.",

      "review": "  The Lobster is the follow-up to Lanthimos' ultra-dark Dogtooth, and sees the Greek filmmaker trying his hand at an English spoken dark comedy. The Lobster is certainly one of the most unique films I've seen, and I thought it was great - albeit very uneven.Set in a dystopian future where single people are taken to a hotel and must find a partner or be transformed into an animal, The Lobster transcends any classification. At times it appears to be an unconventional drama, then a quirky dark comedy, but then it gets REALLY dark. I expected it to be a simple offbeat comedy, and I was very wrong. Lanthimos' twisted sensibilities shine through quite overwhelmingly in certain moments, and just when you think you've figured it out, it subverts your expectations once again - and I think this worked for and against it.I see The Lobster in two very different parts. The first was hilarious. It embodied that extremely dry humour that I love, and was shaping up to be one of my favourite comedies of the year. Colin Farrell was hilarious, and the dialogue and editing perfectly captured that darkly funny, yet awkward spirit. Even in the disturbing moments, I was still on board, as it worked within the movie's twisted charm. But then the second half took an unexpected turn, and the film kinda fell apart. I felt like the film was on a certain path, and then it lost itself and its message got very muddled, sadly throwing off both the pacing and story. The Lobster is a fascinating film with a lot of moments (especially in the first half) but it isn't for everyone. It's depiction of an awkward, sterile world is well crafted and hilarious, with most of its humour stemming from the lack of romance and intimacy in a world obsessed with love and relationships. Its social commentary was timely and refreshing; first poking fun at societal pressure of relationships, and then flipping this by saying that being single isn't necessarily the right thing either - you should do what suits you. With a strong message, unique aesthetic and a playfully twisted and dark spirit, The Lobster is an entertaining experience - I just wish it had sustained its momentum.",

The premise is that single adults are taken to a resort where they have 45 days to meet another single, or else, they would be turned into an animal. The story pokes fun at the notion of marriage and looks at how absurd some of the reasons people get married for. They don't leave loners off the list neither. Their characteristics are just as odd. Much of the conversations are uttered in monotone, but by design. The few times true feeling come out, they are really heightened. I am going to think about this film for a long time, and I believe that's how many others will feel about it too.",

The film could have been much more powerful if Matt Damon had been allowed to play up the personal, emotional struggles of isolation and fear his character must have been going through -- as he has proven he is able to do -- rather than having him appear to be chipper and relatively confident throughout his harrowing ordeal. Daniels, Ejiofor, Chastain and Mara also have proven abilities to dig deeper than the characters Scott gave us. The sole cognizable attempt at emotional expression and conflict was in Sean Bean's character, and it was a complete misfire. This is likely to be the only movie I'll ever see where Kristen Wiig is the deepest well of emotional expression. \"The Martian\" is a very good film but it could have been -- and should have been -- even better.",

      "review": "  The Martian Review:There are some movies you know going into them that they're going to be great. The Martian was not only great but exceeded all my expectations as well. A return to form from director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) who directed last year's abysmal \"Exodus: Gods and Kings (which I adeptly gave 1/5 because I was happy that it ended), The Martian soars to the heights of a great space epic. In fact the thing that I loved about the Martian more than Alfonso Curon's \"Gravity\" and Christopher Nolan's \"Interstellar\" is its optimism. Botanist Mark Watney played by an incredible Matt Damon, plays his character to a tee without depressing or alienating viewers. It is through this lens that we see plausible science (well somewhat plausible) succeed and the audience truly root for Mark Watney to be rescued by his Ares III crew creating a palpitating suspense during the rescue launch. That aside the supporting cast is impeccable, literally every single character feels important and is given enough screen-time to shine, from Jessica Chastain's Commander Lewis to Chitwetel Ejiofer's Vincent Kapoor. Also to be highly commended is the diversity of this cast- where every character is simply just equal- just the way it should be in every film.Finally the cinematography and soundtrack is also used brilliantly with breathtaking visuals of the simmering sun making it's way below the mountaintops of Mars and a soundtrack that utilises Abba's \"Waterloo\" to great effect also scores some brownie points in my eyes.All in all a fantastic film and so far my favourite film of 2015:5/5",

The cut that bleeds most is the final chapter, which gives the whole story a philosophical significance that is both poignant and naively inspiring. Nevertheless, what remains is a fine tale of how science, wit, perseverance, and intelligence are greater weapons than anything else. Mark Watney's humor survives in the film, even if the film strips him of his vulgarity, all in the service of obtaining a PG-13 rating (really, we must reexamine why one \"fuck\" corrupts thirteen- to seventeen-year-olds so much more than ten, twenty, or 100 \"fucks\"). Mark Watney's intelligence survives the film version, even if the film's story presents him with fewer obstacles to \"science the shit out of,\" all in the service of giving director Ridley Scott the opportunity to show beautiful Martian sunsets in the time allowed. That Mark Watney character is quite a survivor. Overall, please watch the film - it's good and it's values are inspiring - but read the book too.",

Mars. And the background and the hope this film presents is grounded on is our quest to reach beyond the limits of Earth's gravity (and so it loudly parades that we'll overcome every adversity). Now there's science here but let's not get too excited. The emphasis is interestingly on the personalities involved, interestingly because while the characters are the primary focus of this tale on one hand, on the other hand they are only the flimsiest of constructs with zero time spent \"getting to know them\". We only watch while they react to danger. Who they are or who they might be outside of these situations, we never get to see. This momentary drawback weakens the film, but only by a bit. Its worth a watch, Jessica Chastain and Jeff Daniels leading a deep bench of secondary players.",

      "review": "  I really like how this film relied more on story than on action and special effects. Goddard manages to keep the screenplay interesting, and sometimes funny, throughout the entire 2 hours and 14 minutes. One of my pet peeves in movies, however, is an isolated man talking to himself and explaining all of his actions as if he knows he is being watched by an audience and is obligated to amuse them. I know that sounds a bit like saying \"Hey Matt Damon, be less entertaining,\" but what I am really saying is that I wish the film's entertainment came from a more natural place. Other than my personal bete noire, the film is very well directed, acted and written. A broad range of moviegoers will enjoy it, I would recommend it to anyone.",

      "review": "  Based upon Andy Weir's nuts-and-bolts scientific \"what if\" tale, The Martian is the movie equivalent of Apollo 13 crossed with Cast Away. Just far less personable volleyballs. But there are potatoes. Space potatoes.After a powerful storm on Mars forces NASA's crew to flee, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead and left behind. He wakes up hours later, shrapnel in his gut, and retreats back to the Mars mission base. He has to survive close to two years of he has any hope of being rescued on the hostile world. Before that, he has to establish some kind of communication with NASA, and even before that he has to somehow grow food in the arid Martian soil. Back at home, NASA is debating their limited options to bring back Watney and whether or not they should tell his cremates that he survived. In conversations with my friend and critical colleague Ben Bailey, he said that The Martian was the opposite of Gravity, a film he subsequently loathed, because it was smart people making smart decisions. There is an inherent enjoyment watching intelligent people tackle and persevere over daunting challenges, and this sets up The Martian for lots of payoffs and satisfaction. We see both sides of the problem and it provides even more opportunities for challenges and payoffs. Naturally the stuff on Mars is more compelling because of its extreme dangers and isolation, but the Earth scenes are also enjoyable as the NASA determines the soonest they might reach their lost astronaut. Just like the similarly themed Apollo 13, there are challenges to be overcome and the solutions are not without risk themselves. I enjoyed how the screenplay kept throwing out new obstacles; just when you think you can breath for a while the status quo is upset again. The slew of new obstacles doesn't feel contrived either but rather realistic setbacks. It's a wonderful storytelling structure that constantly keeps things moving forward and ramps up the urgency. As a result, we don't ever feel safe right until the climax, and even then you're still sweating it out because of all the complications and adjustments. It's revitalizing to watch a movie that treats science with a sense of reverence. Mark Watney endures in the most hostile of environments through his ingenious use of the resources he has because of his understanding of science and math. Just as MacGyver proved there was something satisfying about watching a guy make a bomb out of a toilet paper tube, some chewing gum, and a bobby pin, it's entirely enjoyable watching Watney think his way out of problems, and this starts early on. Watney's first problem after he regains consciousness is to remove an embedded piece of shrapnel in his gut. The scene plays in a methodical fashion without any obtrusive edits, allowing the full task to settle in with the audience. The man has to perform surgery on himself and dig inside himself, and if he doesn't get this done soon, sepsis might set in (no doctors without borders here). From there, the situation only gets more serious as Watney's food supply, even when generously rationed, will only last a fraction of the time it would take NASA to send a rescue team. He has to grow food on an alien planet. That itself could be its own movie, a glossy crossover special from the SyFy Channel and the Home and Garden network. This is a survival story that doesn't rely upon coincidence or some sort of divine intervention but on the understanding and admiration of science and its possibilities. Though America's favorite astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson says that in this movie universe, all the science decisions are being made by science professionals rather than, you know, politicians who adamantly open ignorant statements with, \"I'm not a scientist.\"Another aspect I wasn't quite expecting but took hold of me is how uplifting The Martian turns out to be. It's a celebration of human endeavor and particularly cooperation, as the United States reaches out to other nations for assistance. Watching the determined souls risk their lives to retrieve one fallen man is the kind of thing that represents the best in us. Sure, there's something to be said about the fact that it's one prized American life that countries are spending billions of not trillions of dollars to rescue and perhaps that money would be better spent helping more lives on Earth. There's also the curious fact that the world has spent a ton of money rescuing Matt Damon in movies. From Saving Private Ryan, to Interstellar, and now The Martian, we seem to value Damon above all else. This isn't exactly a one-man show with half of the running time flashing back to Earth but Damon's star quality and acting chops makes it so you don't mind being marooned with this man. Watney's recorded messages are a slick way to deal with the internal thinking of its protagonist while giving the character more opportunities to charm thanks to a rich sense of gallows-level humor. At no point is Mark Watney flippant about his unique predicament but his sense of humor goes a long way to further engender the audience's good will. He's not moping and having existential crises; he's getting to work, and it's through the problem solving that we get to know this character, his ingenuity, his personality, his fears, and his distaste for disco music. Damon steers clear from playing the character too large and bearing his soul as the metaphorical representative for all of humanity and its place in the cosmos. He's just one guy who happens to be lost millions of miles from his home planet, and he's making the best of it. Being a Ridley Scott film, naturally the film is downright impeccable from a technical standpoint. The photography is great, communicating the frightening and awe-inspiring scope of the alien topography, especially when compared to maps for scale. The visuals find ways to further help communicate Watney's dilemma and diminished resources. Scott's visual sensibilities are so naturally attuned to developing tension. I was holding my breath at times from the suspense of certain sequences even though I long assumed that Watney would make it back home safe and sound. A scene with a desperate need for duct tape was a real nail-biter. There isn't a bad performance amongst the star-studded cast of actors who must have been grateful for even a tiny morsel of screen time. I have no idea what Kirsten Wiig really does in this movie as the NASA PR person besides fold her arms in rooms, but hey, she's there, along with Donald Glover as a socially awkward physicist. Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) gets to pour over the regret of leaving a friend behind, Jeff Daniels (Dumb and Dumber Too) gets to once more practice his skill of being an authoritarian blowhard he honed from The Newsroom, and I even was able to tolerate Kate Mara (Fantastic Four), so that's something. The Martian is a natural crowd-pleaser. It's engineered from the start to engage an audience with its survival thrills, present a series of increasing payoffs with new challenges and solutions, and by the end of our journey we're treated to a rousing finish that carries a poignancy and sense of inspiration about the best in all of us, what can be accomplished through grit and cooperation and sacrifice. It's a movie that let's the science of survival be the ultimate star, with Damon serving as a handsome host to guide us through the marvels of the universe and duct tape. When dealing with the vastness of space and the vulnerability of human life, it's easy to feel insignificant in comparison, but that's where the human will to endure and to work together comes in and reconfirms the possibilities of the collective inhabitants of this giant blue orb. The Martian is a sci-fi thriller, a potent human drama, and one of the best times you can have at the movies. Nate's Grade: A-",

The film moves from point to point, keeping things linear and toning the dialogue down to make things easy to follow.The film is visually pleasing for what is mostly a deserted planet. Not much reliance on special effects, but ultimately, things never get stale.Matt Damon proves to be a great lead carrying this picture on his shoulders. Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor provide some solid backups. Jessica Chastain makes the most of the time she has.The Martian never blows it out of the water; however, it keeps it all together for an easily recommendable picture.",

I can gladly say, \"The Martian\" is not only his best film in a very long time, but it is also one os 2015's best overall pictures. After presumed dead and left on Mars by his crew, botanist Mark Watney must use his scientific skills to savour/grow food to last him up to four years. Filled with unexpected humour, this film is able to balance a light-hearted tone while digging deep into the emotion when necessary. This film had me chuckling quite a bit, and I give full credit to Drew Goddard d Andy Weir who penned the script. This witty sic-fi rescue mission is also as intense as it needs to be, ramping up to the conclusion. From the visuals to the directing, from the writing to the cinematography, and from the acting to the believability of this film, it really is one of the biggest achievements of the year by far. I was enthralled from start to finish. Although I have to fault the film for ending a bit too abruptly, I can forgive that for being the only true thing to bother me. In the end, \"The Martian\" is a damn fine piece of filmmaking. Fantastic!",

It was also heartening to see some international cooperation. This movie shows how space exploration is really a team effort in every way. It takes a lot of dedicated people working together to make it happen, most of them behind the scenes, and the work they do makes a difference as to whether the astronauts live or die.Stranded astronaut Mark Watney survives on the red planet in spite of a lot of close calls, one day at a time, helping himself while a team back on Earth tries to figure out how to save him. While waiting to be rescued, Watney uses both humor and ingenuity to survive. The habitats and equipment seemed realistic, although I was a bit skeptical about a single layer of plastic or canvas or duct tape being utilized in a few instances, but hey, it could work. Maybe...The beautiful rocky and sandy Martian landscape was reminiscent of images taken by real life Mars rovers that have been exploring the red planet for years. Ultimately, Captain Lewis and the crew have to make a decision whether or not to put their own lives on the line in order to try to save Watney's. Naturally, they do right by him and the rescue is on. I expected the final no holds barred attempt to save Watney to be over the top, and it was, satisfyingly so.",

I ended up giving it a go because it was the only movie I hadn't seen yet that I would be ok with letting my daughter watch as well. I am surprisingly glad I did, it's so refreshing to see a \"feel good\" movie that involves being stranded in space where they leave out all things tedious and keeps up a good pace without fluffery so everyone watching understands what's going on (and i don't have to keep explaining it). I wasn't expecting funny and Matt Damon seemed to have a lot of fun with it. His narrative often explained plot holes before I could point them out in a rather tongue in cheek way that I enjoyed. This is a good one to add in anyone's collection and a much better every-nation in the world unite movie than anything.Independence Day.",

      "review": "  A Ridley Scott film - starring Matt Damon - tells a story of a stranded austonaut in Mars. The film was compared with Nolan's Interstellar, which later I will share my thoughts about it.The film was GREAT sci-fi film - touching, inspirational, funny, but with high suspense, and mostly accurate with science.Matt Damon was incredible. He made the character looked very much alive and surviving. The scenery or the visual effect was incredible and well placed. I saw a lot of movie with fucked-up visual effect - especially sci-fi. But, the really nailed it with this movie!.The scoring - which was made by Harry Gregson-Williams - was also great. I mean when you hear it, the score feels like it was made for an every day living drama. But, how amazing Williams put it on another planet! Also the soundtrack! HAHA! They're hillarious!Now, I'm going to compare it with Interstellar (2014).Overall - for me - Interstellar was still winning with its genius director, Christopher Nolan. The Martian (2015) can't defeat Intertellar's puzzle and mind-fucked situation. But The Martian won because of the characters - they are easily identified. We usually know what our next emotions would be as the film ran. Interstellar lacks of this, we don't know what the emotions are next. Because of the puzzle of course.On the technical side, Interstellar used traditional technology - which is still very effective. The actors can feel more of the real atmosphere. The Martian used green screen - nuff said.Also the scoring. How can you defeat Hans Zimmer? I still like to hear Interstellar's ORIGINAL music. The Martian lacks of its originality of music.But I still like both of them as sci-fi movies. These two movies proofs themselves to me that they are both intelligent. Even though they lack at some point.THE VERDICT:The Martian is smart, funny - with high suspense - with strong cast and very effective use of science.*note: if you like Interstellar (2014), I think you will like this.",

      "review": "  The legendary Charles Schulz comicstrip gets a modern day movie adaptation care of 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios, with two members of his family behind the story, yet despite that last bit of info, I was still worried. You'd be forgiven for being worried too in this day and age. I cringed at the thought of this movie in all honesty, it terrified me, growing up with Snoopy and co, how could the modern day Hollywood monster do this epic creation justice? Thoughts of newly created PC characters crowbarred in, lots of hip hop music, dreadful big name voice work with pointless cameos, oh my God! you could just see it coming. Luckily none of that actually did happen (amazingly...accept for the music), so lets be happy.As for the plot, well its a simple little thing really, in true Schulz form. Good old Charlie Brown is kinda eeking his way through life, trying his best and not really getting very far, as we all know and love. In the meantime good old Snoopy is up to his good old tricks whilst having his dreamy daydreams about flying against the dastardly Red Baron in his trusty doghouse/bi-plane. All of a sudden (not really) a new girl moves into the sleepy neighbourhood, a little red headed girl, to whom Charlie Brown instantly falls for. What follows are Charlie Brown's attempts at getting the little red headed girls attention in any way he can...without making a fool of himself. As I'm sure you're all aware, this doesn't really go well for old Charlie but nevertheless, he keeps at it and eventually comes out on top (spoiler alert...Charlie Brown comes out on top...duh!).Now the main highlight for this movie is obviously the visuals. When the film was announced I was pretty sure this would look terrible, it would lose all of the charm from Schulz's comicstrip, OK...I was wrong, but come on, how many thought the same thing huh. As it turns out the original Schulz designs are perfectly adapted and complimented by the use of CGI, yes everything is CGI, but its tastefully done and recreates the original material amazingly well. In all honesty it doesn't actually look like CGI for the most part, if you ask me, it looks more like a glossy [i]South park[/i] episode to me with that flat 2D appearance. This is one reason why it works so well, the visuals combine both the 3D and 2D element, giving the best of both worlds, making it feel fresher, different and all the time keeping the classic Schulz style (kinda like the later [i]Street Fighter II[/i] games ya know).Seriously though, when I say they have kept the Schulz style in one piece, that's exactly what I mean, I don't just mean they skimmed the surface. Remember how the classic Charlie Brown gang used to dance in school? all those quirky and unusual little jigs? well they are perfectly recreated here. All those classic facial expressions from Brown and co, their funny little hairstyles, Pigpen's clouds of dirt, the characters stances, the way they move, Snoopy's little happy dances, the little dotted line trail Woodstock leaves behind when he flies around, adult characters represented by a trombone etc...its all here. What's more, they even manage to include some oldschool black and white animation harking back to the old days, not sure if it was actually old footage or not, don't think so, but all the same it was a sweet little touch.The one thing that did disappoint me was the music included (same old I'm afraid). Now admittedly the film wasn't filled with horrendous modern trashy music, thankfully they kept the more chirpy to humdrum tunes and sounds from the original material. But alas they just couldn't help themselves, and to that degree we do unfortunately get some sequences accompanied by some atrocious modern claptrap that completely pulls you out of the moment, it ruins the atmosphere. Seeing Snoopy and co getting up to their cutesy hijinks whilst some RnB/hip hop (whatever) music plays, is tantamount to heresy! I hated every second of it. Then of course they have to continue the trend over the end credits, sheesh!Another tiny issue I had, that did actually become a larger issue, was Snoopy's plot line. Snoopy spends much of his time in dream sequences fighting against the Red Baron atop of his doghouse. Now while this was very cool, very well done and was perfectly recreated along with everything else, there was a little too much of it. The whole idea was sweet at first but became a bit mundane quickly. Yes we know Snoopy hates the Red Baron, yes we know he will rescue his female counterpart and we know the Red Baron will get away to fight another day. But did we really need this to take up virtually the entire movie? I really wanted to see Snoopy interact with the others a bit more in all honesty, its not a massive huge flaw or anything, but it stands out enough to be fair. The rest of the gang are given reasonable amounts of screen time but again some could of done with a bit more (and less of Snoopy flying around), background characters like Pigpen, Schroeder and Franklin I always found more interesting. To be honest, I was never much of a Charlie Brown/Snoopy fan growing up, I knew of them, saw the odd special on TV (was never overly enthralled by them) and had the odd cuddly toy of Snoopy. I don't really know much about the Peanuts lore and don't pretend to, but despite that I can't deny this was a great old fashioned heart-warmer updated with some lovely CGI work. Whether everyone would enjoy this I don't know, kids will I'm sure but they probably won't be up on the whole franchise backstory side of things. Older folk...sure, or at least oldschool fans will, not sure about non-fans though, it might seem a bit too babyish to them. Overall its a very simplistic and basic premise which has been executed wonderfully, everything looks spot on from the locations to the characters attire, they all sound just right and the use of archive sound footage from Bill Melendez (Snoopy) was an awesome touch. This is a completely, near perfect, faithful adaptation of a much loved classic.",

With that said, even with a shorter run-time than a lot of other films, this one still seems a bit stretched. The second story-line involving Snoopy feels as if it exists to extend the film out.The CG animation doesn't trump the old fashioned sketches; however, there is more than enough throwbacks and character movements to make this a successful picture visually.Backed with a classic soundtrack and much approved voice work, this film also delivers in the sound department.The Peanuts Movie excels on many levels and is easily a recommendable easy going animation.",

      "review": "  Tastefully done with care and ease, \"The Pleanuts Movie\" brings back the classic characters in all of the ways you hoped they would. The central story is that there is a new girl at school that Charlie Brown is gushing over and does not have the guts to speak to her. Side plots include a 3D look into what snoopy has been fighting all these years and Charlie Brown trying to win a talent show to impress this new mystery girl. I loved every aspect on how they mixed the old school two dimensional style animation with the new school 3D. It was done carefully and the callbacks to the original specials were done perfectly. Although it does rely on some of the source material to drive the story, I was able to look past that and see that they were just trying to pay homage. \"The Peanuts Movie\" will put a smile on your face no matter when you watch it. It is the children's feel-good film of the year. Is it one of the best animated films I've seen in a long time? Of course not! It is an extremely fun family film with great laughs, a heartwarming story for kids, and great messages throughout. This film may borrow a lot of elements from the past, but it is still great.

      "review": "  Twentieth Century Fox Animation that brought us Ice Age and a short featuring Scrat in space as the opening act reintroduces the Peanuts gang in 3D. Throughout the years of Peanuts specials the cast has regularly been replaced to keep the voices sounding young. The music at the school dance and the fact that Charlie Brown takes a bin of recycling out to the curb at his house are some of the few modern touches that I noticed. The characters don't suddenly use cell phones. Snoopy writes his own hero story fighting the Red Baron of WWI. From his doghouse fighter-plane he must save the poodle Fifi (Kristin Chenoweth is the one celebrity attached to this project). Charlie Brown gets all flustered over his new crush, the Little Red-Haired Girl. This movie is like Linus' comfy blanket. Pretty much every part of the story and the relationships between the characters have been done before. There is nothing new except the 3D animation. The point is that there are still universal themes that modern kids can identify with in Charles M. Schulz's creation. Parents and grandparents get a throwback experience. From what I observed Thanksgiving week at the multiplex, kids were laughing and into it too.",

Rather, it is a celebration of what we love so much about these stories: the unforgettable characters, the story situations which have become a staple of The Peanuts, the excellent humor, and the innocent joyfulness. The Peanuts Movie captures this, and therefore is an amazing celebration of what made Charles Schulz's work so amazing. It's an example of simplicity being a good thing, and the sweet, innocent nature of it makes it maybe not the best movie of the year, but certainly one of the most delightful ones of the year. If you even mildly enjoy The Peanuts, this is a movie you're going to want to see.",

      "review": "  Bringing a beloved franchise out of near complete dormancy, The Peanuts Movie has the right amount of charm and humor for children, their parents, and yes, even their grandparents. (Charlie Brown is HOW old?!) This latest take on the comic strip turned cartoon utilizes a brisk pace and a 3-D animation style that cleverly appears to be a hybrid between hand drawn animation and modern digital trickery. It's not, but the presentation almost fooled me. The plot doesn't take us in any new directions, but it doesn't need to. The movie packs in as many references to the Peanuts franchise as it can, sending Charlie Brown on a mad quest to impress a certain redhead, and showcasing that Snoopy and Woodstock still win at life. The older films exuded a somewhat morose and somber feel that centered on lonely children and their experiences with failure. The Peanuts Movie largely ditches that for a more cheerful experience that succeeds in actually allowing that blockhead Charlie Brown to grow as a character and have an arc. I personally despised the placement of modern music in a Peanuts movie, and a lot of the slapstick humor could have been left on the cutting room floor. But whatever. It's a well-crafted children's movie that will probably best serve as a rental or a purchase for long-time fans of these near timeless characters.",

      "review": "  Brilliantly re-introducing the legendary Peanuts gallery to a whole new generation of Lucies and Linuses, this touching colorful Movie smartly doesn't throw out the Brown with the bath water. Instead of going cynical and cutting edge, the latest adventures of Charlie and Snoopy perfectly nail the heart and humor of Charles Schultz, connecting with nostalgia as if it were the football that our pint-size hero finally gets to kick. Indeed, The Peanuts Movie ends up to be the furthest thing from a \"dark and stormy night.\" In this G-rated animated family flick, Snoopy embarks upon his greatest mission as he takes to the skies to pursue their arch-nemesis, while his best pal Charlie Brown begins his own epic quest back home. In an era when potty humor, fully automatic zingers, and overly syrupy messages get fired at the audience from characters moving faster than Ricochet Rabbit on a cocaine binge, it says a lot that this flick plays out nice and easily as opposed to fast and furiously. This is not to say that it's slow-just that it's not overactive and frenetic like the Ice Age series that ironically comes courtesy of the same inspired minds and animation house. Seriously, if select children want that badly for racecar-in-the-red bedlam, they need Ritalin-not Scrat, the Flying Prehistoric Squirrel. Certainly, Peanuts doesn't lack ambition, it simply fixes up - rather than outright fixes - what isn't broke. With eye-popping computer animation, the movie brings in all of the telltale Schultz hallmarks that made the comic strips and holiday specials (A Charlie Brown Christmas and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown) so enjoyable and indelible. Some slight modern touches (Meghan Trainor sings \"Better When I'm Dancin\") don't do much for the story but they don't exactly detract either. Bottom line: New Kids on the Blockhead",

      "review": "  It's really hard not to love something like Peanuts, even something like their first big budget big screen movie which doesn't do anything you don't want it to do. It's the same characters, jokes, lines, and gags that you come to know as a Peanuts fan. They don't update the formula or modernize it at all for the new crowd of kids coming in to see it. It's the same Peanuts, except for a few modern songs which you can't really prevent. The story doesn't stick to the beginning, middle, end structure as the strips and specials never did. It's Charlie Brown, just seeing him live out his daily life trying to please the little red-haired girl. You'll like this one.",

The Peanuts Movie was a nice continuation of the old cartoons.It had an entertaining story and was pretty funny. There were plenty of different stories to keep the movie going. All the characters were brought back. It only made me laugh out loud a couple of times, but I giggled and smiled through most of it. The voices were excellent. I'm sure they worked hard to get them like that. I didn't like the animation. It looked like they stopped working on it too soon. The Peanuts Movie is worth watching down the road or buying for children so they can watch it repeatedly. Kids in the theater were laughing. I giggled. Parents will probably end up buying it.",

What was not enjoyable was the secondary plot staging Snoopy and Woodstock in a Flying Ace plane battle of sorts, to the point where my fellow moviegoer actually stated, \"This is pretty boring.\" Even so, the good far outweigh the tedious in The Peanuts Movie.",

      "review": "  First thing's first, this was not as good as the original Peanuts. I knew that from the moment I saw this was computer animated. But the movie was still good. All your favorite characters are here and the story is the same good old Charlie Brown story just on a larger scale. Charlie Brown (Noah Schnapp) has to muster up enough courage to talk to the little red haired girl (Francesca Capaldi). I'm glad that the movie didn't just go the same way that other big budget children movies have gone. With the exception of a few things I still believed I was watching the Peanuts and not some big scheme to make money. But I guess those things have to be addressed.There is even a reference to late Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz and his nickname Sparky. Schulz's sons produced this movie and they did a remarkably faithful job of reviving his father's creation; they kept new, unwelcome ideas from infringing on the Peanuts legacy.Overall, I can honestly say that I'm proud that Blue Sky Studios did the source material justice. If you're a fan of Peanuts, then take it from me right now: go see this movie! It's a big ol' ball of nostalgia for any fan, it's a good film for kids and adults alike, and when it's over, I can guarantee you'll leave the theater with a big smile. Now if you'll excuse me, I feel the sudden urge to save up for a keyboard; I wanna learn how to play \"Linus and Lucy\"!",

      "review": "  The Peanuts were a big part of my childhood and I got pumped when I heard they were finally making another theatrical release. But at the same time, I was nervous because they were making it computer generated with Blue Sky getting involved with it. I've never really cared for any of their movies, not even the first Ice Age movie. Their stories aren't very interesting, their humor isn't all that funny, they feel so forgettable, and they never left an impact on me. Though they've always had really beautiful animation. When I finally saw it, my fears were never realized. The Peanuts Movie is one of the best animated films I've seen all year. I'm so glad to see a film that actually stays true to its source material. The story acts like a classic Peanuts special, the script is written like one, its tone makes it feel like one, even the animation feels like your traditional Peanuts special. I didn't think that a computer generated Peanuts movie would work. We were all used to it being completely hand-drawn, which gives it that charm and simplicity that we enjoy. But the style of the CGI actually made it seem like it was hand-drawn and gave us that charm we love to see from Peanuts. Not only that, I think it adds even more depth to the world of the Peanuts and made them feel more real. The characters that we all adore still have their personalities. Charlie Brown is still the lovable loser, Snoopy is still the loyal beagle, Lucy is still the crabby and bossy girl, Linus is still the smart and helpful friend who carries his blanket, Sally is still the cute and naive younger sister, they all have the relatable personalities that we all know and love. All the actors nailed the voice work, especially since it's all child actors. They were all the perfect voice for each character. I also love that the film offers a lot of valuable lessons for children. They show this at the end where, without giving too much away, the Little Red-Haired Girl tells Charlie Brown about all the admirable things he's done. That ending...is just perfect! So sweet, so meaningful, and kind of emotional. I had a huge smile on my face during that scene. It was a perfect way to end the movie. A lot of people have complained that they didn't try anything new with this film. They say they paid too much homage to the original source material, copying a lot phrases they said in the specials. In a way, I kind of agree. There were some parts that felt a little forced. I also thought that there were too many scenes with Snoopy and the Red Baron. Though they were fun to watch, it didn't feel like they had any significant point in the story. But when saying that the film doesn't do anything new, it doesn't need to. We see the movie mainly to see the characters that we all love. The Peanuts were part of a lot of people's childhoods and there's a lot of nostalgia in this film. For that, we should be grateful that they stayed true to the source material. So in the end, I really love this movie. It is by far and away my favorite Blue Sky film and is one of my favorite movies of the year, not just in animation. It unlocked the childhood in me and it has become a worthy addition to the Peanuts canon.",

      "review": "  Jan. 2,2016- I've never read the Peanuts comic strips by Schulz, but without any prior knowledge it was easy to understand the nostalgic effect it was going for simply with the help of great character design and animation. The film succeeds very well at capturing the minimalistic nature of comic strips and manages to maximize the emotional effect coming out of the characters. Story-wise the main plot is very straightforward and easy to understand- Charlie a genuinely nice guy wants to get closer with the little red haired girl but *snap* things never go his way. The beauty of the story however lies in the side plot of Snoopy whose story not only provides the necessary action in the film but at the same time relates very well with the main storyline. I have major respect for Blue Sky studios in taking such a risk with the design elements and the animation when movies such as The Good Dinosaur are bringing almost photo realistic images on screen. It goes to prove that story will always be king even at the cost of some good looking imagery.",

      "review": "  I should confess that the new Peanuts movie has been my first real exposure to the Peanuts comics and franchise as a whole. Peanuts has never truly taken off here in the UK - not for lack of quality - but mainly because Peanuts has and always will be a reflection of Middle-America suburbia. It is a celebration of simpler times; not through the eyes of the current generation, but rather for the older generation looking back at their own childhood.Now yes, of course, this feeling of childhood nostalgia is not exclusive to the middle-class American culture but a universal feeling that has only grown in popularity and become ever more profitable. Yet The Peanuts Movie doesn't culturally translate fully from American to Britain. There were many set pieces that wouldn't really connect to a British audience in the same way, such as the talent show, show and tell or the general imagery of the American suburbs. Despite this, the character of Charlie Brown is very relatable, undergoing feelings of inadequacy and lack of identity that always remains with each new generation.Based off the comic by Schulz, Peanuts centres around the childhood of Charlie Brown, his dog Snoopy and his friends as they get into adventures around their neighbourhood and school. In this movie, Charlie Brown has grown affections for the new red haired girl that has just moved in and believes that he needs to reinvent himself as a winner in order to get her attention. Rather than having one story to follow, the movie has broken itself down into a few miniature stories.At one point it's the book report that's going to save the day, at another time it's the talent show or the dance, all held together by a string of a plot. It's also worth noting Snoopy's sub-plot of his imaginary piloting adventures to save his imaginary girlfriend which the movie casually drifts into at random intervals. The plot is fundamentally non-existent, with all the characters being defined by one strong characteristic. Snoopy's imaginary adventures, conversely, have no bearing on the movie.However, everything I should hate about this movie, I actually kind of love. Peanuts promotes a simpler time so it stands to reason that it follows a simple story, and what might seem small and insignificant can be huge and life-changing to a child. While every character has one defining feature, they have a lot of fun playing to those characteristics, and no single character feels over-used or unwanted; Snoopy's airplane adventure makes for some of the most charming moments in the whole movie.The animation is beautiful, the voice acting is perfect and the humour is hilarious. Plus it doesn't try to update them to modern expectations; no computers, tablets and they play outside. It's never mentioned what decade the film takes place in but you could tell it wasn't this one.All the regular Peanuts characters feel both fake and real, they play to their defining feature unbelievably so; one child is really into music so he constantly talks about Beethoven and always plays the piano, one child is always dirty, another is nerdy and shy. Yet they all feel fleshed out, they have their own dreams, hobbies, mannerisms, quirks and loyalties. After the 65 years that Peanuts has been around, the characters have aged, certainly, but in the process they've become timeless.The only real criticism to make is that while Charlie Brown has to ask himself what makes him special, there's nothing to say what makes the red haired girl so special that Charlie has to chase after her. If they took a moment to give her some personality it would be justified, but she's only really there to move the plot along.It feels so strange that in a movie dedicated to saying how important it is to have a good personality, they don't give the main love interest (well crush interest anyway) any personality at all.The Peanuts Movie isn't going to change anyone's life - I doubt a child would watch it and have it stick with them for long - but it is a very enjoyable experience. The charm and creativity put into this movie alone is worth going to see it. It's a simple movie, but it's refreshingly simple.",

I was expecting this romcom to break a little ground though - be unabashedly unapologetic for fourth wave feminism, but it ends up reinforcing the traditional trope of one partner trying to change the other and the other one capitulating by the end. It's a cute gender-reversed capitulation with awkward Amy winning Aaron over by dancing along with the New York Knicks cheerleaders, but there's really no development as to why the two connected in the first place, and as such, whether there's enough gas in the tank to keep this tank rolling after the obligatory grand romantic gesture. Tilda Swinton, buffed and bronzed to unrecognizable perfection, channels devil in Prada as the bossy British editrix, LeBron James is a surprise comedic talent, and can DanRad BE any cooler making fun of himself in all manners of ridiculous cameos?",

      "review": "  All things considered, with every pun intended, this film could have easily been a \"Trainwreck,\" due to the fact that nobody has seen Amy Schumer leave her comfort zone as far as creating a feature film goes. I can say with certainty, that \"Trainwreck\" is one of my favourite films of 2015. Not only is it one of Judd Apatow's best films to date, but the dialogue and events that played out throughout this film felt so natural. As a reporter (Schumer) is hired to write a new article on a doctor (Bill Hader) who performs surgeries on major sports icons, she finds herself falling in love, which is something she never intended. As stale as that sounds, it is the freshest take on this type of story that I have seen in the last few years. I was laughing hysterically throughout this picture, and that is due to the great writing, tremendous acting, and a slow paced editing style that always adds that next level to Apatow's best works. \"Trainwreck\" does exactly what it sets out to do, and for that reason I can find no faults in this film. The one big fault that this film does suffer from however, like every Apatow film, it is just a tad too long. I am normally not a fan of this type of comedy, but it is so quick that I was laughing throughout almost every scene, and I was in tears on multiple occasions. Yes, a Judd Apatow comedy made me tear up... This film really is something special to the genre. It may just be me, but I believe this film is fantastic. \"Trainwreck\" was a huge surprise for me and I highly recommend it.",

      "review": "  A hard-drinking, hard-partying woman meets a relationship-eligible sports doctor.On a bit-by-bit basis, this comedy is pretty solid - not great comedic bits by any means, but mildly humorous. The best comic talent in the film is actually not Bill Hader or Amy Schumer but LeBron James, who is simply hilarious as Aaron's best friend.The problem with this film is the separation between its goals and what it accomplishes. Politically, Schumer and Apatow are part of modern feminism's movement against slut-shaming and female sexual empowerment, and it's clear that Amy (the character Schumer plays) represents this modern feminist. Yet because it's a romantic comedy through and through, reproducing all the cliches of that genre, Trainwreck forces Amy to change, to return to the tropes that marked women without the lessons of modern feminism. It's true that she never apologizes for her behavior, and the script never asks her to, but the recognition of her need to change indicates that the film's actual political position falls well short of its goals.Overall, while it's a decent comedy, Trainwreck's political aspirations fall short of its reality.",

In point of fact, she is the epitome of \"bad girl\" in that she sleeps around and how. She's seen in many scenes on her back with her legs splayed open. Or at least that's how it begins. No worries, she sees the error of her rebel ways, but only after we enjoy the ride to her change of mind. Along the way are pretty interesting characters too, not the least of which is Colin Quinn, finally given a role the SNL alum can get his teeth into. Some basketball players fill out the roles usually reserved for the ugly secondary \"friends\" clich�s aptly and the boyfriend, Hader, shares nice chemistry with Schumer. But this is Schumer's ticket and she does quite well in this her first time out. What's next? Team up with Melissa McCarthy, or is that too obvious?",

      "review": "  Amy Schumer is having what some might refer to as a moment. Her comedic rise has accelerated as her sketch comedy show has gained greater notoriety for its social commentary from a post-feminist feminist perspective. For many, Schumer has become a relevant and empowering creative voice, and the fact that she breaks free from the Hollywood \"thin is the only beautiful\" mold is refreshing. Her star is only going to rise higher as soon as audiences get a load of Trainwreck, a raunchy romantic comedy penned by Schumer herself and starring Schumer as the lead. Paired with director Judd Apatow (Knocked Up), Schumer excels and surprises in Trainwreck, a modest but appealing rom-com that's not afraid to get real when it counts and sweet when needed. Amy (Schumer) is a magazine writer in New York City and follows her dad's (Colin Quinn) words of wisdom he dispensed when she was ten years old: \"monogamy is unrealistic.\" Amy dates and sleeps with an assortment of men. Her current boyfriend Steven (the wrestler John Cena) likes to spend time at the gym but he doesn't quite satisfy her, at least enough not to still see other men. Amy's younger sister Kim (Brie Larson) rejected dad and settled down with a single dad and his son. The idea of marital bliss and raising children makes Amy uncomfortable. Amy's editor (Tilda Swinton) assigns her a profile on a sports surgeon, Aaron (Bill Hader), specifically because Amy hates and is ignorant of sports. Amy and Aaron hit it off and she confidently takes their relationship in a non-professional direction. It's then that Aaron surprises Amy. He calls her the next day and is interested in seeing her again. Amy has to come to terms with how to navigate a relationship with a good guy who understands her and would like more. The tone and spirit of Trainwreck is very clearly Schumer's voice, following her brand of sexually brash humor from an unapologetic and independent perspective. Amy is a love-em-and-leave-em character who would shrug at being called a \"loose woman.\" Then again if we applied these same standards to men we don't have the gender-swapped \"loose man\" nomenclature. Instead of the standard male playboy character who beds a plethora of sexual partners and then moves on about their day, this time it's a woman, and while perhaps this isn't the strongest foothold in the realm of being progressive, every bit counts (women can do it too!). Amy is unrepentant about her sexual appetites and she is not punished for them. Imagine that, a sexually liberated woman who enjoys sex and doesn't have to suffer some physical or psychological trauma related to her desires. We've come a long way from Mr. Goodbar. The character of Amy is much more than just her dating habits. She's ribald and unapologetic while finding ways to be relatable and more in depth than just the commitment-phobic lead character in a mainstream romantic comedy. Her views on relationships go back to idolizing her cad of a father and a strong sense of fatalism. Relationships can't work out so why bother? This accentuates Amy's already self-destructive habits, which make her in many ways our protagonist and antagonist. She's an enjoyable character who can also be mean-spirited, petty, and push the important people in her life away from her. Her biggest challenge isn't getting the story, holding a long-held secret, or even landing the guy, because he already wants to be with her. It's about whether she can accept a different view of herself. That's way more interesting and complicated than your standard rom-com fussbucket or workaholic.The content of Trainwreck is far easier to engage with than Apatow's previous film, 2012's This is 40. Even though she has a cushy job and a nice apartment in the big city, Amy's struggles with her relationship with her boyfriend, her sister, her father, and her boss, trying to please others without giving away too much of herself. Her father is the source of much of her discomfort as she and her sister debate how to take care of him in his ailing health. Where Amy views her father as an admirable straight-shooting guy who rebels against the social standards and expectations of decorum. Her sister views him as a bigoted and sexist jerk that was never much of a father. The slow acceptance Amy comes to about the degree of pain she's dealing with and guilt related to her father is a key development. Her rejection of the \"old ways\" is a repudiation of her father. The arguments that she has with Aaron are realistic, and he admits that he's uncomfortable with certain aspects of her lifestyle but he's not forcing her to change. There are some dramatic turns in the film that require Schumer to do some heavy dramatic lifting, and she carries it gracefully, keeping in character but also losing her carefree fa�ade. It opens up your sense of the character just as much as the actress. Trainwreck is still very much a romantic comedy and it spends its third act coalescing to its happy ending, but Schumer's self-deprecation won't let it get too saccharine. The movie is also funny quite often though it ultimately gives in to more rom-com conventions than subverting them. There's a funny sequence where Amy is trying to coax her boyfriend into being more vocally risqu� during sex, and John Cena does a great job awkwardly trying to be dirty. There's a funny moment tied to character as Amy mingles with far more straight-laced married women at a baby shower. They play a game of revealing secrets and it's everything you would want it to be. The satirical broadsides at the tabloid and celeb navel-gazing industry are broad but quite amusing, including article topics like \"Ugliest Celebrity Kids Under 6\" and, \"I'm Not Gay, You're Just Boring.\" Amy's self-destructive attitude and her outer layer of confidence lead to many humorous observations and exchanges, especially with Hader. The two actors have good chemistry and bounce off one another well, capturing a fun energy of a couple that really enjoys one another's company and exploring that. Swinton (Snowpiercer) is almost unrecognizable and quite hilarious as the unfeeling boss. The biggest scene-stealer and breakout star is the world's greatest basketball player, Lebron. He plays the standard rom-com \"concerned best friend,\" even warning Amy not to break his man's heart and having a dating debrief while playing very one-sided basketball with Aaron (all elements lampooned in last year's rom-com spoof, They Came Together). The basketball scene is particularly amusing as Lebron dominates his friend so casually and without ego. It's a fictionalized version of Lebron but the man just has natural comic timing and a star presence. I could totally see more acting work coming Lebron's way if he wanted it. However, there are jokes, storylines, and moments that don't feel as well constructed and simply don't work, enough that it hampers the overall impact of Schumer's story. There's a recurring theme of gay equals funny, notably when all of Cena's threats to a movie patron bear a striking homoerotic quality. That scene works well enough, but the theme reappears in a late storyline where a lisping intern at the magazine played by Ezra Miller (We Need to Talk About Kevin) unleashes his inner sexual freak, which involves a lot of homoerotic foreplay and positioning. It's a comedy angle that gets old fast. I also never believed the sentimentality attached to Amy's father after his health worsens. Schumer tries to turn a bigoted jerk into a well-liked character and it just doesn't connect. He has real physical struggles dealing with MS but at no point does he come across sympathetic. I sided with Kim on this one, though I think I wasn't supposed to by the film's end. There's also far too many supporting characters that just kind of float along the peripheral; this is common in Apatow comedies but these characters, from a homeless bum to Amy's work colleagues, don't feel well integrated. Hader's character is fairly underwritten, which again is something of a gender flip for the genre. There's a misfire late in the film when Lebron holds an intervention for Aaron. The core idea would work but Lebron's intervention participants include Chris Evert, Matthew Broderick, and Marv Albert, with the bulk of the jokes being Albert's in-game announcing. They don't address that the figures are playing themselves until much later in the scene, so I was wondering if somehow Broderick was Aaron's father. It's a miss. The movie-within-the-movie is also never that funny or satirical of Sundance indies, but thanks for the effort. As a side note, it seems like quite a missed opportunity that the Knicks game at the end of the film did not feature the Cavs. With Lebron as a supporting character, it would seem like a natural fit to include him in the climax. My theory on this is such: the Knicks play the Brooklyn Nets and we see Paul Pierce in a Nets uniform. As NBA fans know, Pierce left the Nets and signed with the Washington Wizards for the 2014-2015 season (he has since signed with the L.A. Clippers). That means that Trainwreck must have been filming the spring of 2014, which means Lebron was still with the Miami Heat. No wonder the movie didn't feature the Cavs in its finale. Also, in what NBA universe is Amar'e Stoudemire the star of the Knicks? Does Carmelo Anthony and his $120 million dollar contract not exist in this universe? It's a little comical that Stoudemire's knee surgery is given such dramatic stakes for a player that the Knicks were looking to dump. Trainwreck is by no means the disaster implied by its title. Even Amy isn't really a trainwreck of a person. She can be mean and self-destructive, but her shocking behavior isn't all that shocking. She drinks and has sex with multiple partners and does not feel shame in this. Look out, world. Yet it's Schumer's sprightly comedic voice that shines throughout the film even when certain jokes or storylines misfire. Make no mistake, Trainwreck is also a star vehicle for Schumer and she earns it. She even sheds some tears in very effectively dramatic moments. She can do it all (refraining from obvious bad joke...) and still be funny whether she's cutting someone to size or the butt of a joke. Trainwreck is an enjoyable romantic comedy, another in Apatow's sweet lineup of raunchy and somewhat old-fashioned romances with their happy endings. There should be more than enough to tide Schumer's fans and for her to make new ones. Nate's Grade: B+",

      "review": "  Amy Schumer is hardly the first comedienne to talk about her vagina and day-to-day feminine issues on a major platform, but her no holds-barred, real approach is fresh. It's hilarious. And it's necessary. If anything, I hope this turns people on to her Comedy Central sketch comedy show, INSIDE AMY SCHUMER, whose recent season 3 premiere won me over with an absolutely sublime tsunami of merciless feminist comedy. TRAINWRECK is cute, it's sexy, hell, it really is a fantastic syrupy sweet date movie (with all the NBA cameos and pussy humor, you truly gotta love how hard this tries and, honestly, succeeds in catering/pandering to both genders), but it's ultimately Amy Schumer fitting her style into a mold, instead of trying to create an entirely new one.",

Amy writes and stars with support from producer/director Judd Apatow. Translating her humor to feature length and big screens feels so fresh. An amazing cast was brought on board and there are surprises around every turn in the story. I can't wait for Amy's next trip to the big screen. I'm sure she'll have lots of laughs in store for us.",

      "review": "  Trainwreck is a great romantic comedy and a return to form for director Judd Appatow. I usually hate romantic comedies, but this director knows how to do it right. Amy Schumer and Bill Hader have crazy great chemistry together, and are both fantastic in their roles. Lebron James and John Cena are surprisingly outrageous in this film, and offered some of the films best moments. The film isn't original and doesn't offer anything new, but the execution of the comedy and drama is why Trainwreck stands above the rest. Schumer wrote and starred in this film, and I am hoping that this brings her an entire new group of fans who were not previously familiar with her work. I thought the dramatic scenes worked well in classic Judd Appatow fashion. I did think the film ran for far too long, but thats a usualy complaint I have with this directors films. Trainwreck is a blast from start to finish, and it will leave you only wanting more.",

      "review": "  ATTA GIRL! - My Review of TRAINWRECK (4 Stars)Much like Judd Apatow's collaboration with Lena Dunham for GIRLS, his work with comic and bonafide \"it girl\", Amy Schumer, has produced a thoroughly satisfying look at women one can actually recognize as human beings. While both are feminists, Dunham and Schumer seem to dismiss such a broad characterization in favor of one that says women can match men inch-for-inch in their ability to be assholes. Directing for the first time from a script he didn't write (the honors go to Schumer), Apatow has made what is clearly his best film so far. Schumer plays Amy, a hard-partying journalist with commitment issues, who is assigned to write a profile on Aaron (Bill Hader) a sports medicine physician, and sparks unexpectedly fly. From an early age, Amy and her sister (Brie Larson) were taught by their philandering father (Colin Quinn) that \"monogamy isn't realistic\". It's a hilariously written and lovingly shot opening scene that sets the stage for Amy's eventual crash and burn 23 years later. What follows is a funny sequence in which Amy dismisses conquest after conquest, sometimes unsure where she is most mornings when she does her inevitable walk of shame. What's delightful is that Schumer, unlike many stand-ups who become lead actors, fully commits to her character, never breaking or winking at the audience. Sure she gets the laughs, no great surprise, but what startles is her ability to make you cry without it feeling forced or cheesy. Her ability to appropriate that working class sensibility mixed with real smarts reminds me of Roseanne Barr in her prime. A Golden Globe nomination for writing and acting seems inevitable. Thank goodness they have the Musical/Comedy category! Joining Schumer is a stellar cast, with Brie Larson lending believable familial chemistry to her scenes with Schumer. Same goes for Quinn, whose monster dad is given so many lovable qualities that you can't help but side with many of his renegade opinions. At Amy's magazine, called S'NUFF of all things, her haughty and horrible editor is played by a completely unrecognizable Tilda Swinton, sporting enough bronzer and flowing ginger locks to keep Hollywood well-stocked in tanned versions of Emma Stone. Swinton's comic timing is impeccable, nailing her narcissistic character's breezy indifference to anything that doesn't involve her. Vanessa Bayer, one of many SNL actors in the film, seems to have cornered the market on mousy/happy roles, and every painful, toothy pause, especially when Swinton tries to get her to stop smiling, is gold. Ezra Miller uses his gawky male model androgyny to great effect in one ridiculously odd scene. Bill Hader, so wonderful in last year's THE SKELETON TWINS, embodies a fantastic male romantic lead, overcoming his character's perceived dullness to win you over with the loving, patient way he has with Amy.The biggest surprises, however, and the actors many people will be discussing are the athletes John Cena, Amar'e Stoudemire, and LeBron James. Cena plays one of Amy's boyfriends and his outbursts over his closeted homosexuality brings many laughs to the first act. Stoudemire has a woozy charm as one of Hader's patients, but it's James who wins the MVP award in this movie. He fully rounds out his cheapskate, busybody, heavily fictionalized version of himself, complete with surprising TV tastes and neediness. This is one superstar basketball player who knows how to deliver off the court too. TRAINWRECK is about a woman who learns how to grow up and love herself. It's somehow conservative that way, adhering to romcom tropes, yet it skewers all of the conventions simultaneously. This is a smart, rich entertainment, humanist in temper, reminding me at times of James L. Brooks' early films TERMS OF ENDEARMENT and BROADCAST NEWS, both of which also featured strong, flawed women at their centers. Also like those predecessors, Apatow likes to leave scenes loose. It's become something of a trademark of his, and TRAINWRECK suffers from uneven pacing and a few repetitive argument scenes between Schumer and Hader. There's even one misfire of an intervention scene loaded with odd celebrity cameos that took me right out of the movie. Ultimately it doesn't matter too much, since so much bite co-exists with so much kindness in this film. Lovingly shot by cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes (GIRLS, TINY FURNITURE, MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE) with what at times feels like an Instagram 70s filter, TRAINWRECK is a big budget movie with the soul of an indie. If you aren't reduced to a puddle by Schumer's big dramatic speech, or if your heart doesn't melt by Hader's reaction to the final act event, then maybe YOU'RE the one who needs to belly up to a bar and drink your feelings instead.",

      "review": "  Wrecking it for all rom-coms to follow, this whipsmart Train keeps chugging along thanks to honest, intelligent and hilarious look at monogamy come-lately. Characterizing Schumer as just a bawdy sketch comedienne gives one of the industry's sharpest minds short shrift. She kills it in long form too which is how superstars get made. An extension of her frank observations on Comedy Central's Inside Amy Schumer, this filmic misadventure also marks director Judd Apatow's best work since Knocked Up. This film doesn't just take a hard look at commitment phobia, it gives amazingly fresh and doubled-over laughingly funny insight into modern dating and romance. In this R-rated comedy, a commitment-phobic career woman (Schumer) who never thought that monogamy was possible faces her fears when she meets a good guy (Hader). Not only does Schumer's screenplay present a unique warts 'n' all romantic comedy, she emerges as one of the best comedic actresses working in film today. Lebron James nearly derails her train a few times with a fantastically funny supporting turn, but there's no denying this comedienne's R-rated charm. Sure, her big screen starring debut falls into formula a bit but rom-coms dictate a good deal of connecting the dots or else it becomes relationship tragedy. Brilliant and beautiful, her Trainwreck is an absolute for adult moviegoers who appreciate a dirty joke.Bottom line: N'Yuk-ed Up",

      "review": "  Trainwreck was written by and stars comedienne Amy Schumer. If you've ever seen her standup comedy, you might already know if you do or do not want to see this. She's funny, but very irreverent and potentially offensive. Many (although not all) of her jokes are shocking and sexual, with a rare racial joke thrown in. Trainwreck boldly puts female sexuality out there in a way that most movies don't. We start off seeing writer Amy in a dating relationship with the uber muscular Steven, played by John Cena. There is a funny bedroom scene where she asks him to talk dirty, and he tries...and tries, but it's just not quite working for her. He is a great guy with some weird tendencies in movie theaters who is in love with her, but he is not right for her, so they part ways. This frees her up to meet her Mr. Right. Amy's shockingly ruthless boss Dianna, played by Tilda Swinton, sends Amy on assignment to interview and write a piece on Dr. Aaron Conners, played by Bill Hader. He is a surgeon to sports stars, and numerous real life sports stars make appearances in Trainwreck, with LeBron James getting the most screentime. After Aaron's and Amy's first night together, he calls her. These two turn into a cute couple. This may be the first relationship she has truly taken seriously, and it seems to be helping her move in a healthy direction. With this one, she won't be having other men on the side, which has been a bad habit of hers until now.Amy's father and sister and sister's family like Aaron, too. When Amy goes through a tragic loss, Aaron is there for her. She even sort of moves in with him. Suddenly, there is trouble in paradise. Amy and Aaron go through a bunch of drama with each other, followed by a breakup, followed by Amy reverting to her old habits, accidentally going to bed with an underage guy!, which leads to her losing her job, which leads to her realizing she wants Aaron back.The finale is a fun reunion scenario with a big happy ending. While I like the ending, I'm not really convinced Amy has enough of her issues worked out to truly make it in this relationship, without more help, more recovery, and more support towards long-term sobriety.",

Unfortunately a lot of the scenes and jokes are dragged out longer than they need to be, and there is too much obvious improv that seems to be taking the place of actual character development. I enjoyed the movie, thought it was funny plenty of times, but as a movie, it just feels bloated. It is Apatow's style, he just needs an editor to teach him how to drop the stuff he really likes that doesn't belong. Still Schumer's voice comes through and gives this rom-com a fresh angle that doesn't feel like the tripe you see come out so often. She is what made this work, and her rapport with fellow comedian Hader is solid. She just needs a director who is a little less self indulgent when it comes to the improv stuff.",

I was expecting this romcom to break a little ground though - be unabashedly unapologetic for fourth wave feminism, but it ends up reinforcing the traditional trope of one partner trying to change the other and the other one capitulating by the end. It's a cute gender-reversed capitulation with awkward Amy winning Aaron over by dancing along with the New York Knicks cheerleaders, but there's really no development as to why the two connected in the first place, and as such, whether there's enough gas in the tank to keep this tank rolling after the obligatory grand romantic gesture. Tilda Swinton, buffed and bronzed to unrecognizable perfection, channels devil in Prada as the bossy British editrix, LeBron James is a surprise comedic talent, and can DanRad BE any cooler making fun of himself in all manners of ridiculous cameos?",

Trainwreck's major malfunction is that it can't decide whether or not it's a satire - when it decides it's not, it becomes painfully formulaic. Totally inoffensive and nowhere near as edgy as it would like you to believe, this is just about worth it for John Cena and LeBron James. Seriously.",

      "review": "  Trainwreck is very funny at times. Unfortunately those times more often don't feature Amy Schumer than they do which is strange as she is probably the funniest person on the cast. And yet Some of the best laughs in the movie, at least in my opinion, come from Colin Quinn or, of all people JOHN CENAAAA, who is absolutely hilarious in his 2-3 appearances, with LeBron James being quite funny at times as well. The problem, I think, is not in the comedy aspect of the movie but in the 'Romantic' one. Schumer and Hader could not be less suited for each other as co-stars, and the relationship bits that usually make the rom-com work are an utter failure in this case. Furthermore the Amy Schumer show shtick translates poorly to a feature length format as does, in my opinion, the Judd Apatow approach to comedy with a single female lead. The tension is artificial and the ending is a stinker but the movie is enjoyable, overall. Even if it fails as a big R Romantic comedy it is a lot funnier than most others so I would perhaps cautiously recommend it anyway.",

The film is very low-budget, and therefore uses less-than stellar actors, but their campy performances add to the experience; though Lisa Marie is truly awful and her line delivery made me cringe. The plot follows grieving parents who recently lost their son in a car accident and move to a secluded home in a small town to start over, though the house and town hold a sinister secret that goes bump in the night. The atmosphere of this film is what works best with some very good uses of apparitions in the background and as said before, the violence is startling and a lot bloodier than I had anticipated with a full-on, bloodbath in the climax. There are many different ways to interpret the events and the back-story of the house and ghosts seems to have a couple key elements missing, but for a first-time director, it's a solid debut that doesn't spoon-feed all of the details. It also features a fitting pre-titlecard sequence that put a smile on my face, but blink and you'll miss it!",

Now the final act may be a bit jarring for some people but I thought the whole film was building up to a horrific act and when the past instances of the house are revealed that is wholly justified.

But the grieving couple unknowingly becomes the prey of a family of vengeful spirits that reside in their new home, and before long they discover that the seemingly peaceful town they've moved into is hiding a terrifyingly dark secret. Now they must find a way to overcome their sorrow and fight back against both the living and dead as the malicious ghosts threaten to pull their souls - and the soul of their lost son - into hell with them. [IMDb]\"Fuck\". That was the word I muttered to myself when this movie concluded tonight. I'll tell you about my first experience trying to watch We Are Still Here and why it had taken me so long to finally get around to finishing it. When this first came out on Blu-Ray, I downloaded it and had a movie marathon of recently released horror titles. It spanned for about 6 and a half hours. From the course of 10 PM on a Friday to almost 5 AM on a Saturday morning. By the time, 4 AM rolled around, it was time to watch We Are Still Here. I was so burnt out and exhausted that I passed out almost immediately after the opening title popped up.Skip ahead to last week, I was scrolling through Amazon for Blu-Ray flicks to purchase when out of the blue, I saw that We Are Still Here dropped in price from $24.99 to $9.99. Judging from how bad I wanted to watch this and also, seeing that the score on the Tomatometer was 95% from when I last checked, I bought it. Watched it tonight with 3/5 of my housemates and the only real words I could muster afterwards were \"Fuck.\" This movie knocked my sock off. My housemates and I have not moved from where we were sitting and it ended nearly an hour and a half ago. It's safe to say that We Are Still Here.Anyways, moving on from my terrible attempt at humor, I am infatuated with 70's and 80's horror films. They're the shit. Hence why I am such a sucker for newer horror movies that are throwbacks to the classic (e.g The House Of The Devil, The Final Girls, The Innkeepers, It Follows, Berberian Sound Studio, etc). We Are Still Here is now in that list because they nailed the 70's/80's horror atmosphere perfectly. The cold surroundings give off a really isolated and eerie feeling on the viewer but its the house that takes the cake. The house is an old beast and it's truly unsettling, even if nothing is happening. All of the acting was really solid, esp. that by Barbara Crampton, who disappointed me in You're Next. Also, damn. She looks really good for her age. Another thing I admired about this film is the amateur-ish cinematography and the way Ted Geogehan handled the film. His direction was a highlight of the film, as well as the writing.Another thing I really liked was how there was always a tense anticipation in every scene and sometimes, the viewer got what they hoped for and sometimes, not. One can definitely feel the film building up to a huge payoff and I can honestly say that the climax in We Are Still Here is one of the greatest horror movie payoff's I've seen in a while. It was really gory like a classic Italian horror film directed by Lucio Fulci, where the blood and guts was pumped out like a great Italian pizza: to perfection. The burning specters who haunted the house were really cool in how they were conceptualized and the ending was rather fitting. I am content with this film and the last half is pure gold. It totally made We Are Still Here leagues above any other horror movie this year. We Are Still Here is my favorite horror film of 2015, so far. Krampus has a fighting chance but it's gonna be hard to beat, that's for sure. Highly recommended.P.S. S/O to my boy Larry Fessenden. You're always a standout. Thank you.",

With all that being said, it still puzzles me, as I kept on thinking about \"potential\", this movie is largely underdeveloped, with the parts for a good movie, but not quite there.I feel with a bigger budget, I feel he can make something really great--he has a good eye and compelling style.",

      "review": "  One of the great pleasures of watching a lot of horror movies is when you go into one knowing virtually nothing about it and then being legitimately taken aback, surprised, and entertained by what you've found. WE ARE STILL HERE is just such a film, a haunted house story with a few extra quirks and wrinkles that succeeds in doing what few movies do: it made me genuinely uneasy. The film seeks to truly frighten the audience, not merely jolt or surprise them with jump scares (although there certainly are a few of those). It's a classic sort of setup - a couple grieving the death of their son moves into an old house with a dark history; it's no spoiler to say that ghosts are involved, but they aren't only a piece of the puzzle, nor are they the only source of danger for the characters. The relationship between the leads feels realistic and emotionally honest, and occasionally even brings about some nice moments of humor. As for the ghosts, the movie contains some of the creepiest representations of them that I've seen in a long time, as they often exist as dark figures at the edges of the frame or scuttling through the background. The movie is not without its fair share of gore (some of it borderline over-the-top... but in a kind of fun way), but overall it feels much more like the classier haunted tales of old than it does some gruesome, exploitation sleazefest. It is also a movie soaked in atmosphere, something that is ramped up by its chilly, wintry setting and very fine cinematography. It's easy to shock an audience, but it's harder to unnerve them, but this film more than met that test for me. I don't want to oversell it, but WE ARE STILL HERE is a fantastic little horror movie.",

There was some decent gore but it just felt like a failed attempt to combine creepy ghost aspects with classic slasher themes.

      "review": "  An awesome throwback to the old-school, slow-burn horror films of the past, We Are Still Here is unsettling, at times very violent, and has a handful of decent scares that actually work! The film is very low-budget, and therefore uses less-than stellar actors, but their campy performances add to the experience; though Lisa Marie is truly awful and her line delivery made me cringe. The plot follows grieving parents who recently lost their son in a car accident and move to a secluded home in a small town to start over, though the house and town hold a sinister secret that goes bump in the night. The atmosphere of this film is what works best with some very good uses of apparitions in the background and as said before, the violence is startling and a lot bloodier than I had anticipated with a full-on, bloodbath in the climax. There are many different ways to interpret the events and the back-story of the house and ghosts seems to have a couple key elements missing, but for a first-time director, it's a solid debut that doesn't spoon-feed all of the details. It also features a fitting pre-titlecard sequence that put a smile on my face, but blink and you'll miss it!",

Might sound cliche but it really works within the 1979 setting, how well it looks and how well it is shot. Now the final act may be a bit jarring for some people but I thought the whole film was building up to a horrific act and when the past instances of the house are revealed that is wholly justified. Big surprise and I hope to see more from Ted Geoghegan.",

      "review": "  I've been looking forward to this movie for some time now. It's actually not even that long ago now, I'd say around a month, and I can say that I definitely wasn't disappointed by this movie. As far as haunted house horror movies go, and describing this movie as just a haunted house flick is vastly underselling it, but I think this might be the best I've seen since The Conjuring. Though, honestly, I think The Conjuring does a better job at getting conventional scares out of the concept, whereas this one tries to do something different with it. Visually, the film reminds me very much of The House of the Devil, it almost feels like both films could actually exist in the same universe. Though, to be fair, House of the Devil does, for most of its running length, deal with something that's more 'realistic', per se, than this one, where it's clearly all supernatural. But I thought the movie was really well-paced and it built well. The story, or what's going on in the house, is established fairly quickly and it's just a point of giving you little bits and pieces of information until you get to the last act, where it goes all out. That's not to say that there is a lack of horror until that point, because there isn't. Actually, this might be one of the more balanced horror movies I've seen this year in terms of balancing horror and exposition. It's not a slow-paced movie at all. I wouldn't say it's fast paced either, it's just perfect as far as pacing goes honestly. There's a lot of tension here that keeps building and building up until its insane climax. I know I'm sort of raving about the movie, but it's definitely not without its issues. They never make it exactly clear what's going on here in the house, whether it's the house that demands the sacrifice or it's the Dagmars. And it's not like they were trying to be subtle about it, this was a big reveal at the end of the film, where, the patriarch of the Dagmar family, states that his family wasn't run out of town, but were in fact sacrificed to the house. And that brings up more questions than it does answers. Why does the house require a sacrifice? And how did the house go about sacrificing the families that have the unfortunate 'honor' of living in this house. It sort of makes sense when the Dagmar family does it, within its context of course, but it brings up questions that need explaining when you say that it's just the house that demands it and not the vengeful family. And, another thing, if the Dagmar could just come out and murder people, as they did with Bobby's friend and his girlfriend, then why did they not immediately murder Anne and Paul upon moving into the house? Were they not a 'family'? And there's also the fact that Anne and Paul were allowed to live. Though I can tolerate the latter more, because it opens things up to debate. The other ones bother me because it changes on something the film already stated as fact without giving you so much of an explanation as to why that was. So it's just strange to me that movie so well-crafted, so taut and intelligent could have those types of flaws. The acting is also really quite strong, it helps that they have a really good script to work with, outside of the aforementioned issues. This might not be my favorite horror movie of the year, that honor would go to It Follows, but it's still a really damn good horror film. It's smart and it builds tension really well and the climax is pretty damn crazy. This may have its flaws, but I'd still recommend this wholeheartedly. Horror nerds will love this.",

Halfway through this boring movie all you're waiting for is for the characters to die and this movie does not deliver much great death scenes but hey, at least we get a lot of scenery shots that last for an embarrassingly long time.",

      "review": "  \"What We Do int he Shadows\" puts a huge spin on it's genre, creating a documentary style film about a fictional world of vampires as they travel the streets at night and sleep in their home together during the day. This plays out almost like a wholly dialogue driven feature, with just one difference, everything. This is a very clever (albeit oversaturated) story that i really enjoyed. About halfway through the film you get the sense that they have nowhere else to go with the story and that definitely shows in it's mere 20-minute running time. Well scripted and plotted out well enough, this film has a little something for everyone to \"sink their teeth into.\" To mockumentary fans, this film could be their dream. To myself, \"What We Do in the Shadows\" works very well at what it sets out to do, but ultimately falls a little flat in some aspects. A very fun and slightly original film that I can recommend watching around Halloween.",

      "review": "  \"Yeah some of our clothes are from victims. You might bite someone and then, you think, 'Oooh, those are some nice pants'\".Anyone familiar with the little independent Antipodean comedy Eagle vs Shark or the cult TV series Flight of the Conchords will happen to find themselves on comfortable ground with What We Do In the Shadows as the co-creators of these works, Taiki Waititi and Jermaine Clement collaborate again to deliver one the most genuinely funny comedies for some time.There's a big event for the undead in Wellington, New Zealand called 'The Unholy Masquerade' and upon the day, a documentary film crew are allowed access to film a bunch of vampires as they share their experiences and what everyday life is like for these creatures of the night.Fly on the wall mockumentaries is a format that been done many times before. The TV series The Office has had great success in recent times and the likes of Rob Reiner's This is Spinal Tap has made a lasting impression on people since it's release in 1984. However, Waititi and Clement have came up with a new (and strangely obvious) idea on how to gain more mileage from this particular style of filmmaking. Why has no one tapped into the lore and dark myths of vampires and used it for laughs? Granted, some films like Vampire's Kiss in 1989 had an outrageous Nicolas Cage using his couch as a coffin and (famously) eating live cockroaches and Roman Polanski's 1967 The Fearless Vampire Killers had found a cult status but vampire's, probably now more than ever, are in very hot demand what with the Twilight movies and HBO's True Blood. We can't seem to get enough of them but we are still taking them all very seriously. As a result, this film comes at a perfect time.For a project of this nature to work, though, you have to be up on your vampire knowledge and the pop-culture surrounding them. By this, I mean from Bram Stoker to Anne Rice; Blade to The Lost Boys and not forgetting Nosferatu along the way. You also have to open to the ways and needs of a vampire's existence. If you are all of the above, then sit back and allow this film to sink it's teeth in and deliver it hilariously satirical comedy. First and foremost, the characters are brilliantly written and every one of the actors deliver brilliant performances. Each of our vampires have their own style (or lack of, as the case may be); we have the 379 year old Viago (Taika Waititi), the dandy gent of Anne Rice.183 year old Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), the cool rock star type al la The Lost Boys.862 year old Vladislav (Jermaine Clement) who riffs on Bram Stoker's work and 8,000 year old Petyr (Ben Fransham), hiding in his darkened room and resembling the Max Schreck of Nosferatu! As they co-habit and flat share, they argue about domestic duties and who's turn it is to do the dishes. Deacon hasn't done them in five years and anal-retentive Viago would like his flatmates to give some consideration for the decor and furnishings by putting newspapers down before feasting on their victims as the arterial spray can cause quite a mess. They even knit a scarf for their human friend who they all agree not to feed on. It's these exchanges with each other that provide genuine laughs and as they scour the New Zealand night scene for \"food\" they must rely on doormen to invite them into nightclubs as they can't enter on their own accord and have run-in's with the local Werewolves who are so gentlemanly and well mannered that they don't want to be known as Swearwolves.Admittedly, there are periodic lulls but, thankfully, they're brief and when the laughs are delivered they can be genuinely side splitting. I can often be very critical of both horror and comedy as I often find that they either try too hard or simply don't have the material but What We Do In the Shadows really hits the spot with sharp and observant humour, A hugely successful medley of of a filmmaking style and pop-culture sub-genre that is, without a doubt, one of the silliest and funniest films of 2014.Mark Walker",

      "review": "  When you think of New Zealand there are certain things that spring to mind, unfortunately most of those things now tend revolve around Hobbits. Despite New Zealand being used as the backdrop for Tolkien's fantasy world its still not really the first place you'd associate with vampires, especially vampires living in the suburbs of Wellington. So it was admittedly kinda surprising to see a vampire movie emerge from the island of Kiwis, but not just a vampire movie...a vampire comedy mockumentary.Put basically this film takes the popular reality TV concept and blends it with the popular slightly romantic vision of vampires (Anne Rice type vampires) whilst also adding other ghouls and mythical creatures in a bare bones hyperbole of blood. A camera crew stays in a decrepit house with four vampires and follows their daily routines trying to exist in the present day. The film crew have been given special permission to film these ancient creatures of the night as they prepare for a special event, a special ball...the crew were also given assurance they wouldn't be eaten.The four vampires are a mixed bunch from the distant pages of time. Viago (379 years old) is the main vampire who talks to us most of the time, he was an 18th century dandy, a wealthy man who is prim proper and pedantic and likes the house clean and tidy (the Lestat de Lioncourt of the bunch). Deacon is the bad boy of the group...or so he likes to think (183 years old). He's the young rebellious rock n roll leather pant wearing vampire who thinks he's hot stuff, the irony being he clearly isn't. 'If you were a Nazi after the war...uh-uh''If you were a vampire'...*shakes head*'If you were a Nazi vampire! no way!! I was outta there!'Vladislav is the second eldest vampire (862 years old) who grew up during the medieval ages and was a tyrant. He's the most dated and out of touch vampire, HE is the sexual deviant of the bunch, the ladies man. His appearance is more in line with the traditional romantic vampiric appearance (the Gary Oldman/Coppola vampire of the bunch). Then lastly there is Petyr who is the eldest vampire at 8000 years of age. This guy is obviously a homage to the Count Orlok character in the F.W. Murnau film 'Nosferatu'. He doesn't say anything but merely nods or hisses and is virtually more animalistic or creature-like than the others.So apart from the usual vampire-esque things you'd expect to see what is different about this movie? Well for one its all filmed with hand held cameras because its a reality show, not exactly a new idea but it makes the whole film look very realistic in terms of a reality show that is. They have clearly gone out and about in Wellington and filmed on the fly with real unknowing people which makes things more intriguing and fun. In fact its hard to tell at times if the people we see are in the movie or simply real folk unaware they are being filmed.Some of the main things that really stand out are the extremely humorous little chats the vamps have with the cam crew (ala Big Brother) as they bicker about each other and whine about life in general. It is absolutely hilarious to watch these guys moan and take the piss out of traditional vampire lore turning it into annoying everyday situations. A really clever aspect is the fact vampires don't cast a reflection...so how do they know what they look like? This is clever simply because you've probably never even thought about that. Vampires tend to look very glamorous in certain movies yet how do they know they look glamorous, they might look like shit. So we are presented with a brilliantly funny sequence where these vamps must draw each other in certain attire and make dummies to put the clothes on, so they have an idea of how they will look when they cruise the town at night.'I think we drink virgin blood because...it sounds cool''I think of it like this...if you're going to eat a sandwich...you would just enjoy it more if you knew no one had fucked it'Then there is the issue of how to kill and drain a victim without making a mess on the carpet and furniture. How do they get all their clothes cleaned, washing up all the blood stained cutlery and dishes, how to find victims/virgins, keeping their vampire skills honed, general entertainment, coping with modern technology, flying through windows, trying to hypnotise victims when they're glued to the TV or a laptop and getting to grips with a new vampire and his human friend. The answer to many of these things being a female human slave who acts like a personal secretary with a shopping list of victims which is a fantastic twist. You wouldn't think a film like this would have many special effects and if they did they'd be crappy, but you'd be wrong. OK there aren't lots of effects everywhere, they are sparse, but what we do see is cleverly done and highly effective in a tacky kind of way. We see the vamps flying around and hovering, Viago rises from his bed in that classic vertical manner, the guys change into bats, there are of course classic practical blood effects and most impressively we see the guys able to walk (and fight) up the walls and across the ceiling. One scene in particular shows two of the guys fighting up the walls and across the ceiling in one shot and it really does look fab (a rotating set I'm guessing). I must also add that the sets are really atmospheric too, again clearly basic but they work so well.The only thing I didn't quite like about this movie was the adding of other creatures of the night such as werewolves and zombies especially. I guess the werewolves I can accept but the way they are presented and acted out by the cast just doesn't quite work as well I think. The vampires have a clear distinction between themselves, you can send up different variations of vampires and there is so much you can do. With the werewolves its not really the same, one werewolf doesn't really differ from another, the jokes tend to be childish toilet/animal gags and they don't have any kind of distinctive look, they just look like regular boring humans. Of course once they turn things get a bit more exciting but then you lose the comedy aspect and it obviously becomes more of a genuine horror which you don't really want here. As for other monsters such as zombies that was a step too far for me, that felt like they were pushing it too much. I loved the cast in this film I really did, each of the three main vampires are really well portrayed and highly amusing throughout. In fact I can't even say which vampire was my favourite because they were all tops. Each actor had some very funny dialog and they are all gifted with amusing rubbery faces which helps. I won't lie and say its a perfect film that is full of laugh out loud moments from start to finish...but its damn close. Considering this came out of nowhere, the cast is unknown (to me), its a New Zealand made film (no disrespect) and the budget appears to be small...its a fine comedy that deserves much kudos. Its like...'Spinal Tap' but with vampires.'When you get four vampires in a flat obviously there's going to be a lot of tension, there's tension in any flatting situation'",

In an age where vampire stories like Twilight and True Blood have overrun television and movies with terrible stories about love and betrayal and death compounded by bad acting, \"What We Do in the Shadows\" thankfully strays very far in the opposite direction with comedy. It's a simple day in the life kind of mockumentary for these small group in a flat in New Zealand.While the takes on vampires isn't necessarily fresh...I'm talking about partying at night and avoiding the cliches we've come to know...everything comes out as a joke. The closest film I can relate this to is Four Brothers. Flight of the Concords worked so well on a platform of music and sketches, so this comes off as a drawn out television show with a bunch of different events that would have worked well in short spurts. At only 80 minutes long, this offers every cheap and hearty laugh you'd expect from a group of guys who do well at their craft.",

      "review": "  One of the most fun and clever movies of the year!What at first seems like a one-note, SNL-type vampire trope parody/mockumentary, actually digs deeper and deeper into the horror/vampire mythos and creates a brilliant, often hilarious satire of the genre and modern society in general. Playing like a day-in-the-life snapshot of these goofy, out-of-touch creatures of the night, the comedy is structured with a loose plot connecting a series of clever bits and sketches. While many of these humorous observations of vampire lore have been made before, the script and cast are so funny and likable -- and the punchlines have the benefit and freedom of going balls-to-the-wall, crazy over-the-top -- that this movie ends up being one of the most original comedies in recent memory. Its often intense gore may turn some off to the film (even I think it goes overboard in places), but so many of the laughs are dependent on the violence as a means to mock it's use in the films it lampoons. It's a great watch -- offering many interesting, modern-world scenarios in which to place the centuries-old protagonists. It also features the same kind of refreshingly-awkward humor you'd expect from Flight of the Conchords (that series' creators wrote and directed this gem). The first few minutes may seem a bit obvious in the joke setup, but be sure to stick around for some hilarious vampire shenanigans.",

      "review": "  What We Do In The Shadows is a mockumentary vampire comedy about three generations of vampires living under one roof who hire a film crew to document their day-to-day lives and this is bar none, one of the funniest comedies I've seen in years! Helmed by the warped minds of Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi, who also star as two of the vampires, their brand of absurdist black comedy and sight gags had me absolutely dying and it's a shame this film is so underrated. There isn't exactly a plot per se, more like a string of hilarious vignettes as we follow the vampires' attempts to go clubbing (which they can't do unless they are invited inside), their rivalry with a gang of werewolves (which are easily the funniest scenes), and of course, feeding on human blood. The improv skills and chemistry the cast has with one another comes across so genuine you'll swear they really are these characters and their deadpan delivery had me in stitches. There really isn't too much more to say as it's impossible to describe just how funny and in-the-pocket this film was without seeing it for yourself, but you will need to have a pretty twisted/dark sense of humour; we are dealing with vampires here after all!",

But for now...)Normally, Lily lives with her mother and stepfather but they are going to a conference in Australia for three months, so she is put in the care of Daniel(Sandor Zsoter), her father, a meat inspector. Not only is he less than thrilled at this, but his reluctance is added to by her dog Hagen being included as part of the package. And then one of Daniel's neighbors rats him out to the authorities for having an unlicensed dog on the premises.In dramatic visual fashion, \"White God\" makes two points well. 1. Always be kind towards your pet.(For Lili, Hagen is her anchor during a traumatic time.) 2. Have your kids learn how to play the trumpet.(My nephew is learning, so I'm good.) That's as well as exploring what appears to be the contentious issue of mixed breed dogs in Hungary today. Otherwise, the movie lacks consistency at points, not only due to its being parts neo-realism, straight up horror and hints of science fiction, but also due to one major character reversal that comes without warning.",

I don't think the movie decided, and it certainly didn't inspire me enough to decide either. It seems to be a little of everything-a love story, a coming of age story, a fable, a metaphor for revolution, a horror film, a novelty dog movie- which would be okay if it had a point to tie all of these things together. Instead, you have a movie thats not only open ended in what it whats to be, but open ended in how you should interpret it. There's too many threads to follow, and all of them seem half baked. I get the sense Mundrucz� just had a series of images he thought were striking- re: riding a bike in heels along an abandoned bridge, an army of dogs laying down in surrender to music- and just shot the film from there, figuring he'll come up wit the rest as they go. At least the movie is visually striking, and dogs are so wonderfully expressive you really can't go wrong. I just wish he had a stronger point to it all, especially when the dog is the most compelling 'actor' in the movie.",

      "review": "  Quite possibly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I was disappointed that critics gave this such a high approval rating. I love foreign/indy films, but this one got really absurd in the story line. After 2 hours, I as so disappointed at where the story was going as none of the actions were even close to plausible or attainable by the dogs given all we knew about Hagen (a dog that could not find it's way home when originally abandoned). Sadly, the scenes with Hagen are some of the best, but it gets old and the brooding daughter was just too much after a time. Don't waste you money.",

      "review": "  I had heard great things about Korn�l Mundrucz�'s canine entwined drama. It has a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and the poster even endorses it as \"Masterful.\" So, it came as quite a surprise when not long into proceedings did I realise that this was going to be a massive disappointment.Firstly, the acting is bang average. Talk of powerful performances are, for me, shot down immediately. They're not awful, they're just not great. Zs�fia Psotta's Lili is largely a sullen and wooden character that is hard to find any sympathy with. Some of the supporting performances, however, are just plain bad.The best performances certainly come from the dogs. Much praise has to be given to the trainers in getting some fine scenes put together with such a large number of dogs, especially the two playing our furry protagonist Hagen.It's Hagen's journey we follow and what we get is basically an RSPCA horror story. The abandoned dog is put through the mill; lost, confused, hungry, used and abused. The story tries to mirror his predicament with his loving teenage owner (Lili), who herself is lost in uncertain surroundings and at times used by others. It's an unfocused plot that strings together more bewildering and unintentionally amusing scenes than credible ones.There are a few scenes and images that are genuinely striking and memorable. From the opening chase, to difficult scenes of dog fighting and the final \"poster shot\" Mundrucz� shows he has an eye for beautiful imagery. It is however a very inconsistent directorial effort, veering in tone and control.As we meander into the final half-hour, any shreds of seriousness are lost as the film sprints into absurd B-movie territory. All of a sudden we're fed a mess of action, gore and laughable dialogue that is more befitting a bad zombie film. We don't even learn anything...unless they;re trying to tell us a rabid pack of dogs can be controlled by a trumpet.There's a threadbare moral among this fable. What it is is unclear. Themes of underdogs, minorities, youth and ultimately how they are treated in society are there; they're just not explored in any great detail. There's a time for subtlety, but it's lost in the unfolding ridiculousness.Overall, a huge disappointment. A handful of wonderfully shot scenes and images that befit a fantasy fable that are otherwise strung together by an absurd and inconsistent narrative.",

      "review": "  Animal lovers beware. So when a young girl (Zs�fia Psotta) goes to live with her dad (S�ndor Zs�t�r), she takes her dog with her. Her father sets the dog loose on the streets after a fight, and then she goes about trying to find it. But this isn't a story that is just told from the girl's point of view, the dog is a lead character, and the horrors that it experiences lead to something unlike anything you have ever seen before. This is a high quality film, but I will start this off by letting you know: if you have problems with animal cruelty, this is not the movie for you. Everybody has their buttons as far as what they don't like seeing, and this is a big one for a number of people that I know. I wouldn't necessarily label it as a button for me, but I certainly loathe seeing it in real life and on film, which makes this a really good movie that I'm not likely to get a lot of replay value out of. There's a lot going on with White God, and while you think you may be getting one thing, it ends up turning into something else all together. While you do get invested in the relationship between this girl and her dog as it is the crux of the film, you also get a lot out of the stilted relationship between her and her father. You think you may be getting this simple sad story about this girl having to learn that it is time to grow up, but you can't forget: this dog is actually the lead character, and it's his story. Every time a new person comes near this animal, you get nervous instantly because you have no idea what this newcomer's intentions could be, but you're certain that they are sordid. You want this dog to be able to hold on to its humanity (so to speak) and I honestly can't remember the last time I cared this much about the outcome for an onscreen pet. If there were awards given for dogs, this one would win an Oscar, and you buy not only the interactions between him and humans, but also that he can fully and effectively communicate with other dogs. It goes without saying that this is hard to watch, and there isn't a spot of sugar coating to be found anywhere on this. I don't know the ethics behind making this (this is Hungarian, so I don't know if the animal laws are enforced differently), but I can only hope that no animals were harmed during the making of this film. If you can stomach the painful animal cruelty, there is a great movie to be found here, and when you get to the finale, that is where White God shines the brightest by doing something highly unique. With great music and quality performances, it's a great movie that I find it difficult to recommend.",

I don't think the movie decided, and it certainly didn't inspire me enough to decide either. It seems to be a little of everything-a love story, a coming of age story, a fable, a metaphor for revolution, a horror film, a novelty dog movie- which would be okay if it had a point to tie all of these things together. Instead, you have a movie thats not only open ended in what it whats to be, but open ended in how you should interpret it. There's too many threads to follow, and all of them seem half baked. I get the sense Mundrucz� just had a series of images he thought were striking- re: riding a bike in heels along an abandoned bridge, an army of dogs laying down in surrender to music- and just shot the film from there, figuring he'll come up wit the rest as they go. At least the movie is visually striking, and dogs are so wonderfully expressive you really can't go wrong. I just wish he had a stronger point to it all, especially when the dog is the most compelling 'actor' in the movie.",

      "review": "  I had heard great things about Korn�l Mundrucz�'s canine entwined drama. It has a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and the poster even endorses it as \"Masterful.\" So, it came as quite a surprise when not long into proceedings did I realise that this was going to be a massive disappointment.Firstly, the acting is bang average. Talk of powerful performances are, for me, shot down immediately. They're not awful, they're just not great. Zs�fia Psotta's Lili is largely a sullen and wooden character that is hard to find any sympathy with. Some of the supporting performances, however, are just plain bad.The best performances certainly come from the dogs. Much praise has to be given to the trainers in getting some fine scenes put together with such a large number of dogs, especially the two playing our furry protagonist Hagen.It's Hagen's journey we follow and what we get is basically an RSPCA horror story. The abandoned dog is put through the mill; lost, confused, hungry, used and abused. The story tries to mirror his predicament with his loving teenage owner (Lili), who herself is lost in uncertain surroundings and at times used by others. It's an unfocused plot that strings together more bewildering and unintentionally amusing scenes than credible ones.There are a few scenes and images that are genuinely striking and memorable. From the opening chase, to difficult scenes of dog fighting and the final \"poster shot\" Mundrucz� shows he has an eye for beautiful imagery. It is however a very inconsistent directorial effort, veering in tone and control.As we meander into the final half-hour, any shreds of seriousness are lost as the film sprints into absurd B-movie territory. All of a sudden we're fed a mess of action, gore and laughable dialogue that is more befitting a bad zombie film. We don't even learn anything...unless they;re trying to tell us a rabid pack of dogs can be controlled by a trumpet.There's a threadbare moral among this fable. What it is is unclear. Themes of underdogs, minorities, youth and ultimately how they are treated in society are there; they're just not explored in any great detail. There's a time for subtlety, but it's lost in the unfolding ridiculousness.Overall, a huge disappointment. A handful of wonderfully shot scenes and images that befit a fantasy fable that are otherwise strung together by an absurd and inconsistent narrative.",

There is cruelty: dog fighting (remember Michael Vick) and abuse, and tenderness. The young actress, Zs�fia Psotta, was the perfect cast for the part. I don't think I can recommend it, but it sure made an impression on me.",

      "review": "  While it is certainly true that movies have been accused and not without good cause of misleading audiences, \"Wild Tales\" delivers on its promise with its six short movies about revenge that while wickedly fun also do so with more than the normal amount of ambiguity. That starts off with perhaps the best pre-credits sequence ever that also makes a great case for never getting on another airplane. Unless I'm mistaken, there is not a gun in the entire movie. Instead, there are cars, with three of the segments being centered around them, an Audi, Chevy and BMW respectively. For the record, that's not product placement. Rather, it represents different economic strata of society.On the other hand, maybe the fourth and fifth segments do not work as well as the rest. But the fourth one has the great Ricardo Darin in it, so there's that. And while I just saw the latter scenario play out again on a television series, there are still a couple of twists to keep this version fresh.And then \"Wild Tales\" ends on an up note with a wild and frenzied wedding reception that hinges on a massive dose of jealousy.",

      "review": "  DON'T CRY FOR ME, ANTOLOG�A - My Review of WILD TALES (4 Stars)Argentina's Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominee for 2014 is an audacious, edgy, hilarious collection of 6 short films by writer/director Dami�n Szifron called WILD TALES. While none are directly linked to each other, this group of short stories seems to share similar themes of rage and revenge and of people caught during their most stressful moments. Its opening credits alone, a series of wildlife stills indicates we're about to experience behavior of the basest levels. We follow people on a plane, in a diner, on the road, at a towing facility, after an accidental hit & run, and at the world's most insane wedding reception ever and I spent a good half of the time with my hand over my mouth trying to suppress either laughter or an \"Oh no they didn't!\". It's almost impossible to discuss this film without mild spoilers, but I'll do my best not to reveal anything too specifically.The film opens with its shortest tale, a group of passengers on board a plane who quickly discover something diabolical is afoot. It ends with a gasp-inducing freeze frame you won't soon forget. It deftly sets the stage for the sick and twisted stories to follow, all displaying varying degrees of anger at the world and the terrible luck so many suffer. Shot with great muscularity by cinematographer Javier Julia, and infused with a wonderful nihilistic sensibility, each segment has its own style, and I felt like I was experiencing a great Coen Brothers film at every assured turn. In a secluded diner on a rainy night, a server finds her sole customer to be an arch enemy from her past. Goaded on by her increasingly sadistic co-worker (memorably and hilariously played by Rita Cortese), this revenge fantasy simultaneously raises the dramatic stakes while playing off our distaste for awful, entitled customers and slow-moving service people. I loved how quickly one character wanted to murder another simply based on another person's recounting of past events, a perfect encapsulation of our too-quick-to-judge, don't believe everything you read on Facebook culture. From there we're racing along a desert road as a handsome, well-to-do driver (Leonardo Sbaraglia, who first came to my attention in the film BURNT MONEY) gets stuck behind a slow-moving and weaving vehicle. His ill-advised choice to yell at the man leads to a face-off which redefines taking things too far even by Tex Avery standards. Imagine Steven Spielberg's DUEL cranked up to mythical proportions. It's in this segment where every single shot meant something, with the camera put in just the right place, and the editing and writing ratcheting up the tension with perfect, inevitable ease. Clearly final shots mean something to Szifron, and it's in this story where his last moment adds an extra, juicy layer to the storytelling. Next, one of Argentina's most famous actors, Ricardo Dar�n (THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES), expertly mines every moment of his put-upon sad sack who naively takes on the system after getting towed. What makes this segment sing is the fact that his character is set-up as a man addicted to causing drama. I found my loyalties shifting constantly from his p.o.v. to those of the bureaucrats he torments. Again, every moment counts, from the initial set-up at a construction site to its homage to TAXI DRIVER. The film continues with an unfortunate hit-and-run accident perpetrated by the son of a wealthy man (a great slow-burn by Oscar Mart�nez), who keeps making one ill-advised decision after another in an attempt to make the situation go away. This story exposes the never-ending levels of corruption and greed, placing a sad, lower class patsy into the mix (a terrific Germ�n de Silva) to remind us how stuck the 99% often feel in their lives. Knowing full well that no good can come from this situation, Szifron ends this tale with abrupt and off-camera sounds, putting just the right capper on its hopelessness. Finally, a wedding reception from hell ends the film on a funny yet disturbing note as a cheating groom played by Diego Gentile (clearly Argentina's answer to Bradley Cooper) faces off against his distraught bride (Erica Rivas, explosively going past any semblance of sanity). Their performances are electric, and I wasn't surprised to discover that nearly the entire cast received nominations from Argentina's version of the Oscars. The jealously and rage of our newlyweds keeps boiling over, ending (here we are again with Szifron's mastery of final shots) on an image combining sex and messiness. It's a perfect way to summarize the experience of this thoroughly entertaining, not-to-be-missed film.",

I must say I'm not a big fan of anthology films (also not a fan of reading short stories, though I love reading books), but Wild Tales is one of the very rare ones that I thought was really good. One of the major reasons most anthology films don't work for me is that most of the time, even if there's a few good sequences, there's usually one or two weaker stories that are there to just pad the time. Wild Tales luckily isn't like that, while one or two of the stories may feel \"lesser\" than the others, they are still good on their own and because of either runtime or subject they just may feel a little slighter.",

This could be the easy way to explain the film Dami�n Szifr�n \"Wild Tales\". Following the footsteps of famous directors like Robert Altman with Short Cuts and Paris, je t'aime with the directors: Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen, Walters Salles, Alfonzo Cuar�n, Wes Crave and Alexander Payne.Wild Tales is a collection of 6 short films compiled in a single film. Every stories doesn't have a particular connection from each other, but the relationship of success, failure, death, revenge, love and life, is present and should be the crucial link from each tale that you see on film.With Argentinian all stars such as Ricardo Dar�n (The Secret in Their Eyes and Nine Queens) Dar�o Grandinetti ( The Dark side of the heart) Leonardo Sbaraglia (Cenizas del Paraiso) is just a few of the actors who bring to life the stories: -Pasternak the story of a disappointed human being who finds the revenge by get rid of everyone who hurt him. -The Rats The story of a waitress revenge against the responsible of her family demise. -The Strongest The story of two drivers who clash till the end to see who is the bravest.-Little Bomb the story of a explosive specialist haunting unfairness in the daily life system.-The Proposal: A hit and run will turn into a greedy fight for money.-Until death do us part a wedding turn into a bloody warThere is no much to say about this film, is masterful with a very dark humor and realistic situations that appeal to everyone who wanted to fight the system and find meaning to daily conflicts in daily life.Pedro Almodovar produce this instant classic, Gustavo Santaloalla delivers a beautiful score and Javier Juli� create a wonderful cinematography inspired in the look of several films.",

      "review": "  Argentina's submission for the Best Foreign Language film Oscar race lives up to its title. This wicked and funny farce about revenge and the extremes of human behavior is fierce and ferocious. Writer-director Damian Szifron has not made one single film. Wild Tales is six films, all stitched together under one title. Some audiences may not be able to handle it. Oh well.Take the opening vignette, 'Pasternak', set on a jet in which the passengers all realize they've wronged the same man, named Pasternak, in one way or another. No fair spoiling the surprise, but it's a story as gonzo-crazy as anything ever dreamed up by Pedro Almodovar, who serves as a co-producer.Things get darker in 'The Rats' where a waitress (Julietta Zylberberg) finds herself serving the criminal who drove her father to suicide. In 'Road To Hell', a stuffy driver insults a redneck. And then there's 'Bombita' starring Ricardo Darin, Argentina's biggest star, is a demolition engineer who must contend with a towing service and the DMV. It's a lot more riveting and wild than it sounds.'The Deal' has fewer laughs, a story in which a rich man attempts to pay off a gardener to take the fall for his hit-and-run on his own bratty son. But it's the final story that really ignites. That would be 'Till Death Do Us Part', set at a Jewish wedding where the bride (Erica Rivas, amazing) takes revenge on her cheating groom (Diego Gentile), turning the whole party into a gladiator match. You'll be laughing till it hurts, which is of course the point. Filmmaking is seldom such a breath of fresh air like Wild Tales.",

      "review": "  Wild is the right word for this anthology of savage scenes from contemporary life. It takes place in Argentina, but with the exception of a few logistical references and the language, these tales could occur in New York, London, Madrid, nearly anyplace where people are angry at their loss of control. This is an angry film disguised as a comedy, very dark comedy that makes you laugh while squirming at the violence, rudeness, injustice, pride -- well, there you have it, the seven deadly sins. Produced by Pedro Almodovar and his brother, it's easy to see the lineage, especially in Szifron's visual style and use of music, both of which contribute to the joyride rush of these stories.",

None of the character cross over and each story is quite different in narrative however each is darkly comic and wonderfully played. Packing in one story before the opening credits sets the mood nicely and the rest of the tales unfold over about 20 minutes a piece. There isn't really a weak link in the chain though I did particularly enjoy the third segment which is a cautionary tale about the male ego and road rage. Damian Szifron has written and directed six lusciously dark gems which was a real, wicked, delight to watch",

It is actually quite amazing how much character depth and plotdevelopment Szifr�n crams into each 15-20 minute story. The sharp, edgy plots and solid direction are aided by a cast thatdoesn't put a foot wrong.Goes to show you don't need 90+ minutes to tell a good tale. For thesame time you can get six!",
