9af5724a-86e0-41b4-9103-9a2947f14196	  George Miller unleashes a feverish, ferocious film and it's an intense wild ride. Acrobatic "Mad Max: Fury Road" is thrilling and treats the audience to some astonishing action sequences. But the action doesn't dull the emotional impact and that's mainly due to Charlize Theron's fierce performance."Mad Max: Fury Road" is a ride worth taking. Wall-to-wall pumped-up adrenalized fun, it's ridiculously good.	2
6e7dd5de-fd56-4994-9205-d4d751f94d4b	  A glorious symphonic ballet of wanton destruction whose visual poetry dazzles and amazes. Whereas the current popular political correctness deems all life as precious, this weekend jaunt through the local park with the baby in the stroller yells to differ (reminding one of exactly what planet one dwells on). Standing ovation for George Miller, whose charming eloquence about the well hidden truth of modern society is jaw-droppingly stunning. The best apocalyptic vision seen for some time.	2
57aabbb4-c4d4-4f95-bab8-1f807cb123c4	  Its possibly one of the greatest action movies ever made. A mind-blowing visual feast for the eyes and ears with spectacular action sequences, fights and chases. Tom Hardy is a man of few words but delivering none the less and giving a strong performance showing he is more than a worthy replacement for Mel Gibson. It also provides plenty of strong female characters as well, Charlize Theron is pure power. Its The Fast and the Furious in ways only The Expendables can imagine. It's pure mad-man brilliance from a fine artist in fine form. Director, George Miller rocks this film with is gorgeous and explosive vision. An action movie masterpiece that will blow you away.	2
6c91c275-9723-4265-8420-a98c9ec5babd	  George Miller's long-awaited sequel is grandiose in scale of action-sequences overall, and it is marvelous to say the least. Mad Max: Fury Road is an exhilarating-overdose of monumental thrills and sound. The film's post-apocalyptic feel is stronger and the performances are impressive, especially Charlize Theron. It also has enough of a concise story to make this one of Miller's most exceptional works and one of the best summer blockbusters, let alone overall films, of the year. 4.5/5	2
4b5e808d-f775-4cb3-ab1f-4dae54441850	  The post-apocalyptic film can be hit or miss, but Mad Max: Fury Road has some of the best action and chase scenes put on film in the 21st century. Tom Hardy is a breakthrough action star to go along with his recent success as a dramatic actor. He's going to win an Oscar at some point. George Miller writes and directs this film as well as anyone, even at 70. I love it when women overshadow men in the action scenes!	2
2eb7a330-e3a4-45b5-9e1a-aead6b3cdd81	  "A Decent Action Movie, But I Think They Had Missed""The Essence Of What Made The Original Ones Great."***Film Making Isn't Trying To Make Action Films Realistic But Rather More Like A Parody... & If You're From The Millennial Generation You Will Probably Prefer This Film More Than The Original Mad Max Films That Were Done With Real Stunt Men Doing Real Heavy Duty Stunts; Not Computer Generated Jinn-Joint Stunts.	1
0cb7c4f2-d7de-4d1c-94b7-a356a7725be3	  One of my favorite movies of this year, and possibly of all time!!! This movie was stylistically and visually beautiful. There was some really great world-building in this movie, and I love the subtly incorporated Viking/Nordic cultural influences in the Mad Max post-apocalyptic universe. I actually wasn't a huge fan of Tom Hardy, and likewise was also not blown away by Charlize Theron or any of the other acting in this movie. However, this movie was so beautiful, I couldn't resist giving this movie a resounding 5/5 stars!	2
414ff708-f747-4e2e-ab34-ddcc564979dc	  As far as action films go, this is hands down one of the best of all time in my book. Nothing can amount to the fast-paced action. And for today's standards, with so many companies relying on cgi stuff, it is amazing to see a director/film finally taking the bold step to make an action film the good ole fashioned way, with real stunts and actors. George Miller really knocked this one out of the park. Not to mention a great performance by Hardy & Theron.	2
d4a9bf3c-0904-4d07-a9cc-6ea81c4192df	  I simply do NOT understand how the audience score is this high.... The movie was extremely monotonous, had little to no story, and I truly felt dumber for having watched it.... I liked the original Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome, not so much, but it was still head and shoulders above this one.... It is visually amazing, no question. But there was no story and dialog was barely above grunting...	0
204715f1-65df-4d4f-b6de-5028b9170d51	  In our modern world of CGI trash, a masterpiece has come has come forth. This movie uses epic visuals that are shire kickassery. That's all i can say. You cant help but noticing of the originality in this post apocalyptic world. It was so in depth that it reminds me of Tolkien. That's saying a lot. I mean seriously, he would write short novels about a stupid sword. I LOVED every aspect of this movie and hope George Miller has more to come!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2
ceda2c37-d725-4a92-993f-f524f8f1bf01	  Although quite grotesque in it's style and imagery - something I rarely like - in cinematographic and storytelling terms, it's highly refined.I did not like it at first, the introduction fell flat with me, some scenes felt sped-up and it was just weird. I also felt that the world felt absurd and comic-y, and indeed it is. The film does not shy away from this fact, it actually embraces it.The characters felt real and their motivations felt real enough for me to eventually be drawn in, despite the absurdity of the setting.And this, I can respect.Yes, it had some gruesome scenes of violence, but it didn't focus on them.This was my first Mad Max film, I assume the flashbacks/hallucinations somehow connect to the previous films. Happily, they weren't overused and the plot didn't hinge entirely upon them, so even a newb like me can enjoy this film.	2
073bcf33-0871-4b08-af30-698bf9c4de92	  Another sign the Apocalypse has (literally) descended upon the Motion Picture Academy: Mad Max: Fury Road gets 10 Oscar nominations, including a Best Picture. I'm sorry but did they see the same film I did?! It was Fast and Furious in fright wigs and KISS makeup! And the only acting was Charlize Theron with one arm and a shaved head snarling at everybody. Of all the great films to come out of Australia over the last 40 years and they pick this?!! With profound apologies to Trumbo, Steve Jobs, The Danish Girl and especially Straight Out of Compton, this is just piss poor entertainment politics. (Come back "Doomsday" all is forgiven!)	0
14593933-2115-4588-bb10-88f24e1c30e1	  Shockingly bad- particularly considering the attention it's getting. The characters are thin and barely have a believable moment. The acting is good for the most part- it's the writing, the dialogue, and ultimately the directing. The story arc is simple- not necessarily a bad thing in an action movie- but the actions of virtually every character is so far off the believability track it quickly becomes a jumbled mess. The director was more obviously more interested in creating a visually stunning string of intense scenes than a good story. Should have been cut down to a seven minute music video.	0
26bb5e6e-948c-4c22-916e-0a7807c77fd8	  This movie was one of the best hard action movies of all time. Yes very entertaining but never failing to teach lessons on issues such as global warming, depleting world resources, greed, exploitation and poverty, religion, roles of women ect. The movie itself was physically creative and original. It was a road traveled with constant anxiety and wonder with pleasing surprises. And although it barely reaches emotional it is unforgettable.	2
fad5f1ef-428a-4b3c-a9fd-b3c245ddae47	  Quoting Vince Carter after his second dunk in his All Star Dunk contest: IT'S OVER! IT'S OVER! Best action movie of the year! *UPDATED* Best movie of the year! I've seen the movie seven times on big screen because I know that it won't replicated anywhere, this is probably the only film that I appreciate all of the non-action sequences because the action are so mind-blowing and spectacular that I felt it melted my face afterwards, I think I hurt my jaw after watching this film.	2
282bb974-5ae3-480a-ad5b-78bea2bf55b4	  The first mad max film I have seen, it was phenomenal. Action packed with brutal violence and display of a post apocalyptic world. Thrilling all the way through. It sparked my interest in the franchise causing me to see the other movies. While enjoyable this film captured the title as one of my favorite action movies. I recommend this to anyone in search of a film with brutality on the scale of Mad Max Fury Road.	2
ed3d226b-7f17-456a-b4d1-0b4eef5a374b	  97% certified fresh rating? Are you serious? Visuals are good, not great. Cinematography is nice. I can't even say this film had to be acted all that well because it's secondary to the action sequences and Maxes grunts which I guess is also part of the action cause it definitely isn't part of the dialogue. Having Charlize didn't hurt. No story. A mind numbing ride without too much effort required by any of the actors to portray anything other than shock, fear, dismay and hope. Well at least I am able to narrow down my list of potential critics to follow from 333 to 10. Abysmal.	0
4baaa25c-1597-4d64-bb69-08db64e12447	  I finally got to watch this much hyped and praised action flick after six months of being released and...... I liked it. I was expecting the second coming of Christ and all I got was a fun action movie that plays it safe on narration, but puts some of the best practical stunts on screen. I guess I'm supposed to let the paper thin characters and weak villain pass? I can do that.	1
eae04754-edbd-406b-ae69-f9b8cf0458a1	  Oh, what a movie. What a lovely movie! ;-)Best viewed in the widest screen possible in the biggest bad ass speakers you can find at full blast, it will take you to an adrenaline filled journey orchestrated by a visionary conductor/director with strong doses of humour and poetry alike. Stunts, costumes and cinematography are out of this world. If there is one action story to watch this year, this is definitely it.	2
e039870a-52da-4f89-948a-2d1d2d271496	  Action ? Yes. Visuals ? Sure. Scenario ? Not so much.I struggled to watch this in its entirety. The first 30 minutes set the tone perfectly : do not expect any coherence, depth of characters or, well, anything other than full in-you-face action here. Nothing stands up to scrutiny, no character holds up to any real logic, and of course it has nothing to do with the first movies of the same franchise.Let it be noted that Charlize Theron is the real main character here, and plays her part with talent and charisma, which sorely lack in Tom Hardy.	0
985b6244-a869-41fc-932a-1a0cfe27be5c	  As a fan of the original Mad Max trilogy, I was hesitant to watch this one as there was an American input to an Australian classic, but realizing George Miller was at the helm, I gave in and was happy I did. Tom Hardy did the role justice, but wasn't as good as Mel Gibson, and unlike most of the other reviewers I wasn't overly impressed with Theron. The hit is George Miller's vision of what an action movie should be, so I can recommend this one to all Mad Max fans	2
156cdcb4-39cf-4713-86e2-d8b7e5c9a3e7	  Wow...still trying to process everything I just saw. Pretty sure there were a few scenes I didn't even blink because so much insane stuff was happening all at once. Did I understand everything that was going on? Not really...but at least it looked pretty. Funny thing is Mad Max really feels like he's barely in the movie, but you won't even care because Charlize Theron is really the star of the movie and she kills it.	2
87805971-438d-4c44-882c-030be9daef98	  I'm not a gore for gore's sake kind of viewer, but being old school... Mad Max back in the day was one of the goriest movies out there. THIS Mad Max really doesn't have a drop of blood in it. A lot of "crash. boom, bam" but nothing really at stake. If you are expecting to see the old gritty, hardcore Mad Max where death, rape, and dismemberment are just around the corner... you are not going to find it here. If you want another homogenized 21st century type "action" film, it's worth a look.	1

994fd3c3-f06a-43e6-9303-3814cdea5d1f	  WHAT A DAY WHAT A LOVELY DAY INDEED!!! My god!!! This film kicked my ass!!! This is what action films have been sorely missing for the past ten years or so. Imagine if a 12 year old kid circa 1984 got hold of a lot of black tar heroin and fireworks and decided to make a movie but this time with a bigger budget. This film is great, with some of the best action films ever put to celluloid, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are both terrific as the leads and the film never slows down. This is one of the best films so far of 2015 and one of the best of the last several years. Also can we please get that guitar flamethrower dude in more movies please. We seeing this movie pour yourself a cup of gasoline induced goodness cause this is one of the best films of the year.	2
9b23300a-77ea-49be-b91c-52c72c7c5518	  One of the most awaited films this year. I've seen the old film series lately as a warm up, and they where quite good to be honest.This film is even more intense and filled with effects and actions. You get some breaks from the action and the pretty good story makes it whole. The actors are solid but again - this is all about the action. I really dug that guitarist - funny, clever and original.8 out of 10 sips of mothers milk.	2
b8ce5ff7-6ea4-48e0-bd48-4c688441ebbe	  There is no question; this thoroughly modern Max is an extremely entertaining synthesis of mess and noise. The antidote to the onslaught of comic book superheroes and vigilantes of the last few years was anti-hero Max... or so we thought. Director George Miller subverted all our expectations of this film, from tweaking the gender roles in action films to astronomical production aesthetics. Few directors have the tenacity to unleash the kind of physical carnage Miller splashes across the screen here. You'll barely have a second to breathe as he seamlessly shifts from one insane set piece to another, ratcheting up the stakes and assembling his meticulous symphony of carnage with the combined result being one of the most successfully ambitious action extravaganzas committed to film.	2
641efd84-00bb-476b-9886-ab9829c9982d	  If the first two films of the post-apocalyptic Mad Max saga, became indispensable cult films, and entered through the front door of the big productions unfit for cardiac history. Then Mad Max Fury Road with Mr. Miller, over the years in this wasteland will be finally received into the very gates of Valhalla. And there will be revered as a hero, who made a spectacular masterpiece on human decadence and ultimate redemption, as the true artisan director of those car chases outputs of your own nightmares, and for bringing maximum glory a work 25 years of dedication and sacrifice. These unique virtues it goes without saying that scarce in the film pretentious and empty action today !!	2
35ac6a41-70be-4918-8cc1-8ca742f274d6	  It's been 30 years since Max left us in the big screen. Now he comes back with a new actor portraying the lone wolf from Mel Gibson in which he had established 36 years ago. While the film may look like Furiosa's story, Max's character holds on his own and shows that there are men who do selfless things without any thought of reward, nothing but the silent respect that women should give and acknowledge. And when you do, they're gone...going their own way.	2
b74cdbb5-879a-4b4f-94c7-92efc2ee3bf8	  What can I say? As far as pure, technical achievement goes, not many films can live up to the heights of this Mad Max entry. The complexity of its action scenes and their individual, often awe-inspiring shots alone aren't the film's only attributes, however. Making beautiful use color in its dessert landscapes, incredible locale and vehicle design, and a perfect use of pacing -- especially in the kinetic energy of action scenes -- director George Miller and his team create something that doesn't really come along often. As much praise as other "artistic" action films like The Dark Knight receive, that example doesn't even come close to the skill on display in the conception and editing of Max's set pieces. It's light on story, but sometimes a film can be almost perfect without one. Sometimes.	2
cdc3d4f1-0ffc-4a1b-9897-87ae7ad615a5	  To call Mad Max: Fury Road incredible would be an understatement! From a badass cast of characters led by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, to amazing visuals and practical stunt work, all the way to masterful, energetic, and visionary direction from 70 year-old George Miller! This is not only a perfect action film, but a perfect film all around! If you love action movies or simply love movies in general, it is your DUTY to see Mad Max: Fury Road!! 5 out of 5 Stars!	2
130235a0-ab29-4797-9293-f5c080b712d1	  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Some nice special effects, but such a lack of story line that if i hadn't been with friends i would have walked out of the movie theatre. Charlize Theron like always was an amazing actress, and Tom Hardy fulfilled his role, but they could be out doing much better movies, their performance id the only thing that occasionally made this movie watchable. But please don't waste your precious time on this, it is a pointless, senseless jumble of special effects.	0
8421459b-4ab6-481d-a39a-3cb9c1d5de57	  "If you can't fix what's broken, you'll go insane". This line represents the theme of the entire film and the entire series. Max is a loner running from his past, who eventually finds his humanity again by helping others. Perfect. This film is one of the best of the year. And one of the most breathtaking action flicks in even longer. Definitely a contender for Best Picture, in my opinion.	2
5fdf7890-f016-491c-b9d7-498d1dd74cd0	  This movie was the shiittest thing i have ever seen it is designed fir fucking bogans who enjoy cars and electric guitars, there is absoulutly nothiung appealing about this movie why anyone would want to watch this shit movie with a very weak plot baffles me. If you enjoyed this movie adn or recommend it to others please hang your self. if i coukd negitivly rate this movie i would. Why the fuck would i want to watch 2 hours of ugly bald pale looking pricks drive cars and listen to heavy metal music. i would rather tie a rubber band arpond my ballsack until it falls off and then choke my self with my own testicles. This movie is very poor and i have no clue as to why it is the best movie of 2015.	0
46935b35-341b-4bc1-937a-e982fdebc2f2	  Very intense chase scenes that actually could happen based on physics but they are totally silly based on common sense, but overall, totally entertaining! Who knows why the world has become so bizare as betrayed in this flic, certainly not me as not much is explained about ANYTHING but it looks and sounds great. Just a little more back story and it gets 5 stars but well worth the visceral experience wehn viewed in a subwoofer sound environment. Just a few too many buts...	2
fccb4b31-e124-414d-ab9d-e04349efd18b	  What a stinker, where is Mel when u need him. They give one of Hollywood's great beauties a stump for an arm. This movie was perfect for a 15 yo male, with no discrimanatory taste. The male lead looked fat, angry, ugly, like he forgot his lines, in different scenes, no acting ability combined with poor direction. I'll bet most of the peeps who watched this never saw the original.	0
0c141fd8-ea55-4bf1-aa9c-eb15a4c6cf82	  Though the action was relentless throughout, the first hour was a little difficult to follow as the dialogue is kept very much to a minimum. The film is essentially a two hour chase movie and because of its basic premise, it was a little too long. Its gender politics is something James Bond could learn from and Tom Hardy is brilliant despite his few lines with his body language alone. The post-apocalyptic world is well made and you can almost smell the petrol but for the most part Mad Max is very loud, bit too long and occasionally listless.	1
e53be022-d49d-4c93-af2f-f934ef1c70eb	  Perhaps not quite as entertaining as The Road Warrior in my opinion, Fury Road is nonetheless a strong installment in George Miller's post-apocalyptic franchise. Despite pacing issues in certain areas and an average story, Mad Max Fury Road has gorgeous cinematography that never ceases to amaze throughout it's run time, insane action sequences coupled by gleefully bizarre characters, vehicles, weapons and clothing design. The performances are adequate as are the characters, and Fury Road is the epitome of a popcorn thrill ride.	2
1839f196-d2ef-4316-adbe-f8dc619e88c8	  A sequel worth waiting for. By any standard, this is an entertaining and exciting road movie, not dominated by CGI. Action sequences are so well choreographed; you want to see it again. They are filled with fresh ideas and audacity. There is not a boring moment. Tom Hardy's Mad Max is just as alluring too. Let's hope we do not need to wait another 30 years for the next one.	2
91aa180c-0792-4208-9728-dad2c62e3cb4	  Movie of the year. All Australians must see. More Australians in this movie then Western Sydney. The girls are the heroes so is you a feminist this is for you. For more fun check out the movie cast before watching the movie, surprised me, as the history is stunning. And yes Tom Hardy is a great replacement for Mel Gibson. Specially 2015 Mel Gibson. Not shitty like Thunderdome. Closer to MM 2. Watch on big screen with sound up loud. George Millers manipulation of the time frames in scenes makes the movie. You get to See movie, the action is not to fast for the eye. Great movie.	2
6f680a65-cbb2-4cdf-8a8b-80596907b29b	  One big, rage-fueled drive through a wasteland with no history and no explanation of the characters, this film fails of any drama. The characters are trying to survive a madman, but they have no story, no background, and no hope. Characters die meaninglessly, conventions of the universe are just dropped into the film with no explanation whatsoever, and the plot is indiscernible other than as a pointless fight to the death on a confusing wasteland for reasons that are known only to the characters and not to us.	0
55b9cd6a-8dc3-4b91-9ec0-688d827c677d	  I don't understand how this movie got such high ratings? I didn't understand anything I watched for 2 hours. Did I need to watch the first one from 1979??? I was 8 and don't remember anything from the movie except the car. What was the silver shit they were spraying in their mouths? Why were they using other people for blood transfusions? Cool special effects, but I still have no other idea what the movie was about.	0
fd0ba2e2-638e-4a4b-8e8f-c1bcc1853ccb	  If i had to define this movie in one word it would be "spectacle". Film is 100 years old and change, and in that time i have seen most every version of the car chase and fight, then mad max comes along and give you 2 hours of action you have never seen before. George Miller does a flawless job of creating and executing this set pieces as well as creating a unique and intriguing post apocalyptic world. This film has strong feminist undertones evening without a complicated plot. Several times the question is asked "who killed the world?" and its clear it wasn't the women. In a time of pretty wise cracking super heroes this throwback style seems so fresh. Possibly the best film of this year.	2
3092e979-398d-4b4d-b8c9-3a3103fdb499	  Exceptional! Tom Hardy strikes me as a wise and mature actor to know when to leave a steamrolling Charlize Theron have her head. She is as good as she's ever been in this. We know we're going to guess a lot of stuff before it happens, but how it happens and how it's filmed make this a thoroughly enjoyable romp, breathing a solid breath of gasoline fumes into the franchise. Boom!	2
531d6547-e822-44b6-ae11-d7316dcc8fa8	  The best description for this movie that I can come up with is that it's like a combination of Looney Tunes (Road Runner & Wily Coyote), Fast & Furious, and Mario Kart on STEROIDS! While the story and plot are very simplistic, the visual elements of Mad Max are all amazing to witness (WITNESS ME!). From the practical action sequences to the undeniably incredible production values and stellar acting, MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is definitely an over-the-top masterpiece.	2
f27cc9ae-a645-470b-b640-4dbcc257bcbf	  It is certainly a visual and aural feast and a stunt junkie's wet dream but without much else it does get a bit tiresome. There is very little character development and why it is called Mad Max is beyond me, he is practically a nothing character in this. There are a few interludes where characters take a breath to let us know why we should care about what is going on then off they go again and we realise we don't.	1
b0fc3ceb-49b2-45bb-bc52-afd653161ebe	  Mad Max Fury Road could quite possibly be the best film of 2015, it came out in May and I still have not seen anything better, and we are in November. The action is amazing, some of the best action sequences ever put to film. Furiosa is really the main character of this film as she drives the plot quite literally, Max really only says a few things the entire movie, he is still badass though. The practical effects are what make this movie worth seeing, they could have easily done these amazing action scenes with a computer but that would take away the immersion and this movie would not be what it was, the only drawback is that there is a time when the film really slows down and it gets kinda boring. 4.75/5	2
ed246846-bb63-4635-9b5d-c6f786edea8a	  I am a huge fan of Tom Hardy, he is a very talented actor that commands the screen and seems to be very versatile, however because once again he goes through the film grunting and mumbling I have had to know half a star off. At first I thought he was going to attempt an Aussie accent but soon went straight back into Bain. Nevertheless I do believe he controlled the screen well! The storyline itself was good, simple yet easy to relate and gave a good sense of morality. The main stand out element to this film was the superb special effects and stunts which has been one of the best I've seen within the last 10 years. The film itself knows exactly what it is and plays well upon it, high octane, none stop, balls out action! Contender for film of the year...please stop grunting Tom...	2
9c25da6a-92a8-4734-890f-3123e8830748	  One of the very best action films ever made, Fury Road is a testament to what all movies should strive to be: A medium so creative it transports us to places our minds couldn't even possibly conceive themselves. The post-apocalyptic world and society in the film is fascinating to examine, and the action sequences that take place within them will have audiences' collective jaws on the floor for the two hour non-stop thrill ride. A 21st century masterpiece.	2
9614c6a5-8a58-46d9-9bbc-c9c32771ee9c	  A glorious symphonic ballet of wanton destruction whose visual poetry dazzles and amazes. Whereas the current popular political correctness deems all life as precious, this weekend jaunt through the local park with the baby in the stroller yells to differ (reminding one of exactly what planet one dwells on). Standing ovation for George Miller, whose charming eloquence about the well hidden truth of modern society is jaw-droppingly stunning. The best apocalyptic vision seen for some time.	2
dfd57d41-187e-47a1-a215-cb54544ac814	  Really great visuals and really great action. Characters range from "meh" to good. Hardly anything that can be called a story. Sadly, doesn't live up to all the hype it's been given. It wasn't really meant to be much more than a really good action flick, but, at least for me, that can't make it a great film. At least not as good as I was led to believe.	1
c16010f8-0bdf-4ea9-b8f8-dc5410d23813	  If you're into nonstop action and gore, you'll love this critically acclaimed flick. I enjoyed George Miller's Fury Road as much as the next viewer, but I still couldn't help feeling a little empty based on the lack of actual involvement of the titular character. I get Charlize Theron's Furiosa is vital to the progression of the series, but I need more participation from Max. Nonetheless, it's a worthwhile watch. The coolest random bit of this summer was the flamethrowing guitar guy. Amazing stuff.	2
8b7fc5cb-19ef-48c2-9901-37edfa60bce5	  For a movie that's essentially one super-long chase scene (with pit stops), it packs a huge amount of narrative power. Character arcs are well-defined, histories are intriguingly hinted at, and the world-building is mind-boggling. And all this done in the midst of spectacular action sequences. But what strikes one the most is how ANGRY it is (as if the "Fury" in the title and character named "Furiosa" weren't obvious enough) - angry at the state of women in a destructive patriarchal society such as the world we live in. And that is the reason why this could very well be a game-changer.	2
a31f55f5-db6f-4ccd-9b23-a9e32277853c	  I was really looking forward to this film because it got such good reviews and a couple friends said how much they liked it. I thought that there wasn't really much of a story. It was just a lot of mind numbing action and explosions. All of that was really cool to watch, burt there wasn't much more to the film than that. I think the best thing about the film, that made it interesting to me, was the way in which it was filmed. Visually, it was a very unique and interesting film, and I I liked that aspect very much, but the story was pretty simple. I was expecting more.	1
19688a61-3ebb-4604-acb1-469d6ee5eae5	  THIS. This is an action movie. I hate action movies because the stories are often vapid. The story in Mad Max: Fury Road is meaningful, It's powerful. And it's matched only by the stunning cinematography. This movie is gorgeously shot and perfectly edited. Every action scene is natural. It isn't forced, even if there are some very choreographed scenes. It works. And considering the movement of the vehicles as these shots take place, it feels real. I'm sure there are some effects used, but the scale is epic and reminds me of the intensity of the chariot races in "Ben-Hur." Simply said, this movie is brilliant.	2
90ee209e-4913-4fa5-9f04-4d1d0cb1247e	  Mad Max: Fury Road is a visceral ride, featuring incredibly impressive action scenes, some surprisingly strong performances from TomHardy, Charlize Theron, and Nicholas Hoult, and achingly beautiful cinematography. While Inside Out is probably the strongest film of 2015 I've seen in cerebral heft, Fury Road will probably be higher on my fend of 2015 list act due to the fact that I can see myself revisiting this one many times. Verdict: A	2
66a4a326-8cdf-4377-b02a-7f3e2a71a9b8	  Upon watching The Road Warrior, I assumed that the rough-around-the-edges low-budget look to the whole affair was part of the charm (at least it looks like budgetary constraints to a modern audience). It turns out that the only thing holding The Road Warrior back was a huge pile of money and a light technological touch-up. Mad Max Fury Road uses The Road Warrior as a baseline and takes it to its natural conclusion, a riptide of cars, guns, and hellfire that starts thirty seconds in and keeps going for two hour straight. Its not without its missteps, and some of its flourishes fall flat, but overall, Miller has shown us exactly how good a post-apocalyptic joyride can be.	2
a5d3ef56-5d08-4e77-8a02-a995ccfc5ee4	  Lots of frenetic shots & explosions on roads. The only reason critics like this is because it's a mindless ultra-feminazi fantasy, with requisite white guilt pandering slavery parallels.I am utterly amazed at the overwhelmingly positive responses. Where was the story?? Did I miss it?If you want to see stuff blowing up for two hours straight and don't care about story or character development, then this is the movie for you. The guitar was cool & all, but that's not enough...even for me.	0
69a60f9c-fc63-4b02-b85f-093c82a170ce	  It's been years since I've left a movie only wanting to immediately turn back around and watch it again. Mad Max is essentially one long car chase, yet unlike most CGI summer action films Max never feels bloated or fake. Theron is the real star here, with Max along for the ride, but the film is stronger (and smarter) for it. Absolutely spectacular. One of the best action films so far this new century.	2
e3ea80a0-12fd-4d68-b414-1ccdd503ba05	  One of the best action movies I've seen. The visuals are outstanding. Tom Hardy continues to show his range as an actor. The only drawback for me on this movie is there was little in the way of downtime between the action for us to connect with the main characters. I would've liked to seen some more scenes involving Theron and Hardy to develop their chemistry. Overall though, wow, you'll have a tough time catching your breath..	2
9cedf555-cf0a-407c-9842-45e0a59881e7	  A masterclass of film making. This is an action film with the right blend of carefully handled character development. You are left to draw on your knowledge of Mad Max and his world to figure out how things stand. It doesn't lack for story at all - it simply doesn't spoonfeed you. I watched this a second time with my friend at the biggest IMAX in Europe, and I can safely say that it changed my outlook on action movies.So interesting to see the cyclical inspiration of Max Max > Borderlands > Mad Max too!	2
59b2bb5c-6ef6-4c3c-967e-26c7c7516954	  I enjoyed this crazy action film quite a bit. I liked how almost all of the action scenes were really filmed and very few involved CGI. It took a little to get into the film as I have never seen any of the previous Mad Max films, but for the most part it didn't have any effect on how much I liked this movie. I didn't see this film in theaters and I heard it was better in theaters and I believe it (if I would have seen it in theaters, I probably would have given it 4 stars instead of 3.5). It sounds like they were be making a sequel and if it's true, I'll try to see that one in theaters.	2
fcb10af3-b6e2-4f39-9643-41093e4cc3bc	  Fury Road is the rare movie that wastes nothing. Not a character, not a crazy vehicle, not a scene, not a single action is this film is done for no reason. Everything is put to absolute perfect use, as we watch amazing practical action play out in a visually cohesive way. But Miller doesn't let the audience get tired, he throws in scenes of tension, character, and emotional weight to round out the glorious apocalyptic spectacle. After watching it three times in three days, I loved it even more the last time.	2
e9c3f23b-a2cb-478b-8568-36dc904d772d	  An adrenaline filled thrill ride that is almost guaranteed to wow even the most passive movie-goer, Fury Road is filled with interesting characters, strong performances, beautiful visuals, and arguably some the greatest action in cinema history. The overall plot is pretty simple, it's basically an escort mission that you would find in a video game where you have to go from point A to point B, now on paper that doesn't sound too interesting, but the way the film tells its story through the combined use of impressive visuals, interesting characters, and strong non-verbal acting actually give this movie a level of complexity that many movies today lack.	2
1453c212-57f6-4b49-b19e-9b22e4128861	  2 hours of edge of your seat holy fucking shit amazing. Bring a friend, And if they don't want to come fuck em. Bring a couple of drinks and cheer your way through the chaos. I HAD A GREAT TIME!!! AND IT WAS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY!!If I had one criticism I feel like Charlize Theron should of showed up to the gig hungover and looking more like shit. She really didn't match the aura of the movie, A little more back story to her, Even a tease might of been good. But that wouldn't of quite matched her "I'm really unhappy with this hairstyle I just paid $200 for demeanour" AFAIK if shed been as rough as the movie was it could of been the best action movie of all time.	2
c5d7eadd-ab0d-4bcd-a7d4-88c598b2b753	  I watched Mad Max after having heard from nearly everywhere that it was one of the best action movie ever made, although the 2 hours was filled with very few dialogues and a lot of pursuits and violence. I don't know actually what to say on the topic, because the world in which the action take place is very accurately built, and also the character has the same great characterization, both the main and the secondary. The rythm never falls, and also in the moments of calm, you feel that something will roar back soon. There is a total lack of humanity in most of the characters as well, and this give you a strange feel for all the vision. From here to say that is the best action movie ever made, probably passes a lot, and I will not express my opinion on this.	2
57de3106-5583-4e09-845e-e10f36417bbc	  This movie was insane. It was a total trip to watch, all the way through. The world created here(or brought back here) is so alive, despite it's opposite depiction on film. It was beautiful. The scenery, the whole look of the film, was perfect. The stunts, mostly done the old fashioned way, were totally nuts, and fun to watch. Mad Max himself, Tom Hardy, was fine, but not the best character. Charlize Therons Furiosa takes that spot. She kicked ass. This is easily the best action movie I've seen in YEARS. Totally deserves all the recognition.	2
9412f0dd-ea6e-4757-b168-b18611b0ac50	  OK it was a really strange, weird and creepy action movie. I think lots of people didn't like it, but I liked it! George Miller (The Witches of Eastwick, Babe, Lorenzo's Oil, Happy Feet) is my favorite director. Mad Max 2 was like this and that's his Aussie style action. Best performer was Charlize Theron, she was calm, cool and wonderful! Tom Hardy was cool too. Nicholas Hoult (About A Boy, Warm Bodies, X-Men: Days of Future Past) looked different and he did nice performance. First I thought story is boring, but climax car chase action sequences were really dynamic, heart pounding and fantastic! 3D effects were really vivid, colorful and amazing! Ending was great! If you like car action movies, you should watch it! 3D is better!	2
a48093d4-ba79-4545-8968-ccc9a14e1baf	  Meaninglessly gory, depressing, ugly and bereft of substance, this movie was by far the most torturous two hours of my life--two hours that I regret that I will never have back (and I've had a sigmoidoscopy before). The characters have about as much backstory and dimension as a toothpick, and the mindless action is stupefyingly dull. While I can never un-watch this overrated drivel, I sincerely hope that my review will help you recover two hours of your life.	0
344bc50d-4b65-4833-a42a-497d30633f4f	  This was the biggest waste of two hours I've spent in a long time. If you're into meaningless undeveloped characters, over the top props, ridiculously impossible in the real world action and shootings, CGI generated stunts, and almost no plot, this is your movie. From the first moment of the movie till the end, its non-stop explosions, chase scenes and gunfire. Thanks, but I'll just play call of duty when I want to watch insane action.	0
3d44452c-4bf1-426f-832d-444db39691fa	  THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING TO HATE ABOUT THIS MOVIE, ITS GOT IMMENSE ACTION SEQUENCES, A STRONG SCRIPT, RELATABLE CHARACTERS, AND A GOREY CHARM TO IT! ITS TRULY WHAT A BLOCKBUSTER SUMMER MOVIE IS MENT TO BE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1	2
bb2f6603-6ede-413b-9bd9-3fc7ecfeaee2	  As a action packed movie, this movie nailed it all the day with it's incredible colourful visuals and lack of CGI. The problem was that there wasn't much of 'Mad Max' in this film than the other prequels, which was very disappointing since the entire franchise is depicted on him. Instead the film should've been called "Furiosa: Fury Road" as she was mostly featured through out the film. Another point, was the whole vehicle chase scene was just copied from the second and third installment with more gore and action. Though gotta give credit for those damn monstrous vehicles. See my point is this movie was great and all but I would like to have seen more of Mad Max and a fresh unexpected story to start of the fourth installment after like what 25 years!	1
d30fefe3-b38e-45b9-aedd-6b6607327192	  for nearly 15 years have we only received a handful of action movies that have a well crafted source of action, character, and high octane storytelling.... Fury road is one of those movies. In terms of not only a film having a wide range of being able to show the action in a clear and clever way. Just like how Christopher Nolan revived and changed the superhero comic book genre as we know it today, George Miller has returned to revive and change the action movie genre that we know for the better.	2
ae33bde0-ff0a-4dd9-8b7e-10981158e199	  This is my first experience of the Mad Max franchise and had much to learn about its story. This movie taught me all i needed to know and its a bizarre world full of character and stunning imagery. Its a strange movie but one that keeps up an impeccable pace and is full of brutal action. Really the whole movie feels like one massive racing scene and on reflection not much happens but the full 2 hours is a fully entertaining adrenaline rush. Im positive this is a movie which can be enjoyed by all due to its unique style and extensive entertainment value.	2
5193d487-f43b-434b-a4f4-50f16fc247a9	  This was a tedious grungy chase / war movie that I couldn't wait to end ! Despite the good art direction everyone looked like they just got back from burning man and Charlize Theron was a waste as an action star . I'm glad I saw it on DVD and didn't waste the money at a theater ! I'm really amazed that so many critics liked this ! I'm being generous with 2 stars ( for the art direction ) Sorry but the rest was a bore !	0
a3d623c3-2010-489c-abdd-76f46344cb7f	  Mad Max: Fury Road is confusing, it's unsettling and it's absolutely entertaining. Even though this is a sequel, George Miller has given us the most unique film of 2015. It really is like nothing you've seen before. Plus, this movie is filled to the brim with impressive practical effects and remarkable stunt work. This is an adrenaline-fueled ride through the mind of a crazy person, and I was happy to be a passenger.	2
eb7a57bc-2076-4856-8d0d-8d308e135ff3	  I can certainly see why this got good reviews, damn.. what a movie! The action scenes in this were something else, probably the best I've ever seen in a long time. The bad guys looked menacing, the visuals were stupendous.. even the old ladies in the final showdown kicked some serious ass. I loved that there was a dude rocking out to some metal during the whole thing hah the only thing that kinda irked me a bit was how things were wrapped up so neatly at the end when they arrived back at the Citadel, but that's the only issue I really had and a very minor one at that. I'm shocked I loved this when I found the original Mad Max trilogy tiresome(I slept through every one). I'm calling it now, BEST MOVIE OF 2015.	2
0c71a38b-49f8-4c9b-b03e-d3de42ca5827	  Entertaining? yes. Visually amazing? yes. Good action and cool style definitely. Best movie of the year? Meh not in my opinion. Best action movie ever? Not even by a long shot. I'm a huge fan of Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron and they were fun just like the movie. I do think it is a bit overrated, If you want action from beginning to end, yeah sure you get that but with basically no substance. It is a fun watch and I actually feel I'll like it even better after a second viewing but can't help but feeling let down after all the hype.	2
b2e69e67-fab9-40e4-8ee7-625efe9e3955	  After what people say that Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome a disappointment. I think George Miller will make up for it with Mad Max: Fury Road. Mad Max: Fury Road is currently my favorite action film ever made. It is a modern action classic and easily the best film so far in 2015. It is a Milestone in action film history. Tom Hardy does a descent job as Max Rockatansky not as good as Gibson but good enough for the film. Charlize Theron is also very good I think Furiosa will be an iconic female action character like Ripley and Sarah Connor. The action in this movie is some of the best I've ever seen with great stunt work and no terrible CGI like most action films these days. If you want mindless action unlike The Expendables or Fast And The Furious movies watch Mad Max: Fury Road because it will give you an experience like no other.	2
6b562d39-d1ec-442b-aa60-97715eaceca7	  Some of the best action set pieces I've ever seen on film. This movie is so intense they should have seat belts in the theatres playing this. You can tell that this is a very distinct vision from a director and not a film made by focus groups and studio heads. A different movie making style than your average action movie. The story is pretty barebones and the production design is pretty steampunk/strange and might turn some average viewers off but what a thrill! Not a casual movie to watch. You better hold on to your hats and glasses because this joyride is a brutal one!	2
8885370f-71a9-4cf8-aab9-695c156ace33	  While it is packed with action packed car chases, fights, and stunning cinematic vistas, this film also does a great job of filling out the backgrounds of the characters during the film. At times it has a theatric feel to it with soliloquy like moments, and at others it is a chaotic circus. You really feel you are in the truck with Max as he, along with Furiosa, leads their group on a quest for a better life.	2
1eac5a5a-ed1e-45ca-8921-59f710454712	  Great film, one of the best of the year without a doubt. The story and acting was great, the costumes, effects, choreography, sets, vehicles were excellent. The highest grades go to the amazing stunts and how the director weaved them seamlessly with the story. This is the best Mad Max film made and an entertaining film from start to finish. Note this film is rated R and is not a family film. This film takes a bleak and heartless time and manages to find humanity and heart where it is conspicuously missing.	2
1784f50d-2223-4e3d-bae0-7fe25951d19d	  The best action movie ever made, period. Tom Hardy acquits well, Theron is amazing, and it is absolutely non stop action. It's what I think of when I think of a Mad Max movie. Love the series, but this is easily the best, which is tough to say as it is being that The Road Warrior is so revolutionary on its own. Will never get tired of watching this, not sure how they could top it.	2
ed5ed004-9150-4fd2-bf8c-fa48941127d8	  This movie really was awful. Yeah, it had action, but that's it. Barely any dialogue (and the little there was was mediocre... ha! mediocre...), zero character development.Just a bunch of screwed up dudes driving screwed up vehicles, with a couple of girls tossed in so the whole movie wasn't just screwed up dudes.Another movie in what is sure to be a long line of crappy movies, since Hollywood can no longer make decent films.	0
647f8e4f-841a-4baa-9ecf-1ba4163a0ab8	  This movie was just a perpetual train wreck. It just starts in the middle of a story that has no real plot. People drive off into nowhere for no real reason. People drive all the way back because they finally say 'oh hey, water would be a good thing'. The only high points of this whole snore-fest is some mediocre action scenes and some hot women. But the main douche character doesn't even bother to get a congratulatory kiss. I struggled to just finish this movie, hoping and holding out that there would be some sanctification brought from watching this film. No.	0
22b41c7c-2c63-4743-9d06-e326ccaa7c6a	  This was quite possibly the worse movie ever made. People actually got up and left during them movie. I stayed only hoping that it would get better. It sucked. It was horrible. If you watch it and you have half a brain, you will soon realize that you just wasted 2 hours of your life. If you watch it and you liked it, well, there isn't much to expect from you.	0
a52a734c-54d8-43ae-a750-fb6d7b03e248	  Thrilling, white-knuckle action that gleefully doesn't take itself 100% seriously - the backstory's oil wars leading to a world where battles are fought by large petrol-guzzlers is about as ridiculous as actually having a war truck specifically for a post-apocalypse metal guitarist and his six accompanying drummers just to provide a soundtrack, but it's all here and you can't help but accept it. Theron is formidable and Furiosa is one of the best film action heroes this decade, and it's great to see Hardy taking Max back to the first-Max-film roots. Hoult is also brilliant and almost unrecognisable in a very good way. Great accent work by everyone as well.	2
c118be91-355d-4f75-9f34-3835100dcebf	  Amazing film, with the right amount of action and emotion. It's not your typical dystopian film based off of a cliche teenage novel. A fresh take on a post apocalyptic world. Theorn and Hardy worked so well together to create the perfect platonic bond. There is no forced romance, which is something that induces eye rolls when it is oddly placed in a film for "effect". Definitely one of my top ten favorite films. A definite winner.	2
40fa622d-3abd-467a-a5c5-789119c1d7c4	  This movie is precisely what a Mad Max film ought to be and a worthy successor to the franchise. You expect wild characters and outlandish vehicles in an explosive race across the desert and it delivers.What's even more impressive is the amount of back story and plot that is laid out at the start just by showing the way the people live. It's a barbaric survival-focused existence, but it tells everything you need to know.Dramatic visuals and intricately created vehicles lend a rich background to the movie and Charlize Theron's prosthetic is perfectly executed. Great work here. It's brutal and violent and dirty and covered in grease and sweat. There's fire and drums and fights on top of speeding trucks. If that's what you're looking for, you will not be disappointed.	2
06155133-5cd4-4ce1-8763-5588dd0f1de7	  What a spectacle. From the first frame to the last, the movie is relentless in providing outworldly surprises. Gruesome yet gorgeous. Gory and still glorious. Warriors on fast bikes that are grannies. War armies led by a rock guitarist. Acrobats on bending long poles as the ultimate weapon in the fast car chase. Mystifying and mythical. As contrasting in every scene as in the main story where Maddeningly macho Max is second fiddle in all the bravado to the far better Furiosa.	2
8d72085f-cda4-4660-8915-0322af22e69c	  Good movie, but not as memorable as the original. But George Miller is smart and is getting positive publicity by getting a well-known feminist to give her stamp of approval. Of course shared with the world so everyone knows... Anyway, I appreciate the practical effects, but the little bit of CGI that was used was VERY jarring because they were pretty poorly done and stuck out like a sore thumb from the practical effects they did... That and the fact that it was basically just a car chase movie, are the only complaints about it. Otherwise good movie. Charlize Theron definitely outshined the character the movie was named after.	1
2f9b59d7-db8f-4b33-8b6f-7b5e129d18ca	  I really enjoyed this movie. A fun, crazy, weird, wild ride just as I had hoped. I think the character Mad Max could have used a few moments where he does the extremely cool & wow maneuver, seems like everyone has more of those moments than him. I liked that the women(wives) that were being rescued weren't just damsels in distress, but that they got down and dirty and helped. Really cool movie.	2
09f1057c-0bb2-4852-8d6d-e088a6566aae	  Entertaining but overrated.Set in a post-apocalyptic future, an evil ruler, Immortal Joe, keeps his subjects under tight rule. Then one of his most trusted lieutenants, Imperator Furiosa, sets out to escape his regime, taking with her all his wives. Along the way she meets Max Rockatansky...Directed by George Miller, who directed the original Mel Gibson-starring Mad Max in 1979, plus both its sequels, Mad Max: Fury Road is two hours of non-stop action. The plot is rather basic, and there's very little substance to it, but the action is frenetic and constant. However, while this makes it entertaining, it does feel monotonous after a while. There's only so far you can go with an "all style, no substance" approach.Ultimately reasonably interesting, but vastly overrated.	2
369c155e-091f-4e41-88e0-266868fa80f2	  Excellent nonstop, heavy, and fast paced action, but pretty much lacking in all other areas. Basically a group of people drive away from danger while being chased and then realize that they can now be safer back where they drove away from, so they turn around. A circle chase that is very entertaining, but will not make you think at all; it might actually make you dumber. A top notch action movie nonetheless.	2
f23972e2-6900-4d38-9164-800343ab391b	  Is there any way for the reviewers of this movie to re-watch it and then review it again? I'm guessing after a second viewing, they will see how bad this movie is. The "dialogue" is the worst I've ever witnessed in a major production. The story; sorry, there is no story. And when will the studios realize Tom Hardy has no charisma?? Would have preferred to have Charlize Theron's character be Max instead; maybe changer her name to Maxine. Then towards the end, when he thinks Theron's character might not make it, Hardy finally says, "Max, my name is Max." Who cares at that point?? Wow, I still can't believe how bad this movie was and how it's getting such positive reviews.	0
c3b8e984-acb0-4a8a-807a-c8fed76a3e77	  It's visuals are speechless inducing and straight-on eyegasmic. It's production design is stellar, and it's narrative (while subtle) shines thanks to some excellent acting (with Charlize Theron's Furiosa stealing the show). Every aspect of the film excels, helping George Miller's intense, sadistic and intense 2 hour long chase through the Wasteland earn a place as one of the most stunning action movies of the century. What a Lovely Film indeed.	2
cf014e2d-854b-4539-bd8d-376c65866bb2	  An artistic and stylized action movie. Perhaps it is more appropriate to say that this a violent love-poem dedicated to the entire action-film genre. This movie had seriously awesome cinematography and seriously awesome action choreography. The story was simple, but yet enjoyable. Tom Hardy played his brooding macho character with a lot of subtly. Charlize Theron, on the other hand, played her unforgettable character with bold heroic strength and beauty. This movie may not be for everyone, but it was definitely good.	2
06aefef7-33ae-485f-8d1a-b6a017299fa4	  This was a movie that literally kept me on the edge of my seat, and I could not have asked for more. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about with this movie, and I must say, it truly did lead up to the hype. Tom Hardy is spectacular, as ever, and Charlize Theron brings to life a character I never would have thought she'd portray so well. Hugh Keays-Byrne portrays a great antagonist, and the supporting cast of Nicholas Hoult as Nux and the other girls definitely bring a spark into the film. Overall, 10/10. :)	2
f4e2dcff-2125-4b21-b6c0-61b7d524f554	  This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. This movie is a disgrace to cinema, there is no plot or storyline. Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are great actors but this movie did not showcase their real genuine talent. I do not understand how the director was able to release this film in theatre. As a movie lover I will not watch this movie ever again. Word of advice do yourself a favor do not ever watch this movie. This movie is a waste of time and money. Your welcome.	0
8a7c68a8-2950-4873-b679-47e728f8a821	  Watching as an on demand rental and it simply is not worth the price even there. No real plot, no real acting. Just a whole lot of things going boom, exploding, catching on fire, getting shot or stab. I suppose from a cinematographically point of view and special effects it could garner some Oscars, but I was basically bored out of my mind and quit half way and then came back to finish as an obligation but still bored.	0
8ea0abfb-83f3-46a6-b852-8bee8c4f3498	  Wanted to love this movie. I loved the old series, the first two more than the third but honestly I just don't see what people like about this movie. I found it to be rather boring, the plot to me kind of sucked. It just seems like the movies critics or people on this site seem to like I normally hate and the ones that do bad on here may not be great but aren't as bad as people make them out to be. This wasn't a horrible movie but I gave it what I gave it because the expectations were high and this was just barely worth the rental.	0
a00b14ef-884b-4118-b9a6-6c7a402b9661	  Fun, imaginative movie. But I felt kind of bored near the end. Like I stopped caring a little bit about the endless car chases and who would kill whom. I didn't really like either of the main characters. They both had no personality, and as many people have already pointed out - plot and storytelling takes a backseat to action. I need to see it again, but for now I feel like the movie is overrated.	2
4b65f04b-ef46-46f7-9f9d-73a55bbe385b	  When you see 97% on the tomatoemeter than you're expecting a bit. Every previous Mad Max had at least some sort of plot. Not this one. They are just fleeing from the mean boss in order to save his wives. This one takes place on the road for 99% of the time. Sure it's still fun and interesting but you expect a whole lot more after it was hyped so immensely. The 3D is decent but as for the movie, it's only mediocre. Worth a Blu Ray? Yes. Because it makes a great Demo Disc. But mostly for that reason only.	2
7c2b346d-b118-4fe6-bd34-2ff7c5379734	  Always being interested in the credibility and complexity of a plot, but Mad Max: Road Fury made everyone see that simple... is sometimes made to be amazing. Though some of the sub-plots seem to be strained, they never lacked integrity and purity from the delivery of the actors. This was definitely Hoult's best performance and introduced him into the world of far more serious and complex characters. The epic music combined with the unbelievable imagery pursued feverishly by the ravenous plot made me wish to stay and live in those moments eternally and for life. An excitement that could only be ensured in a far fetched reality with truly human, truly heroic characters.	2
545072b2-58ef-4c2b-8e20-6c772b81659d	  Watched this movie on Dish, I did not go to see it in the theater because I was afraid of being disappointed. My disappointment was just delayed, remake turned Mad Max into pussy Max, and the whole thing came across as a victim mentality. I don't think the filmmaker was in touch with the nerve the original Fury Road touched and its a shame, if he would have got it, it could be the new cult movie instead its just a Starship Troopers 2 with no redeeming qualities other than the cute harem of gals.	0
2461fcd6-aff2-4f60-9e67-c3c04f53250b	  Road to NowhereThis movie was absolutely deplorable. Sure no sex or swearing but it paled in comparison to the original Road Warrior and Mad Max. Where was the dog and Gyro Man when you really needed them?The acting, if you can call it acting was limited to 10 word utterances. Hardy was god-awful with his Aussie type accent if you can call it that. In fact the accent changed towards the end of the flick. The only redeeming features where Charlize Theron and some of the action sequences. But while it was loaded with action so much of the film was speeded up to supposedly heighten the action which it did not. The plot was so thin as well. All in all a total waste of time of true Mad Max fans.	0
6460dbf5-cbac-42bf-9249-43486c4e99ad	  This movie was a surprise,a very welcome surprise!I never thought I would like an action movie that much,cause I never felt like an action movie made any sense at the end!But this was fantastic,this was a really amazing movie!I enjoyed every scene,I enjoyed every sequence and I was blown away by the way action and meaning can be combined in a very thought-provoking way.A movie about hope,and a movie that is hope to a cinema that produces films for visual pleasure and no passion at all.Charlize Theron blew me away,she did a fantastic job bringing to life the surviving and more heroic side of women!And of course Tom Hardy,was physically there without even having to talk that much and this is saying a lot!I really do start to respect him a lot as an actor.I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie!	2
43f9831a-4709-4496-b64c-5486794ee11d	  One of the best action packed thrillers I've seen in a LONG time. Despite the lack of description and intermittent plot holes, the story was anything but cliche, and the characters were out of this world. They constructed a surreal post apocalyptic future such that the societal structure and the tribal interactions seemed completely plausible which made the lore of the story that much easier to embrace. I'll watch this again and again	2
135deb3a-5f0f-4a7b-b917-44672db925fb	  George Miller ain't playin' no games because - MY GOD - was this a spectacle. I rarely rank something an instant classic, especially on a 5 star scale....well, this one was worth it.This is the very definition of what a Summer Blockbuster is supposed to be. Fight scenes? Check. Special Effects? Boat loads. Thrilling? Oh, hell yeah...I won't say that Tom Hardy makes you forget about Mel Gibson from 30 years ago, but he does a damn good enough job. Charlize Theron was definitely the soul of the film. But you're not watching this for great Oscar Award winning performances. This is just something to see and be completely entertained. It ain't for kids. It ain't for teens. This is just straight up grown folk entertainment.I loved it...#WitnessMe...	2
14affd2c-568e-4b8c-9b17-95865c5322b0	  I don't usually give into reviews when it comes to my interest for movies, but when a movie gets a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, I have to see it. Now I'm incredibly flustered and trying to figure out how to get my $5 back (ITunes rental). I've watched the Mad Max series before, but when you do a reboot/ sequel, you need at least some kind of introduction to the series. The movie depended on the mystery of each characters past and future, but failed to fulfill the suspense. I'm disappointed in the reviews here. The action was great, but the storyline sucked.	1
265e43f8-f2ec-4c09-ad90-2035962d4496	  If you're into intense action and adventure, "Mad Max: Fury Road," is the movie for you. See it on the biggest screen in your house, and then crank up the Dolby-Surround Sound! To quote Charlize Theron, see calls her character one "Bad-Ass Bitch." I couldn't agree more as she disproves the old adage that women are the weaker sex. After two hours of this non-stop action, you will need either C.P.R. or two days at the beach. If you're a big fan of "Mad Max," spend the extra bucks on the five-disc "Mad Max Anthology A great Christmas gift.	2
06b2db9a-b3d6-4082-9f01-befa3f6d2bf0	  It is amazing how a film can be gripping even when the story is not known. We do not know where they 've come from, we do not know where they are going. All I know is I cannot stop watching. It is a 2 hour long big awesome car chase filled with bombs, catapults, bullets. and lets not forget that crazy guy with the guitar.If you compare it with the Mel Gibson Mad Max, you will find a major difference. It is in English! we can actually understand what words they are saying. That does not make the sentences any more of nonsense but still a major improvement.	2
366d0d30-483f-41ea-80ca-dc0f194c96b1	  The awesome weirdness of this world and great use of practical effects make this one a definite watch at the cinemas. Immortan Joe and his strange children make for unique villains in a movie that's plot pretty much boils down to an extended car chase due to someone taking something from the bad guy. The main criticism from myself and the mates I went to see it with was that it does become a little repetitive as the movie goes on.	2
efafbc06-696b-4d6c-8c2b-29dd8bec7d3c	  Tom Hardy steps aside in what is clearly Charlize Theron�s momentum. And boy, does she deliver!! There is a reason for all the hype, indeed: Fury Road is a non-stop roller coaster ride, which consists of 3 major action scenes scattered in 2 relentless hours of film. However, I don�t believe this movie deserves ALL the hype it�s been getting: its ending feels rushed, and so does Immortan Joe�s demise: it seems as random as any of the thousands of thugs' - or warboys, if you may - deaths we witness during the film. I believe this movie should be remembered for what it clearly serves: brilliantly orchestrated action sequences, together with the strong, memorable character that is Imperator Furiosa.	2
222b6d23-f30e-45b4-9f61-5b07834c6247	  Mad Max Fury Road is a non stop action thrill ride that barely pauses, and never disappoints. I would feel remiss if I did not mention that if you're a person who dislikes the wacky and weird this is not for you. The characters are all very interesting and well developed, the action sequences are amazing, the pacing is almost non stop, and the villain is almost like a combination between Darth Vader and a possessed Santa Claus. While the film may not be quite as good as Road warrior, it comes very close which is an accomplishment in its own right. In essence Mad Max Fury Road is a great time at the theaters, one that I suggest you see in theaters, because it's such a great experience.	2
fda65917-a7bf-49e4-b7c1-8781fb681fd0	  Maybe I am getting too old for this stuff, but if I watch this and all its silliness and try to compare it to any other movie, it just comes off as absurd and awful. I'm almost at the point of thinking that the 98% ranking on here is some type of joke being played by internet trolls. The movie has a difficult plot line at best and is basically a two hour chase scene full of ridiculousness.	0
ad2e4e6a-74f4-4a34-b266-78d3917c8a1c	  This is an incredible journey, The visual is great, the cast is amazing, the story is good and they all work together in unison with a massive production to create such master-piece... nothing was expected every turn was a surprise and the ending is awesome!!! George Miller as a director did a great job with the action sequence the chase with its dynamic, jumps and explosion that nothing was out of its place, and After this I will trust him to bring a decent Man of Steel :p Tom Hardy is always awesome! though he didn't talk much :) can't wait to see him in Splinter Cell and in 100 Bullets :) Charlize Theron, the real star of this movie just incredible :) I'll give it a 9/10	2
8ddc10e9-f699-4e28-82e3-9668791338a1	  Mad Max: Fury Road is quite impressive; I would go so far as to call it close to a miracle. I almost never see, rather than review, movies in this genre, as its not my thing. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Mad Max was pretty good, and it paid homage to its Gibson-esque prequels. The film works on almost every level: as a comic book movie, as an action flick, as a character study, and much more. Also, it has beautiful cinematography and performances to burn; some of the CGI was almost as good as in the 2009 movie "Avatar", I dare to say. It was a really well done movie overall, that will satisfy almost any viewer, and I highly recommend the experience.	2
54b66076-bee5-4117-b4ca-5e4ec3761efa	  This film gets us on LSD and ecstasy together,. The real experience of this movie one can get only in theaters and who got the chance to, can't help the feeling what the f.........Charlize even without one hand is more beautiful then brides, and TomHardy...uuuu Tom Hardy is real Mad Max, he is so real that I can't. Even remember Mel Gibson in this role. Everything is so weird but so connected in one violent disturbing image of post-apocalyptic world that we cannot stop the feeling and wonder what If really one tiny hand of beans could make our day in the future, I certainly did. Great movie for action lovers!	2
ca0c0bbc-5979-4d02-b964-120db78021b4	  I wanted to like it but it this film was just appalling, in fact it was utter drivel. 98% of the Rotten Tomatoes critics were obviously under the influence if they liked this film. I applaud the other 2%. In fact I'd say this film was exactly the same as the 1995 flop Waterworld except this time they switched from the sea to the desert. Waterworld was actually a far better film compared to this tripe. Anybody who fancies the film I can sum it up in one line "nutters drive from one place kill each other along the way and do the same when they drive back". Virtually no dialogue, no character development....nothing. Crap!!!!	0
38d9c31e-40a9-4e5c-b0d1-ef2579552ba4	  i really enjoyed this far more than I imagined as I am not always keen on remakes but this is superb!!!! The action an filming is stunning and beautiful despite the storyline and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of the cut and shut job ( pardon the parody) of the ending. It was too short, jumped from scene to scene making no real sense and lacked the conviction of the rest of the film a real shame but definitely worth a watch	2
8ea2128a-b56f-4394-aee4-335d97abc95a	  After a series of middling disappointments, Pixar returns to glory with the animative "Inside Out". Loaded with imagination, color and crackling with emotion, "Inside Out" is quite magical.The story of the going-ons inside a young girl's head prove to be an amazing device on how to convey that all emotions are important in achieving true fulfillment in life. While at the surface it looks like a children's tale, "Inside Out" strikes that perfect Pixar balance of fun for both adults and kids.The voice performances are superb with Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith as standouts. Colorful and delightful - one of Pixar's best offerings in years.	2
8b0b5fc9-e602-49cf-bcd5-dcc935ea384a	  Pixar returns to form with the delightful 'Inside Out'. Following 11 year old Riley and her emotions (Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness) this film explores the psychology of a child in a unique and gratifying way, with simple yet effective messages that will warm the heart of any child or adult. For me the message was quite beautiful that a memory doesn't have one emotion attached to it- it has a plethora of emotions, showcasing how unique and complex we are as individuals. It also tells us that we are allowed to feel joyful or sad etc, and that we shouldn't feel bad for feeling anything that we do because it is human to feel. Without spoiling anything there are a few scenes in the movie that may leave you with a tear in your eye. Pixar effectively gives emotions feelings in this brilliant animated movie.4.5/5	2
6b012f0b-8633-4c88-883a-0ac33830839b	  So freakin' lovely, as expected from a Disney Pixar joint. We see how children naturally evolve from their compartmentalized basic emotions to composite secondary and tertiary emotions. Even I didn't understand Joy's fanatic tenacity for much of the movie, but the overarching message about how putting a happy face on all the time can take its toll is quite kathartic and accurate. There are some random, goofy tangents throughout the journey, but Bing Bong's sacrifice is so sad and moving.*Mild spoiler: So does that mean children's comprehension of Sadness becomes Reason later on in life?	2
a3d24577-4ca4-4c3c-b983-3c0da6a99eba	  Pixar is known to be a master at playing the heart strings with their animated ventures, I think it's exceedingly clever of them to tackle the very core of their films; emotion.Inside Out is boldly creative to say the least, the whole lore/world built up by the story is interesting enough on its own. The adventure on top is just icing on the cake. I'm just somewhat underwhelmed by the lack of exploration with the other three core "emotion" members (anger, fear and disgust) Like Sadness I think they're a lot more interesting as perceptively "negative" emotions. Instead Joy gets an unprecedented amount of focus that I just don't care for.Inside Out is a great "journey" adventure, but a missed opportunity to simplify and explore the complexities of its own cast.	2
b9451ac0-3857-41ba-ac4f-32df05146739	  This is a very rare case of a films idea being greater than the movie, but the movie still being pretty good. Pixar really targets the adults in this picture, but includes some funny moments for children and some really clever moments for everyone. Some parts of this movie are complex, probably too much so for its own good because it does get out of hand at some points, but that is better than being too simple. This film may be overshadowed and under appreciated since it came out on the heels of Frozen and The Lego Movie, and while I consider those 2 to be better films, that is not to take away from how enjoyable this one is.	2
ea34e49e-86af-4b3e-9907-92d2415ead47	  Pixar again and this time covering interesting territory, the space between your ears, seen through the eyes of a preteen forced to endure moving to a new city, leaving all that she knows behind. Hardly worthy of a film, you might think, but in the capable hands of Pixar, worthy insight into that indefinable nuance, that which makes us tick. One cool decision is that Fear and Anger, while present, are given diminutive roles compared to Sadness and even Disgust. Overall, at the end of the work, there is that largest of compliments any film can hope to gain: one wishes that it could go on and on.	2
10071df9-52ff-4606-8ae1-9e55d4fef993	  Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen play with emotions in Inside Out.Spanning a somewhat brief 95 minutes, the film's intriguing story concept goes full circle in the head of a little girl. While lacking depth in a few places, the plot details are amusing and insightful, creating a character friendly adventure all around.The visuals never seem to hit it out of the park, although the character designs are colorful and unique allowing for easy recognition throughout the picture.There isn't anything to argue about when it comes to the voice-work; it gets it done all around. Amy Poehler is a delight as Joy with Phyllis Smith pulling off a Sadness.Inside Out may not expand enough from time to time, but ultimately it delivers nicely.	2
bc73d3ea-0816-42ad-a6ad-72d2d4bbdbdd	  This movie was nothing short of incredible. In a year of sequels, remakes and adaptations, this film shines as an amazing original film with a satisfying blend of fun and sad scenes. The sad scenes were very sad and at times overpowered the films lighter scenes. The scenes that weren't sad were lots of fun. I loved seeing the emotions controlling Riley, and the scenes that showed Joy and Sadness traveling through different places in her brain. After viewing it in theaters, I was in awe.	2
6f422b42-1787-4ff2-a131-2c70385fee18	  Inside Out feels like the culmination of Pixar's now 20 year feature animation career. It illustrates quite literally the value of embracing all of one's emotions, especially sadness, to live a fulfilling life. From what I have observed, that seems to be a central message in most of Lasseter and Co.'s stories. I really can't say enough about this film. The casting, acting, art direction, character design, dialogue, pacing, score, EVERYTHING is just dynamite. The final gag sequence is enough to make it a classic alone.	2
eb7d952a-d994-4324-a14c-d95e14c9f590	  This movie is so good because of how relatable it is. This may be my new favorite animated film, though the How to Train Your Dragon soundtrack still has a firm grip on my heart.Edit: After consideration, I've decided that this IS my favorite animated film... but not really. My head tells me this is better, but my heart still loves How to Train Your Dragon. So, I'm only going to admit that this film is the best technically... but How to Train Your Dragon is my all-time favorite.	2
9709d148-6399-4a50-bd14-cf4fb80738ad	  If you have daughters - even sons - but especially daughters - you HAVE to see this movie. Pixar never ceases to amaze me with regards to how they can constantly step up the research and writing game. The reason their movies are so damned good and that all ages can appreciate them is simply - the multi-dimensional writing. This movie broke down the complexities of emotional development - especially around adolescence. For me, this could not have come at a more perfect time given the ages of my daughters. if you have young daughters, it will prepare you - if you have older daughters, it will help explain some things.	2
5861e64e-bf1e-4737-a331-f5c1001a2269	  93/100 - Inside Out is not quite the timeless classic that I feel Up, The Incredibles, the Toy Story films, and Wall-E are, but it does show us that the cross-generational Pixar we know and love is back. The voice casting is superb, and the animation is golden as always, but its premise sets it apart. I can't think of a film that has examined the human mind in such a unique yet strangely accurate way. I'm not sure how much of it will be grasped by kids, but the more seasoned viewers will have a blast.	2
64867039-3d72-43fd-82ef-d77fd1b39d80	  Pixar has given non-human things human-like traits and emotions ever since 'Toy Story.' Where do they go from here? They give human traits and emotions... traits and emotions. And they pull it off wonderfully. The jokes are snappy and witty, the characters are spot-on, and you completely care about the human characters in which the emotions are taking place. Pixar took anthropomorphizing to a whole 'nother level. This is one of the best of the year.	2
f9bc2ced-6019-4720-b739-c1acb138b87d	  I don't think an animated movie has made me cry and laugh so much as Inside Out. Joy and Sadness took me on Riley's extremely relatable journey; I saw myself in her emotions, which is a triumph of animation. Gorgeous visuals, brilliant voice acting, heart-wrenching catharsis, hilarious moments, and best of all: a profound message . . . Joy cannot exist without Sadness, and we must reflect on our downfalls in order to pick ourselves back up again.I will remember this movie as the psychological, emotional rollercoaster (without being clich�) that revived my love for the powers of animation.	2
2d240cd6-c40a-4a99-8921-df54e2b18508	  GET OFF THE HYPE, PEOPLE! My number 1 rule is "Never judge afilm until you've seen it twice. I will agree with every molecule of my being that this is a great film, but i cannot agree that it deserves a spot in the top 100. Has it really attained the rank of Casablanca, or Red River, The Dark Knight, The Godfather duo, or anything Alfred Hitchcock ever released? No! Not even for a second. Good film, just not 98%.	2
ec30d456-7128-4063-be57-ece778d02a3f	  When you ask me what's my favourite Pixar movie is like choosing your favourite child, you just can't do it. But Inside Out just might in the top spot, it no only a fresh, not original but spectacularely clever animation movie, it might not be the funniest or the most visually impressive but the animation is gorgeous and what it does is so powerfull, and moving, that you can't help but find your inner child and treasure it for movies such as these. Inside Out follows the five emotion of girl named Riley, and how they direct her to cope with changes in her life, and how could i forget about the outstanding voice acting from the leads, special notion to Lewis Black as Anger there couldn't be a more perfect casting. Adventurous, funny, and unsurprisingly "emotional". Pixar you did it again.	2
638cf59e-f5b2-4a1a-aea8-6508991f88fd	  Ironically one of Pixar's least emotionally-exploitative films, because it actually lets the emotion come naturally from what's going on, rather than getting so-called "depth" from trying to force the viewer to feel like crap (see: opening minutes of Up, for which the entire rather mediocre movie was lauded far too much; or the driving premise of the decent, albeit highly-overrated, Toy Story 3). It's not perfect by any means - it works better on paper than in actual execution in some ways, but it was enjoyable, and darker than one might expect.	2
4e834a4d-582f-4298-9e3a-0bb4381ca7fe	  Its a bit over rated, the plot doesn't really make any sense. They make everyone so unlikable besides Joy. I really hate watching movies where everyone is so dislikable. Riley is annoying and she makes decisions out of happiness and sadness even though Joy and Sadness aren't with her. I know it seems like a nit pick but if you're making a movie about emotions I expect each emotion to show their respective properties. Its better than The Good Dinosaur at least.	1
57dbb682-20d5-46b4-9c87-1e90bc005e7a	  With Inside Out Pixar takes a rather old concept and reimagines it in a wonderful and exciting new way. The story follows an 11-year old girl named Riley as she adjusts to a recent move from Minnesota to San Francisco; and helping her are her core emotions Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear, but when an accident ejects Joy and Sadness from the control center of Riley's mind she starts to suffer an emotional breakdown. The voice casting is really well-done, particularly Amy Poehler as Joy and Lewis Black as Anger. And the animation is amazing; with extraordinarily creative designs for how the mind is structured and visualized. Another Pixar triumph, Inside Out is a fun and entertaining family film that has a surprisingly touching message.	2
13d50a22-4d65-46f5-9bfa-93df4a0a1653	  For me Inside Out was Film of the Year material. A gloriously in depth film which really strikes a very strong and emotional tone. This film was perhaps the most aimed at "the parents" of any pixar film, touching upon that very real feeling of loss that we get as we grow older; but also the opportunities that we gain as we leave childhood. As we watch both riley and her emotions attempt to deal with the trauma that is moving home for a young person we take that emotional journey with her. Inside Out, doing what pixar seems best at nowadays, actually achieved the most sobbing i have ever witnessed in a cinema capturing the emotion of "sadness" bang on the head.Not seen it yet? Do. Just be sure to have tissues on hand.	2
8d8cae4c-100f-4233-abb9-361b4886bcab	  I can't imagine any child enjoying this movie. Honestly, I don't even know if I enjoyed it or I just empathized with it. It's a movie about pure emotion, so it's hard not to get emotional watching it. In that sense, it's the most manipulative Pixar movie ever made; it doesn't feel like it's trying to make you miserable or anything, it's just using the most obvious shortcuts to making you like it. That said, it's enjoyable because it's so relatable- I just kind of wish they had done it a less obvious way. I feel like everything I got out of this movie, I've gotten stronger out of other movies that weren't so overt.	2
09cf74b9-7dc6-4741-894d-df913d8c3b2e	  Inside Out is nakedly out to make you cry, but resists being cheap at achieving this goal. As a movie about growing up, it'd be easy to throw in a dead pet here, a lost grandma there, and get the tears flowing. But instead, Inside Out digs a bit deeper, and tells a story about the simple losses of growing up, with a perfectly acceptable moral of "its okay to be sad sometimes". The characters don't pop in quite the same way that some of the Pixar classics have, which stops it from really entering the top tier of Pixar, but it clearly belongs in their company.	2
63008025-a08d-47f1-b6c8-f15c42931de9	  From someone who moved house 5 times as a child, I can totally relate & connect with this movie & damn wish it had been around when I was a kid growing up. This film is nothing short of a glowing creative masterpiece & shows that there's definitely still magic in the Disney/Pixar studios. Trust them to turn such an unthinkable complex narrative into a cute, entertaining & beautiful story. Such a refreshingly inventive & original concept with endearing characters that everyone can relate to on some level. Amy & Phyllis as the voices of Joy & Sadness were spot-on. I'm looking forward to a sequel.	2
2f9f8f49-1811-4fca-810f-527b80b96fd3	  When we see ourselves in front of the mirror, what would we have in our mind seeing our own image? In this animated we're taken to see human mind divided into five different emotions. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear. Every emotion particularly set the protagonist motion through the day. Mostly Joy dominates the control, but one peculiar day shatters the ryhthm and set forth the duo adventures to Long Term Memory library.Skywalker Sound works out the post production sound which turns out filling the pitch effects all right. Music in other hand is not too typical Disney theme, but quite speedy and vibrant.Breakdown is a state to breached whenever stress culminated in a harrowing time. Sometimes the only way through is to express the sadness experienced with close related ones, either family or friends. By then true joy will have way entering the soul.	2
de36bc2c-1bcc-423e-bba5-760e50f96f02	  What would happen if you took the emotional roller coaster that was the intro to Up, and turned it into a full length Pixar movie? Inside Out. Going into the movie, you probably just expect a fun gimmick about people in a brain controlling a person, but while that's true to an extent, you also get something that is a deep exploration of human emotion, and it gives you a rare look at how that affects us on the inside, which can have a significantly different appearance than what's on the outside. It has a fantastic visual style and creative design behind everything, and it's for sure going to be one of the more memorable Pixar movies, even if I think some of the others were more impressive in other areas. Personal Grade: S+Technical Score: 82%	2
66552a84-b68c-4964-8c0a-64974258dd0d	  Inside Out is a fun, creative and inventive take on the human mind concept. The emotions are memorable, the humans are relatable, the humor is funny, and the world-building of the mind is definitely the main highlight. However, I feel like there have been missed opportunities with the story, as some parts could have been executed better, felt questionable and to some degree emotionally manipulative. Overall, while I do think Inside Out isn't as perfect as everyone is saying it is, Pixar is heading in the right direction, as Inside Out is a film that should be watched by many.	2
33ad565c-597e-4df4-8219-6f6bccad7f9c	  One of those odd birds that truly lives up to the hype. Exquisite, detailed visuals (look at the individual memories as they cruise the long-term banks) combined with an almost-too-hip-for-the-room screenplay and an understated, beautiful soundtrack add up to a very special film. Take the kids, but bring a box full of tissues, because this story about emotions, the human mind and childhood reaches across every demographic. Highly recommended.	2
b47703d5-e524-460f-9eae-fdb4dad333ed	  Pixar has done it once again! "Inside Out" is a terrific film! A heartfelt story with a very unique concept, a kids' film that adults will also enjoy! Fantastic characters that are guaranteed to make you laugh, but there will also be moments that will make you cry! "Inside Out" is on par with some of Pixar's best films, like "Toy Story". One of the best animated films of the last years!	2
85661a7b-45bf-426a-9805-c206396dae1a	  As a kid I loved the idea of creatures in my head controlling my body much like the alien inside of the head in Men in Black. How wonderful to see this childish thought made into such a stunning and fun movie. Its colourful, imaginative and funny, for all ages! It has morals which all parents can feel comfortable with and is a proper family flick. In my opinion not enough fuss was made about this wonderful movie and is the best disney production since 'Frozen'	2
326931bf-05bf-4f76-9564-9b593ae428c5	  Just re-watched this with my three-year-old. A great family movie, with limited annoying characters. The story revolves around a child's emotions after her family moves out of state. It mirrors some things that have gone on in my child's life and is a great tool for having discussions about emotions. It's also entertaining, funny, heart warming and all that. It features a girl who plays ice hockey which is also pretty cool.	2
ad2101fb-da09-4a35-b231-5eced5229de6	  After a series of middling disappointments, Pixar returns to glory with the animative "Inside Out". Loaded with imagination, color and crackling with emotion, "Inside Out" is quite magical.The story of the going-ons inside a young girl's head prove to be an amazing device on how to convey that all emotions are important in achieving true fulfillment in life. While at the surface it looks like a children's tale, "Inside Out" strikes that perfect Pixar balance of fun for both adults and kids.The voice performances are superb with Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith as standouts. Colorful and delightful - one of Pixar's best offerings in years.	2
83ff371e-dc03-4235-9bc4-ea138ab20529	  The fact that Inside Out is a children's animated film simply does not matter. It is one of the most original, emotionally impacting, and constantly engrossing films of the year. It should come as no surprise that the man who made the greatest animated film of all time - "Up" - would hit this one out of the park. Inside Out is not only Pixar's best film in years, but it is also one of the best of the year, period.	2
b0466636-3fc2-45bb-958a-c24d56ad9d05	  I honestly can't fault this film, from the animation to the story, this film is a masterpiece. the story is about the emotions in a girls brain, such a clever idea and a heart wrenching one. This film is filled with humour just like you would expect from a Pixar film but there is like other Pixar films an emotional scene which pulls at the heart strings. The voice acting was perfect especially Lewis black as anger who is my personal favourite emotion. This film is for children but adults as well. Pixar are known for making film's which can appeal to both demographics with there stories. I give this film 10/10.	2
a22bb32a-586b-4452-bf17-ffad4539db9d	  Right before the Christmas break, I watched this wonderful family movie with my students. Most of them are from low-income families so they've never been in a movie theater. So I prepared this joyful movie for them and we all enjoyed the movie! Interestingly many girls liked the character "Disgust" and many boys liked "Anger". Why not "Joy"? I'd like to make my students happy/happier. But after that, I feel so tired! LOL Actually I like all the five emotions because all emotions are valid. I'm going to show this movie to my nephews who live in Korea. A big two thumbs up! ??! ;)	2
13b51e7c-9523-4f1c-848c-57f60a633f7c	  I like all of the Pixar films (I love The Incredibles, Up, Wall-E, and Finding Nemo) and heard really good things about Inside Out and I enjoyed it quite a bit, but not as much as some of those other Pixar films. Inside Out is a lot of fun at times and I loved who they got to play all of the different voices as they were spot on. The film is pretty fun for the most part and I'm not trying to knock it, but the film did not meet my high expectations for a Pixar film. Overall, Inside Out is a fun Pixar movie that I enjoyed for the most part.	2
90aad84d-7e37-4211-87ac-3629ffed7bf8	  I thought that this film looked amazing and really took me on an emotional rollercoaster ride. The voice work is fantastic and the use of colour to evoke emotional response is at times intense. I've suffered from clinical depression for several years now, and the emotional manipulation that this film put me through really triggered a lot of sadness and fear within me that I know far too well. Whether that's a good thing or bad thing remains to be seen, but if a film can affect me in that way, I'd say it's pretty good. Whatever the case, I think that "Inside Out" is a good example of psychological education.	2
ea9b28fb-c531-49f9-9ad9-361584869b5a	  Pixar returns to form with the delightful 'Inside Out'. Following 11 year old Riley and her emotions (Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness) this film explores the psychology of a child in a unique and gratifying way, with simple yet effective messages that will warm the heart of any child or adult. For me the message was quite beautiful that a memory doesn't have one emotion attached to it- it has a plethora of emotions, showcasing how unique and complex we are as individuals. It also tells us that we are allowed to feel joyful or sad etc, and that we shouldn't feel bad for feeling anything that we do because it is human to feel. Without spoiling anything there are a few scenes in the movie that may leave you with a tear in your eye. Pixar effectively gives emotions feelings in this brilliant animated movie.4.5/5	2
17db483b-7726-4a52-aa09-a7121f8bbac9	  78%Saw this on 16/12/15I guess I have grown too old for animation films, because I felt bored at most of the melodramatic dialogues from the cliched character Joy. However, the film retains much of the Pixar formula and it's emotional resonance. The characters Sadness and Bing Bong are the only interesting ones here. Inside out needs to be praised for it's original theme. However, it was slightly short and I don't think I can call it one among the best work from Pixar.	2
dec60ac9-6cfb-4936-b185-79d2d5e7d660	  I liked it, but based on the positive reviews I expected it to be better than it was. I expected more emotional punch than I got out of it. I would have liked to see more time spent directly on Riley as opposed to the character who represented her emotions. I just didn't feel as invested in the characters as I did to Riley, so it was disappointing that the movie was so wrapped up in those characters.Overall, not a bad movie but not great either. I definitely wouldn't put it on the same level with the Toy Story movies or Up.	2
557fe331-347e-48df-a0c0-d76ab4d8a32f	  Inside Out is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. The creativity that went into this film is yet another example for why the people at Pixar might be the greatest film makers of all-time. The voice acting was incredible, the visuals were flawless, the characters came alive in realistic ways, the plot was interesting and surprisingly moving, and the concept overall was just genius. The only flaw was that it did drag just a bit towards the middle of the film but that's just my opinion. Overall, I think this is a film that adults might actually enjoy even more than children.	2
a7d9640e-5dfc-45ce-b313-63f743d5c668	  One of the Bizarro entries in the Pixar canon in that it's squarely aimed at adults, but has plenty for kids to enjoy (see also Up), this one flew under the radar a little bit. It's a sky-high concept that could've easily gone wrong, but luckily it turned out to be a tremendously clever ornament of a thing, packed with subtle visual tricks and leitmotifs. Inside Out nevertheless may have more life in it as a discussion topic than as a film - and there's some irony in my having no idea whatsoever what young kids would make of it.	2
70f25b43-71c9-42de-a403-16d0f29f506b	  An extremely original concept revolving around the emotions in your head and what causes people to react the way they do and Disney Pixar has returned to do what they do best make you feel. This time Pixar skipped the middle man and went strait to the heart. They do such a good job at establishing characters and making the audience feel for them and recently they haven't done that but the comeback is strong making one of their best films.	2
eafc9c9e-cbfd-4e76-ae5c-47a2c14993ff	  This is a wonderful animation film based around a novel idea of anthropomorphic emotions inside the head of a 11 year old girl.It is such an interesting take on the workings of the human conscientiousness. It works on a number of levels where adults and children can enjoy it in equal measure. The film touches on the subjects of longing, memory and purpose of our range of emotions to create a funny and, well, emotional movie. Its conclusion treats the viewer with respect and provides a thought-provoking ending to one of Pixar's best films.	2
25ed91a0-9601-4818-9023-84fb66947baa	  A lot of people sad that Pixar lost its touch( I absolutely loved Monsters University so I wasn't one of these people) then came this movie and people were forced to swallow their pride. This is a very imaginative movie that will appeal to both adults and children. The ending was perfect and I think we can all learn a lesson from it SPOILER ALERT........................................... sadness is necessary in life and sometimes needs to be expressed. I would recommend this movie as a family movie.	2
6cdb2a4a-6840-48d2-a0ba-d9b6efbe8b85	  another steaming pile of politically correct crap to make sure the men and women continue to "work" and go in and out of the vagina to make more babies to send to more boring schools. but then again how can you retire and be in a diaper unless you've made enough speeches and paid enough taxes first? since I am above it all I officially declare myself God. the only one higher than me is the sun	0
06f5bd7a-0087-4732-a207-38c4d511d7bc	  pixar proves once agin your never too old to learn from cartoons it was an emotional roller coaster watching this little movie first u laugh then u cry get afraid for the characters then feel joy in your heart by the end all over agin this was a perfect movie i took my teen siblings too and we all loved it and had a long talk about emotions on the way home it was fantastic we have sence then watched it agin and the same thing happened just one of those where no matter how may times u see it u will still feel it	2
8979f70b-5d51-4649-9b7b-0e0b3480e1c3	  Pixar's "Inside Out" is an outstanding movie because it is about the emotions in one's head who controls what someone feels and thinks. For example, most of us have felt lots of joy spending time with our families, and we've also felt anger towards our parents as kids at one point. It is such a silly movie because we see the emotions running inside the main character Riley's head throughout the whole movie trying over and over again to save her childhood memories. That is a strong representation of all of us growing up into our pre-teen years.	2
fbba74ce-bac6-4bcf-a637-59e909f41b4c	  ok when i took my siblings over the summer to see this i wasnt expecting to lear a lesson myself 'nor for them too' however it was deeply moving and we all learned alot about our emotions with this my siblings are all teenagers but we still learned from it u are never too old for a lesson from disney fellk in love with sadness and discust joy was ok too and fear hated anger tough lol i suggest u see it	2
1e997662-c8f4-4966-956a-4b0eecefb801	  I had such high hopes for this movie... As it was, the concept was really cool, but the plot was severely lacking. The effort it took to establish the "world" made it so that what was actually going on in the real story was super boring. Also, I'm not sure that the main character should have been 11 years old. This should have been a movie aimed at younger children who are just figuring out what emotions are. My 2-year-old repeatedly said to me, "This is boring. I want to watch something else!" Sadly, I had to agree.	1
b42ca75f-2fb2-4382-b519-fb6f2bd248c6	  What a disappointing film.As the film follows the theme of proving the importance of sadness in developing a rounded personality, it puts some of the characters into some very dark places and prolonged periods of stress that will upset many of the children who go to see it. This should not have been rated as a "U". I know it could easily upset my own daughter and this DVD will be hitting the charity shop first.From an adult point of view, it has it's funny moments (virtually all of which are available FOC in the online trailers). Buying the film and sitting through the whole 91 minutes provides very few additional laughs.The story itself it mostly fairly dull, with very little in the way of a finale, while it was almost impossible to relate to, or even care about, the main characters in the film.A very rare dud from Pixar.	0
f5571acd-f9e7-401c-a7e5-076b11bafae9	  Few films capture life like this one does. Not simply life as we live it, but life as it lives within us. The moments, the memories, the essence of what it is to be human... Often times we forget that despite the many years we spend on this earth, the great achievements, and the heart wrenching losses, somewhere in the deep recesses of our subconscious lay an even more powerful color, the color of beginnings!	2
5c1804be-4ad3-40ef-abcc-b97414a79d17	  Pixar's first full-fledged movie for grown ups. Ok, maybe that's not entirely true, but I can't see how a child would find this interesting. Sure there are bright colors and cute little avatars for emotions, but everything about this movie is designed to make parents sob and have all of the feels all at once. I'm speaking from experience here, because Jenny and I couldn't go 20 minutes without tears streaming down our faces at the thought of our own daughter growing up and going through all of these complex emotions. The moral of the story, which has so much depth and complexity and humor, seems to be this: NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES MOVE YOUR CHILD ACROSS THE COUNTRY. There's also a Chinatown reference that made me cry tears of laughter. Still, this feels less like a film and more like a fascinating experiment.	2
60d9c040-dd33-4e8d-ac9b-51ee85de742a	  What a clever movie! One of the most original ideas out of the house of mouse in recent years. Every joke has been so thought out and all of them land perfectly. All of the emotions have their moments to shine and they all have great jokes and moments. Anger might just be my favourite. If you have kids, this is a perfect movie to take them to because you will be laughing, crying, and smiling right beside them the whole way through!	2
64b3d568-b759-434e-913e-62e0417d87e0	  I love it when Pixar releases movies like this where there is so much imagination and creativity behind it! I loved how colorful it was, the voice work was perfect, and I loved how they blended the humor and heat into it. I know I am going to get hate for this, but I didn't like Bing Bong. Sorry not Sorry. But other than that, I really loved this movie!	2
c563c19a-dae5-4771-b0ea-846a87daed3d	  Inside out, an excellent pixar movie where Riley is moving home from Minnesota to San Francisco as her dad has a new job. Her emotions are all over the place and in turn is also guided along in life by them. Joy (poehler), sadness (smith), fear (hader), anger (black) and disgust (kaling). Things are almost always positive but due to the move there is conflict on how to adapt between the emotions and some disasterous events take place. Loved this movie, an insight as to how a person can be controlled and when Joy and Sadness become lost within Riley away from the other emotions its a race against time to get back to the main control room. Allot of heart and emotional roller coaster to watch. Very clever to make emotions characters, loved it.	2
03b4ee3a-4ef8-40a9-a880-e9bdaa0a9e30	  Inside Out is a family animated film about the brain and how emotions have to work together to make a person whole. This movie is quite well done and is not only something for the kids but for the parents as well. It focuses on how not always the positive emotions are important but the other emotions like sadness anger and the rest all play a part in the whole scheme of things.Totally worth to watch with the whole family.	2
859aa92b-7a79-4df8-bc84-409c47799167	  One of the BEST animated movies to come along in years! It's on a par with "Finding Nemo," "Ratatouille"and "Up." It's the story of the emotions found in the mind of an 11-year-old girl. Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust. I promise, "Inside Out" will become a classic. As the voice of Joy, Amy Poehler is at her best. Come Oscar time, I say for Amy...why not? You and your kids will want to see this at least twice. Can you tell? I LOVED IT!!!! I say buy, then put away until Christmas. It's the perfect gift for the entire family.	2
079027cd-63bc-4c16-805b-0bd1ea8b0a2b	  This movie is waaaaay over hyped.... It is so plain and just unoriginal.... Its sad how this movie even gets any reward. I mean we get it, its famous because tumblr kids are now making fan art of this god damn piece of shit animation... But I still hate it because its average and boring... Boring boring... Please stop with the "#1 animation of the YEAR!!!!"..... "The Adventures of Tin Tin" is a 9/10 animated movie.... Yet no one remembers the movie... But everyone will remember this stupid movie...	1
9a34a2a3-8e18-4a0d-ad0d-6f9ecf978b5b	  Insanely inventive, life-affirming, and not only for chldren (au contraire), Pixar�s latest truly is the best they�ve made in years. A story about happiness, change, and the feeling of loss that that may bring, all told through the prism of a young girl�s anthromorphosized emotions with the most delicate touch. I am not a fan of animated movies, but this one really won me over. And it is truly funny! Do yourself a favor and watch it! It really has no fault...	2
f8455e87-4de7-42a1-bed5-8bb613fd7baa	  I can see why this movie has gotten a lot of good reviews, but I wouldn't put it up high on a pedestal like some people have. The 'emotions' make for interesting characters, which is the main reason this movie was amusing(good voice casting too). Still, it's not without its flaws. I left with more questions than anything and I felt like a lot of this made things up along as it went just to continue the plot, but it is a kids movie I suppose. Entertaining and no annoying singing(save for that gum commercial jingle, but it was used in a funny way so no bad marks for that).	1
bfdfbb3f-35d4-44b3-9d45-7a540072311b	  The movie is not the emotional gut-punch or the technical marvel I was told it to be. It seems to get too much praise for being a downbeat, mature story only translated into an animated movie for kids, though it can and should be enjoyed by people of all ages. I suppose my disappointment stems from the fact that the powers that be that created the emotional system inside everyone's head created a stupidly flawed world that not only puts the emotions (and thus the person) in danger, but also hopes to circumvent any logic gaps that might occur, granted though that this little world inside people's head is made from scratch, but set up for failure from the start.	1
62b2301c-c4a9-46d4-97fe-214b86853802	  Good concept, solid movie, great for kids and adults. The plot line was a bit simplistic and the "twist" obvious, but the rest of the film kinda makes up for it. Enjoyed the animation style and characterizations. Odd to think that the original concept had Joy and Fear as the main characters; Joy and Sadness make a much more effective duo. My boys liked it, I liked it - what more could you ask for? (another star and a half, I guess)	2
d0d9f42f-4bed-47b9-9567-3508ff0b3ace	  It was ok at best. The animation was fantastic although the human characters look a little wonky depending on their facial expressions. The movies main errors come from the relationship between the emotion characters and their human host. Cheesy dialogue is present everywhere due to the fact that the emotions just kind of react to whatever their host does whenever they are in the "Control room" the brain. So in other words, there is a whole lot of "Wow!" and "Oooooooohhh" reactions from the emotions the whole time, which does get annoying. There are also too many plot conveniences and plot holes, but you can youtube those if you want to hear about them. Is this movies concept original? No, but well executed for the most part. All in all, it is much better than "Frozen" and worth a watch to formulate your own opinion.	1
f8598fc6-857d-45b3-8505-f745c9bf9c8a	  Pixar Shines..Disney has kept Pixar where it belongs, Right on the topInside out does not disappoints at all, it is an incredible movie, good combination of humor mixed with all the other elements like sadness, fact of surprise, incredible psychology, creativity and 3d art.. it has everything to be a heartwarming family movie.Pixar is one Studio that never disappoints me, i never hated a single Pixar movie, i even loved cars 2 because of its fantastic visuals, my favorite movie is UP... , the movie has great direction amazing voice acting, amazing details which you won't catch up int he first watch, its a must watch for any animation movie fan any pixar fan and probably any dreamworks fan or any person on the planet i rate it 4 stars cause i had an incredible time with my family :D	2
511f9401-17f5-4a09-a557-f397558f75a1	  One of the most creative, refreshing, sincere and great movies I have seen in quite a while. Such creativity at every turn. There are not enough positive words to say about it. The animation, the cast, the story. Strong fantasy aspects that drive real(and not always happy) childhood experiences and yet relatable to adults. People complain about not enough creative original scripts. Well, here is a great one.	2
e35c2a7a-7c67-4753-9415-c3debd67b361	  "Toy Story": toys come alive when humans aren't around"Bug's Life": ants and grasshoppers in an unofficial remake of "The Seven Samurai""Toy Story 2": Zurg is Buzz Lightyear's father"Up": widower goes on an adventure to honor his late wife by strapping balloons to his house and brings along Li'l Kim Jong"Wall-E": a post-apocalyptic, post-Paleo Diet vision of the future of man and Earth"The Incredibles": the Fantastic Four movie so good, "Iron Man 3" ripped it off"Inside Out": tween girl is bummed because her family moved to San Fransisco. One of these things is not like the others	0
0b709d2d-c5eb-4a01-a3fe-aee185149ee4	  All the praise made me think this would surely be another Disney Pixar classic enjoyed by both children and adults. Personally I don't see great appeal here for older viewers. Using personification of key emotions such as joy and sadness to provide commentary on a young girl's childhood is a strong concept but it eventually becomes mind numbing to mature eyes when the script, characters, humour and design are all heavily geared towards kids.	0
f73c8e50-867d-4ec9-8367-fbb79b61b6ee	  Many Pixar movies hit you right in the feels and bring even grown adults to tears, but this one just takes the cake, with a final 20 minutes that will reduce your tissue box to empty. Great, complex metaphorical movie with the usual Pixar trademark of appealing to children and adults alike, without talking down to anyone. I especially appreciate Pixar's commitment, in film after film, to not taking childrens' intelligence for granted and treating them as the smart, inquisitive little people that they are. "Inside Out" doesn't spell out everything for you, instead asking the viewer to dig a little bit in finding the profound message hidden among the entertainment. All other animation companies could learn a lot from Pixar's brand of storytelling. Another jewel in Pixar's crown.	2
6729a2dc-9637-4bc5-bf69-cfb3b6ecd03f	  An outclass film, crafted perfectly around a marvellous idea. I was very much curious to watch this movie since I heard that the main characters in the movie are human emotions, after all I wanted to get inside my own head for once. From tiny details of memories, dreams and subconscious to the complex behavioural patterns, Inside Out is total knock out. Although physical appearance and motion of Main character Joy, reminded me Penny from The Big Bang Theory, but it was Amy Poehler who stands above all other aspects (except for the idea) of the movie.	2
dc1dce1f-ffb2-4252-a205-e9ea9a902a21	  WOW,So Pixar, does it again. Inside Out, has a wonderfully clever story and concept, the characters are fun and cute. The animation again, has been bumped up another notch by the Disney owned Pixar. As a 3d artist, I took note of the hair on the characters, hair is incredibly hard to get right in 3d animation, as is interacts with everything, while receiving and casting shadows on every strand of hair.The story, starts off a little bit slowly, but as the viewer understands the idea / concept behind this cute tale, it turns out to be a very heart felt and wonderfully cute story.Thoroughly enjoyed it!	2
88e1d18d-c507-4abf-81a6-c744a94fa050	  It was a good movie, but not great... Too much expectation is dangerous... First movie was not fun and funny... It was sad, emotional and really dark... Lots of TV actors did voices and I thought not great... Story was unique and very original, but absolutely it was not really funny... CG animation was colorful and beautiful. I thought if I saw it in 3D, better! Yes, that was the problem! This is 3D movie, but I saw it in 2D... So half the excitement. Anyway I kinda disappointed... I think small children shouldn't watch it, too dark and too dangerous... But climax was nice and wonderful. I love Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Wall-E. But this is not Pixer's best work and not my favorite... To me Minions was better... Haha...	2
e1dd9d56-7eba-4213-9d5c-281c50712c62	  Another classic from Pixar. I know this comment is nothing new, but I love how this is basically "Herman's Head." I guess it was just too "ahead" of its time, lol. Despite this earlier placeholder, a very good original story, and the world building here is mostly seamless and awesome. Joy and Sadness are great characters, love them as a team. Riley also works well. The imaginary friend character was also a highlight. Only wish we had gotten more Lewis Black as "Anger."	2
e82d7c2c-4ed7-44e9-92f0-b5fd6548aa5f	  The movie was fun. t had a lot of creative ideas and started really interesting with all the new things that go on in her head. After that the fun drops. Some forseeable action happenes, sometimes the pace gets way too slow. I would love to see the interactions between differents peoples minds more often, like in the trailer, which pretty much never happened elsewhere. All in all, the movie is a nice cartoon for young and all but I would rather recommend to watch it on dvd than in a cinema.	1
a396517e-07e6-4d5b-99c6-7763139b4b94	  So freakin' lovely, as expected from a Disney Pixar joint. We see how children naturally evolve from their compartmentalized basic emotions to composite secondary and tertiary emotions. Even I didn't understand Joy's fanatic tenacity for much of the movie, but the overarching message about how putting a happy face on all the time can take its toll is quite kathartic and accurate. There are some random, goofy tangents throughout the journey, but Bing Bong's sacrifice is so sad and moving.*Mild spoiler: So does that mean children's comprehension of Sadness becomes Reason later on in life?	2
69e673be-1fcd-4ce2-a5a4-db5ec2850684	  I'm now convinced that if Pixar wanted to jump across the uncanny valley, they could probably do it. Not only does this film improve upon their already impressive visual style, but it does so in a way that brings that inexpiable time in our lives into coherence. Sure, they do stick to the cliches of film (including some they've mastered as well), but a lot of this film wouldn't work if we all hadn't experienced these things at one point or another.	2
f350359a-309b-49e3-8efb-a8ca510ba4f1	  "Inside Out" is by no means a kids movie even though it looks like one . Pixar like always takes all the themes that makes a great movie and represented them using emoticon characters. The story plays out beautifully , less subtly from its predecessors , and handles some critical elements beautifully . It however does lack a bit of humor unlike Toy Story but it possess more characterization . I found the middle of the movie a bit of drag but the climax makes up for it .Seeing emotional representatives of various characters does liven up the scenes though . Overall it is a very neat concept and one can definitely hope for a sequel of it . Inside out is a brilliant return from Pixar	2
acabc252-b34a-4f95-8553-872b83057686	  Well, I cried my eyes out. I loved this movie. It's so clever and magical in how it portrays feelings, memories, defining moments, and even dreams. It's difficult not to relate and get caught up in it. I would love to see more of this concept. It's a brilliant idea and was executed so well. I really appreciated it's message about the role and importance of each emotion. I loved that Riley was a girl who loved to play hockey. That is awesome! So far, this is hands-down the best movie I've seen this year.	2
927a1747-fe94-4e31-8dae-f2ef99cee6bc	  Well that was disappointing. My high expectations for this movie were kicked in the crotch. It lacked substance, like it was missing vital organs. Sure it was cute, but not as cute as I had hoped. It was funny at times. But parts were really Disney cliche and generic, plus I had to ignore the character issues and plot holes. I like human psychology (not that this movie was clever, but its simplicity I guess was for the child audience), but this was meh. Too bad, cuz I really wanted to love it. I wanted to feel, to cry, but I was let down. 6.5/10	1
7f9170c0-613c-46ed-948b-ac765b94144a	  This movie is a challenger to those who say 'there are no new stories to tell' , 'everything is tried', 'nothing new can be filmed'. I recommend all the parents to watch this film with your kids. This movie is powerful message. If you haven't understood the first time, watch it again. The movie deserves to be in a 'Best Picture' category for the year 2015. I strongly request the movie distributors to release this again during the Winter holidays.	2
81e80b86-b090-4d86-87ff-a29748744a93	  100% Pixar at their best, enough said. The director is the same from Monsters Inc. and Up and you can see it. It's a wonderful and funny cartoon but it's not a simple movie. Like in other Pixar movies, there are at least two levels here: the story and the metaphor behind it. Behind its funny and colorful adventure, "Inside Out" tells the story of what happens in a little girl's mind at the passage from childhood to puberty while the world she used to live in changes. Little kids will enjoy the adventure, the gags and the characters, adults will enjoy the symbolic level of the movie, if they pay attention to details and accept to play with the metaphor behind the movie : from color choice to little details of scenes, nothing is there without a meaning, in a Pixar movie.	2
6f073764-88ea-4d67-bac6-0704d5c3340e	  This movie is so awesome. Fresh, funny, full of joy, fluffy, and very fun. From the beginning Inside Out doesn't give a promise about big adventure and makes the audience wonder what is gonna happen next. In the end Pete Docter successfully shows that, even in your head and over a night, there is many adventure could happen and informs the audience how your head works in funny way.	2
0d202891-0a01-4ffd-9121-74283c14c040	  "Inside Out" is an amazing idea for a kids film, if not for a grown soul like my own too, but at times it forgets the core idea by bringing in slapstick humour to "the emotions" that step out of their characteristics. "Joy" should only be happy, and "Anger" should only be angry, and NOT when the story needs them to be. This leads to a choppy, and partly unfocused script that could have been so much more. Apart from that, Pixar manages once again to bring us a mature message, great voice acting, and colorful animation.	2
66515d75-4ba3-4c4c-ad2b-77455b6d63a6	  Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school. Written by Pixar.	2
238065c4-17bb-4c0f-bc13-74a3a0e4727b	  As the movie starts "Ever wondered what goes on inside our heads when emotions kick in ?". This movie answers the latter in an absolute stunning and brilliant fashion. It exceeded my expectations and from the words of a good friend of mine "Pixar knows how to tug at the heartstrings". Full of potential containing stunning visual effects and animation and graphics along as a talented cast, this movie is powerfully moving, original and emotional all at once. It delivers all of the essentials of not only a movie full of fun for the family but also just about for any audience and if one would think that its only meant for a young audience, I have news for you: you could never have been so wrong.	2
713a0f8a-3d16-4d06-8398-58630ba3dc22	  By far the best animated movie of the year. this movie beside being funny, it touches the feelings a growing child goes thought. and the changes that a kid endure in their life. It tells us that even if some feelings are bad and bring sadness, as a growing experience it will make you a better person and new great memories will be build on those feelings. especially when a child is becoming a teen	2
bd14d656-4ea5-47a2-a9f3-232387525156	  4 1/2 voices out of 5. Perhaps the most delightful surprise of 2015 for me. This is animation at it's best- creative, interesting, childlike, questioning, filled with high level concepts broken down to a simpler state, adult humor that doesn't insult nor offend, well crafted images, matching sound quality, and a film that gets better with every viewing- I'm up to 3 now! The story is so well constructed that you almost feel like the director somehow managed to open up his daughter's own mind and faithfully copy it's complexity and beauty. Bing Bong, Bing Bong!!!	2
b9d41319-7689-485e-af8f-add83f293ea5	  There are plot convinces, sure. But they're so easy to overlook when the rest of the movie is so good. Perfect casting, stunning animation, great humor for children and adults alike and Pixar's usual poignant touch are all familiar in the best way possible. It's not perfect, like I said. Some parts with the imaginary friend are almost impossible not to predict, the order of the islands is so incredibly convenient, and the archetype parents are bland. But the story they're telling is brave an inventive, the animation is as creative as it's ever been (not their best though, that goes to Wall-E), and it's definitely worth watching.	2
8061cca9-74a7-47d0-a83f-10f6f2e2954e	  From Bing Bong's tragic sacrifice to the colorful dynamic between the different Emotions to the disharmony between the imperfect parents, "Upside down" is another piece of perfection that reaffirms John Lasseter's team as the best there is at what they do. Disney's "Inside Out" has so much more soul and originality Compared to Dreamwork's "Home," which has Steve Martin shamelessly imitating Sacha Baron Cohen's King Julien from Madacasgar.	2
b5c54efb-9807-4b73-a0a1-3c22606a2bd5	  This movie is excellent on every level. We saw it minus kids or grandkids, as did many other adults in the audience. On one level @PixarInsideOut is engaging, beautifully illustrated and animated, well "acted" and engrossing. On another level, is provides a clear layman's explanation of how the brain and our emotions work. On a third level, it provides adults with a metaphor for talking to children about their emotions and getting them to understand why they feel they way they do: "I think Anger is running things at Headquarters today. Do you know why he took over the controls?" With great reviews from the critics as well as audiences, this is going to be a blockbuster for Disney Pixar.	2
372f0c93-b631-465a-a7c0-04fba43217ca	  It has an original, interesting main idea and, like many Pixar films, addresses not only young kids but also teens and adults. It can be laugh-out-loud funny and action-packed, but also quite moving. Riley's reactions and her relationship with her parents are very realistic. Strong psychological points are being made inside the Headquarters - and yet they still remain a wacky universe where things can go amusingly surreal. Arguably not Pixar's best film, but still a classic, classy, unique one.	2
e1b9a322-3b34-4e59-ba45-a0506991cba8	  Disney-Pixar has dug deep into the depths of creativity and imagination crafting a stupendous formula of humor and heartbreak. 'Inside Out' is less than a film but more of a trip to the recesses of a child's innocent and boggled mind, terrifically molded with psychological substances, lighthearted adventure, and heartbreakingly relatable real-life experiences. With all pride and confidence, I could say that Inside Out was more than a movie. It was an experience.	2
14d64ad1-e91c-4f63-ae55-95065e417633	  This was some light and fun entertainment. Far from Pixar's best movie, but still pretty good. I do like that they took a risk and made something completely new and different from everything else. A story told from the inside world of a little girl's mind was unique to me. Plenty of humor and some heartwarming moments too. As with many of Pixar's leading ladies, I fell in love with the tomboy Riley. However, it was the character "Sadness" (played by Phyllis Smith) who stole the show.	2
2ca8fd7f-df8e-45ca-bf9d-48b0516a63ad	  Riley's family moves to San Francisco for her dads new job. She's in a new house and starting at a new school. Her emotions run her world like the rest of us: Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness. Things start to go downhill at the emotional headquarters when sadness starts taking over most of Riley's memories. Joy and Sadness try to piece Riley back together while Anger, Disgust, and Fear run the show. Pixar did an amazing job with Inside Out. It's colorful and emotional. A lot of people can relate with the experiences Riley goes through and I think that's why it made so many of us cry during certain scenes. It isn't my favorite Pixar but it is definitely an amazing movie.	2
11c8ee96-9e4a-45e3-b82d-9bec9ef8231b	  Revolutionary, a new standard for animated films, a new standard for films in general. Inside Out is the perfect movie. Every single frame, sound, and color is truly incredible. The emotion is heartbreaking and genuine, the humor is constantly hilarious, the animation is some of the best ever put to screen, the voice acting is stellar, and it has amazing, deep themes about emotions, growing up, letting go, and accepting reality. With time, I believe this will be in the conversation of one of the best movies of the 21st century, if not one of the best films ever made, period. I'd be shocked if it's not my pick for the best film of the year come January.	2
d00cb9c4-e1fa-4c1b-9a98-e216e1905d68	  For years monsters inc was my favorite pixar film until pete doctor stole his crown. inside out is simply the greatest disney film of all time in my opinion. it takes a concept already done before in films like osmosis jomes but it manages to be so creative and so unique with it's premise that it blossoms into an original masterpiece. it has great characters, amazing animation, rockin comedy, and it manages one of the saddest moments in animation ive seen in since how to train your dragon 2. definitely recomend it.	2
f7ec02f9-bd7b-42c1-ab80-97545712ba1f	  Another score for Pixar! The third in the 'If you don't cry in this you are a heartless monster' trilogy (Up, Toy Story 3).A beautiful, affecting and intelligent film about growing up, the loss of innocence and the importance of embracing all of your emotions. It is brave in that it refuses to talk down to it's audience or to spoon-feed its message. Great animation, jokes for all ages and realistic characters all round.If I had to make a criticism it would be that I would have liked to see more of the other characters, who felt slightly undeveloped. Phyllis Smith as Sadness, however, was an inspired casting choice!With the critical and box office success of this film, and living in the sequel-obsessed age that we are, we will no doubt meet Riley again, inside and out.	2
75212d46-af42-4c58-a190-83c14972bea3	  "A movie that takes your sadness and flips it inside out"This Film (like most pixar films) is AmazingThe story is Genius, we have never seen anything like this before, the writing is very clever,the Animation is OutstandingThis is not a "Kids Movie" it is very emotional, and very smart, its the best entertainment for all ages to enjoy for many years to come.I am going through a tough time right now, even when I was watching the film I was going through a tough experience, but this film managed to suck me into its fantastic world, this is the best type of "escapism" there is.I am truly grateful for this movie.	2
49acfd9c-bdc0-43c0-ac8c-03e3b00307f5	  Every once in a while, a movie comes along that revitalizes the film market and helps every adult see what it's like to be a child for old time's sake. This is one of those movies. This movie's over-arching themes are complex and mature; showing us the serious side of Pixar. Giving us a glimpse into the depth of their writing talent. I definitely recommend this film to ANYONE over the age of 20 to re-experience the joy and imagination of childhood.	2
67583acb-a330-4452-ad91-a7e429970043	  Animated movie was not this clever in boundaries of story in a long time. It''s an original, brilliant idea with beautiful animation and very nice voicing. I loved it whole even though it's more of for the adults and it can be very sad realizing the cost of growing up along all the things we sometimes abandon. Very beautiful, why the hell did they not think of the clouds earlier! :-) Loved it.	2
d74b6dd7-1943-47ec-a495-d34d80d57c47	  The story is pretty much predictable but even though it tells a story that would basically happen to any of us at probably any time of our life, that is exactly why Inside Out is brilliant. It touches on all of us, emotion-wise. Along with every character in the control centre, we audience get to experience all different emotions on the spectrum. Cast from The Office like Mindy Kaling and Phyllis Smith is too cool!	2
31159fcf-e16f-45b1-a110-5039f3149c1c	  It's not perfect, but it's exactly what you'd want from a Pixar film: heartfelt, funny and at times almost cathartic. It's simple in message but that message is a fundamentally necessary one; opening up a dialogue about feelings and emotions is something our society needs, perhaps now more than ever, and I'm so glad we have a film like this for young children and adults alike to enjoy, discuss and possibly (definitely) cry over. Conceptually, it's intriguing and highly original, and while it may get convoluted at times, by the end its message is plain for all to see. If it's a choice between this and the Minions, see this one.	2
c9c08d68-4b98-49e4-b004-7da87f9da4c9	  Why did I doubt this film? I saw it before, and thought it was average. A month later, I got a gut feeling that I had to see it again, so I did today. Holy cow, I was blown away! The animation is stunning, the story is great, and the concept is brilliant! The ending gives you an amazing feeling, and I can't recommend this film enough! Best animated film ever, period.	2
c1ec7aaf-4cf7-4145-9f6a-9e9c78c3ab3d	  A life experience masterpiecePros:1. The movie main idea is amazing.2. The characters interactivity between each other is fine.3. The inside-world is fairy.Cons:1. Characters are not graphically amazing as Pixar can do.2. The film story is not complicated to satisfy us.3. The school scenes didn't take it's fair time.4. The cloud-town scenes didn't take it's fair time.5. Lack of graphical details in the Riley's Birth, Moving to San Francisco, San Francisco streets, Riley's old home, Memory spheres, Control room visual extra effects and characters faces details.Overall: A life experience masterpiece	2
b11bcff6-4cdc-4c0a-881a-333bf2549b35	  I'm yet to see a Pixar film that I haven't enjoyed, and Inside Out continued that tradition. My hopes may have been a little too high heading into this one, as even though it was a good film, it definitely fell short of some of their previous classics. I foolishly expected it to go a little bit darker into Riley's emotional state, but it still touched on some themes that are important for kids (and adults) to see and understand.	1
8c4e462d-2d44-4031-8974-e5f601479ea4	  Five main emotional character that people have, Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear and Disgust. They're perfectly pictured and draw, i personally love disgust.. ;) As you grow older, a lot of things happen and you can't just feel Joy,sad,angry alone there must be a mixed feelings. And complicated feeling that you can't describe. I think pixar succesfully describe and deliver these message in a touching and funny way.	2
c1a2ac9f-8dae-4305-9d36-a35bd075b1c7	  My love of Pixar is long-held and borderline uncomfortable for people that hear me talk about. Inside Out continues the trend (or is it a tradition at this point?) of thoughtful, intelligent, hilarious, breathtakingly emotional filmmaking that manages to both push the boundaries of the genre while still existing comfortably inside of them. If you can't find something to like here, there is something deeply and profoundly wrong with you.	2
67a2bd46-0223-45c1-ae50-69fe893ecc02	  Pixar was once a film company known for bringing entertainment, comedy and emotion into an innovating concept. Yet many fans consider post Toy Story 3 films to be the dark age of Pixar. However not only does this film break Pixar's losing streak but it shines alongside the other greatest films they have made. And ironically, they do it with a cast of 1 dimensional characters. How? The audience knows that it's the concept of the Emotions to have only one personality so it never feels stale or out of place. The parallel stories match perfectly and the fictional logic behind the inner workings of the mind are so possible that it makes anyone think that this fantasy world really does exist in all of us.	2
1eaa63f8-1590-4aa7-8acd-be83fc1a1a90	  Surprisingly, I'm thoroughly entertained with the movie. Yes it is fully animated, CGI, Disney movie for kids, yadda yadda yadda but the thrill (yes there're lotsa thrill) and the tense in between every dire situation faced by Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong make you anticipate what's gonna come up next! And then there're Anger, Fear and Disgust trying to solve the problem by creating even more problems. But the one criterion I love the most in this movie is how the production team expressed what's going on inside our head. I would give this movie 5/5 if Sadness wasn't being too much emo through the whole movie.	2
1e44ea39-3feb-4d0a-ba30-23c3fa6ab32a	  Pixar is known to be a master at playing the heart strings with their animated ventures, I think it's exceedingly clever of them to tackle the very core of their films; emotion.Inside Out is boldly creative to say the least, the whole lore/world built up by the story is interesting enough on its own. The adventure on top is just icing on the cake. I'm just somewhat underwhelmed by the lack of exploration with the other three core "emotion" members (anger, fear and disgust) Like Sadness I think they're a lot more interesting as perceptively "negative" emotions. Instead Joy gets an unprecedented amount of focus that I just don't care for.Inside Out is a great "journey" adventure, but a missed opportunity to simplify and explore the complexities of its own cast.	2
d44b4111-fa40-4b2b-8c47-38ed827c8e43	  Unless The Good Dinosaur exceeds everyone's expectation, this will be the best animated picture of the year. Everything here is well thought out, from the animation, punch lines, the main and supporting characters were given their moments to move the plot. I don't even think that the target audience are the small children because some of the references will go over their head and adults will pick up and laugh a lot (I did). And yes, the signature funny moments from Pixar is still here.	2
8106bc6c-b6d7-4cc4-9d07-d72af7250029	  Very phylosophycal, inteligent and adult (maybe too much adult for kids). It is not only that it has translated to a visual language complex thoughts as those related with our thinking, but also shows the value of sadness, the importance of growing and also accept the bad things that happens in life, focusing in an aspect not very underlined in movies for children -depression in kids. The last part looks an allegory of both growing and Pixar -you acquire complex feelings and accept everything as a integreated part of life. Pixar becomes an adult, too.	2
ffe2eb02-ec2f-4f55-aa0e-a13a4eec7430	  First of all, I would like to say that Inside Out is awesome. Wow! You should definitely check this out now. It was so awesome that I didn't even notice the negative things of this film.The voice acting is amazing. Story is great. The execution is great. The characters are well-written and interesting. The world that Pixar created is so much detailed. Colourful & inventive. I love them. From the beginning to the end, I was in their world.The main reason I love Inside Out is because it touched my heart. Dammit Pixar! You can make people cry. This film has a very beautiful message that it is ok to be sad.Pixar studio always delivers great original animations and this one didn't disappoint. I shouldn't even say disappoint because Inside Out is awesome and it is undeniably one of the best films of 2015.	2
ddc98e08-90b4-4457-bfde-e1a4688f311c	  Me and my girl friend walked out half through it. This movie is not funny and has no story. Before the credits, there is a little love story about island volcanoes, still got not clue why the hell this was included.This was the first movie in over 30 years of going to cinema that I walked out of. This movie is just bad, flawed, tedious, slow, limited humour and story etc.	0
b2a220fe-8659-42a5-97fe-76c10c575cbe	  Let's cut through my usual hyperbolic, or some might say long-winded, review and just say, don't let the girliness of the premise put you off, and please go see this truly original, intelligent and moving film which also happens to be a funny and entertaining animated feature that bursts with colours and ideas, thus satisfy both cerebrally and aesthetically, for children and adults alike. Sidenote: last time I was reduced to a watery mess at the cinema was after the first ten minutes of UP; and it happens again here in the last ten minutes. Pete Docter, director and brain behind both these films, I hate you.	2
5a606dab-3095-465c-bffc-2b7beb587fd8	  Although 2015 isn't over yet, I highly doubt I'll see a better film this year! I had high expectations for this film, and they were certainly exceeded! The comedy is great, the voice work is very well done (especially Lewis Black's performance as Anger), and the film has a great emotional side! The film's story is nothing new. This premise has been used in other films and television shows, but the folks at Pixar expended on this idea greatly, making this one of the most inventive animated movies I've ver seen!	2
c8e5cb09-4e2c-45d7-8a04-162c8271b0c7	  Wits: 5/5Story: 4.5/5Perception: 4/5First adjective that comes to my mind regarding this movie is: witty! The entire context was carefully prepared and parallel for the components of the subconscious world was brilliantly established. Even if there are some slowed down transitions the whole story is highly involving and the voice casting choices were on the spot. It goes without saying that the technical quality is close to flawless. So in the end, superb idea and execution!	2
8a50071e-3cd4-4634-9c89-965980eee862	  Disney is probably the best story teller of all time. This new feature film by Disney/Pixar sparked our interest when it first released its teaser, but after this long wait, this proved to be of Disney's best productions.Revolving around the coming-of-age of little Riley and tells the story of the little emotions that live inside her head, with a clever set of characters and a very clever storyline things went from great to superb.I can't stop raving about this movie, but I must encourage everyone to go watch it now! Easily the best movie of 2015.	2
71249b06-a9c1-4d11-a26c-a387cd73176c	  After a few years in the wilderness it looked like Pixar had gone the way of other lesser animation studios, trading originality and flair for mediocre unnecessary sequels and uninspired production mill like fairy tales. From the outset Inside Out looks like it shouldn't work, a film pretty much playing out entirely inside the mind of an eleven year old girl. Unsurprisingly it works and on many levels managing to offer something for everybody no matter the age or gender. Very young children may struggle but older kids will love the well designed characters and beautifully developed worlds. Adults will very likely be left a sobbing mess and that's before the main film even begins as the 'short' beforehand LAVA is wonderful.Very possibly Pixar's best film.	2
d27261a3-d82d-4280-9bd2-928bea654271	  I can describe Inside Out in one word: GENIUS. This movie is really inventive, smart, imaginative, emotional and hilarious.Many of the actors are perfect for their roles. It's not a perfect movie, and it's not saying everything in this movie is totally original (as this does make me think of Osmosis Jones and Herman's Head with a good and clever spin on it) however it's totally well done and well written.I can see several sequels coming from this story and I'll be excited when with what they can do with those movies.	2
1a1d8eee-5002-4fbd-a757-f83189cb8821	  Great movie, but still left me wanting more (maybe that's a good thing...). The best part was the interaction between the different emotions at the dinner table after Riley's rough day. They needed more of those interactions (there was one more towards the very end during the credits). I'm not sure my kids could enjoy it as much as I did, maybe my older kids, but otherwise it seemed geared towards an older audience. Loved the development of complex emotions, that was a nice touch.	2
7a176431-6015-43cf-80c7-762bef91b7a2	  Simply wonderful. One of the best movies of the last decade and a movie of warmth, humour, creativity, intelligence and humanity. A movie for anyone who loves movies and people, and it genuinely had me reflect about my own life. This is exactly the type of movie that puts most others to shame; yes I am talking to people almost everyone else in Hollywood and beyond! I also loved 'Lava' before the main feature, so charming.	2
397a8c64-f00d-4387-97e4-c64f54bd5462	  I would recommend watching this movie alone as I cried many ugly tears, boogers and all, and that's just not a good look. This is a wonderful film! I haven't gotten the same feel since Meet the Robinsons! I was so worried it wasn't going to meet my expectations since I watched it after all the buzz, but it was absolutely fantastic. I suppose it's mostly because I knew nothing about the real and relatable plot but who cares. Definitely seemed to be for more of an adult audience. One of those films that should go down as required viewing.	2
17b10d86-73aa-46f1-a58b-34c8056583d0	  The most heartwarming and beautiful Pixar film i've seen since Toy Story 3...this isn't just a kids film..it's much more than that. With great animation that has always been made with Pixar's film and well done voice acting put together to tell an extremely detailed and interesting story that give's you the feels almost as bad as Toy Story 3. This is the best film i've seen this year and i have a feeling it's going to stay that way 10/10...Hype is dead...9.5/10	2
128f2206-263b-4016-bd3d-c586ed0b79f6	  Funny and heartwarming "Inside Out" showcases Pixar at its best with witty dialogue and gorgeous animation. Amy Poehler is as lovable as ever as Joy and Phyllis Smith acts the perfect foil as Sadness. The rest of the emotion crew, including Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling), are equally hilarious. Richard Kind as Bing Bong the Imaginary Friend, however, may take the prize as the standout character with his wonderfully absurd and heartfelt antics. The film's plot suffers a bit from predictability, but is held up in the end by those trademark Pixar "feels". Overall, a great trip to the movies (especially if you can avoid the kiddies).	2
81380ba7-8e76-4e2f-8da6-12a46b82b6dd	  A fresh, original and much needed revival for Pixar. Inside Out conveys it's message in a fun, ingenious, and ultimately touching way. It's teaches people that it's ok to be emotional once in a while, and that your emotions are here to help you. With almost unanimous praise for this masterpiece of a film, I say to the great Mr Docter, that you would be crazy not to bless this film (and Up) with a sequel. Some young children won't grasp some of the concepts portrayed in this film, but that's ok, because Inside Out is a film that anyone, no matter how old, can relate to and enjoy.	2
bb27aba1-c245-4b88-b8fc-a8d4accd0b66	  A perfectly cast movie! And super creative - I loved the idea of "seeing" the emotions inside of people (and dogs and cats)! Very funny! But, for me, the journey of Joy and Sadness was much too long, and a bit boring. I started eagerly hoping we'd "get back to headquarters" - maybe even more than the characters were! Still, it's a fun, family movie and the end, with all the peeks into various brains, was great!p.s. - The short film before, "Lava", was so wonderful! Flat out wonderful!	1
e05ecfa6-fd9b-481c-aebd-dfdac3bd1629	  Such a travesty that David Oyelowo and Ava DuVernay were not nominated for Best Actor and Director Oscars. Oyelowo could and should have easily swept awards season (since McConaissance wasn't in the picture :-P) with his resonant basso and gut-rumbling delivery of MLK's marcato articulation. His dynamic gestures as well as his wide, knowing eyes carry the wins and losses of the Selma protest march and almost foreshadows the tragedy to come. Ava DuVernay's perceptive direction interweaves several concurrent threads: from the earth-shattering bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, to Annie Lee Cooper's stalwart struggles to vote, to MLK and Coretta Scott's marital strife.	2
ea886106-c185-4f15-bf50-eb5ff7ef7775	  A number of historical dramas fall into the trap of sugar-coating the details of its subject matter in order to stress the qualities of its protagonist. Selma doesn't fall into that trap.A masterclass in directing, 'Selma' is a gripping, hard-hitting and moving depiction of events in early 1965 that refreshingly presents its main character as a flawed but inspiring figure. It's not just required viewing because it addresses issues that unfortunately exist in contemporary society; it's required viewing because it's a freaking fantastic film.	2
5409f3b9-4f0c-446f-871b-78ec04a4d193	  SelmaInspiring, heartfelt, and resonate without being condescending or pandering, Selma is the rare example of Hollywood taking the civil rights genre seriously. Essentially a chronicle of the events leading up to, and the aftermath of, the famed march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, Selma is a film that looks at the civil rights struggle from a mature perspective. We are not treated to villains or saints, but instead people in a real-life struggle. We see MLK not as a pure man, but a flawed man with astute political calculations. We finally get a depiction of LBJ which is at least somewhat unflattering, a man whose treatment in history is much to whitewash.An overall even-handed and emotionally compelling film.4/5 Stars	2
061703d3-164b-456d-b583-a8c7c3c42dcd	  "Selma" looks at a short (six month) period in the life of Martin Luther King, where he invests his influence in a movement to establish real voting rights for blacks who have been systematically disenfranchised and intimidated. It is an important movie about significant times and events and, as such, in includes some shocking, confronting scenes that, quite frankly, make you ashamed to be a part of the human race. And, thankfully, it didn't canonise its subject matter, including reference to his marital infidelities. As King, David Oyelowo gives an outstanding performance that makes you wonder why he was not recognised by a Best Actor Oscar nomination in 2015.	2
a583158f-7db4-42b2-9fa4-5fa12d10abf9	  I admire Martin Luther King, very much. I have watched many such films, movies and made for television, and, this is the most disappointing, boring take on telling his tale that I have ever encountered. However, I read, in an article, that Oprah Winfrey starred in this movie and she was not in it, when it was rented from Red Box. And, the thing that I saw was so boring that there is no way 86 percent of anyone would like it, ever. So, that does make me wonder what they saw versus what was released in other places. That sort of shenanigans happens, you know?	0
d3905d5c-7b58-49f5-ac73-ec829e51d67b	  Watched this with my kids on Martin Luther King Day. These teenagers, who usually go for action and humor, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. So did I. It really gets you into the time and place of these events, and into the hearts of these real people who did incredibly brave things. Lives are lost. Domestic terrorism at its worst. How far we've come. But how far we still have to go.	2
b4869874-31b8-4301-a425-949c214cf12e	  Powerful, emotional depiction of a landmark moment in civil rights history.Alabama, 1965. While black citizens of Alabama constitutionally have the same voting rights as whites, they are hamstrung by racist local registration officers, politicians and lawmen. Dr Martin Luther King and his followers go to Selma, Alabama to attempt to achieve, through non-violent protest, equal voting rights and abilities for black people.A great telling of a great moment in history. Interesting from an historic perspective and powerfully and emotionally told.Great performances help too. David Oyelowo is superb as Martin Luther King. Excellent supporting performances too, especially from Tom Wilkinson (as President Johnson) and Tim Roth (as Governor George Wallace). How this movie wasn't nominated for any acting Oscars, I do not know.	2
f595b88d-d33b-4388-a7e1-d87c07a07ccc	  Selma is the true story of Dr Martin Luther King Jr and his movement to get equal voting rights of the town of Selma. David Oyelowo gives a stunning performance and is supported by fine acting from the cast around him. The story is brought to life with hard hitting scenes that are uncompromising and a soundtrack that really ties this captivating and compelling biopic up. This film has pain, joy, suspense, anger, pretty much every emotion possible and it delivers every single one with realism and efficiency without being over the top.	2
03054495-cada-43a1-96cc-e929005da769	  I'm giving Selma a bad review for one reason. It's blatantly and unapologetically historically inaccurate. This is a Hollywood trend that seems to be hitting biopics and period pieces really hard, and that is if there is something about a true story you don't like just change it to make your movie better.The movie falsely portrays President Lyndon B. Johnson as an enemy of MLK, going as far as using the FBI to discredit him. In reality this couldn't be farther from the truth. Selma was LBJ's idea, he considered the Voting Rights Act his greatest legislative achievement, he viewed King as an essential partner in getting it enacted, and he didn't use the FBI to disparage him. Did they really need to create lies in order to tell MLK's story? No, it's already good enough in full truth.	0
c4d9d0c8-3718-45c9-b8b0-0ebf298eabd2	  A biopic that took far too long to make. Good performances all around. The events around Selma leading to the March on Montgomery are faithfully recreated, reigniting the anger felt then, especially in view of what is happening today, 50 years later. The stubbornness, ignorance and brute force have survived. For some odd reason the film does not engage the viewer as it should. At least, not this one. But, that may be due to me remembering how it was when it happened. Bottom line: American heritage not to be thrown aside	2
1f9e71fd-2a7e-4828-a477-1d70b8198e46	  A very good film that links the actions of MLK and his supporters in Selma, AL to the eventual passage of the Voting Rights Acts. The biggest negative of the movie was all the cryptic typed government subtitles as if the information came from some secret government files. Government spying on MLK and his associates is certainly present in the film, but the subtitles were never tightly tied into the plot and seemed out of place and a distraction. Otherwise, a very good two hours spent with good acting for figures that you know from real life, a task that is never easy.	2
142db7a0-5c96-4f5e-8265-19325504db08	  Loved it!!!!! Very poignant and still relevant to this day. It's painfully obvious racism isn't dead, and this film captures the horror of racism in America. Very subtle, poignant performances by Oprah & Lorraine Toussaint. It was a truly ensemble film, I felt, so I can see why it felt short of all the awards, but it's nothing against the movie per se.	2
69cdb224-24a9-48da-bcae-a371845a8681	  Pretty good. Oyelowo did a pretty good job as MLK. A few complaints: many reports allege the tension between MLK and LBJ was contrived. I don't know. The more I learn about LBJ, the more I bet he was a difficult bastard to deal with. But on this particular issue, if there was little or no tension, it undermines the movie to suggest there was. The other complaint is the scope of the movie. It was a hugely important event. I guess I just think MLK did a lot of really great things. It almost seems funny that a 2-hour movie was made based on this particular one.	2
5dc4af59-eaf1-42a9-ba95-4042ee6225d7	  A film that tracks the later life of one of America's greatest Heroes, the film is a tough watch, to see the events during that time and here in 2015. Ava DuVernay's directing shows, one to watch out for, she's great. But David Oyelowo is amazing as MLK, his performance is great and sometimes make me film like it's the real MLK's ghost on screen. The supporting cast all shine in their individual moments. the film is very thought provoking and makes me as a human think. A beautiful film that deserves a best picture nod, and dare i say it, winning.	2
f62dcf21-2d10-4611-839a-120809b60702	  Moving. Truly. And three things come to mind:1) Everyone should watch this in these days where most people in western societies do not experience oppression but complaint about frivolous things. Everyone should know about Martin Luther King and the oppression of black americans (that still goes on, after all these years).2) You can fight a cause without violence. That takes courage, and nerve, but it is the right thing to do.3) This was the only Oscar Best Feature contender in 2015 that was never shown in theaters in Finland. The only one! Seriously! It says plenty. I know, lack of theaters and not great audience expected etc. But sadly it says plenty: we do not think movies about black people would be interesting to Finns!! Sad.	2
9bf05f0f-7b09-4e58-aa9f-9c01eeebdaa6	  Selma is a triumphant film that takes us into the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as he leads the people of Selma to a greater and better future. The film has powerful themes of racial equality, corruption, love and power and is truly a great showcase of new time director, Ava DuVernay's talents as a visionary film maker and David Oyelowo's performance as King Jr. is truly phenomenal and powerful, expect big things from Oyelowo. Highly recommend this film to viewers interested in history and/or biopics	2
decc0406-0db9-435d-856e-0dd79641fea6	  This film is not just an homage to Martin Luther King. He get�s his role, but more important is the civil rights movement, the dirty politics and the astonishing display of racism in the American society. Catchy and with its ending not just a piece of history, but connecting to our times and the ongoing struggle for equality and human rights. Watching it, the movie does not let your mind rest and if you want so that�s its only downside.	2

7d9789ee-75d6-47bb-8970-a52a50a4898a	  I think everyone should see Selma. Towards the middle of the movie I was beginning to feel angry about the nonviolent movement. Just seeing people getting beaten and killed. But then I started to see how the movement came together. After the movie I just wanted to weep because I was overcome with different emotions of seeing people coming together but also the struggle of something that is a part of our history. Also, David Oyelowo was amazing in his portrayal of MLKjr.	2
8b7250d8-5c55-4238-ac7b-06a9e2326b77	  Powerful, is the best way to describe this movie and even though it's far from flawless it totally succeeds in the end and is extremely powerful. The film is a little long, especially in the middle, but it's ending is so moving, you forget a lot of the film's flaws. David Oyelowo is great as Dr. King, especially when he gives his speeches (which are mostly original as another film studio holds the rights to those speeches). I love the flashbacks at the end and the closing song, 'Glory' by Common and John Legend. Overall, even though this film isn't a perfect film is accomplishes what many movies set out to do as it moves its viewers and was one of the most powerful films I've seen in a long time.	2
805432b5-0718-4b84-9240-e2a5fdae42a1	  What a great adaptation of the Civil Rights movement of the early 60's following MLK Jr. I can't describe this film in more then a word: amazing cause everything about it is incredibly accurate and music, filming, of course the actors were all top notch. It accurate portrays the struggles Civil Right activist had during one of the biggest tipping points of US history (does the US stay pro-white as things worked they way they were or does the US change its policy making all equal and changing how society operates) either could have been good or bad. It shows the struggle of MLK to give freedoms to non-whites. Fantastic movie10/10	2
4ea0ea5a-c51d-4b81-b009-cb0d7b7736fa	  The story of Martin Luther King's fight for equal voting rights. The man need no future introduction, but here we mostly follow marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. Marches that made huge inpact on the matter.Well produced and superbly acted. Educational and a nice flick that never is a true bore, something that I feared it could be - but this is a very engaging film with a great historical matter.A solid film that does it's job but nothing more, really.7 out of 10 batons.	2
911b84c9-1b68-4653-abd7-976625848c7a	  "Selma" is probably the best film about Martin Luther King to date; not a definitive biopic, but a complex look at his strategizing and his relationships with the White House and other civil rights groups during the Selma marches which led to the Voting Rights Act. A powerful story fuels a movie that was good, but could have been great. The indoor shots are too shadowy and the supporting characters seem under-developed, making Selma harder to follow for people who don't know the history behind the movie.	2
c1f64618-6cd5-451c-84e3-c0f699749a88	  Very powerful movie. You realise the similarity to Gandhiji in the movie also. Acting is outstanding from all involved. The sound is not overbearing. The shots are perfect, the close ups plus the pans. A great insight into the mind of one of the smartest peaceful activists. Family issues were also delved into but not in melodrama. In fact, in this kind of a movie, it is very easy to fall into the melodrama trap but the director does a great job to maintain reality and subtlety. Must watch!	2
b76fc206-0de0-48d3-a302-9a648d399c29	  Selma: "One Dream Can Change the World." Truly, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream did change the world for the better. This movie shows us how Selma, Alabama played a very important part toward realizing key changes in the civil rights of men and women of color, and all citizens of the United States. David Oyelowo does a fantastic job as Martin Luther King Jr., and the supporting cast is terrific as well. I felt the pain. I felt the struggle. I felt the anger. I felt the joy. I felt the sighs of relief. I felt Selma.	2
f6b228d6-3e50-407a-8cec-fdb21b393a42	  The movie acts as if every black person during the movie's time setting was a well educated person. It also acted as if 99% of the white people in the movie were racist bigots who wanted to murder all the blacks. Neither of these were true. While it did a good job at portraying what had happened back in those times, it also gave an innacurate portrayal of the time's people as well.	1
314a319b-1013-4bdf-89d3-220bf71f0025	  I understand why DuVernay wasn't nominated for a Best Director Oscar after watching this. This was a good movie, neither bad nor great though, it had a strong cast with good performances, but it was done in a fairly dull and uninteresting way; lacking much passion, tension, or really much feeling albeit some short emotional moments here and there. A little better quality than a TV movie bio. Dr. King's story is a great one though and the actors did their parts well, but overall this was just an okay film.	1
2df47da3-fa95-4539-a82f-f6b1b9cb2da3	  Selma disappointed me due to its unispired and straighforward storytelling. It is not memorable nor poignant nor original. Likewise, some characters are given unsatisfying arcs (Coretta) and some are dubiously portrayed (Johnson). Still, what makes it worth watching is Oyelowo�s strong performance as Martin Luther King Jr. because besides portraying the historical figure we all know about, he gives him depth, presenting him as a flawed and internally conflicted human being. There is always more than simply goodnes and morality to a person.	2
f532b5b8-2847-4647-8b07-76482afa36f2	  When you finish Selma and realize that David Oyelowo was not nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award and Ava DuVernay was not nominated for Best Director, it really hurts. Yeah, they're just awards and this film and performances will be remembered for years to come, but it really is painful that they did not get the recognition they deserved. Oyelowo commands the screen as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and this supporting cast is so good. The writing and direction is outstanding. Selma is a film that is NEEDS to be seen.	2
2aab0295-1c05-4e3c-8ebf-67cc62c87b1e	  I hope that this film is historically accurate, because there are many things in it that I did not know, which is what made it so interesting. I really loved that it delved into the inner-workings of the Civil Rights Movement as they planned and strategized. It really gives in-depth look into the world of grass roots politics and how to work the system from the outside in. Sure they focused on a bit too many characters and it would definitely been helped if it had just been streamlined to deal with the person we are most interested in, but it does not completely destroy the movie. It might not have been the most innovative film ever made, but some times it is simply enough to tell a good story well.	2
82b94f6b-ecd9-4b61-ae32-95d5df3bd64e	  "Selma" is a stunning biopic about an incredibly inspirational historical figure. The movie is powerful and resonates deeply with its brutally realistic portrayal of the time period. David Oyelowo does truly spectacular work in his performance and was snubbed of an Oscar nomination. His delivery of every line of dialogue is superb and believable, and you feel like you see MLK speaking opposed to somebody just playing him. This movie is an all around impactful film fueled by great performances and relevant issues in history. It is one of my favorite films from 2014 and one of the best movies about the civil rights movement I have seen.	2
a200cf60-d2d2-4816-80d5-32e31c537c91	  Brilliantly acted, Selma is backed up with a complex and well-written script that brings out the historical characters that the textbooks present and humanizes them. The script is full of historical references that all create a rich, full atmosphere that immerses the viewer almost as much as a complex, well written TV show. The movie also exceeds in making this movie about the march from Selma to Montgomery and the political and social relations that surround it. The protagonist is Martin Luther King, but he is neither glorified nor is his death, which is always regarded as a tragic yet overused moment, featured, which makes the film seem that much more original and clever. The only problem was the cinematography that I found bland, trite, or cliche.	2
a06a6af8-cca8-4340-812c-a3f8d0077301	  A powerful, emotional and engaging film that should be shown in schools from now on. It sort of reminded me of Spielberg's 'Lincoln', in the sense that this film also focuses on a pivotal moment in the protagonist's life, rather than their life as a whole. David Oyelowo and the writers did an exemplary job humanizing Martin Luther King in the quieter scenes where he is not giving empowering speeches. I loved that he was not portrayed as a flawless man. Why he did not receive an Oscar nomination at the very least, is beyond me. I also enjoyed the political aspects and different points of view from everyone involved. I'd recommend everyone to watch this.	2
d0bf6423-ee1e-4fe4-afa5-2e9863965835	  This movie blew hard! I can't believe it got such a praise. A two hour historic race card just wasn't my forte, I suppose. The fact that I'm not black and wasn't around during this time has nothing to do with why I found this movie so boring. It was a good story, but a really boring film. If you haven't seen it, wait until it's an "ABC World Premiere".	0
50a1a855-fb03-4755-93b9-69a650efc988	  It was a good movie. But not powerful enough. It was really slow, violence and too long... David Oyelowo was really Martin Luther King Jr. His performance was great and he needed to get Oscar nomination. But I was thinking like this, history of Martin Luther King Jr. was great. But his movie was not really great. I was really tired to watch it... Co-Executive Produced by Brad Pitt. Oscar winner for best song.	1
a06372fd-a153-4139-95a8-5fd19a5af1a6	  Selma has fine direction, a couple of wonderfully developed characters, involving and important story and a powerhouse performance from David Oyelowo, but it is also a flawed movie thanks to some not well developed characters, a couple of annoying choices with slow-motion and at times very standard approach. The approach here is the biggest problem and it is very polarizing - it is at times very grounded and wonderfully realistic, but at times also very typical, never quite distinguishing itself from other movies of this type and the film unfortunately lacks the energy and inherent power that it should have had.	2
8fd23fa5-5766-40b1-bd09-c958c2a58f13	  A very good movie and I think something that should be remembered today. There is a way to protest and a way to make progress without being violent. Dr. King's way is a good way as it draws attention and if there is violence it is not from you. Turn this into today, what can we do to turn the situations around? No rioting, no violence, and no looting. Be peaceful, be mindful...... think forward. Demand change sure but what change do you want? Not all law enforcement is bad so let us look at cameras as a way that can tell part of the story and help us see what happens. We live in a country where we can ask for this and we can get it be applying pressure, without violence, to those in power. Rally together and not apart. Peace to victory, peace to change......	2
87477789-c108-4f5e-8876-fd322354cc85	  Selma is an excellent movie that lived up to my expectations. I actually wanted to see a biopic movie about Martin Luther King Jr. as it's fascinating about what he has done that change history. David Oyelowo is amazing in this that I'm surprised that he didn't get nominated for best actor in the Oscars. The directing and the writing are really good, and the rest of the acting is great. It's actually human to see that Martin Luther King Jr has no idea if it's going to work, and instead thinks that it's not going to work, but still tries no matter what. The soundtrack is really good, and the characters are memorable, especially Martin Luther King Jr. himself. Selma is a memorable movie that I know that many schools would use this for history classes.	2
e39d2cf9-20c2-4cbe-9c85-d386abcb1102	  Not once are the images and acts of savagery intended to disturb or lay way for cheap shock value. They tell a story of an American history so important, so evil, but so necessary. I was reminded of the many other films, based on racism, The Help, 12 Years a Slave, The Butler, etc. At first I thought, "Why another one?".Selma humbly stands at the very tip of the spear with it's undeniable truth of what it means to be an American people, there are no heroes. I have a responsibility, and so do you.	2
16660c6a-5417-4d16-ab2f-e871c5592880	  84%Saw this on 7/5/15Not a biopic of Martin Luther King, but it's the story of Selma, the place where King fought for equal rights to vote for black people. Selma benefits from a fantastic performance from David Oyelowo and stylish direction from Ava DuVernay. However, what irritates me is that the film is too dimly lit and even the most brightest scenes have a somewhat foggy effect on screen, a true eyesore.	2
f9c95191-2217-4b67-9545-716bd7544684	  It's mind boggling to see what went on back then. I never saw it directly, and being out of state back then is like being on another planet now. It boggles the mind how somebody can look at another person and say you can't drink or eat here, worship here, vote here, live here. Dr. King was an amazing man, and I wish we had leadership for our young people now like him.	2
d8ddea5a-04e1-4297-955e-6a0c03e09b02	  Very good movie. David Oyelowo is outstanding in his portrayal of Dr. Martin Luther King. This is a history lesson that should be seen by everyone. No matter your color, there are moments in this movie that will make you angry, make you sad, and at the same time encouraged by the positive potential we all possess. A bit too intense for very small children.That's why I suggest you buy, for when they're old enough to understand. Yes, buy in Blu-Ray for the historical extras.	2
e218dc14-5762-466b-9d21-0a81fd343720	  The 1964 the Civil Rights Act legally disgregated the South but the town Selma remained very dangerous for black people. On the background of the march from this Alabama town to the state capitol in Montgomery, the movie tells a piece of American hisotry in a way, thankfully, very different from the dutiful but ossified history lesson which are typical of the films of this genre. I found "Selma" beautifully staged even when the events it depicts are at their ugliest and very naturally acted which is a big bonus. The pace of the film is not too fast and this is good because the topic deserves the audience attention to the words.	2
6cee3bec-f7e8-45a2-8917-593e01a05c11	  Of course this is an important movie, but the director got lazy and assumed that people were familiar with the events that take place. Several events on the timeline do not advance or integrate with the story but are there only as a marker that "hey we didn't forget to add (Malcolm X, the church bombing, etc.) to this movie." It seemed like these parts were just thrown in and not tied to the rest of the narrative. It also seemed like if you were going to include X in the story, you should have explained the major philosophical differences between him and Dr. King and why King's strategy worked but X's did not. There was some cursory explanation but if X had been acting on screen instead of just talking on screen that would have worked better.	2
be3642d5-217b-48be-b9c2-0a495fc6ae74	  I consider a good, dramatic, inspirational, freedom-seeking movie, one that is a real tear jerker. Well, I had a near-tear moment in this one, twice. So this film gets a good rating. If you are a hateful, ignorant, racist, homophobic person, then this movie is designed to open your mind just a little bit. For everyone else, this is status quo, as far as treating people equally goes. A++	2
c630cca3-6d92-45fb-82b9-43ca5d19c93f	  Great heartwarming film. What the Black ppl went through. The film tells the life and times of Dr. Martin Luther King. He was wanting MAINLY voting rights for the Black People of the Americas. As they didn't get the voting rights, they went on numerous protests as expected. This year 2015, back in March(if I can remember), saw 50 years ago, when Dr. Martin Luther King, CROSSED Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. They were wanting to cross the bridge to excercise their consitutional right to vote in Montgomery, Alabama.	2
c343b6e9-7571-4c11-985a-2265f14369d2	  Its about time they made a Dr King Jr movie., I have to say I have been waiting for this ever since I saw the Malcolm X movie...so so many years ago (damn, I'm old).I think it was brilliant to focus on one event rather than go into the whole life of Dr King, goes to show you that the movement was more important than the man., for a man he is, full of faults, full of hopes, full of opposition from unlikely places too.I enjoyed this look into what was going on behind the scenes, behind the speeches but in the end it didn't drive home like I thought it would. No fault of the actors or the production., and no point in pinpointing where the fault is when all I want to say is that you should watch this.	2
e76cbd38-3314-43ee-a687-5fb87e9cebc4	  Such a travesty that David Oyelowo and Ava DuVernay were not nominated for Best Actor and Director Oscars. Oyelowo could and should have easily swept awards season (since McConaissance wasn't in the picture :-P) with his resonant basso and gut-rumbling delivery of MLK's marcato articulation. His dynamic gestures as well as his wide, knowing eyes carry the wins and losses of the Selma protest march and almost foreshadows the tragedy to come. Ava DuVernay's perceptive direction interweaves several concurrent threads: from the earth-shattering bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, to Annie Lee Cooper's stalwart struggles to vote, to MLK and Coretta Scott's marital strife.	2
697ebdf6-e6cb-46ce-b4fb-05e36ab9aadf	  This 2014 brought us great movies, but at the end of the year the best of all was release, Selma is exactly what we call a film without mistakes. The story of Dr. King never had been projected as in this film, personally I think that David Oyelowo made one of the more cogent and heartfelt performances ever. Was needed a good direction for a movie with this historical load and Ava DuVernay was able to do it perfectly. 10/10	2
7571842a-76c8-49dd-907f-e3eb5a92c203	  Selma is a powerful and moving film. It is about a chronicle of Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965. David Oyelowo and Carmen Ejogo give incredible performances. The script is well written. Ava DuVernay did an awesome job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the drama and history. Selma is a must see.	2
47704ed4-f2ce-4f69-9b5e-84b9840faf33	  The film has minor inherent flaws (Oprah's character wasn't necessary, the historic license may have been a bit unwise, and a couple scenes could have been cut), but Selma's compelling acting, especially from David Oyelowo as Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., who not only looks fairly like Dr. King but also has legitimate acting chops, as well as rich dialogue, riveting political and social scenes, and the refusal to shy away from the brutality of the protests (It's surprising that the first protest on the Edmund Pettus bridge was accomplished on a PG-13 movie) combine to make Selma one of the most gripping biopics in years. Verdict: A	2
d6076247-cc96-4b2c-92a6-a7308e79c3f1	  SELMA MOVIE WAS EXCELLENT! I AM GOING TO SEE IT AGAIN AT MOVIELAND BECAUSE IT HAS SO MANY GOOD LESSONS IN IT SUCH AS CHANGING HISTORY AND USING THE MEDIA TO ADVERTISE A POINT, INCLUDING ALL RACES TO MARCH ARM IN ARM AND PEACEFUL PROTEST, PERSEVERENCE, FAITH, INTELLIGENCE TO QUOTE AND STAND FIRM ON. WE STILL HAVE ISSUES WITH POLICE BRUTALITY AND BULLYING NOT JUST OF BLACKS BUT ALSO WHITES THAT ARE BULLIED AND BEATEN TO DEATH. LET'S USE MARTIN LUTHER KINGS LESSONS TO CHANGE HISTORY AGAIN AND MARCH ARM AND ARM AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY NATIONWIDE. WE NEED A POWERFUL INTELLIGENT LEADER TO ORGANIZE AS MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS AND TO USE FAITH, GOD TO DRIVE A POINT AND ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE ARM AND ARM AND MARCH TO CHANGE HISTORY AGAIN AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY. LET'S USE THE POINTS IN SELMA MOVIE TO STAND UNITED AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY.	2
0ec5c122-29e1-4cc6-9856-dae619078f35	  See it. Make sure your kids see it. The star of this show is the history, which is depicted with emotion, and without undue sentimentality. The acting is uniformly excellent. The story is powerful. The production is careful and thorough. The scenes of white violence are perfectly shown. The detail is superb in the period interiors, the cars and the clothing. There are great speeches by Martin Luther King Jr that are not as often heard, as well as the contributions of other African American leaders. We are reminded of Johnson's and Wallace's roles. An indispensable film, that should grace every cinema and library, not only in America, but everywhere.	2
b1450747-6dd9-4993-92f4-4a4c4f32d019	  Good film and timely too. Some great performances, but they really should have made more of Carmen Ejogo in her role as Coretta Scott King. To be honest I expected more from the film and although I did learn more about the Civil Rights Movement by watching Selma my view is that there have been better films on the subject. This is still an important film and one that I will be adding to my DVD collection.	2
597bc16b-013b-43a8-a85e-487c997d827e	  It's hard to believe these events are merely one life-time away. David Oyelowo gives a commanding performance as Dr Martin Luther King, and it's easy to see why some felt he missed out on not getting an Oscar nomination. Uncomfortable viewing at times, but thankfully violence is not overplayed, in fact much of the film concentrates on behind the scenes action, with King's family and debate among other activists, almost introspective. For long periods I could just hear the steady sound of crunching from the kids in the row behind me munching their way through a seemingly never-ending bucket of nachos. The story is a very worthy one to be told, and surprisingly long overdue to be made.	2
a63fbf4f-fa2b-4105-a0d9-ea5c542c39e7	  The true power of this film marking 50 years from the actual events is in the focus on the issue behind the events and not on personality.The start is shocking, the meat of the film is riveting as different factions, certainty and uncertainty intersect across the movement for equality and the racist establishment in the south. But this is no cardboard villain show down for the large part with even Governor Wallace being shown to have been a defender for the rights of the poor )whites) but as was typical, a blind racist.Great performances and tight editing make for powerfully compulsive viewing.Don't be eating or drinking at the start.	2
5e11cd80-dc4d-41e9-a0a1-9aa1b62b79cd	  I didn't see any of the Oscar nominated films this year except Selma. I thought Selma had its moments but just wasn't a great film and had lots of problems -- poorly-written dialogue, a confusing crux, a lack of oratory, the best actors playing small parts, constricted camera shots, too much about the Kings' domestic conflict, too much about LBJ (he could have appeared just once or twice). It maybe attempts to be restrained but comes across as constricted and lacking the full range of affect and emotional depth. It doesn't even come close to a film like Spike Lee's 4 Little Girls, which was nominated in the past. Another film that comes to mind is Malcolm X, which is an excellent and masterful portrayal of a charismatic figure. The fact that King's family didn't endorse this film speaks volumes.	0
740ff8e2-a4b8-4f5d-b4b3-075a7325549b	  I don't know how this film failed to get more nominations at the Oscars than it did. No Best Actor nod, no Best Director, no Screenplay, no nothing. Regardless of that fact this film knocks it out of the park. Riveting and suspenseful even knowing full well what happens and we get to see Dr. King and Dr. King be uncertain and careful. And we get to see people be ticked with him too.Fabulously made film that did not get anywhere near the recognition it deserved.	2
5c084af2-93d6-48c9-9566-9c529454f4f4	  One thing I will say about films about civil rights and similar topics is that they should elicit strong emotions. The fact that I came out of Selma feeling quite angry is testament to the power of the way the film was made. Last year The Butler and Mandela were relatively light portrayals of recent black history and they didn't do their subjects any real justice. Selma emphasises the wrongs that occurred in America only a few generations ago and by concentrating on specific events it amplifies the emotional response. David Oyelowo is surprisingly nuanced as King, it is a powerful performance that is big when it needs to be but for the most part it is understated. It should have received awards recognition, there are no two ways about it (just what was Oscar smoking this year?).	2
e48f0df4-58f5-45d3-bf20-42f8266f652a	  Selma is an outstanding movie, a true story which comes to life on the screen. Mr Oyelowo's performing is really, really good, he once again gives life to Martin Luther King's words, to his believes and his thoughts. His interpretation is complicated, you can understand the mole of work he had to do to interpret the 1964 Nobel Prize Winner. I was very disappointed seeing this movie nominated for only two Oscars, it should have deserved more in my personal view.By the way I am glad I went to the cinema watching Selma last night, I learnt more about a giant piece of modern History and I am thankful.	2
4382e0ef-5338-4a38-89ab-60eced3bfa00	  saw Selma today with family, having already seen it once before--and have also seen most of the other nominees for Best Picture-(not Whiplash)--my rankings--Selma, Best Picture (by a lot), American Sniper, runner up (wouldn't mind seeing this win), Birdman, Imitation Game and Theroy of Everything tied for 3rd (all good films), then Boyhood (which is remarkable, but really annoying too, I felt), and way in the rear, the Wes Anderson film (though I love some of his earlier movies)--Selma is just a GREAT film, the reason movie awards exist is films like this--see it, every American would benefit from doing so I feel--	2
58692dc2-1d00-48c7-801e-f6e0f2a7f815	  Selma was about the struggle to get the equal voting right for all and an important chapter in American history. This film reminds us not to take that right for granted and that we need more fearless leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. The greatest injustice of the Academy Awards is the fact that David Oyelowo was not recognized for his portrayal of MLK. He made the icon into a man of flesh and blood. So powerful was his performance that I had had chills running down my spine!!!	2
335d5f81-99e8-4f00-8c45-19f7fe30bcf6	  Selma is a good film that could have been slightly better. Does it deserve and Oscar nomination, yes I think so. I preferred it to Boyhood and Birdman which I felt were really over-rated films, but like those two films, I feel like that this film is really aiming for an Oscar and often that can be a film's downfall. Where as I felt films like The Imitation Game were just trying to be a good film. Does that detract from the film, not too much though it also detracts from the fact that the cast and characters do feel slightly under-used. I really enjoyed this film for all the right reasons. It did some excellent commentary on some recent dark history, it gave some outstanding performances from various cast members and I wouldn't mind seeing it again at some point and is a great credit to director Ava DuVernay.	2
a715d1ba-4d4b-4510-ac2b-51da80fb1bd4	  Selma is an essential film to see. Not because it is a great film, although it is very good, but because this is a subject that still totally deserves to have a light shine on it very brightly. Martin Luther King was an icon and a hero and David Oyelowo plays him with perfect dignity. The film focuses on the march in Selma in 1965. All the main players are there, LBJ, George Wallace, Ralph Abernathy and the film really captures well in many powerful scenes the danger and emotion of the times. A very fine film that sometimes falls in sentimentalism and the direction is well crafted rather than original, but it achieves its aims in spades.	2
49b34fee-59bc-4e61-8851-ebed3a776362	  A brutal yet touching look at the personal life of Martin Luther King while taking the audience through his journey to battle 101 demons waving confederate flags and ready to kill any African American insight.Selma metaphorically bridges the gap between MLK's time and ours, showing our adopted apathy towards a fight that is still ongoing but almost forgot about in the world; the right to be human regardless of orientation, skin color or moral choices.	2
697d9d2d-a9fd-4b33-8f51-1ca11f9d414d	  This movie was one that showed just one piece of the puzzle that was Dr. King's amazing heroism, and difficult struggles from family to organizing. A well done film that will be one to last. I am at a loss for words as to how amazing this movie is, from the acting, to the cinematography, just an all out, well done film. It was gritty, unafraid to depict some of the major events that played out during the Civil Rights Movement, and showing some of the different aspects of Dr. King's life in the process.	2
491d9090-fd23-4e24-99d2-882f75700adc	  Selma plays out a beautiful script, helped by the fantastic words of Martin Luther King who is played excellently by David Oyelowo. With a big cast of different characters, often the film can become crowded, but never suffocating Oyelowo and his tough performance. With strong emotional and visual moments, it's Selma's lack of boldness that stops it standing out amongst the crowd, but is never the less and inspirational and powerful biopic.	2
eb806775-dcf7-46fa-a512-ac6f026576c2	  In 1965 Dr Martin Luther King Jr started a dangerous movement in order to gain the same rights for black people that the white folk have been afforded. King wanted the right to vote for ever black man and woman and wouldnt stop pursuing the cause so a march from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery which resulted in President Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The film was brilliantly told and the acting was superb most noticeably from David Oyelowo (King). Its nice to finally have a film to tell this story and being someone who has been interested in the history of people like Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King it was great to have a history lesson of great quality and accuracy that this provided	2
d5828c7a-718d-4cdf-bce9-9095b35631ad	  If the civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 was half as drawn out and painstaking as "Selma", the movie that tells us about this moment in history, then it was certainly an epic test of endurance. I wanted so badly to like this movie because it is so well made, and perfectly acted, and it tries so hard to be honest and righteous, but it is so damned slow and plodding that I felt myself almost willing Luther King to triumph in his endeavours just so the film could end. The best parts of the movie are undoubtedly the magnificent speeches delivered by King which are now legend but if I wanted to hear these I would prefer listening to the actual recordings no matter how well David Oyelowo performs them. Only 3 out of 5 I'm afraid to say.	1
da62ee20-4671-4ccb-a537-67ed94d196a4	  I've said this many times about biopics based on significant historical figures... sometimes, a feature-length movie isn't enough to do their true-life character justice. Maybe producers should consider an HBO mini-series perhaps. Of course, having said that, there are exceptions to this. "Selma" serves as a great snapshot of the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr, but I'd have been keen to see a whole series highlighting more than just one part of the man's story. Oyelowo definitely delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.	1
c8e11591-554c-4cf4-b80f-c5d7945f0ac3	  From a historical standpoint, this movie is so important. It shows how far we've come, but how far we still have to go as a country. Also, most MLK movies portray him almost as a saint. This movie portrays him as a man. A great man, but a man who worries about his wife, kids, and everyone involved in his protests. This is also helped by a powerful performance from David Oweloyo. He was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Along with showing MLK as a man, we saw the behind the scenes struggle to even make the march happen, which made it even more meaningful. My only complaint about this movie is that the middle drags. Even though the behind the scenes is interesting, the middle is a lot of people talking at each other for long periods of time. But overall, this movie shouldn't be ignored.	2
bf36b8c7-4ce4-482e-966a-40bfa9774d2a	  David Oyelowo was completely raped by the Academy. His performance was so much more deserving of a nomination over other contenders. Overall, it's a great film. I have a very serious problem with the way the politicians were depicted in the film. Multiple times in the film LBJ and George Wallace refer to bleeding-hearts, liberals, and progressives in derogatory terms, which the majority of the public would likely assume indicates that they were Republican. This is an implication by omission due to the fact that BOTH LBJ and Wallace were DEMOCRATS and this information was conveniently excluded from the film, never to be mentioned. It makes me wonder if either actually was a Republican if the same omission would have been made. I seriously doubt it. Also, am I the only person that finds it completely bizarre that so many black people worship a Semitic god given to them by white people?	2
37868b19-5bad-4739-b3c3-d3300f52aaee	  The title is accurate. It's the story of Selma with MLK as the constant, as opposed to a biopic.It's a good piece of filmmaking. DuVernay's direction is top-notch. She should have been given an Oscar nomination (admittedly, the field is crowded this year). The story is important and well-told. The varied points of view are well complemented to each other. The personal touches (like when everybody pours into that kitchen for breakfast) bring the characters to earth, and make them real. Debates with the president, who was on-side, showed how difficult the battle was.Go see it.	2
8460f777-cec7-442e-a8f0-33a57231fdc6	  Though slow at points, Ava DuVernay's delicate handling of a story of this gravity is to be commended. Never has a story involving so much violence and hatred been told with so much poise. With a spotlight on racism in the 60s, Selma manages to teach a piece of Martin Luther King Jr's life (played by an unbelievably powerful David Oyelowo) that has barely been taught past the surface level in history textbooks. This is an important film to be watched, not just for its historic content, but for its applications to modern day racism still prevalent in the United States.	2
4003d7cb-055f-4a34-93fe-20f0be9f773d	  A little girl wailed and had to leave the theater traumatized by the first two scenes of violence. For me this aspect was wherethe power of the film lay. Regrettably many of the political scenes felt hallow. I understand why people are move by the film, both for an against. I understand that the director has said this is a fictional interpretation of history. I found that convoluted the film and made it sadly feel less than true. Still it was powerful.	2
7f006005-d490-4097-b647-305f76f62741	  Emersive and engaging this film should have been getting awards a plenty as David Oyelowo turns out a performance that beats Chiwetel hands down. Ava DuVernay wrote a script that, while not using the classic speeches, invokes the power and belief that moved people to action and MLK to international recognition. The script is so amazing with some create speeches and inactions between even minor characters. Beautiful and affecting because you understand everyone's motivations.	2
0da7f1a6-2937-4181-a3eb-ae6cf1593963	  A quietly directed, but powerfully moving cinematic experience. A colorful and diverse cast provides a backdrop for a very human portrayal of King, with Oyelowo shining here as a crusader struggling with his own doubts and external forces encouraging him to compromise. It's a shame this film didn't get more attention from the Academy awards, because it deserves to be a focal point for discussions of the methods that can be employed to deconstruct racism, even in our new millennium.	2
4e946080-26c4-4733-abc1-595d84b77abf	  A true masterpiece of powerful cinema. From undeniabe performances by the cast focused mainly on Oyelowo to deft direction that impressively ties together the stories of the man, the movement and the harsh realities of politics at under LBJ. While sometimes these different threads can bite into each other a little, for such a relatively inexperienced director - DuVernays really packs in enough gut punches to make you feel a little giddy leaving the theatre with Oyelowo's powerful recreation of the spellbinding rhetoric ringing in your ears.	2
0b01c974-219b-43cc-beed-3fcf0c7b89bd	  This movie is about a place and time, a man, a very human man, who fights for something greater than himself, and weathers the sacrifices this entails. I would have liked to see more of the stories of the supporting characters. The losses along the way felt like deep tragedies and part of me wanted to know more. The movie moves at its own easy pace which allows for a deep sinking in of the atmosphere of the time.	2
8e759db3-ce4a-41f9-a5f8-4422f05fba96	  The film's high praise I fear is due to its reverential subject matter. David Oyelowo is quite good, but the characters never come alive. The film just sort of meanders to King's inevitable victory. Its depiction of LBJ is wildly inaccurate; its depiction of George Wallace fails to show why he opposed desegregation (it was a way to get votes). So he becomes simply a fool and a boogeyman, which dilutes his true evil. Not a terrible film, but many critics think they have to praise it or else look "racist" even if everything tells them this is a rather unremarkable movie.	1
46dbfb18-f3a1-4e32-a879-a88ed746dfe7	  Given the recent events in the states the past year and human rights in general, Selma is an important movie. Ava Duvernay directs this film with depth and honest brutality. Anchored by a powerful performance from David Oyelowo and strong supporting cast, Duvernay shows Martin Luther King jr. warts and all. Great cinematography from Bradford Young enhances the well written screenplay aided further by a good score. This is defintely a good film and an important one but I didn't find myself completely connecting with the film, it felt a bit too clinical to me. Though I think it's great I wasn't blown away.	2
e7bdf0dd-cf07-4793-a244-ca622cea5215	  I really don't have anything light or flippant to say about this one. It manages to be revealing and educational. It is a fine piece of story telling. It puts us in the moment, with all the insecurities. David Oyelowo manages a herculean feat in this portrayal of a man who, to many of us, has become a legend. Selma is also artful, if less than subtle about reminding us of the issues of today, specifically regarding the Voting Rights Act. It would a shame to walk away, and think "Well good, problem solved"	2
a5018145-5aca-4afc-a923-f5279d8fe978	  A films that has caused alot of controversy due to lack of award noms espicially the oscars. Its a good story based on the march from Alabma to Mongomery as the black people fight for their right to vote. Some parts are horrific and shocking to watch. The acting is just amazing and its a shame David Oyelowo gives an standout performance and its a shame he hasnt been recognised. Other cast memebrs are also good like Wilkison, Roth and Winfry.POWERFUL IMPORTANT A MUST SEE	2
70a3edc9-4604-4f44-8c26-a4a053d39b62	  While it looks like a blatant Oscar-bait movie, it was better than that. It had something it wanted to say, and did so in a not heavy handed matter. I appreciate the subtlety of the story, but it became a little preachy by the end. Considering what it could have been though, no complaints on that area.I think my opinion of it will probably fall, as the ending leaves a little to be desired, but still a great movie with an incredible portrayal of an iconic man.	2
8ef5575a-d290-4d5f-b112-638ef60f7fd9	  SELMA offers a new perspective on the legacy of MLK. It doesn't glorify him, but gives a deeper understanding of the trepidation, danger, rejection, and doubt that MLK went through during the Civil Rights Era. It shows a man willing to risk everything for his people, but it also shows a man who questions his approach, and questions his own decisions. SELMA does justice to MLK by showing just how hard a life like his would be, and how hard it was for him to keep choosing to live it when he wasn't being forced to.	2
e0fb8f55-2c20-4751-ac73-7362f3ab3f52	  Refreshingly un-Hollywoodish. I hope it wins the Oscar for cinematography. It was subtle, but they did an impressive job of making the film look like it did back then with washed-out blues and heavy oranges. I liked the acting, with the exception of Martin Sheen whose usual over-acting dragged down two scenes. Tom Wilkonson is one of our finest actors. I also liked the portrayal of the difficult marriage of Martin and Coretta. I don't know how faithful it is to the facts but it is an excellent sub-plot in the movie.	2
40d3d659-bc35-4359-a947-6e07a80a5ca2	  This movie was one of the few movies that I actually saw value in. I aint no movie critic, but this one looked special since I could relate to the racism in it. Anywho, this movie is very inspirational and should be ranked higher than american sniper since I see much more historical importance in it. I recommend everybody to see it since you dont usually see the victim's point of view of racism in a movie	2
e5e4a981-50f1-4b0e-8b9b-d12bed387ff6	  A Film that would make you think, wonder and research. A Stunning film that gives you the confidence to stand up for what you believe in, no matter how big the obstacle is or how impossible the task is. andMan, what a performance from David Oyelowo. An Oscar worthy performance if you ask me. Ava DuVernay probably should have gotten a nomination for her stunning directional work. Somehow last year's Best Song nominated "Ordinary Love", soundtrack for "Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom" has its very big similarities with this amazing song "Glory" by John Legend and Common. The main themes and issues tackled in the movies speak for itself. Certainly the favorite for the Oscars also.A cinematic masterpiece, this feature may be small in scope but it's momentous in its ability to capture how complex and powerful the civil rights movement was. - John Hanlon	2
f9818aa6-e2f6-4cb1-a886-ae4787ee4ee6	  Leaving aside the rough depiction of President Johnson (admittedly a big caveat), I thought this a great film about one of of the pivotal persons (Martin Luther King) and one of the pivotal events (the Selma-Montgomery march) of the civil rights struggle. He and it really are the main focus of this movie, and viewed from their lens it is a fascinating story, and one which is also very well acted (once again, with the exception of LBJ).It's hard to understand why the film's creators were not more careful about the role of LBJ in these events, and their carelessness about that is a shortcoming in this film. But, even with that, it is a powerful and worthwhile retelling of one of the more important bits of American history in recent decades. Very much worth seeing.	2
887bb3f8-5800-47a7-b805-6554e0dd48e9	  What an inspiring, thought-provoking and heart wrenching movie. I didn't grow up during the civil rights movement, so everything I learned about MLK was from a history book and TV specials which could never do justice to this American hero. Selma brings to life this amazing man who rallied a nation to face the injustices of Southern voting policies and racial segregation. I applaud the movie producers and writers from not avoiding the human elements of Mr. King's character. Yes, Mr. King strayed from his marriage but that did not take away from his role in the Civil Right's Movement. I found it interesting that our government would sink so low as to try to thwart the Civil RIghts Movement by threatening his public image. Go see Selma you will be glad that you did.	2
4a767691-71d5-43dd-857f-60562e84eef2	  I gave this movie a five star for its powerful example of the unity as a people. We should stand up for what we believe not just one day but everyday, and not just for ourselves but for each other. We should do this no matter the adversity or obstacles in our way. I like to believe that we all have a dream that as a people we will rise up and take a stand against the turmoil that lives inside of us today. The movie was worth every penny.i Will see it again.	2
06059f99-5a73-47ff-88a8-4998acf65b37	  It is obvious that the person who wrote this movie did not live during this time. POTUS Kennedy could not get civil rights legislation through congress. Much like the Tea Party today, the Dixiecrats of that time (legislators from the south) could block any legislation they chose not matter who was in control of congress. It was POTUS Johnson, as a Dixiecrat who was able to Jawbone then to pass civil rights legislation. He was the enemy he was portrayed in the movie. Not Worth the price of admission, if fact I left early.	1
015a14cc-2715-4962-b8d9-18fa310dc438	  The courageous and tremendous story of the significant and victorious march from Selma to Montgomery during the civil rights movement should have translated easily into an uplifting and remarkable film, but instead drags along with monotone, perfunctory performances. The one exception is Carmen Ejogo's portrayl of Coretta Scott King who captures more intensity and emotional impact in her powerful and soulful performance than the entirety of the film.Bottom line, this is a history lesson we should all know and remember, but you might find it more spiritedly told in an elementary school classroom. The story is a great one, the film not so much.	0
359f64ec-962b-4027-ab29-add1fcee4db6	  This is a great movie - it is an important movie that is sadly still relevant today. We think we've come a long way as a nation but after the unrest from last year it seems we still have a long way to go. I don't understand why David Oyelowo was not nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Dr. Martin Luther King but I guess it doesn't really matter anyways. This is one of my favorite movies of 2014 and I hope a lot more people will see it.	2
9f1ddabb-8069-4fd7-9f0a-7864866e92d8	  Selma is a gripping biopic on Martin Luther King, Jr. On the whole, the film is engrossing and anger-provoking in the ways it wants to be, and is very relevant given the recent events involving racism. It is a little long, and there are many historical inaccuracies, but it is David Oyelowo's performance as King and the expert direction of Ava DuVernay that make this movie one of the most important films of the year.	2
1357230c-57a4-4a46-ac1d-651ab97fe555	  I really liked the director's view over the facts and all. All the bridges scenes are really moving, the first one made me really emotional. Overall, I would say David Oyelowo delivers a great performance, really standing out from the rest of the cast, even though he tends to sound like he's giving the "I have a dream" speech during the entire movie.I don't know if Mr MLK Jr. was that formal all the time, or if that is simply his way of talking, anyway. For me, the movie fulfills its purpose very well.	2
3aa6e266-f42d-430c-8f77-1ca975c7b17f	  I almost didn't like this one, just based on the fact that the dialogue here is mostly pretty boring to sit through. It does have some pretty inspiring things to say in this event of history and the performances here are all top notch. But as for being one of the top films of the year and something I one would want to sit through again, I would say no. This is the type that was made for history classes in school and not something to be marveled as a masterpiece of film itself as most critics would say. The soundtrack, I believe is what saved this movie and David Oyelowo's portrayal mostly. For those interested in the full story of what happened at Selma, I would recommend this to, otherwise it's more of a rental than anything.	1
f6c32c84-fe9c-4bf6-8304-8f2535479ad8	  All the Hollywood "glitz" that gets wasted on VFX junk food gets put to great use here. Historical controversies aside (really, if the biggest thing was a less than completely flattering portrayal of LBJ, I think we're going to be okay), this was a really great movie. I was gripped every moment of it, and *that is exactly what should happen*. This is an amazing story and David Oyelowo's performance is stunning, not overacted like Steve Carrell in Foxcatcher or Benedict Cumberbatch in The Imitation Game. It is a crime that Oyelowo didn't get nominated for an Oscar for his performance.	2
0f6b9845-b761-41d8-af26-009080cc50ac	  Overrated and overhyped, Selma is a made for TV movie that has been given far more credit than it has earned. The real problem is that it is a well-acted slideshow of history, rather than a cohesive story. Monologues are the name of the game here and while I do enjoy a good monologue or two of self-awareness, here it just got annoying as it was hard to relate to characters who most of the time speak in monologues rather than as people.American History X did a much better job of exploring the themes of racism and hate while still maintaining a genuine (and very tragic) character story.	1
01c304f7-0f5f-41df-9fe0-cba2179e11b5	  While it wasn't among my favorite movies of the year, I can still recognize how important a well-made movie like Selma is. Ava DuVernay tells a memerizing story and David Oyelowo gives a dramatic portrayal as Martin Luther King, Jr. History books can make monumental events seem so impersonal, so I appreciate films like these that show how much had to be overcome to get to where we are today. The movie has several uncomfortable but powerful moments, and in some ways, it also reminds me that while our society has progressed a lot since then, we still have a long way to go.	2
8e881ed2-20cc-441b-a945-7b4b3e6bb3ec	  Very good. Entertaining and powerful except David Oyelowo didn't really remind me of MLK. I believed his performance in telling this story, but MLK had one of the most distinctive voices you can have. It does't take away from the film, but it seems pretty obvious that nailing MLK's vocal cadence would have sealed the Best Actor nod. Anyway fat ignorant white people in power still suck. Sad how little has changed.	2
a9071661-7722-4eea-aaef-be9ef78959cc	  This may step on a lot of toes, but I was not crazy about Selma. Granted, this is a movie that should have been made long ago, and coincided perfectly with the turmoil created by the police shootings; I was not impressed. The first half of the movie discussed the politics and legal wrangling involved in the march. I felt that Martin and Coretta's characters were underdeveloped, and needed more fleshing out. How did Martin's absence affect the children? Why did Coretta put up with the cheating? Okay, but not worth buzz.	1
cb208264-c144-4902-ad70-3301b383d054	  Selma's strength is focusing on events leading up to a particular moment, rather than attempting to summarize King's entire life into what presumedly would have been a rushed and disjointed biopic. The cast is great, but Oyelowo completely transforms. And the film is shot with such beauty and restraint that at times it fools you into thinking you're watching the actual events unfold. The movie is as timeless as its central figure.	2
7d17edf3-04b1-400b-b3fe-1a458527303c	  Oscars got it right...not a good movie. How can you have murder, politics, and racism seem so mundane? And rap music???? common, shameful. Not an exciting movie, not gripping, very underwhelming. Pacing bad, cinematography bad. No fire in the actors...Oprah was the best part of the movie, and the end where they tell you what happened to the characters.Watch "Malcom X" instead. Million times better and more information and better performances.	1
c7fd47c5-888c-4515-8117-75dc857d35fe	  Hum... Sometimes you read a true story and it is so moving you just can't imagine a movie doing it justice. Well, Clint Eastwood on American Sniper delivers brilliantly and Spike Lee on Malcolm X killed it. Why did the people who wanted to bring Selma to the big screen not call upon Spike Lee? What in the world where they thinking? I seriously thought this was another Angelina Jolie directed movie because it had the same look and feel as the butcher job that was done on another powerful story like Unbroken. I say redo, but please give the directing of these great stories to people that truly have a vision and skill to do the stories justice. Kinda mad cuz I love Martin Luther King.	0
bb9609d3-0e73-4da5-b5e9-5c2d5695a0e9	  Wow. Selma is a powerful film and one that resonates in our current times where racial tensions between authorities and the people have been stirred once again. Selma follows Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as he leads a peaceful campaign for the voting rights of black people in Alabama. David Oyelowo is fantastic, his speeches given in Dr. King's astounding tone and his roller-coaster of emotions in the face of constant adversity are memorable. I think that everyone needs to see this movie no matter their color, to see people white and black marching together for freedom and equality. In the end the movie proves that there is no "them" there is only US.	2
7c8c8418-3317-4a8a-841e-4fcc570acb7d	  Saw Selma on MLK Day because it made sense to do. Amazing performances by all actors to show the complexities of the time. I cried for the pain and suffering that was endured by blacks with whites in solidarity to secure their right to vote. I cried for all these leaders who were murdered during this decade. I cried that the SCOTUS weakened the 1965 Voting Rights Act to keep people from voting democratic party. ?#?historic?	2
7589b10c-ddf8-4d96-9e4b-21afb4249ee3	  I really wanted to like Selma, but it just missed the mark for me. For starters, very few of the characters were formally introduced, so their story or names for that matter weren't well known until the end of the movie when they flashed their names with a bio. Also, the police report-style text that came after some scenes really didn't seem to have much of a purpose or fit in with what was going on in the movie, and it wasn't ever explained why it was shown. Besides that, the movie was very slow-moving with a lot of awkward silence that just added to its longevity. Overall, Selma just didn't do justice to its important subject matter and it felt unfinished. It just needed a little more clarity and cohesion to be a good movie.	1
9f846df0-3c79-4ed4-867e-24fa507d6c68	  Excellent and important movie. David Oyelowo is impressive as MLK. (Quite a feat to convincingly portray an international, well-known icon.) Oprah by contrast should have taken a pass. Despite her believable portrayal of a supporting character... well, she's Oprah! Every time she appeared on the screen, even as a face in the crowd, my head goes, "Oh, there's Oprah again." (which of course makes derails the scene ). The Oprah distraction tells me how far we've come. A black American woman is one of the most recognizable people on the planet and universally loved and respected for her social intelligence.Selma is a mover well worth seeing. Rates #2 on my list of Best Pictures, behind The Imitation Game.	2
e2581fce-852c-44c2-943c-b936130b6ee4	  A deftly-directed, plotted and acted biopic of the trailblazing Martin Luther King Jr, who was an instrumental figure in advancing the African-American Civil Rights Movement. Selma charts King's involvement in the 1965 historic marches that sought for voting rights for the blacks. The psychological ordeals and injustices the marchers have to go through are compelling yet utterly heartbreaking. But the true star is David Oyelowo as the charismatic and unshakeable King. In this blessed modern age where we're beset with indifference, one only wishes there're more of such selfless, strong, inspirational and motivational leaders around. Someone with a spine, mind and heart.	2
5b54b15a-a2a5-4e9d-b66a-0ac760886069	  As we left the theater I overheard someone's opinion that film should be shown in every middle school in America. That's exactly my problem. America and particularly African-Americans deserve a truthful presentation of these momentous events. I get it that Blacks won these achievements for themselves, but was it necessary to portray Johnson as contemplating King's murder, mouthing the n-word, yucking it up with George Wallace and having the Voting Rights Act (which he ordered written the night he won election to the Presidency) shoved down his throat? Preposterous and shameful! A beautiful and important movie that should be watched by everyone. It's too bad the filmmakers found it necessary to dumb it down and defame allies of the movement to simplify the plot.	2
89cd97d5-abc9-4412-b2fa-9718a0775b2d	  I didn't love Selma though it was far from bad. The acting is fantastic, the story is very interesting, upsetting,and heartbreaking, and the look of the film is very well done (especially in the scenes regarding the bridge crossings). MLK's public speeches are generally quite powerful, but when it comes to the private meetings his words start to feel contradictory, wishy washy, and some ideas don't seem fully realized. These talks even start to feel stale at parts. And while it is a part of the film, MLK's family interaction is underdeveloped.And while the history behind Selma is important for every American to know about I just didn't think this film was all that great.And boy, do you really hate LBJ while watching this film. Well, until the scene with his sudden, random, uncharacteristic change of heart.	1
338e1b71-cd76-4057-a270-6289f4e1dd45	  Selma is a great movie, although, it is an incomplete rendering of the historical events. Performances are great and it's hard to believe this sort of racism ever existed. But, it did and our world is a better place for the efforts of Dr. King and the civil rights movement. LBJ is depicted as unsupportive, but he was, in fact, very pro civil rights. But, that's Hollywood, isn't it? Definitely worth seeing...	2
9afee5e3-3501-4bc0-925d-0b2055ba6017	  It's very good, well acted, very nicely shot, and powerful. But, with all the movies about racism that have come out in recent years, this just seems to be white noise. (wow, no pun intended). I liked what it had to say but it seems, if 12 Years A Slave hadn't come out last year, maybe this movie would be making more of a buzz. I still stand by my statement that Django was the period at the end of the sentence on movies about racism. Anyway, it's a darn shame that the academy has almost no love for this movie. I think one of my friends said it best: "Didn't the academy prove that it wasn't racist last year?" Too bad. This movie is very good. But no one cares.	2
817bf960-67f4-408d-92ad-9c3798d93db4	  David Oyelowo puts on an impressive performance, showing both Dr. King's impressive dedication to the cause,as well as his human side. Ava DuVernay weaves a very tense epic, demonstrating the viciousness of the violence against those fighting for civil rights, as well as the difficulty of managing a non-violent movement composed of so many different people. Alas, the movie would have been far better served with more historical accuracy. The changes served to detract from the incredible story, rather than enhance it. Unnecessarily making a villain of Lyndon B. Johnson didn't really serve the story any more than the truth. Heightening the tension between the SCLC and SNCC was also unnecessary and distracting. But don't let it's intentional ignorance of history prevent you from seeing it; there is still a lot to like here.	2
b63a9ad7-0fff-4cb8-afd7-5550a52c106d	  Ava DuVernay's "Selma" is a stirring account of the events in Selma, Alabama that led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. David Oyelowo is stunning as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., capturing the civil rights hero's eloquence, passion and spirit. Even as it celebrates hard-won progress, "Selma" is a humbling reminder that there is still a long way to go in the fight for equality and justice.	2
aeef3f50-e5a9-4e66-9543-cfbb66cc297b	  David Oyelowo, enough said. I have seen one of the top 3 or 4 performances ever. While I was watching this film there were times where I felt I was seeing Dr Martin Luther King Jr. on the screen. This is a movie everyone should see. Graet performances, great direction. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a perfect score is that it did seem to drag at one point. I am looking forward to more of Oyelowo's work.	2
b8c2c680-2058-4a31-98ed-c01f214cdd88	  Well acted story that needs to be told. Some of it was enlightening and some of it was inspirational. However, It was also a little slow in spots, and somewhat lacked tension. The parts with Dr King and LBJ were well done, but maybe not so real. Tom Wilkenson was very good as LBJ. David Oyelowo was pretty good as Dr. King, although he wasn't nearly as inspirational a speaker as Dr. King. I'm not sure it was the movie, but I was tired and sleepy at some points of the movie. Overall, I liked the film. I doubt I would watch it again. I would recommend it to all children as semi educational, and something will make them understand more about how we got where we are. Spoiler alert: it has nothing to do with Marge Simpson's sister Selma Bouvier. :P	2
89fd46c3-a232-4fc9-9ecb-cca6b24db630	  #Selma is an insightful, heartfelt and riveting movie highlighting the politics and significant occurrences contributing to epic #MarchOnWashington An enhancement could've been more #historical context of the significance of the church bombing and what was going on in Selma during that time for Martin to opt to protest there. #MartinLutherKing was portrayed as charismatic, persistent, human and willing to sacrifice for the greater good. This touched on his fears, flaws, challenges and aspirations. It did get a little slow near the end and left more to be desired in the closing. Overall a good movie and depiction	2
d98c51a2-b1dc-46cf-a13a-9afa4310dca3	  Surprised it took this long to get an MLK movie to the big screen, but at least the one that ended up being made was as good as this, it shows in detail all the brutality MLK and his supporters endured down in Selma, and also shows the many sides of MLK, Oyelowo is great here, showing him as a leader giving rousing speeches and leading the marches, also as a family man, relaxing with his friends, and emotional scenes with his wife over his infidelities, Roth is very good as the evil George Wallace, and always good to see fellow south sider Common acting (and singing the end credits song) Hopefully this will serve as launching point for Oyelowo and director DuVernay for long careers, as both are very talented	2
03342db0-0f30-4316-b9d0-fdfeb3f6ffbc	  Harrowing and sometimes powerful, Selma is the first biopic film about Martin Luther King Jr. It explores the three months of campaigning and protests that King did in order to get blacks the ability to vote, since they are bullied and intimidated when they try. A masterful performance by David Oyelowo is the highlight of the movie, as everyone else gets a bit shafted. The villains are pretty good too, with great actors portraying opposing men and their racist beliefs. Sometimes the film is a bit preachy with an agenda, but overall its a solid drama with lots of good performances.	2
4eba047c-add8-4ef2-855b-d5891f788618	  Everything about this movie is great...except for the script. Really well-directed, with an important message and a great central performance from Oyelowo. But this could've been so much better if they had placed more focus on the individual stories of the townspeople! The most powerful scene in the movie is when King is talking to Jimmie's grandpa in the coroner's office. Why couldn't we have had more of that? More heartbreaking personal anecdotes that give weight to the individual conflicts of the people of Selma and flesh out the supporting cast.	2
71d4e6dd-3d20-4080-8de6-6f68ccb74ec9	  It's all about the way things look. One can make something look a certain way and the masses will believe it because they don't want to take the time to view the truth. I don't want to discredit the man Martin Luther King Jr. for he is a man of greatness. Yet he was not perfect; he did make mistakes. However, this film shows him as a man of no fault. Ava DuVernay skips over the darker parts of his life in order to show MLK as a man with a clean slate. All this does is create a fiction. To present every caucasian in this film as evil does nothing but show ignorance. To be honest the message was clear from the beginning. If you don't know it yet just listen to the lyrics of Common's track during the credits. Destroying the truth is injustice in itself.	1
f2d16f7d-35bb-47b1-8e90-bbd160bc3009	  Selma transports the viewer back in time, 50 years ago. The view we have as we are transported and watch the story unfold may feel eerily relatable and relevant to present day. Gorgeous shots, detailed costume and superb acting make this film an engrossing experience. No matter what your views on race are, you should see this film. Watch with an openness and willingness to reflect and place yourself in the shoes of those depicted in this masterful work.	2
92aacaaf-778e-4479-ad54-ad8fc447ad81	  Selma reminds us that time is indifferent to equality and justice, and that change can only occur when action is taken. So stop complaining about your politicians and go and do something, you lazy bastard. In all, the film is as slow paced as a march, treading on through its plot. Luckily, this helps to punctuate the drama caused by police brutality, acts of terror, and King's negotiations with President Johnson. When victory is achieved at its end, it remains all too real that there's a lot more work to do."I'm not even angry at the white man. I'm angry at the black man. How did we get here today from that? All the black man wants to do today is tear each other apart." - my eavesdropping after the movie	2
2c9b66cc-eb62-435b-81ec-c0be85aa13f4	  A languorous look at Dr. King's life and legacy, encapsulated in the events leading up to the march from Selma to Montgomery. There are highlights: David Oyelowo's performance in the lead role, and Stephan James' turn as civil rights icon John Lewis were both moving. Carmen Ejogo also infuses Coretta Scott King with a quiet dignity. But the pace is slow and the call to peaceful resistance feels passive, despite dialogue telling you that just the opposite is true. The message of the film is unassailable, but the vessel - the film itself -- is imperfect.	1
1e8978da-2907-4f51-976e-fd2dee0dbc58	  There were times while I was watching Selma that I forgot it wasn't a documentary. David Oyelowo so completely transforms into Martin Luther King, Jr. that it is easy to forget that fact.I watched this film on Martin Luther King Day, and how better really to honor the great Dr. King's legacy than to be reminded of his incredible legacy through film. Ava DuVernay gives us perhaps the seminal film on the American Civil Rights Movement, and presents us with the additional stories of the other often overlooked players of that historic time. What is most remarkable about Selma is that no screentime goes to waste. Every frame seems weighty and full of import, so much so that the over two hours' runtime is well deserved. With excellent performances all around from a strong cast as well as excellent work behind the camera, Selma is an outstanding entry into the film anthology of American history.	2
7e9ff846-e088-4f42-8b92-9f550cbeb054	  This film made me cry at least twice. The depictions of violence were heart wrenching. The filmmakers seemed to intentionally linger on the violent scenes in order to force the viewer to confront the brutality instead of offering a fleeting glimpse of it, which most documentaries tend to do with violent scenes. I read that some people thought the portrayal of LBJ wasn't accurate or fair (but I'm not a historian of this era). I think I enjoyed Stephan James's portrayal of John Lewis the best.	2
bc4ef6c5-275a-4afd-a069-c1d1c0097dcd	  A good film but a bit underwhelming. The actor chosen to play Dr. King sure resembles him but has the charisma of cardboard nor does he even remotely sound like him. Was there no African-American actors available to play MLK, they had to choose a Brit? They also made the mistake of choosing a director with such little big screen experience. Her last directing experience was an episode of Scandal and it showed. This film lacked the pacing and storytelling it takes for a 2 hour film. The supporting cast was superb which also made the role of MLK seem even smaller in comparison. Good film, but missed the point to expand further on fight for voting rights in Selma.	1
7d31a315-202f-418a-9962-000c290c54a7	  Director Ava DuVernay explores the time, place and events with complexity, while David Oyelowo, as King, is mesmerising - inhabiting the role completely. The only jarring note, for me, was a minor one - the rather self-congratulatory end credits and John Legend's bombastic theme. And as some have argued, perhaps the film is not entirely fair to LBJ. But that's another story - on the whole this is a strong, unsentimental take on Selma, with resonance for today.	2
88c07a23-3410-47ba-a9f1-209c08260759	  Nominated for Best Picture (well-deserved) "Selma" is a look at Dr. King's march on Selma in 1965 and all the turmoil surrounding the civil rights movement in the 1960's as he battles enemies both from outside and within. Acting is excellent all the way around and especially Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King (Cory). She missed out on a best actress nod. Like "American Sniper" should be seen by every American but for a different reason.	2
086f6c0b-e291-4f15-a137-42f1ca5f6e5e	  I wanted to see more organizing of the protests and training of the protesters. I also wanted to get to know the organizers and participants better as people. It's not that I didn't like the glimpses into King's personal life and struggles, but it took away focus from what is presumably the focus of the film: the behind-the-scenes of those protests, and peaceful protests in general. The actors were good, especially King. I wish also that they had used less slow motion. It made the scenes seem more movie-like as opposed to realistic and visceral.	1
b5997389-478f-44c0-a0cb-5a1926b54347	  Watched Selma last week with a good friend and here are some thoughts. The movie has some really good acting and well directed scenes, especially those that take place on the infamous bridge where MLK and supporters marched from Selma to Montgomery Alabama. I am surprised the guy that played MLK, David Oyelowo didn't get an Oscar nomination for best actor because he deserved it but the Oscars have sucked recently anyway so who cares right. Anyway, see it for the history but there were a couple slow parts too. Can't win them all!	2
1204699a-8661-4b1b-a089-19ed8648800d	  Took my boys to see Selma on MLK Day. Multidimensional storytelling sheds light on the conflicts and challenges to the 60s Civil Rights Movement, and MLK's efforts to to get Voting Rights legislation passed. We get to see MLK's doubts, fears, and personal failures. All of it presented and portrayed in a very sensitive and impressively cinematic fashion. I was fortunate enough to privately meet with Martin's wife Coretta back in the late 80s. It was a thrill I will never forget. This movie reminds me why I'm proud to be American and African-American. Our contribution in this country is so deeply ingrained, both politically and culturally. What would American be like without Rock and Roll, Jazz, or the courage of those brave people in portrayed this movie. This is American history. Love it or leave it.	2
5389d86b-e3ac-41d3-a7e5-f2473b7c690a	  Just viewed this as part of Odeon's screen unseen and it could be one of the most important films made this year.David Oyelowo is tour de force as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in this story of how the Voting Rights Act of 1965 came to pass.It is an excellent and powerful film that depicts the struggles that black people went through to vote, something that we all take for granted and in this day and age don't even bother to use.	2
a11e314d-6ce1-42d1-a4bf-44d7b59e5c94	  A very fine film. I believe it does a good job of allowing us into the "movement" to see the stresses and strains. It de-mythologizes King and makes him more real. Personally I think the film also shows President Johnson to be a man seeking to do good but pulled in so many directions. I think everyone should see this film to remember where we come from and to catch a glimpse of where we need to go.	2
91a3aca9-f5a5-4938-aa91-c1508db39386	  Complex in its portrayal of King (who is shown as a man with flaws, vices, fears and doubts, not as a saint-figure), Selma is a strong performance surrounded by two hours of melodrama. Yet the melodrama is effective. Careful framing, a powerful score that tugs at all the right heartstrings and some very good performances from the supporting cast elevate Selma from a biographical historical drama to a good movie. And white it's true that some moments are cringeworthy the overall effect is undeniably powerful. Selma is a movie that sucs you into the civil rights struggle and doesn't let go.Timely, well shot and well cast Selma is one biographical drama that stands out from the pack, and a movie definitely worth seeing.	2
91142fb5-bbd5-430c-a64b-4a310e0622c8	  Emotionally moving, and it never stops...from the moment when four beautiful little black girls are murdered in a Klan bombing of their church, to the moment when LBJ signs the bill to enact the right to vote for blacks. You viscerally feel the beatings, shootings, and even the spiritual songs. I came away with a new knowledge...of how when this all took place (I was 11 and oblivious to news programs then) it was as if we were at war down south. I had no idea just how brutal that 'war was.	2
7f43fa34-c07d-4676-b892-bfbfc675bee5	  Selma, starring David Oyelowo as Dr. King, is a moving film that has a couple flaws just on the technical aspects of the movie. It could have done a little better with the pacing and adding some background music to help set the tone of what was happening. Some of the middle of the moving was slow at times. However, I really liked how the film started and finished. Plus, the marching scenes that happened during the movie were very intense. David Oyelowo has a moving performance has Dr. King and you can really see the weight on his shoulders as the leader of this important movement. I give the movie 4/5.	2
aca44e4e-3284-4576-ba68-19fb23b8742d	  Predicted winner if 10 MILLION Oscars, because it's about a BLACK man giving a BLACK speech to BLACK people about BLACK people. No surprise that all the 'critics' are giving it top ratings, to cover their sorry politically-correct butts. BONUS: watch for white people to be portrayed as 2-dimensional cardboard cutout bad guys, while the Anointed One (no, not Obama this time) swoops in on his flaming chariot to saaaaave the oppressed from the clutches of eeeeevil crackers.	0
2fe17be6-499d-4199-8cdb-f35666c952e4	  This film should be required viewing in high schools...especially in the south. It's rather unfortunate that many people will choose not to watch this film in its theatrical run due to burnout from the Ferguson riots. Of course, this film was in production before the Ferguson riots even occurred. Both this film and Ferguson should be a reminder that racial tensions and hatred are still alive and well in America. For example, although news coverage of this was sparse, last year the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act which protected minorities and almost immediately....states (mainly in the south) passed laws to make it harder for minorities to vote. Keep that in mind when you watch this film.	2
9ee3ad1a-ea1a-4171-ba4e-938e12d5005d	  LOL, What a load of chit. 99% critic rating? Really, 99%. This is why the media any ANY media outlet cannot be trusted. You can't get 99% agreement by critics for even the best movies, but let that movie be about black civil rights, or gay rights, and suddenly 99%.BS. 99% of the people could give a crap less about black civil rights history or gay civil rights history.	0
189a832a-f4c6-477f-b3dc-10a2fa267f3d	  Although the plot isn't as tight as it should be, the film has so many great performances, and does a good job of conveying the tension, from the oval office to the streets of Alabama. We get to see Dr. King as a strategist, and tough negotiator, who did much more than inspire people with his words. It did have a few moments that didn't add to the plot, but overall a worthy adaptation of a turbulent time in American history.	2
acf515bf-0594-416b-b851-ab1bd65ad9fc	  Undoubtedly powerful and unflinchingly portrayed, this is the story of MLK's journey from Selma to Birmingham in an effort to truly gain the right to vote for African Americans. Delving deeper into MLK, we find that he was a very flawed man, and it is to be applauded that director Ava DuVernay did not make this a flowery love letter to MLK and followers alike. Incredible performances from Wilkinson as President Johnson and Roth as bull-headed politician Wallace, really anchor the story, but David Oyelowo delivers a one-of-a-kind performance as MLK. This unclouded depiction of 60s life in the South, (mainly Alabama in the film), shows us how far we have come and more so, how much further we have left to go. Rated 3.75 out of 5. Reviewed 1/16/15.	2
00650db1-1dda-433b-8490-8231779ae70d	  Despite the historical inaccuracies of this movie, most notably the portrayal of LBJ and his views on the march, it is a very powerful commentary on what the civil rights movement went through in order to open voting to all US citizens. The acting is wonderful, although Oprah?s appearance seemed a bit gratuitous. David Oyelowo plays MLK with passion and is quite inspiring. All in all, if this movie creates dialogue about racial issues that are happening in our time, it is worth the watch even if it isn?t 100% accurate.	2
9122933d-9d4e-496b-94bd-c8fd36307958	  Excellent Movie, surprised it took this long for such a key part of the civil rights movement to be made into film. British actor who plays Martin Luther King Jr pulls it off phenomenally with a flawless southern accent. King's uncertainty in actions are engaging and this film is a reminder that inequality continues in 2015. Liberals on the left were the ones fighting for equality while the remaining southern racists/fascists found refuge in far right movements. King was a true progressive that criticized the Vietnam War, was an adamant supporter of democratic Socialism and condemned the Capitalist system which has accelerated the growing gap of inequality in the past few years.	2
ef537b6c-6f20-4a6c-ad3d-ec011407871a	  Very good film with some excellent acting. Always loved King's speeches and the best lines in the movie were written originally by him. The saddest thing however was that I left the theater with a bad taste in my mouth. As the credit roll, a rap song plays talking about marching on Ferguson with hands up. Since the poor kid in Ferguson didn't have his hands up but was attacking the cop, apparently we have gone from defending the truth to defending a lie. Giving his teaching on the dangers of violence, Dr. King must be looking down from heaven weeping.	2
71b49595-55a1-4d81-bc6e-90ad122fee18	  Powerful, emotional, righteous, and masterfully realized, Selma is a film brimming with life and passion! These men and women took up this righteous cause and let no one deter them. This movie is nothing less than a historical document that palpably finds the mood and atmosphere of the civil rights movement. It certainly helps that David Oyelowo completely commits and nails his MILK performance, humanizing him with deep troubles, passions, and immense courage. This is a movie that MUST be seen by an race, color, creed, or gender. I was in awe and at it's mercy the whole time.	2
244644e1-f505-4f63-b7f6-70ef1e47b859	  Selma was a fantastic film. I thought the portrayal of LBJ was accurate of a politician trying to balance a enormous amount of policies that a president has to consider on one plate. Another well represented aspect of the film was MLK himself. We all know MLK the ideal. The ideal of non-violent yet disruptive protests that many protests today try to resemble to bring awareness to issues in our society. But what you see in this film is the man. MLK laughing and enjoying a meal with his friends. MLK working on martial issues and the struggle inside himself of understanding his lasting legacy and how history would perceive him with every action he did. How David Oyelowo did not get a best actor nomination from the Academy is a travesty. This is one of the best pictures of 2014 and certainly one many people should see.	2
f7e9da4f-7660-46cf-b5fb-911ca881589f	  Selma is at times a biopic showing the sequence of events that made one man validate himself as a true champion of non-violent peace causes, and also a political drama about the people and circumstances that played out behind the scenes to create a monumental phenomenon in the national history of a country. The film is epic in scale just due to eh act that it tackles such a grand event; and secondly because of its exceptional handling of the drama that unfolded along the many lines of this fight - the personal front, the family front and the public front.	2
954d0411-f340-4830-ae20-232c216d167f	  Preachy, historically inaccurate, over-dramatized and slooooow... however there was good acting by the two leads. I found the direction to be uneven and some characters stories not brought out enough. This movie could have been much better. There was more to tell. The movie did a very good job of making it feel like I was seeing the 1960's south. I went through the south as a kid and the sets were very well done. I like seeing historic films and pointing out the inaccuracies. The biggest one here is the treatment of President Johnson who was made into a racist. To big of an inaccuracy to forgive for me.	0
30e4b2c5-8533-4b31-ac99-bf70ce9ab95f	  What I got to say about "Selma" is a good movie of determination and peace. "It's timeless, astonishing, and original." The performances by the hole cast is really good. "David Oyelowo gives one gripping performance...Very remarkable!" The directing by Ava DuVernay is very well directed. The screenplay by Paul Webb is great. The cinematography, score, and effects are good. "I'm raving that "Selma" is a movie that draws inspiration and dramatic of an American masterpiece of a movie."	2
254c820e-8f84-40cd-bd8c-2f1361fd59a1	  After all the great reviews I was expecting a moving tale of the march from Selma to Montgomery. That is not what I got. The movie started out well...actually a masterful piece of insight and direction for the first scene. After that it went down hill. The actors playing Johnson and Wallace were ill suited for the role. The actor playing Dr. Martin Luther King, JR lacked the charisma of Dr. King. I remember Dr. King's speeches...I watched the events unfold. This movie did not do justice to either. It would have been better if the story would have been told from the point of view of a participant instead of the leader. And it would have been a hell of a lot better if Oprah Winfrey hadn't hogged scenes, bringing nothing to the story.	0
4f0c24d4-75b5-4b19-8c22-098a50ee4e21	  I liked Selma about as much as I thought I would. I didn't really care about the historical inaccuracies. The detail in the presentation, and the conveyance of the reality of being in Selma when those decisions were being made is what makes this film watchable and powerful. Starting out with MLK's Nobel Prize ceremony sets the credentials for what comes next. Strong performances and some archival footage in the credits bring the movie home.	2
6e039902-8a6c-441c-b16d-d282559d1ba8	  "Selma" is the best biopic I've seen in a long, long time but it is so much more. Considering the volatility and brutality portrayed, there's a surprisingly and fittingly (considering Dr. King's allegiance to non-violent resistance) quiet strength in its direction and performances that drives this movie off the screen and into your heart and conscience, simultaneously touching you with a sense of the injustices and sacrifices of our country's past while reminding you of those still present, in the present, that require sacrifices today and will tomorrow.It asks us to remember who we were, to contemplate who we are and challenges us to raise up who we could be.See this movie. Because more of us need to remember who we were, need to contemplate who we are and need to rise up to who we could be.	2
dc377359-1a90-4ad7-beda-3e2ceca5db37	  I can't really find any flaws with this film. It depicts a specific period of action, thereby focusing on the politics and humanity of the civil rights movement and sidestepping the melodrama of King's assassination. King himself is depicted as flawed and unsure of the best course of action. The movie keeps the focus on the many individuals it took to create change. There is also a scene that overtly references current events of police murdering suspects unprovoked as in Eric Garner. This movie is about today, while at the same time reminding us that yesterday, regular people took action to stop evil.	2
e5903c8f-972e-475e-b62a-f22e8bb529e9	  I can give this movie nothing less than 5/5 stars for being excellent! Oprah finally did it in making a good movie! I loved it. I was not alive during this era and I had always heard of the march from Selma Alabama to Montgomery as nothing more than a mere blurb in the history books. I had no idea how much went into this march or the personal struggles that Dr. King went through when deciding to lead it. Also liked how they were able to do this movie without being too sexual or gory which seems to be a common theme in many films today. I have no doubt that one day this will be a standard film shown in American history classes throughout our nation	2
f733daf9-3c26-4cee-a50c-4f1267076e87	  As opposed to the long, boring, biographical film it could have easily been, Selma is a focused story and compelling story that manages to stand out from other films like 12 Years a Slave. David Oyelowo plays a God inspired, and actually quite intimidating Dr. King who quite literally cannot back down. All of this accompanied by a solid soundtrack makes this a film that probably will be forgotten, but really should not be.	2
e301ac4c-d39c-4aa1-af77-e6df7fa84d67	  Though it doesn't always quite reach what it's trying to grasp in it's grand scope as Selma isn't quite fully capable of capturing both sides of the fight for civil rights, it's still an inspiring one about one of the greatest men in history. David Oyelowo paints this man, Martin Luther King with one of the flat out best leading performances of the year, bring Martin Luther King back from the dead it almost seems for this movie. Though the movie's merits are plentiful, it is Oyelowo who manages to bring the movie together, and why he manages to make it work in the end. Though it's a film I don't think I would say is a five star film, it's certainly one that I absolutely can say is worthy to be a portrayal of the man who's story it tells, and there's something unabashedly admirable about that.	2
1299ac2d-6a2f-47e7-aec7-28be4484e394	  Great performances. I spent a lot of time crying through this movie. It touches your heart even more because it's true. Maybe even more because this victory in Selma has been put in jeopardy more in the last 10 years in that country than ever before. I docked it a half star because I would have loved a call to action at the end. Something to remind the viewer that the US voting system still denies people the easy access to voting their constitution mandates.	2
5a676198-53ae-40ee-ada9-f396638e2d28	  Selma is a very good film about an historical episode that had huge consequences for the change and evolutions of laws in the 60's for African American people. wonderfully shot and acted, this film is a case study of the fight led by Dr. King and his followers to gain the right to vote like any other citizens. It's a smart film, with strong dialogues and a message of hope, pride and dignity crucial for times. The fight our ancestors drove to eradicate segregation and racism is still much needed today and once in a while a film such as Selma comes to remind us that a lot has been done but more, so much more need to be done to end the racial hatred still unfortunately present in our modern society.	1
d7cc1783-f1c7-430a-835d-84852e27e056	  Powerful & gritty film depicting the important Selma march, thanks to outstanding performances & Ava DuVernay's down to earth direction. David Oyelowo is brilliant depicting MLK, not physically looking like him but capturing his mannerisms & passion with precision, especially in his numerous speeches throughout the film. He gets able support around him, particularly Tom Wilkinson as LBJ & Tim Roth as George Wallace, who manages to bring some humanity to the former racist Democratic governor. Behind the camera, DuVernay gives a nice behind the scenes view of how the events formed, displaying King not only as a passionate civil rights activist but a cagey politician who selected Selma for a specific reason. The film also doesn't gloss over King, depicting him as a human being with real flaws, including a particular infamous one. Overall, one of the finest dramas of 2014 and sure to be seen throughout the award season.	2
954c20a5-f92f-41c6-b279-dd62781331ad	  It is one of the most powerful moves that I have ever seen. Even though they needed to change MLK speeches and LBJ's character arc, they did a magnificent job in writing a story about MLK figuring out a way to get Washington and LBJ to see that a national law needs to get passed so that Blacks can vote. Lastly, the acting was superb especially for David Oyelowo and the supporting cast was great too. EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE THIS FILM!!	2
cd1e2a04-c224-45b5-ba99-dcb476dd23db	  Ava DuVernay does an excellent job at bringing out real emotion through imagery. There was a point in the film where I literally felt such horror at the way mankind treats one another, and this was accomplished even without showing any excessive amounts of violence. That said, the message was a little heavy handed, a trait I see from many movies directed by women. In the end, this is a must see not only for historical appreciation, but also for its gripping emotional impact.	2

d7501dea-3732-481b-a896-8f84be172a88	  NOT as REAL and INTERESTING as the real MLK. Go watch a documentary AND just like in general THE REAL PERSON IS 100X more powerful than ANY actor could portray AND you'll learn something. This is a WATERED DOWN MARTIN LUTHER KING and the worst part is they don't really capture the spirit of the era. Doubt me? Well tell me how many times you see this movie as I DOUBT you will see it more than once. AND in that case it IS NOT a great movie as great movies you see again and again and again. A case in point is the GREAT movie GANDHI that does capture the spirit of his era AND you learn something. AND the actor, Ben Kingsley captures Gandhi himself.	0
4507b671-e028-4176-a62d-147f65d6267a	  While it was a well intentioned effort at examining the dynamics and strong personalities behind the march to Selma and the subsequent signing of the Voting Rights Act, there were several intriguing threads that were glanced at, then left unexamined. Malcolm X's influence on Dr. King's movement was mentioned then left out of the conversation thereafter, as well as the first tentative displays of respect between the marchers and the State police when Dr. King refused to continue his second march after the troopers withdrew were ignored in the film. Understandably, when issues are so vast, the filmmakers have to decide what's relevant to the picture they are making and what is extraneous, but those two factors I felt left me feeling I was not given the whole story and I left the cinema unsatisfied.	1
1ebb53e0-719c-492f-9f70-d1a468c69cf2	  I thought this is so over-hyped. I didn't feel that this was a new unique film. There was too much recreation and fan service of the the original film(s) and felt more like a nostalgia film rather than a new film. I wasn't impressed with Kylo Ren. I expected more out of the action sequences. I didn't feel I cared too much for the new characters. There was one emotional scene but other than that I didn't feel this film brought any new exciting things to the table.	1
329da4c4-52a0-4bf4-9ad6-ca5dd3e1b7fa	  Great for Hardcore Starwars fan's out there I'm sure. But I'm not a diehard fan so 3.5/5 for me. With a big budget, start director and all the resources possible, it still bugs me with the poor choices made by so many characters in the plot and how much this movies tries to play homage to Episode IV. Else it would easily have been a 4 to 4.5 in my books. Thank you Lucas for setting the bar so so low with the prequels.	1
d99365b5-21b2-4ba1-819d-bd307c406df0	  Possibly the worst star wars due to the infinitely recycled plot points, extensive plot holes, sappy music, a quarter of the movie with two characters staring at each other as the music swells, characters as tropes, and this ren girl being magically better at the force than one of the strongest dark force users in the universe without any training who can also fight without any training and who doesn't kill the main baddie because of a magical chasm that appears between the two just in time. Oh, and there's another death star that gets blown up again. Basically, just watch the original 3 again and you basically just watched this lazy cookie cutter movie. The only reason it isn't 0 stars is because it had great visual artists.	0
7bec9430-6f4d-4a9b-9e7d-481101b0dfa3	  Movie was at some points a rip off of "A New Hope" from the original trilogy. Made the plot line boring and predictable. I don't see how anyone who has watched the first movies could possibly rate this anything more than a one star. Not even close to being worth the ticket price in theater, or the price it is going to go for when it's new. The only redeeming factor for this movie was the visual effects were better than the second trilogy Lucas directed as well as SOME of the acting was at least bearable. All in all, for the amount of force fed Star Wars hype from ads, and the huge amount of commercial items all over the place, this movie is one to wait for to show up in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart.	0
1e38eb65-517a-4a69-aa39-89de3144b230	  JJ Abrams proves a very good action director that can channel heart and great chase sequences with large explosions, I find him far more palatable than Michael Bay. That being said, this is nothing more than a strict cash in for the hearts of and minds of those who still love the original three but loathe the others. It's fun and mindless drivel but it's all been done before. There is nothing special to this other than the hope that it offers at the end that the following movie will be better than this. It's a great story but the telling of it is getting to be tired trash for Hollywood blockbuster sci fi action movies.	1
8dc7eddb-e9a9-4b00-b886-7d348fa228ba	  You know its bad when light sabers don't instantly cut through anything they hit. They might as well be fighting with wooden swords. Then there is the whiny, Darth Vader, picture a long haired Ross from friends. It is not the worst movie ever but I certainly don't understand the hype. I noticed the guy in front of me fell asleep. I don't blame him I was just waiting for this snooze fest to end. Either have a realistic gripping story or dump the over the top immersion killing humor. You cannot have both. Furthermore why would 2 people who have never used a light saber do so well against a master....	1
d66b072c-8fa2-4c74-9026-fd46904d8cc6	  I am sorry but I hated this movie. The plot was a twisted mess. The pace at times put me to sleep. The special effects were nothing special. And the Princess and Hans were so old looking it freaked me out. Give me the old Jedi Knights that were in training for years. These new female type pick it up overnight and beat the darkside like a drum. Which reminds me Hux needs a bigger helmet and a kick in the teeth for crying.	1
66ce7e84-198b-4e56-adf7-5704bd142ff3	  This film is profoundly OK. Among critics and fans alike, it seems to be benefiting from a hefty dose of low expectations brought on by the prequels. Half the scenes were lifted straight from A New Hope, the story-line was painfully simplistic, and the main "bad guy," Kylo Ren, is disappointing (he went from intimidating to weak and laughable way too fast). There are some notable bright spots here. The new characters (Finn, Rey, Poe) are good although their dialogue relies a bit too much on cheesy comic relief (so, you're telling me that a guy who was born and bred as a storm trooper from such a young age that he doesn't even have a name--only a number--somehow talks like a wisecracking fanboy on Reddit. Come on!)	1
47a29dae-2d0e-4b95-b7f5-1ddd6c9341a3	  It's okay. No better or worse than the prequels. More of a lateral move. Better cinematography, worse story. Almost no story. This exists as the set up for more movies and borrows heavily from ANH and KotOR for copious filler that has nothing to do with the plot of this film. The actual plot here constitutes no more than ten minutes of screen time. Only a heroic set of performances from the cast elevate this film into something worth watching. Disappointing but not bad.	1
6f0c313c-b49a-41b2-845f-23f0518210af	  Decent. Lacking character development like all of the previous films. The series really needs to move to TV and have multiple seasons. We aren't introduced to characters, religions, planets, all of the wonderful little things that make up Star Wars and unfortunately, the movies don't give the real story any justice. I find that at the end of the movies, there's no emotional investment to any of the characters really...other than the ones we've seen in older movies. By the end of this one, I could care less if Kylo Ren was dead, because Rey embarrassed him with her Force skills -- which she randomly learned in the movie.Really disappointed.	0
4e47aa31-baa5-473a-a244-e976a9d3c1ee	  I agree with the Golden Globe and the Oscar committees that this movie does NOT deserve a major award. It just is not an exception movie - the acting is unimpressive, the story is unimpressive, it is hardly original and talk about predictable - if you couldn't figure out Kylo Ren is a Darth Vader descendant from the preview you are brain dead. Take out all the eye candy special effects there is hardly anything to this movie other than an introduction to the next sequel. It is a dumb movie that is candy for the immature masses. Very disappointing.	0
90d92f9a-c4c2-4699-a772-c780d9be8459	  horrendous movie,its a rehash of ep 4, with nothing added. I am a star wars geek so to see that blatant ignorance and complete contradiction to star wars lore is one of the greatest problem to real star wars fanatics. The story in of itself makes no sense that characters have no real character to them. Fin simply acts a buffoon with off one liners and ray as a mary sue able to do everything	0
0ba81cca-e0d3-40c6-a7d8-fa91afa52939	  A film that only superficially captures the feeling of the originals, but is let down by it's lack of originality, it's predictability and it's poorly written new characters. Motivations are to be presumed as they're never explained and it's hard to feel any threat or attachment to any of the new cast because they're all blank slates, void of personality or individuality. Performances from all actors, Harrison Ford aside, feel hammy, twee and sometimes at odds with the brief backstories we have of these characters. The rehashed plot quickly becomes tiring, as apposed to the nostalgic romp they had aimed for. The positives mainly come from the exceptional design teams, cinematography and score.	1
a3aa41fc-0016-4915-b642-57441a828c88	  really lower your expectations on this one. Not great visually, intellectually, or great writing. It's more like a reunion special where within 10 minutes you know how the movie is going to end and within 15, you're wondering why should I even care for these characters?maybe the 2nd movie will give more background to the new characters, but this is an example of how George Lucas knows that if he puts "Star Wars" on anything, there will be those who will just eat it up without really thinking why.	0
39fb35ba-3dca-430b-93ac-ec6858219cf4	  Force Awakens, Looks in Mirror, Goes Back to Bed Again. Seriously.So, I purposefullly did not read anything before seeing this movie. Which is probably why I am so dumbfoundedly disappointed that it was a damn remake of the original. Let's break it down a little:- Disaffected youth in out of the way locale stumbles over rebellion. - Boy meets girl. - Girl kidnapped by Establishment to their planet-sized weapon base. (Again. Seriously?)- Father / Son duel over void. (Again. Seriously??)- Rebels rally and fly in to exploit weakness and blow up mega-weapon just before it can blow up planets. (Again. Seriously???)Come on.Out of a universe of possibilities, we get this slavish rehash? I think they even reused the loading graphic for the big weapon powering up.	1
4dce6010-0ffd-49c5-b47a-0c1cab25cfa8	  Sorry, this new Star Wars episode is horrible, neither credible nor interesting. A sanitation worker can just pick up a light saber and battle a Vader-in-training character? Really? Where's Yoda when you need him most? I guess this generation has no patience for such character development, but it really detracted from the Star Wars magic of the force and all that. Instead you get a bunch of over-eager actors who escape one danger after another. Nothing compels the story along. No good vs. evil here.	0
cd84ee69-0f10-4ba8-9d3c-617261217525	  I had more problems with it than I anticipated, but taken as simple entertainment it was okay. The effects were decent and it felt like in a galaxy far far away enough. What got me was how it was kind of too slow and too fast at the same time. Reams of exposition thrown into dialog that had a LOT of staring in between, instant plot as vehicle coincidences that seemed super fake, instant force mastery based on nothing, and a villain you might as well call Darth Emo. You can get any number of spoilers somewhere else, I'm not doing that, but a lot of things certainly don't add up. It's almost like a paint-by-number in it's simplistic setup for the next one which hopefully will be better.	1
162bc2a4-8cda-4305-89cd-558c13d14ed9	  I fell asleep the first time I went and decided to try and watch it again. This movie was boring with not enough action, horrible acting and bad ending. This ranks as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Hollywood and consumers have lowered their expectations of what a good movie should be. Knowing the fact that it will break box-office records makes me wonder what the heck is going on in the entertainment industry. People buying tickets in advance and lining up just because its Star Wars is just plain stupid.	0
22012167-62a3-42d0-8b83-c35fc2719b8c	  Bringing familiar faces from Star Wars past, was the best part of 'The Force Awakens'. Though I am a big fan of J.J. Abrams the joint effort script (J.J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan, Michael Arndtwas) was not up to the Lucas/Star Wars standard viewers expect . The movie lacked flow and continuity as it jumped from scene to scene. So far everyone I know, who watched Awakens, came away with the same basic impression...a poor remake!	0
8e7a1639-5b4d-43b5-b927-f26cd0687d96	  After watching Star Trek Into Darkness and Star Trek (2009 Film) I was expecting more from the film than what actually came out. Though it included some impressive effects, I found The Force Awakens was basically a rehashing of Episode IV without a clear plot. Apart from the money, there was no real meaning to creating a seventh episode to the series since it was perfectly fine the way it was. Some scenes in the movie had already been repeated several times before.	1
b972c67b-5b03-458e-95e5-e2dce93b84f0	  if there was a lower score than this I would give it, but this by far the worst of the Star wars movies. While the Prequels were no joy at least they made an attempt to be original, this movie does not. the humor is campy, the plot would be down right plagiarism if Disney didn't already own it. This should have been advertised as a reboot instead of a sequel. The best thing about the film was Harrison ford and they killed him off, Fin is the second best thing but he wasn't enough to save this film.	0
764e922d-7801-4dbc-941c-2069e8f8210d	  This movie is the most disappointing thing ever... it's even worse than 'The Phantom Menace' You people who helped this 93% rotten tomatoes, are either complete fucking retards, or have a nostalgia meter bigger than geeks boners when watching the fucking trailer for this movie. The main villain is a fucking stupid teenage brat, who was saved by a stroke of fucking luck. Our secondary character was a retired toilet janitor.... and those are just a few points... Can't wait for Mr. Plinkett's review of this movie... -Thanks for reading.... idiots....	0
6d0a90e9-293b-4db2-8981-4f3efbe0889d	  Don't believe the hype, don't believe the raving fanboys and by no means believe the blatantly lying, Disney-bought critics. This is a storyless and soulless, stinking POS. Quoting youtuber Senju: "it feels like a slighly surreal and very expensive fan film". It also feels like a sligthly too long (2hrs worth) movie trailer made by hipsters who think that having the old, "genuine" special effects is more important than having a story. 3/10. 1 for the genre, 1 for Harrison Ford and 1 for Chewie.	0
0821ffd2-112c-4288-ae70-7710e8f22473	  Fresh faces - yes; familiar faces yes; good special effects yes. Sadly, though, I felt I was watching a remake of the A New Hope (the first star wars film released). I honestly did not believe my father (85) when he said it had virtually the same overall plot, just with some slightly different details - I apologize to my father for not believing him. We are real Sci Fi fans and were very disappointed.	0
025599eb-0ea2-40c0-ac64-393402fe27ce	  Well, when the film was over I had very mixed feelings. To describe it in short - I enjoyed watching this movie despite considering it a pretty bad product; fun with a guilt if you know what I mean :-)Scenario was no more than a digest of chunks and pieces from previous movies, deja vu was the prevalent feeling for entire movie. Cast was questionable at times, and performances far from plausible (leaning towards bad). Nevertheless, it was fun to watch despite all its flaws, probably just a nostalgic kind of joy :-)	1
e1d7b314-fe06-4aa2-b5fc-742120d16181	  Held off on this for long enough, as saw it the day it was released so if you haven't seen it by now you are not a real fan. I didn't mind it, it reboots the franchise, but that's all it felt like, a retelling of the same story. Should have been called Stars Wars A New Hope (Again). Also galactic empire stop wasting resources on gigantic bases. Doesn't seem to be working out. Really hope the next installment isn't some kind of rehash of Empire strikes back and it takes us somewhere else	1
55480c16-e6e3-4740-82b4-6591fcae64c8	  This is where, I COMPLETELY DISAGREE With the reviews and reviewrs of this WEBSITE. UTTER RUBBISH movie and yet the so called CRITICS have given this crap movie 93%. At best I would give it a score of 30%. Real Bad new characters, the movie suffers from a hangover of the previous characters , and yet does a pretty bad job much like Indian Jones 4. Sketchy characters, hardly anything exciting or fearful, really nothing new except for its the old Coke in a New Bottle with new faces and names and yet none of them impressive as the original storyline.I found it boring....Wheres the innovation.	0
d5679c93-e43c-4150-8cb4-60c27c4986d2	  Played too safely with an identical plot to A New Hope. The stakes were never clear and Kylo Ren was a very poor antagonist. I laughed out loud in the theater when that chasm opened up between Ren and Rey near the end like the writers couldn't think of a way to have Rey win (established that she can never lose in whatever she chooses to do) but have Ren survive for the next movie. It relies on the rest of the trilogy too much to adequately explain what's going on. I almost burst out laughing again with the weird helicopter 360 shot of Luke at the end since it felt like a giant middle finger for not including a single line from him.	0
4f480b35-26a2-45ab-af0b-0e7fb45f3c61	  I can't believe people liked this movie! It was such a re-hash of most earlier Star wars movies and explored NO new ground or ideas.....They end up fighting another dark star... and even have the same kind of approaches.I A much more interesting movie would have been Luke...coming into the movie....earlier on and fighting with Hans....Solo... introducing new such Star wars' recruits and passing the baton on to the younger generation.... And don't even get me started out Hans and Leia's relationship...that was sooooo boring...I kind of feel like we've got a situation here of the Emperor's invisible clothes.... syndrome....!So, disappointing...	0
0565957e-82e5-4a3d-9553-146c84231a76	  Old movies: A burst of creativity; Tatooine, Darth Vader, R2 D2's sounds, the Death Star, the Millenium Falcon design, Hoth, X-Wing-Fighters, Yoda, Rancor, the Force, and thousand other ideas.This one: Zero; another desert planet, another droid getting a secret message, another Darth Vader (and a ridiculous one!), the same Falcon, an alien that has glasses like Geri from Pixar, a *bigger* Death Star, ...To repeat; not a *single* new idea!	0
3c56663a-cae3-411c-8776-ef15439f1497	  Maybe I'm just old and jaded but this felt like somewhat of a retread to me. I don't dislike the new characters but I don't really love them either. Darth Vader made for a truly iconic villain but there are none of that caliber to be found here. In many ways, I think the less well regarded episodes I-III had more "zest" and intrigue and I'm a bit puzzled as to why this installment has become such a chart topper.	1
ef6d1127-e2b5-46dc-8860-e4416c95746b	  I know it's not just me when I observe that the seventh episode of Star Wars felt flat, contrived and, frankly, not very interesting. "The Force Awakens" was, of course, nothing but a re-imagining of Episode 4, with basically the same motivation, same scenes, same dialogue, and same (identical) ending as "A New Hope"... but without the thrills. I never thought I'd say this, but even Harrison Ford (with his hefty $34 Million role as Han Solo) failed to inspire. Seriously, I DID NOT CARE about this cast of characters, including those of the original cast members. And THIS is the best that the golden boy J.J. Abrams can do? Fortunately, I take consolation in knowing that not one thin dime of my money went to Disney on this one.	1
140dbe16-1290-48c7-b470-735a2791cd12	  Pretty fun, just go to enjoy a good adventure movie and don't think to in depth about the plot or you will find issues. If you liked the originals you will like this one. You should at least see the originals for this to all make sense for you or this won't completely stand on its own. This is on par with a bond or mission impossible movie as far as quality but has a lot of nostalgia going for it.	1
3340955a-afc1-43d1-a71c-6111ebcf6a86	  Overrated over hyped worst star wars yet. There was better and more acting in Jar Jar binks than the whole of this movie. If you don't want to think too much and enjoy a 65 action% 15% acting 20% plot then this is for you. This is simply a remake in search for more money. Spoiler alert Nothing original except the new droid which is r2d2 hyped up. C3PO and R2D2 dont appear till near the end of the movie. Wannabe vader 2.0 wannabe emporer 2.0 etc etc nothing original	0
652fe8d4-7f5f-427f-bc83-39a0e60e123b	  Saw the first six within a week just so i could see this and i was OVER THE TOP disappointed with how number 7 panned out. It was boring, it was used, it was all around a snooze. I believe there is maybe 2 lightsaber scenes lasting a total of about 10 minutes out of the entirety of the movie. And i get it.. im huge with dialogue and characters.. THEY NAMED HIM FINN?? FINN??? THATS YOUR NEW MAIN CHARACTER IN STAR WARS?????? FINN????????? if it werent for that little robot i wouldnt of even continued watching	0
0cbd91d0-6e0c-40f0-a764-1f81d83cd226	  Better than the prequels; however, I felt like this was similar to watching the pilot episode of a television show. This movie seems to be the set-up for the upcoming sequels. It left me with a half-full feeling. A bit more "meat" could have been added to this intensely anticipated movie. Most disappointing was that the familiar characters were a little too self-aware that that were in the previous movies. Corny self-referential lines took me out of the Star Wars reality and more into a wink-wink nod-nod frame of mind. Overall, though, the movie was good. Not great. Good. Here's hoping that SW8 is a fuller movie.	1
cbe1b047-bb1e-46ef-a61a-2a1e2c83d75e	  No Star Wars feel at all, rather a generic dumb SF with some SW-elements thrown in. Absolutely not worthy of the SW name. Poorly written, badly directed and badly edited. Poor action choreography with way too fast cuts. Jarring camerawork (too close placing, unnecessary movement and "flashy angles") that breaks with the established visual style of the saga, and pulls the audience out of a galaxy far away. Inconsistencies, abandoned characters, unfocused storytelling, unimaginative settings, poor performances. In no logical way a sequel to ROTJ.	0
6653d747-e767-4605-ae4c-a330b2cd119a	  Whilst changes to the saga were always going to happen, Star Wars feels like it's been shrunk down to planetary skirmishes.Although some plot items have been increased in size, the sense of scale that battles previously had has been lost, which is disappointing.When coupled to the hit and miss with the new characters, this feels like a film lacking the charm of either IV, V and VI or the updated wow factor which I, II and III had.	1
df938959-0790-4b37-ae54-28f3fa05fe67	  A big steaming pile of derivative garbage. This film does not stand on it's own two feet, relying heavily on nostalgia to prop up this un-original and labored plot. Screenwriter was the easiest job on this project by far, basically just changing the names on the storyline from the original (Episode IV). This was a pointless exercise in re-hashing, and its a shame the fanboys and fangirls seem to be giving it a free pass.	0
b01ed4cf-d8d2-479c-9125-360686ef1596	  My O my. OK the rebel forces might be destroyed by a large weapon unless can shut down defenses to allow an attack to destroy it. Is this the first one or the third one or the 4th one...and the Jedis who can move stuff and kick ass....and can see the future sometimes....well..didn't/don't. I liked the movie for the same reason as most. I find it ironic that during the film the part that got the most cheers was the Millennium Falcon. Predictable Fun. JJ was true and loyal to the first three. I liked it and will probably see it again as it dribbles into the history of the universe. Was it bad...no....but if not a Star Wars Movie....the truth is I think most would say "it was Okay."	1
ed82ecdd-ef17-4c16-8804-5bad422b4c94	  Seen it and was disappointed, having seen all the old ones and purchased the games in the noughties I saw repeats of scenes and and no wow factor. Having seen the new Star Trek films, which by comparison were excellent this had no real storyline and did not seem to be advanced in years with new models of fighters or costumes (remember the old SMGs the star troopers had). Very disappointing for those that have been here before.	0
847de83c-2cdb-41a0-b64a-23eddf414f9e	  WTF, that's some movie which i hated. I'm one of the first generation star wars fan's. but this movie is terrible. Self the bad boy is no secret anymore. When he is angry he destroys the Console with his lightsaber instead of killing the messanger. There is not really any story behind it. just a combination of old topics. Nothing is really new. And the new Actors are terrible. This movie don't deserve a rating at all. That's more made for from the production straight into the video store. terrible	0
db8b1a58-22f3-4966-b043-614c102c3df8	  Don't read if you haven't seen this movie. I was very disappointed to see that some of the cast members were recognizable stars from other shows/films. One of the best things about the series is the new faces. I don't want to see the stars from "Heroes" or "Girls" because it distracts from who they are meant to be in this film. Also, if you are going to cast the biological grown child of two characters, at least find someone who looks as though they MIGHT have come from them. Oh, and don't kill off the most popular character in the entire series! I won't be buying this movie.	1
01de72de-dbcc-4357-bb97-58b906a07953	  Something screams in the dark. Fortunately it's not an infinite number of trade negotiations or annoying stories of epicness told by the Jedi while strolling amiably in the CGI colonnade of the temple.It sounds more like �This is what we believe you want to see: things! Things! Even more things!�Somehow, it is as if the characters in the film were actually fans of the original trilogy.However, it's still an entertaining and visually spectacular flick.	1
060fdbdf-e6fe-4efc-a8bc-bbcc4d6f9853	  In trying to recapture what made 'Star Wars' so special, director J.J. Abrams and new franchise owner Disney decided to introduce a bevy of young characters, along with some old fan favorites, over a plot that is -- for all intents and purposes -- the same as George Lucas' original film. Star Wars has always been mythic storytelling, and even the prequels featured elements mirroring the original films. But this entire approach struck me as lazy and trying to play it over-safe. To make matters worse, Abrams kind of already did this with his rebooted take on 'Star Trek' -- I expected more of him, frankly. To the filmmakers' credit however, the new cast shows a lot of promise; under the guidance of a director less willing to hang themselves up on nostalgia and take some chances, this could bode well for further installments of the new trilogy.	1
4966274c-0070-4eae-8eb8-081dea7fd44c	  Not for adults.This movie had a lot more action than the original, and more simple humor for the kids. But there was no unexplained mystery, and that removed all the "mythic proportions" that of the saga that gave it so much appeal to the original fans. That which was not directly explained was hinted at SO many times, you would have to be mentally challenged to have missed it I don't have to see the next one ... I already know the "secret" they hinted (and hinted hinted at). Not a bad movie, but no great shakes.	1
d2409f54-c6bb-4a38-b364-5ccd98dcb1bf	  Very disapointing. Disney blew it, J.J. Abrams should stick with Star Trek..at least jar jar binks wasn't in it. You decide to use special affects to create that ridiculous Golem looking "Supreme Leader" when you should've used it on "General" Leia's face and her smokers voice. She looks like an old catchers mitt and sounds like Batman. Here's hoping for a better written and more thought out episode 8. Think, "what would George Lucas do?" Not, "how can we turn this masterpeice into a Disney movie?" #Lame	0
77ab2424-0c88-4572-842d-6dd29da74b4e	  90% liked it ?? What's the basis for comparison here, the prequels? What was so good about this movie other than seeing the original characters back in action, BB-8 and other comic relief? The plot was nearly a carbon copy of Episode IV, except it was downright cartoonish in its silliness and the characters were even more one dimensional than in the prequels, albeit better actors but that's not saying much.. I wanted to love this movie so badly I was in denial until a few days after I saw it. Ask yourself if you are too..	0
6adb7ac1-35de-4461-90f8-09c4fc8501b0	  An admission to start - I was never a Star Wars fan.But after seeing this latest mess I am utterly convinced that to think it is great cinema you simply need to have been touched by 'the force'........An illogical plot, bordering on the inane; simply awful acting - with even stars with a reasonable reputation, such as Harrison Ford, embarrassing themselves (though, perhaps death by light sabre is supposed to elicit a C grade death), and derivative in almost every way a movie can be.This is dross. Dross sprinkled with stardust, but dross nevertheless.	0
8955a6a5-575c-4e30-aa1e-fb7245f29202	  Really unimpressed with this film. It just is a recycled version of the first star wars film released in 1977. But much worse than that film. The characters are wooden. I did not buy the relationship between rey and finn nor the rey's ability to channel the force so immediately. Or the relationship between Han solo and Leia. Why not take more risk and make an interesting sequel to the other films? There is no way a film like this can lose money and yet they went the safe way.	0
5a8076d2-036f-4234-8247-aae1137f7240	  Besides watching Harrison Ford and some of the humour, this is much of a fans movie. Nothing really stand out, not in any of the action or fight scenes, the space ship, environment, or special effect. As for the story, it's pretty linear and it leaves A LOTS of "unanswered questions" which is pretty much a setup for the upcoming StarWars episode in 2017, another in 2018, and another one... until no one remember about the force....	0
12ebe655-fffe-44cf-b046-2ec5d1c2b2bc	  There were some bright spots with the new characters and the new plot lines which you can look for online, however, there were too many ideas carried over, plagiarized, from the original trilogy.The movie relied too much on nostalgia and was a poor attempt at a reboot of a franchise and is nothing more than a transitional movie to steer you into the next movie.Stop me if you've heard any of these facts before. All of which are in this movie.rescue from a Star Destroyer prison on a .Guy gets tossed in the garbage chute.Droids crash on a planet pursued by dark jediThis isn't the droid you're looking for.X-wing fighter destroys the 3rd Death star.btw, there's another death star.Good jedi turns to the dark sideHis mother utters the words "I know there is still good in him, because I've felt it"Major character death at the hands of a dark jedi	0
91c1ffc3-eee8-4d01-a473-600ab6ac8720	  JJ Abrams has gotten old, his tired movies are not good anymore. This was basically just a remake of the original movie if everyone got older and history together. my problem with this movie is the drama is just not good the plot lines are very thin, there is no depth there at all. I liked the original star wars IV but this left a horrible taste in my mouth. Unfortunately I may be done with the star wars series forever.	0
07d67515-ace5-4d6d-9167-350a905a4e5a	  Horrible, horrible movie. Filled with cliche moments, plot holes, some things didn't make any absolute sense, too many sudden moments where characters meet up , the main "heroine" is a feminist propaganda mary-sue ,this is a FAIL of desperately trying to copy something from old movies but he copied the ENTIRE PLOT... JJ should be banned from producing anything in the future, he tried to mask our eyes with fancy WOW moments and cgi but that is all.. who gave this guy right to be a producer ? the whole movie industry is going slowly down the drain because of this, it's been like that for the past decade... 93% ? I guess the reviewers here got their pockets filled up to give positive opinions. I am terribly scared for the future of movie industry.	0
59927c3c-6066-4c57-861a-0e1025c43631	  The new Star Wars (The Force Awakens) people over reacted with it saying how great it was but although the actors were amazing the plot wasn't. Even the directer from the first 3 movies even said he would have done it different. In the first book is shows you tat when Luke Skywalker found out he had the force he had to learn how to use a life saver, and the mind control like thing. Now I don't know if you noticed but the new character Rey as soon as she found out she had the force she completely knew how to use everything, from the mind control, to how to use a lifesaver.	1
7a10507d-3ea8-43cf-88a8-eab7f68f2e48	  The film was more about visuals and has some really dumb moments through out and J.J. Abrams penchant to make fan fiction films. The problem for me was that Rey character at times was poorly written. inconstant, and annoying character I have seen. She speaks lines I would expect a ten year old sidekick to say in awe or some star wars fan would spew in fan fiction . Yes my eyes were rolling like they were watching the Phantom Menace when Rey was suddenly starts piloting the Millennium Falcon (plot hole) at the beginning and then Han Solo's later entrance in another ship that finds them (plot hole). I can see why Rian Johnson is taking over the franchise for Episode 8. I hope Riany fixes the characters and this franchise that has been repeatably trashed by Lucas.	0
78dc681d-53f8-43c3-b4c7-4768e9be6d9d	  RETREAD, RETREAD, RETREAD. This is a compendium of prior star wars movies nothing new here at all. I've seen them all. Asked the kids,(high school and college) what they thought, "retread, retread, retread". For those of you die hard entrained Star Wars fans this will be manna but looking at it critically, nothing new. Bored. At least I won't have to watch Harrison Ford again in episode 8. I think I'll just watch that one on redbox.	1
bbbc68cb-92a8-4bed-ba7f-f19c893a7771	  I can't believe the Tomatometer score of 93% as of today. As someone who saw all the episodes of Star Wars, in the order that they were released I am shocked. I wouldn't give " The Force Awakens" even two stars, one and a half at best, poor scripting, poor directing, poor casting and poor acting by some of the leads. What more could you NOT want in a film series that is considered iconic by generations of viewers.	0
a3cfa3eb-6af3-41d7-b283-9117e48c08f3	  Great visuals (as you'd expect) and some fantastic action sequences but the film overall is let down by some horrible and frankly unforgivable plot holes that caused me to lower my rating considerably. Having said that I still enjoyed the film and would recommend others seeing it, just prepare to be disappointed if you are unable to suspend belief and can't just go with the flow and accept it for what it is.	1
d259f6e9-c816-407a-af89-efc7b0084dda	  Apparently the world was so desperate for a period piece romance, that they saw one without the name "Nicholas Sparks" attached and swooned. Two good performances by Ronan and Cohen and a decent ending can't erase a rushed relationship and standard narrative. No.... seriously. Every "big" event between Ellis and Tony left me saying "Already????" and the second half is even worse. Don't believe the hype.	1
3ccc9707-56d0-44e5-8db9-33092c400e78	  First and foremost, Ronan is very solid in her Oscar-nominated lead performance. However, the film as a whole felt underwhelming for me. It starts with the promising premise of this girl struggling to accept love, and dealing with the hardships of being homesick and the overall struggle for immigrants in the '50's. However, heading into the second and third acts, the film falls into a very routine, "I love him but I'm almost tempted by another lover" plot device and without anything new to add to that kind of story. The film also begins with a wonderful light and quirky tone, only again to be sucked into the cliches of this romance plot, but without giving you any stakes into caring if it'll all work out. Overall Brooklyn isn't a bad, but not an overwhelmingly special movie.	1
e988b788-7f3f-4f80-88cd-b446989091b6	  Not a fan of how she decides to go back to US. Being married, and spent so many time dating the "catch" back home just seems so fucking wrong. You can argue that she isn't sleeping around but it is still so fucked up. In China, we call girls like this green tea bitxx. So when her previous employer talked to her and "reminded" her of her marriage status, suddenly she decides to go back to US? The Fxxx? This can be handled a lot better. The rest of the film is beautiful in a lot of ways.	1
3a6c607a-aed9-442c-a557-0e4feb601ab9	  Boring.Facile acting and technical work don't make this trite and dull story better than what it is.The period setting is generally wasted as it barely engages it - nothing more than eye-candy for our culture's period-fetish. The character of Tony the Italian Plumber is so on the nose, he plays like a joke. So does his loud-mouthed little brother.Audiences eat this up because ultimately they're starved for films that depict a simple, positive story. That doesn't make this film good though. More a reflection of our deprived culture than anything else.	0
9015f733-223f-4a4b-89a9-7d95bd642bf9	  This movie was awful; I don't understand the high rating. Synopsis: A super boring Irish girl moves to Brooklyn and marries a sweet Italian dude. Then her sister drops dead for absolutely no apparent reason, prompting her to go back to Ireland for a month, where she ignores her husband's letters, dates some rich Irish dude, and pretends she isn't married because ~she's conflicted~ and ~her heart is complicated~... But wait! Nevermind! Ireland sucks! So Boring goes back to Brooklyn to be with the husband she ignored for a month like nothing happened, and he's basically like, "Omg, I have no questions about any of this. Let's kiss in the street."I should have seen Star Wars for the third time.	0
94ed5abe-e1e5-47a8-917a-3dae5cdcd979	  Cute but not much else. I suppose it has some interesting and nice moments, about homesickness and finding your confidence, but I wasn't particularly compelled by anybody and I disliked how they tended to jump cut out of any large bits of dialogue. All in all, a very sweet and endearing movie but felt emotionally reserved to me. You never get a real sense of Tony so I didn't feel like she would have lost out. I'd say the lesson I learned was "don't marry the first guy you meet."	1
69a46664-efa2-48bf-8220-86b702ae89d2	  I just don't get it. This movie had good performances and gorgeous cinematography. It had a potentially good plot. But it was SO slow. I looked at my watch probably 20 times. The people i saw it with actually hated it. Just don't get the critics on this one. 98%? On such a poorly paced movie? If you're thinking about seeing this movie, wait till it comes out on DVD. Then at least you can pause the film and take a little nap while it slowly lulls you to sleep.	0
c530df00-b2ad-48fa-8444-4d70a2c4287c	  Lovely film. Acting was wonderful. Story was interesting. Storyline was good too. So whats the problem? In a nutshell . . .I don't see how Eliish (Ronan) lost her viginity to Cohen so quickly. It was a beautiful story up until that point. It was like jumping from 1950 straight into Tinder 2016. Is the author of the book a male?? Oh, maybe thats why. A man writing a book about a young Irish girl or any girl usually ends up losing her virginity right? And I thing her Italian boyfriend/husband could have been a better actor and taller. Ok, thats it in a nutshell. Too bad, it really could have been a delightful story without the trash.	1
4c472674-c57e-4b5a-aae5-e594f737a2d7	  A very "old-fashioned" movie. If it had been filmed in b&w it could have been mistaken for a 40's flick. It had a number of touching moments and a little surprise when she returns for a supposedly "short" visit back to the Emerald Isle But it took "forever" for something interesting to happen. Patience and revererence for great production values and fine acting are the keywords here.	1
3537678b-7d66-4e89-ac35-aaf1d94f5f79	  You know the reason why I saw this. If you don't, then figure it out. Anyway, this was a really good drama movie. Saoirse Ronan stars the main character who moves to Brooklyn to start a new life. She does a fantastic job in role. This wasn't here best movie but it wasn't the worst either. I was the youngest person in the theater when I went to see it. It's a good drama and I recommend it to seniors. This movie was very Irish so be ready for an Irish themed throughout the movie.	1
349fbb20-6fde-4b4a-a6b0-2ac244dbc8bb	  Apparently the world was so desperate for a period piece romance, that they saw one without the name "Nicholas Sparks" attached and swooned. Two good performances by Ronan and Cohen and a decent ending can't erase a rushed relationship and standard narrative. No.... seriously. Every "big" event between Ellis and Tony left me saying "Already????" and the second half is even worse. Don't believe the hype.	1
199a0f7f-ceeb-4573-85aa-f6e2af141640	  This has to rate as the most boring movie of the year. The old "boy-meets-girl" story unfolds like the slow boat from Ireland to Brooklyn. It's all predictable and Saoirse Ronan sleep walks through it with a wooden performance that adds to the soporific effect. Emory Cohen is the only sign of life in a vibrant supporting role as the nice Italian boy (and he does look a bit young for the part) who wins Ms. Ronan's heart, hastily marries her, loses her, and you can guess the sappy ending (yawn).	0
229b6616-cbd5-48cc-a192-a6f5b792eea3	  A young Irish woman leaves her mom and sister behind and travels to America seeking a better life where she quickly gets over being homesick, finds a good job and falls in love with and marries the first person she dates; but when she returns to Ireland to comfort her mother after the tragic death of her sister, she is tempted with a job and new man, until she is confronted that she is married and so she returns home to her true love. The End. Seriously?	1
a6b2caf1-0c7c-4a2c-b1c7-14574f8e1af5	  I would watch Saoirse Ronan in just about anything, and she proves once again that she has true range and star quality.I was reluctant to see this movie previously because I had the impression that it would be depressing. However, without revealing any spoilers, I can say that it is in fact an uplifting and emotionally engaging story that many viewers would enjoy.The comic relief scenes also contribute balance and lightness, with charming appearances by Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent.	1
33bf1725-c54b-4581-aa47-1c2b960f69d2	  I'm not as impressed with Brooklyn as I had hoped to be. Despite the talented actors involved, the fact that the title of the film removes any doubt as to the outcome and the less than exceptional writing and directing leaves me indifferent. There is little to no character development for anyone involved in the story other than the lead and it seems as if the vast majority of the film is purely background and lead up to a conflict which is over almost before it began. Brooklyn is okay to watch on a lazy day when one has nothing else to do but there are several better options available at the theatre at this time.	1
979f4972-83d8-4a81-9819-5be2d9e07c15	  I was raised very Catholic and no longer practice and do not consider myself such. I honestly do not see what everyone is raving about with this movie. I almost fell asleep during the first 30 minutes it is very slow moving! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the acting talent. Some of the limes are so badly written it's almost laughable. There is no chemistry between the actors. The cast is seriously lacking in diversity. This story has been told too many times and I was hoping that possibly the movie would add a different perspective to it. Instead it just beat the same add dead horse we have heard for years. Same old stuff just repackaged. I have no idea how this movie got a nomination for best directing when the majority of it takes place in one room!	0
412bb1ed-2ba7-40bc-8c5c-f7fb8453fe41	  Good but overrated. This was no "All The President"s Men." Simply not crackling and gripping as expected. All performances were excellent, led by Keaton, but Oscar worthy is debatable. All the unknown actors and bit roles very much out-shined the bigger performances. Oscar nod for Rachel McAdams for mostly taking notes on a pad is perplexing to say the least. Overall did not live up to the hype based on nominations. Direction was excellent and worthy of nod but could not create the tension it needed. It was easy to lose track of all the names and characters that are mentioned in rapid-fire fashion throughout. Most dissapointing was Liev Schreiber in a very under developed role.	1
2cae913d-1af8-4142-a4ec-28b1da71988b	  certainly entertaining enough. a good story. but i realy didnt have any emotional investment in the film. i understand that it had to focus on the investigation. that it was an ode to investigative journalism... that the story was really to big and it had to focus on the journalists and not and part of the story that could have easily been emotional. or could have had more of an emotional story arc. none of the performances were that great as none of them really had too much to do. noe one has anything challenging. liev schreiber was the only one of note. i though mark ruffalo had a couple very odd moments. its a whats for dinner movie.	1
886b406d-5734-4b68-8e0e-04afa49c0603	  The true story behind the film dwarfs it both in the moment and after - when its greatest impact is felt through a series of pointed, factual inserts about what the team's work ultimately laid bare. Ruffalo does memorable, if mannered, work, and the film is brisk and intellectually engaging. It's not, as some purport, a stellar achievement in film; but, rather, a serviceable, workmanlike documenting of a stellar achievement in journalism.	1
c5d00692-8160-4f4d-996c-71440fdaa482	  Preachy (no pun intended), forced, self-righteous, and yet another movie that demonizes religion. I'm not all that religious, and yet even I'm getting sick of this denigrating, Hollywood trend.There is some good acting to be had here, though. Michael Keaton, in particular, is enjoying a deserved renaissance. For the life of me, however, I do not understand the appeal of Mark Ruffalo. Besides just being generally annoying, I just don't find him to be a convincing actor.	0
3448a294-901e-4726-bd0b-ca8f61a8888b	  Dumb, derivative and above all, awful.How this film can be considered in such high regard is probably the most menacing thing about it. When you consider that this scores higher than Hitchcock's legendary "Psycho" or Carpenters masterful "Halloween", you will be deeply disturbed.The plot is riddled with holes and is no more complex than a Tom and Jerry cartoon and it's multiple levels are presumably that it is a metaphor for STD's.If however, you live in fear of an easily avoidable adversary throwing a toaster at you then prepare to be horrified.Don�t waste your time, watch a classic horror film instead.	0
be93bc55-02c7-4034-b54c-adbe87beb698	  There is nothing overtly bad about this movie, but neither is there anything that impressive that will stand out. The film is marked as horror, but really it seems to have as much comedy as horror to me - in other words, this isn't about to be the start of a franchise such as a Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Candyman, or numerous other horror flicks. It's more horror to the main character and a couple of her friends. The audience? Not so much. To be blunt, I personally considered this as much comedy as horror, and for the "critics consensus" about it being terrifying? Hardly. Worth seeing as a rental, but really not that frightening.	1
3353255d-5103-4664-9ac1-e037fd94b219	  This film was ridiculous. Seeing the 97% on Rotten tomatoes I figured it must be good. But I was horribly mistaken.The concept seems parodical, but takes itself completely serious. The characters are unlikable and the pacing is atrocious.I did get a good laugh near the end, but passed that it was just bad. It wasn't scary, it wasn't suspenseful. The attempts at suspense just came across as slow and boring. Just. Bad.	0
d2fa0ed5-858e-4ef2-869f-17d1bf0f4a78	  Probably the most overrated movie i've ever seen. I first saw this movie before I read any of the reviews on rotten tomatoes or IMBD and I thought it was awful. It does not leave you in suspense or scare you throughout. The only scares, if you want to call them that, were jump scares, only one of which not being predictable. It definitely is not smart, as it is literally about an STD. The acting is mediocre along with the plot which overall makes the movie extremely boring. At points in the movie I felt myself falling asleep. Overall a boring movie with mediocre acting, a bad plot, and extremely predictable and stupid jumpscares.	0
4e674ecc-dbbb-4a5c-900c-7b022a64e3f7	  Mood does not a movie make, but that seems to be much of what this overrated exercise in alleged horror seems to rely on to carry the film. Its heavy-handed STD symbolism and allusions to classic horror films don't add much either, especially when weighted down by an excess of prolonged shots of characters emoting while contemplating their fates. I missed seeing this in theaters when it was initially released (I was attending the Chicago Film Festival at the time), but I'm glad I didn't waste any effort trying to fit this one in during its initial run. Easily one of the year's most overhyped offerings.	0
afb0d2a5-541b-4196-bd88-074e0f0f612e	  Even if I had not heard of flattery reviews It Follows received, I would have found it not entertaining. Premise is very strong and interesting but to keep it realistic and teen friendly, there is nothing happening on screen except for nudity. I would call cinematography weak as well as there was not much shaking of camera which was eminent for this genre. Another aspect is adult absence in the movie which is confusing.Not so entertaining movie which completely failed to build strong work on good idea.	0
ebd0f5cc-921b-42ba-902a-d8dd05f2ae57	  This movie is not a waste of life don't get me wrong, its a solid 2,5 stars maybe even 3. Without a doubt the movie is scary and has a unique way of delivering its horror. However the script is sparse, dotted with awkward moments where another line or two could have helped nurture the scene a bit more. Perhaps the writer/director David Mitchel thought to fill these gaps with some kind of visual narration but it rang empty (fell on blind eyes?) in my opinion.Putting some awkward moments aside, in general the film is shot well and the sound design, excellent! If you enjoyed Final Destination (the original) then you may find the the kind of suspense beats on offer here familiar and I would recommend this movie in kind.	1
84d2dc00-e47f-466d-8e13-4b59e906c5c0	  This movie was lame. I don't know how it got such a high score.... "it" is just a weird killer thing that gets passed by banging, but it doesn't....uninteresting concept. It did not leave me "lingering" it left me with a weird face and wanting to write this negative review. Don't waste your time, the movie Teeth was better and that movie blows too.	0
67e3e89c-3243-431a-b147-45046803ab8f	  55%Saw this on 13/8/15Aside from a few jump scares and a reasonably good performance from Maika Monroe, It follows is an unoriginal film with a pedestrian story that still thinks that those who loose their virginity before marriage are to be put under the knife. These are the kind of shits that the original Scream(1996) so effectively mocked. This is also a kind of film that you feel like appreciating while you watchit, but once it's over, you end up feeling how unmemorable all the shit really is.	1
84006593-a12a-4564-b120-67931e7fe8df	  So this movie got crazy good reviews when it came out which got me interested in seeing it. I know I am in the minority but I did not like it. It just becomes so inconsistent and leaves so much stuff open ended that is just became frustrating. There are these scenes that happen and are never answered, the kids make the dumbest decisions (especially nearly the end with the whole pool thing) when they know all about "it", the music got super annoying, and I just thought it was not scary at all, in fact it was kind of boring! I liked Maika Monroe she was a good lead here, it was all filmed in Detroit which gave it a good suburban feel, and it was cool that it had a low budget type of feel to it.	0
f2a7fd45-de02-435a-b8b6-9fd75dd3c203	  Oh, farting chick. Charming. I hate the farting narcoleptic girl. Do these kids have parents? It gets major points for featuring a Father and Son commercial. Is it not allowed to follow when you're sleeping? That slut will sleep with anyone to get rid of her pursuer. No wonder she's surrounded by perverts. Actually, an interesting idea. Some of the night scenes in Detroit in slow mo with jarring music are quite effective. The ending made no sense. Why would there be a bloody pool if it was already sot before? Cause it's in water, that was never electrocuted? This cause a half-star deduction. But the amazing Detroit-ness adds that half star.Paul: "You could...pass it on."Subtle.	1
083b6c64-9b12-48d1-896d-964b5dac1040	  It follows has a pretty unique story line where our lead actress, Jay, contacts an STD (Sexual Transmitted Demon) from a seemingly innocent sexual encounter. She soon finds out that this innocent encounter will eventually haunt her until she finds somebody else to pass the (STD) to. I feel like this movie had a lot of potential, but lacked a lot of depth. The story seemed to be one big loop hole. Good graphics, great soundtrack, alright actors. Like I said, it had potential, but over all I think it was just alright, and the story didn't make much sense.	0
130135eb-394e-4348-b29e-d7cdf8129d5b	  I've heard a lot of hype over this one so I gave it a watch. Overall it ain't bad but a good deal of faults stand out to me more than the positive aspects of it. It was mildly chilling but the characters were pretty much lifeless and the dialogue was poor. The toss in of Dostoevsky and TS Elliot quotes to attempt to latch onto a greater theme felt very cheap. It was cleanly shot and overall the score was quite good, except for a couple of the cues which sounded like the wrong sort of 80s horror soundtrack. I probably wouldn't watch it again. Very cheesy all and all.	1
0bdba826-b56f-4e82-8d97-414ec69c7583	  There are a lot of positives I can point out with this film. A good unknown cast, an original story, some very nice directing resulting in a very aesthetically pleasing movie. The ending, however is likely to disappoint a lot of people. That is unless they plan to make several sequels to explain what happens next, a question which we sort of need to know. I thought that they could have done a lot more too, there were not enough scary scenes which was a bit of a waste.	1
885ea52e-12bc-4a0e-8c26-487bceb265ab	  It Follows is only scary if you are frightened by awkward pauses and stupidity. It's like the filmmakers knew their actors were terrible and their dialogue was awful, so they avoided having the characters talk as much as possible. The plot doesn't make sense and it is constantly breaking its own rules. The stalking monster is creepy in theory, but around the third or fourth time the characters run away from it, the premise gets old. The most horrifying thing to me is that some people actually like this movie.	0
9f34d9c5-2fde-4940-b685-4b2ff00a44f4	  It showcased performers playing their actual ages while talking and dressing the ages they represented which was a nice change for film makers though the director was in love with our main character's feet a little too much. This movie had potential to be better, but suffered from long bouts of nothing more than character development which it did indeed succeed in making the characters realistic and likable. But as creepy as the rare parts were, it just missed being as agonizing as it was built up as.	1
3f5a91bc-e358-4853-a4a4-fd306f695abc	  "It Follows" | C- | One of the best premises in horror film history: brilliantly simple and truly terrifying.Unfortunately the writer-director's execution is so poor, the finished product deserves a D (I kept it at "C" level because of the premise and a great lead performance). If you can ignore the embarrassingly bad music/score, check out this overrated mess. Critics have it at 96% but the audience has it at 65%?You'll enjoy the amazing first 30 minutes, then spend the next hour laughing at the filmmakers' horrible decisions (so horrible they're almost entertaining, especially the ridiculous pool scene).	0
91606463-b20d-48ac-8194-d5390bcb37e4	  Someone please tell me why this movie was rated so high ! It was quite boring, and full of cheap thrills. The horror was completely driven by the interfering background score and all the other popular techniques of close up and lack of information for the viewer was explored. There was nothing particularly innovative. It was very average to say the most and painstakingly mindnumbing to say the least. There is a reason why I don't watch Horror. This movie epitomizes it.	0
6a6e659c-ec33-4be6-a54a-de9d7d77fe4e	  Listen to me closely, the amount of positive reviews for this brutally terrible movie are both destroying my faith in Rotten Tomatoes and the human race in general. I know you think I might be harsh here, but I am honestly just trying to get you to not waste your life like I did. This movie had terrible acting,a story as empty as my own soul after watching this, and an ending so abrupt and bad that I spent the better part of my evening last night trying to find the person who wrote this, just so I could kick that person in the nuts.Please like better movies in the future and stop hyping up this sort of trash.I gave it half a star on the basis that it succeeded in one aspect of horror, as it is frighteningly bad and as such made me want to vomit myself into oblivion.	0
c8b1b202-424c-4588-8402-e82b9c5f04c4	  This horror flick had a lot of potential and it squandered it. Instead of elevating its very original conceit to something truly terrifying and poignant, it instead lost its focus for two thirds of the movie, devolving into lame dialogue and cheap thrills. And there was something awkward about the movie's characters overall (intentional?) that I did not like. The best thing I can say about this movie is its Drive-esque soundtrack, all synthy gloss and New Wave sounds, but even that should tell you something: the soundtrack is kept to a bare minimum for most of the movie.	1
99923fbf-35c3-4515-a454-c78c3d804a9c	  Decent idea to start a movie, then it never plays itself out. I was hoping for a refreshing, twisting plot. Instead, its just a movie about about the weirdest STD (Sexually Transmitted Deceased) ever. I'm fine with zero to little gore, and even fine with an ending that doesn't wrap up everything in a nice little bow, but an annoying score and boring plot (with too many holes)doomed this flick for me. Not scary or even creative beyond the first fifteen minutes of the movie. Definitely a polarizing movie amongst horror fans though. The one never even heated up to the slow burn I was expecting.	0
fbe8c889-0dec-4207-b185-aeccd3874d53	  A thought provoking horror that nicely blends low-key cinematography with the slasher genre. Its a good horror to watch if your don't like being frightened with horror movie scare tactics, as they are kept to a minimum. Terror is instead made up for in excellent plot and cinematography. The only let down of this film was the ending, It may have been a little to subtle for me to grasp or it could just been intentionally straight forward, leaving many question unresolved. I've read that there may be a squeal in the works so it may have been sitting itself up for that. Nice too see a more progressive film of this genre. I will be looking out for more work by this team.	1
27f65521-2296-4fdc-8a6d-cf8b59744ac6	  I don't understand how this movie is so highly rated. I watched it three times and it is still or terrible movie. It's not even good enough to be a SciFi original movie it's that bad.The story was original, I'll give you that. But it doesn't make any sense. Nothing is clearly explained. Not scary at all. Not creepy. No jump-scares. No suspense. Instead of jumping out of my seat with fear I was rolling my eyes with disappointment.To me this movie felt like it was made by a Christian Pro-Abstinence group in order to scare kids into not having sex and making Jesus cry. If movie reviews are bought than the budget for the reviews was at least 3x the budget for the movie.	0
36d64d56-25c6-45a4-981d-010ae412c217	  I would give this 0 stars if I could. I felt this movie had nothing but pointless awkward sex scenes, nudity to try and be shocking and just got trite. I wish I could get the hours wasted on this movie back so I could have the time to watch something that had a shred of scary. Ohhh find the idea can be somewhat new but if it is boring and unscary what is the point!	0
190576be-4436-42a1-a318-ee76c2e6e157	  Gives a whole new meaning to the term STD, as in spectrally transmitted disease. If you watch it straight up then it doesn't make much sense since the monster moves really slow (it follows) and while that gives it some creepy moments it's a bit hard to carry a whole film on that premise. So 1-1/2 stars for me on that. If, however, you look at it as an existential film ala Bunuel's The Exterminating Angel, then it becomes a film about life, death and our response to inevitable mortality - keep moving! In that respect it earns 3 stars, maybe 3-1/2. So, it is only so-so as a horror film but is quite good as an existential film about life, sex, and death. IMHO	0
040c7ae1-68d4-47aa-a6f6-3cbad3efc54c	  Visually compelling and stylistically refreshing for a horror movie... at least on paper. But in real life It's boring as all hell, and barely scary. And no, I'm not one of those people that needs gore and jump scares to enjoy a horror movie. I give it credit for being something more than a hunted house, demon child, or murder fest. But not a whole lot of anything at all happens. For me, this movie was a victim of the hype.	1
daacb551-67f0-4c37-bf41-4616a672cf27	  I was watching 'It Follows' and turned it off midway. Unfortunately overrated doesn't adequately describe the praise it received. The problem was the story didn't develop fast enough before the remote forced it off the screen. Instead we have a bunch of American, teen, culture references midst a girl who's been cursed for having intercourse. The setting and filming were perfect, and there were even times where I was surprised by the horror aspect, but its slow development and hokey premise were enough to cripple the thrill.	1
e7d959aa-5959-4a2c-a7a5-7136bb18ffff	  I'm not against indie horror films that go for style and story over scares. And I also know that every horror flick doesn't have to be packed with gore or jumps scares. However, It Follows left me with nothing. No sense of dread, I was never creeped out, freaked out, or the least bit afraid. And when the dead victims, ghosts, cursed, w/e, appeared, it was nowhere near as effective as how M. Night Shyamalan pulled it off in The Sixth Sense. I'm not necessarily suggesting skipping It Follows, but if you never end up seeing this movie, you're not missing out on much.	0
7a8b1173-1dd0-4b23-a9e7-077fe664e7e5	  After reading some rave reviews, i was looking forward to see a nice horror flick and I ended up watching a nonsense movie. The trailer also made a lot of promise, but most of things were super lame to me. No offense, but throughout the movie, I was wondering if this movie was work of some i-am-too-intelligent-for-you chick. However, I did like the camera work and specially the ruthless, cold suburb lanes and some genuine style (that's why two stars from me), but everything else is lame and crap.	0
fa0d03e4-7e95-4793-9a04-3a725c72b40c	  A slow but pretty good horror film. It Follows creates a terrifying concept that is very unique to horror films. It wasn't as scary as I was hoping it to be, but it did deliver a few scares and unique moments. The dull dialogue and slow pace does bog down the plot and the whole movie in general. It Follows is worth watching, but you might not find the whole movie as unique as the idea of it.	1
48bf933e-c7ce-4f6c-a1e4-4e1bedbb0662	  A horror movie with tons of critic respect but I'm not quite sure why. I'll give it props for being original and the camera work is interesting at times but the movie is soooo slow and worst of all its not very scary. Most of the movie is shots of Detroit and a group of teens sitting around talking. I get what they were trying to do but it just didn't spook me. Skip it!	0
17ce0fcc-e934-4c71-a0be-daaf40565d2e	  It was sexist and weird. Furthering the notion that woman's sexuality is bad. Plain and simple. Also, what constitutes as a sexual act that would move this thing to follow? So sex act between a man and a woman where the woman clear doesn't enjoy herself, then followed by a creepy thing, after what seems to be a rape scene. No one else was disturbed by that guy being a rapey creep who kidnapped her?	0
0bbe091c-ff24-435b-9470-7a8b23092df2	  Well directed overt homage to Carpenter. The film never truly scares you, packed with bored millennials and the worst music I've heard in a modern film, of course I'm not a fan of Carpenters use of those horrible synth sounds , but at least they were innovative for the 80s . The director does capture the sleepiness of the suburbs and the slow moving juggernaut of its consuming boredom . Yeah it's arty and pastiche , I get it, but I still won't get the 90 minutes I wasted on this film back.	0
3e59804f-a747-4a9a-b723-724f68df2ca1	  This movie was a total let down. Good scary/horror movies are hard to come by and this is not one of them. The beginning will keeps you in suspense with the death of the opening girl and then as you 1st see the ghost/monster/it chasing the lead character to kill her. Other than those 2 and the beach scene, this movie has a weird fixation of an 80s feel that doesn't fit the story. When watching this movie you easily get into the mood of this is ridiculous, and if this thing is chasing me on foot at a walking pace, with not move to an island or live in opposite sides of the country for months on end.This movie may seem scary for the 13 and 14 year olds out there that often go to the movies, but critics should be shame for praising this garbage as a good scary movie.	0
2b64c110-b0c1-44f3-ae6c-0d935ec36844	  I have never reviewed a movie on the internet before, but I HAVE to make an exception here. This is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen in my life, and I watch a lot of movies. I especially love horror flicks so after reading some of the reviews online I was expecting a good time. NOTHING TO SEE HERE. An absolute waste of time and money, I wanted to walk out after 45 minutes, when I could tell that the plot was going nowhere. Just a stupid movie and an excuse to focus on irresponsible sexual behavior.	0
b0bf4350-219a-4c6f-8b3c-5e520404fe53	  "It's disturbing in its own right, especially the concept of being followed everywhere, but what this indie-horror film is lacking in is the sense that we could care so little for the characters because their development is stunted by such dull dialogue. However, the director gets props for great camerawork, a good produced score and some really eerie scenes (wait until you hit 15 minutes before the end credits roll out).	1
891eb3bb-dc82-4c94-b424-746df7c411f8	  I decided to watch this movie, It Follows, based on the reviews from multiple websites. Many critics seem to agree that the movie is a revelation, a revitalizing of the Horror genre itself. Let me tell you:It is not, at all.It Follows barely passes for a TV-Mature late-night B movie that you would see on the USA channel. Don't get me wrong, the premise is great. That drew me in alone, and the initial scene with the monster, the audience's first experience, is not bad. However it goes downhill very fast, and does not stop going downhill until the end of the film. Do not waste your time or money on this movie.	0
cb6b8038-7ede-430c-b80f-513a23d3699f	  Disappointing. I'm not a big horror fan but the glowing reviews for this film enticed me to give it a look. Stylish and unpredictable, yes. But the unique story completely fizzled out. I didn't want or expect a neat explanation for everything, but the ending left me feeling that the filmmakers couldn't figure out where to go next, so instead opted for an abupt ending, hoping critics would find that bold. It wasn't	1
83a83043-60fd-4c72-a0eb-b022d29953e3	  Okay first of all, I trusted you Rotten Tomatoes. Secondly: I could never tell what was going on with the movie, it jumped way too much and frankly, I'm pretty sure I have whip lash from it. Third: what was up with the electronics around the pool? Seriously, what was that? Did you think that after shooting it in the head once that electrifying it or shooting it again would work? Lastly, I could totally jam to this soundtrack but it didn't really seem to work with what was going on. Over all, would not recommend and kind of wish I could give it less than half a star because I wasted my money and time on this.	0
2de9a49f-660e-42f6-bc8e-e6861f0ff32e	  a different type of horror film no doubt, and one with a clear underlying theme it plays off of that everyone has experienced (your first sexual experience, how it affects you, and how you deal with the aftermath). believeable performances from a cast so young, but for me this film falls victim to it's own hype. watching on demand after it's initial theater run i had heard how unique the movie was for the horror genre and was expecting something great. what i saw was a decent film that does a good job setting a spooky aura for itself but a movie that had been HEAVILY influenced by other films in the genre to the point that some of the scenes were direct copies (i.e: the Faculty, Let the Right One In). not a bad film for a late night scare, but not as innovative as The Cabin in the Woods either.	1
537b2f78-23c1-438a-8bf2-ea645b669ba5	  Lets start by saying its a good premise...then lets go into saying that its completely destroyed and wasted. Most scenes just end in a fade, unresolved or really explained other then the standard "couldnt really think of a ending there". The now standard "lets put a 80s score on the film" is completely out of place and more distracting then not putting anything behind the scenes. The direction and acting is so lax that it just makes you angry to still be sitting there watching it going "For fucks sake, why are you fucking up this film?" It could be a case of a great film that was killed in post or by production, but whatever it is- its not the glory all that everyone talked about.	0
b0ba3bb4-3d75-4665-9462-18b714377aa5	  The movie jumps right into the story and sets you up for what is to come, it seems like the pace will be very frantic at first, but then everything really slows down, it does have the creepy shots and feel going for it that reminded me of "Halloween" from the scenery, the way it is shot and the music, but still seems slow and there is a major reason for that which I won't say. I was expecting something more I guess. I don't wanna say too much but it did not live up to the hype. It is worth watching because it is well made and a good horror flick is very rare these days. Good is about as high as I can praise it though.	1
b482ce7d-7091-4833-ab64-2dea2d036bae	  This movie would be great if it weren't for the constant 70's & 80's references. I love horror films, (a bit to much), but I don't need to be reminded of horror's greatest ages. Enough with the synth sound track and rolled up jean jackets. I need something new! The story was good, the scene shots excellent-just bring things up to date a little. Not to much, I mean, I still like pop culture references, just not an entire movie built on them.	1
8d67772d-893f-42b2-b7b5-d1daf07e32e2	  This movie was a complete and total waste of fucking time. The acting was bad, the plot was bad, the "suspense" was bad. You people want to fucking sit here and tell me that this was fucking number one movie of the year? Bullshit. The main character was also a fucking idiot. The thing walks; that's all it does. Why the hell are you freaking out over it? You could power walk away from it, no need to wreck your friend's car. This is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through.	0
8ab9e136-7ea4-484d-a47a-a6cdd36f84c8	  Yes, the concept is original imagining teen sex as some type of horrible 1/2 naked shapeshifting demon that "follows" you around stalking your every move and there were a few creepy scenes. It's also hard to throw shade on hot teenagers running around in skimpy clothing....but I also don't think there was enough going on here to make this movie truly scary or that memorable. It's not all bad, but it's not that great either.	1
43bc61e8-9729-40e7-9c88-04ed142a251b	  This was a giant piece of garbage that was a complete and total waste of a perfectly good budget. The acting (If you can call it that) was more on par with a early 70's porno, and the plot.... wtf.. I couldn't even sit through this piece of crap, I turned it off and got rid of it, and that says a lot because I watched Rosemary's Baby right through....	0
128d0415-b461-4ba6-9db6-a95e075d6334	  I am a huge horror fan so as expected I have been looking forward to this one for months. THUD! Well shot, credible acting, cool music but not one decent scare. As a matter of fact this movie went nowhere fast including the innocuous ending. The opening scene was so promising but really had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. I just did not care for this one at all.	0
72e7e3ec-3e33-4cfb-b7fb-8e25014d57ba	  The critics loved this film, but perhaps only the weirdos watched and reviewed it. They talk about great performances and metaphors for teen sexuality and a really uniquely terrifying film. But the film I watched was shit and excruciating to watch and it ruined my day. Sitting there in the theater watching these long ugly scenes, with shit characters and smelly dialogue and this blaring synthesizer music that must have gone on for 60 mins straight; and looking across at my date who gives me a troubled smile that seems to say "You really fucked up with this film that you said was really good, we could be hanging at the pools right now"	0
35db7ce6-cbc7-40a1-86c9-e9c5335fb296	  Started off very good, with some real promise. The biggest problem I have with the movie is it made no attempt to explain anything or than 'Have sex and pass it on to someone else'. Part of what makes a movie scary or intense is the lore behind what is going on. Then, to add insult to injury, it just peters off. Im almost certain that there was no ending written for this movie.	0
e15d7251-4931-4781-9d5b-01be2941a1cf	  I'm not sure why so many people are saying this movie is scary when it really isn't (unless you count the fact everyone owns a television from 1975 for some strange reason). The premise is really good but comes off completely dull and boring thanks to the director trying WAY too hard to make the movie feel like a late seventies movie. The result is a movie acted by dull characters that comes off way too dull. Horror from the 70s was slow but riveting. This was not. Adding the synth soundtrack also screamed that the director was trying too hard to make it a 70s movie. Thinking you can electrify a giant swimming pool with some house appliances also made me lose all respect for the characters intelligence level as well. Nobody with an IQ above 10 would think that would work.	0
c1e87658-e2e4-4d1a-b1b6-77c93235bce1	  Writer and director David Robert Mitchell has a very simple, very scary idea: imagine being followed everywhere you go by a lone figure that's slowly but surely creeping towards you and that no-one else can see. Unfortunately, the idea doesn't quite work in practice, at least not as a feature length film. For most of its running time, It Follows is atmospheric, engrossing and often strikingly beautiful. But cheap jump scares and an absurd climax seriously undermine it, with Mitchell either unable or unwilling to commit fully to his premise. It's a shame - this could've been great.	1
d61892eb-74da-4cf2-8f2a-55474f0d59d2	  It Follows? No... IT SUCKS!!! The only thing this movie follows is directions to the can. I am a big horror fan and I'm always searching for a decent scare. So I saw the movie based on the ratings. Not impressed. it is obvious, the makers of this production know how to bribe a critic. Unfortunately, we followed, IT won and that's the lembowski score.	0
41ba9cc8-f5ec-415d-81ce-81da90f4f8be	  I have absolutely no clue as to why this movie is reviewed so highly. I had a friend visiting from out of town and we went simply because of Rotten Tomatoes. This film was utterly boring, unscary and was one of the first times I have EVER considered asking for a refund. I also love all types of horror films and I am still seeing these scores and feel like I am in the twilight zone. Immediately upon the movie ending, another audience member got up and expressed his displeasure in what he had read on Apples as well. I truly don't get it.	0
98890821-6519-4761-8324-5290937f8e51	  It Follows' inspiration garnered from John Carpenter's 1978 horror vision Halloween is simply obvious from the beginning with the portrayal of teenagers that are for the most part entirely normal and deal with the things the way the rest of us would. It's totally indie but also really polished. Unfortunately, I found that the awesome idea behind the film and the originality and attractiveness of the camera work are watered down by the pace and mood of the film that make it a tad boring at parts, predictable and a bit too subtle to even be acknowledged. It could've been amazing and one of the best horror films of the year, it isn't, but its definitely one of the most interesting.	1
19aa23c7-c2be-484f-a94e-8b7de982ec85	  This movie is $7 and 2 hours of my life I will never get back. The best part of the movie was the previews. I don't know how in the world this got such a high rating, but you would be better off giving your money to a homeless person or getting a happy meal. Trust me, it would be a far better experience. The dialogue and acting is an abomination. And there is this girl who reads random quotes from a kindle in a clam shell. It has all the suddenness of a early eighty's horror film complete with bad synthetic music yet it carries no other qualities of a film. Just don't waste your money	0
fbd3ef7a-07c6-4389-84c1-4610259dd575	  I REALLY don't know what everyone was thinking when they gave this movie anything except for a warning NOT to waste your time! BAD ACTING, stupid script and the list could go on and on. There is nothing redeeming about this film, I literally can't think of one good thing to say about it, except for it's over and I never have to sit through that again!!! STAY AWAY!!!	0
275949c4-91c7-4c25-8fff-0866c32ff63c	  The trailer had me psyched for this movie but this was a huge let down. There were a lot of slow moments in this film with unnecessary dialogue. I had also expected "It" to be something we never saw. Instead "It" was just a series of slow walking gross looking people. And "It" turned out to be an STD. There was a lot of promise with the concept of this film but it was poorly done.	0
cac60922-7cb0-4fa9-ac0e-724408eebde1	  There's stuff to like in terms of retro style (that soundtrack!) and the acting is more than competent (Maika Monroe is terrific, although the retro horror movie she made last year, The Guest, was way better) . But the dream-like time period annoyed the hell out of me, and bottom line: this is The Ring, but with sex instead of a video. And it's a good thing the monster never actually sneaks up on anyone or comes for them while they're sleeping.	0
5bc0d33e-86d8-4bb4-b6cc-a6bdad8fa39e	  Oh Puurlease, despite the plethora glowing critiques, the follwing is a B+ movie with better than average acting skills. The best thing about this film is the concept which is at least original but as for fright value, I'm afraid the following scrapes the very bottom of the bucket. Sexually transmitted followers are perhaps only slightly more uncomfortable than a virulent STD and with an equal horror factor than originates from below the belt.Saying that, if you have nothing else to do and it's raining outside, it's worth the watch, but not recommended for those on a first date.	0
861065e4-4ed7-4194-9cfc-d63ba0dde4b8	  Terribly boring, super slow burn. Not scary, better suited as a made for TV movie. It just amazes me how this film is so regarded by these critics. All this shows me is that no one should be paying attention to critics, they simply are trying to sabotage the Horror genre with art-house garbage. My advise to anyone who wants to see this film, wait till it's on free tv, it will put you to sleep. I am SHOCKED this is rated R, PG would suffice, they showed absolutely nothing, all implied.	0
09f5b051-0d15-499e-832c-ee084ded9530	  Sorry, but this isn't original. It fits in the body horror genre and belongs along certain films like 'Teeth' and Cronenberg's 'Shivers'. So calling it original is for the naive or amateur horror buffs. Now as for the film it's pretty stupid and slow moving. I felt like a zombie while watching it. My brain severely numbed by the whole experience. It's artistically driven and I'll give it that, but harbors a severe amount of artsy fartsy that I really couldn't help but laugh at certain times. Like the pool scene near the end where they try to electrocute the IT that follows while the main protagonist is in the pool. Like I said stupid. Overall, Hipster horror at it's finest. The only thing I would say that was missing was the MTV Films logo at the beginning.	0
1092a98c-0360-491c-aa8e-89b32870025d	  i was incredibly disappointed. this got such good reviews i was expecting a lot more. i get what it was going for, which, yes, is a very scary concept -- something follows you that only you can see so no one else can help you. and it doesn't stop. you can run from it and delay it, but sooner or later it'll get you. unless you pass it on. good grief. it kind of seemed like this entire film was a giant metaphor for what happens to promiscuous teens. STDs; they'll get cha. anywho, the acting wasn't that great and it seemed kind of choppy -- i think they could've done much better with this.	0
76125590-e6c3-40c1-8db1-68e94a49a3cd	  Did the reviewers watch the same film I did? When this one ended my first thought was that I'd just seen a high school or college project that received a failing grade. This was one of the least scary and most ridiculous movies I've ever seen. The film is so slow, the plot so poorly executed that IT Follows ranks among the worst movies ever to hit the theater. Even the gratuitous nudity (a staple in most good horror flix) was beyond gratuitous; even beyond silly. What a waste of time and money.	0
510ce6bd-4d7a-4e22-83f4-b7301a2a7624	  After a sexual encounter, a teenager is told that she has been passed on a curse in which a supernatural terror is constantly hollowing her in the form of a person walking towards he. The only way to escape the curse is to pass it on.Certainly original in its premise, It Follows is still quite mired in the early 80s horror of Carpenter and Cronenburg and rather the better film for it. More unnerving than scary, though once the concept of the big bad is told, you will be searching the background for figures walking slowly.Entertaining and original, just didn't scare me.	1
0d9eba03-0056-4c8e-9ace-239e1cea4937	  I was VERY disappointed by this film. After reading a lot of the reviews on this site, I was looking forward to a good movie and a good scare. Unfortunately, I found the movie to be, overall, pretty lame. On the positive side- I liked many of the performances and I liked the basic creepiness of the film. However, there were too many holes in the plot and the ending was absolutely stupid.	0
648094e9-acfd-41f6-a7b3-6253ffaf276c	  The things to admire in this movie fall short of being good entertainment. For example, the lighting director knocked himself out illuminating minor details to give every scene depth and interest. The sound designer made creepy music that made me wonder how a particular sound was made. The director certainly earned my respect for not making the movie one of successive false alarms followed by serious trouble. My hat is off to all the people who worked so hard and created a professional product. Nevertheless, I paid matinee price and felt that I did not get my money's worth.	0
3ca5e05d-58c2-44ae-907c-1326a224b256	  A simple premise wrapped in slow-burn horror, deftly sprinkled with 80s slasher flavor. Some parts could have been done better, or imbued with a bit more urgency but all in all, an effective little horror piece. I appreciated some of the camera techniques like the 360 pan, but one of the pluses of the movie was the realistic portrayal of modern teens as opposed to the cliched stereotypes. The combination of spartan camerawork and naturalistic characterization really heightens the fear factor when the entity appears in the distance.	1
30c87c29-f61b-4441-8457-43fd7fbf1aaa	  What is with all the hype? Cliche, boring, stereotype teenagers getting killed off one by one. Guess what?! They like sex. Hell, it's the driving force of the whole movie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a metaphorical story, but if the characters are all so unlikable and none of them actually learn anything, it means nothing! It has a brooding atmosphere, homages to old school horror tunes and some artsy shots. That's it, people. May as well be any other slasher, outside of that.	0
00e2fe6f-5298-4aa7-a67c-9b5e98aa157d	  This was the worst movie I have seen right next to trolls 2. My room mates and I were yelling at the screen the whole time and every single character was extremely infuriating. This movie is preaching abstinence above all else. If I wanted to listen to someone yell at me that I shouldnt have sex i would go back to highschool. It was unbelievably predictable we were literally calling out everything right before it happened. This concept had so much potential and everything about this was literal diarrhea. This is the first movie review I have ever written. I dont know who sucked who's dick to give this movie such a great rating and review. I trusted you rotten tomatoes. And you fucked me. Fucked me long and hard Rotten Tomatoes.	0
7931543a-2a31-4274-b322-8b3097448778	  Damn it I wanted to love this movie. The premise is fantastic, and the characters, cinematography and music are genuinely fantastic, but what it builds in tension and scares, it tenfold looses with idiotic scenarios, unrealistic behaviors, and a ghost/monster that may or may not be able to be killed but can certainly be injured and stopped easily enough. In fact, the ghost-thing is barely a threat at all when you consider the facts. And because of this, the film itself falls flat as a horror. It's only the character's unrealistic fear if this thing that keeps the movie going. But the audience is likely done with this nonsense half way through. Not to mentioned the horrible ending... ugh.	1
78ff8857-c725-4ace-a138-ccb7051353ce	  The premise itself is really great, but I'm extremely disappointed with the execution (If you could call it that), and the fact that the whole movie was centered around sex 90% of the time. What could've made it better is if it dug deeper into the thing itself; she could've tried to learn more about the creature (which seems like a succubus/incubus type thing) and tried to find ways to get rid of the chain entirely. But no. This movie wasted the potentially amazing plot it had in exchange for three sex scenes and a plot centered around sex. Don't waste your time or money with this steaming pile of wasted potential.	0
0954e9df-3fd8-461a-a36d-f0a9c577bc28	  Everyone praises this movie for being an old school-style horror film and to some extent it is. Admittedly, a sexually transmitted horror that ceaselessly pursues you is a unique idea. The problem is, at a certain point, the movie starts seeming unending. I do not have a problem with them not showing the "It" which follows very much. I do have a problem with the fact that it is not particularly scary even when it does.	1
d35b482e-640f-40df-94a9-e9815ba60815	  A teenage girl has sex with a boy she is seeing but finds that as soon as it's over he tells her about a being that will follow her and ultimately, kill her, if she lets it get to her. It can take any human form. This is highly original and at times, creepy, yet, as much as I wanted to really enjoy it, I just couldn't get why this film had been hyped so much. It is well acted and shot, some great camera work, a John Carpenter-like score of synth music (indie horror is being over saturated now by the use of the synth score). I enjoyed it but I wanted to love it.	1
35bea2fd-7e4e-41f0-ab2a-12babef3ba70	  It wasn't all that terrifying, but did have some good scares (a few scenes will make you jump) but overall unfulfilling. Left the theater thinking, "that was okay, but how could 96: of the critics like this movie so much???" Obviously left off allowing for a sequel, but I don't know if I'd make any time to see it. Too many things defied logic. Not the threat, that was reasonably established, but are all the people It follows THAT stupid? Left a lot of questions rather than leaving you afraid to leave the theater.	1
03810375-130d-403e-93fa-2fc6ab39e2d4	  Meh! I heard good things about this film so I gave it a go. Yes it's stylishly shot, yes its kind of a clever ode to horror films of yesteryear. But is it scary? NO. Is it creepy? Yes. There are a couple of jump scares that are effective but apart from that I was feeling bored by the end. Speaking of the end, its a let down and leaves it open for sequels.A horror film need to be horrifying. This film isn't. End of the day it can be the most stylish horror film in the known universe but if it doesn't horrify me then I dont really care.	1
f44484f1-850c-411b-bed4-5e0cc4a71f2e	  This was one of the slowest movies i have ever seen in my life. It was not at all scary and I do not understand it's high rating. The concept is just fine but it moves so, so, so, slow. I just kept waiting for something to happen and whenever "something" did happen I thought , oh good, here we go... only to return to a slow paced, boring and not at all scary waste of time.	0
5846db8b-cf6e-4969-b95b-277dabbd8d15	  "It Sucks" should have been the title as this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen - period. If you find that promiscuous teens, old naked people, and running aimlessly away for "something" terrifying then this is the movie for you as there is little else going on with this juvenile story. How this movie has such a high-rating with RT is dumbfounding and I will no longer trust their ratings. The only thing truly scary about my ordeal with this film, is that I didn't ask for a refund. Why is horror such a hard genre?	0
71f7dfc2-f059-4706-b524-a440b54eedad	  Are these reviews for real??? Was there an "alternate movie" that I could have seen that would make these reviews more reasonable? My girlfriend and I sat through this movie because of the great reviews that it received and at least 4 times during the movie looked at each other and asked when it was going to get scary. At the end of the movie, when the lights came on EVERYONE in the theater started looking at each other like we had just been punked... And that the real movie was going to start.I cannot fathom who thought this movie was scary. I would take my two sons to this movie and they are 8-10 and they would not be the least bit scared.	0
232b258c-ad6e-4ff2-9c1e-0bc9622c924d	  A nearly plotless film. A few half baked plot drivers to keep the movie going, but nothing to acutally there to maintain interest. The 'follower' is a slow and unterrifying horror 'monster' that seemingly is only half of a concept without any back story. I honestly don't know why people enjoyed the movie so much... it was slow and lacklaster. I nearly fell asleep during the first 30 minutes. I assumed they were going to tie the movie together somehow at the end, but the ending just sort of happened.... I honestly could have written this script in about 10-15 mins....and came up with way better plot drivers. Only pro's to watching this movie was the rich sounds. But that was about it for me.... I was too busy cringing the entire length of the film.	0
d56fe7a4-2085-4341-920f-b9ec2e6e5867	  151126: Really? Critics at 99%? Users at 82%? Spoke with my ten year old son after watching this film. Asked him if he ever thought he'd watch it again. His answer was the same as what I thought, "No". Though there are moments, Shaun lacks impact. Quaint story but none of the characters really grab you. Just felt flat most of the time. Glad I didn't buy the DVD.	1
6bf89c50-6ae6-46a7-b577-e27afdb989c6	  I've always been a fan of the Aardman Studio films. Chicken Run, Flushed Away, Wallace and Gromit are great flicks and now we have Shaun the Sheep. This one is certainly a little different as there isn't one spoken word in the whole movie. Now I don't have little kids so I don't know if it's a problem for them or if they would be bored with this, but this movie is still funny/clever/touching all without dialogue. I would say this isn't as strong as the movies I mentioned earlier, but I still enjoyed it. While the story is simple, there's enough going on that makes it clever and doesn't drag at all. It's not quite as funny as the previous Aardman movies, but still a very solid offering and I walked out with a smile on my face.	1
d477af52-3541-449b-b93f-7922f793e192	  Shaun the Sheep is a movie apparently trying to grab the audience's attention with their many attempts at slapstick comedy and disgusting humor. Something that Inside Out wasn't able to portray, except for its more clever attempts at slapstick humor.The movie was about how a bunch of sheep are getting chased by people which lures them to the city. They must disguise themselves and sneak away from the animal control to find their way back home safely. Now, I ain't going to spoil the ending, there is more action to brace along but I think this movie is more emotional than Inside Out in the case of making me cry. It was cute, sometimes too cute.The movie is very funny but the attempts at humor left a bitter taste in my mouth, as though it was intended for 9-year-olds. Older kids especially older teens would not get as much of a kick out of it.	1
041fccac-f152-4130-8bfa-ae77cb87a863	  As a longtime ardent fan of Nick Park and Aardman Animations since the old Wallace and Gromit days. I've always appreciated and admired the attention to detail and the painstaking process that makes it all work. I had high expectations for Shaun the Sheep, and was not at all surprised to see such rave reviews, so I bought a ticket. I was very disappointed with the film and wonder if the folks giving it such high marks have been long time fans with some reference points from which to make comparisons. The past films have always had rich story lines, characters you could really engage with, great dialogue, etc. I found Shaun of the Sheep to be pretty boring and predictable. And way too chaotic and obscure for young children. I have to give it one half a star for effort, but that's it.	0
7a33a143-a523-4fae-9432-ae79eb772495	  Cute and sweet with jokes that are ok. But I was expecting something more intensely satirical and biting. The amazing thing about the movie is the amount of work that must have gone into the animation - which is stop motion. Apparently 20 animators worked on the film producing 2 seconds of footage per day! That's nearly seven years of work to produce 85 minutes of movie! (If my calculations are correct.) So one almost feels obligated to see the movie given just the human resources that went into it. Apart from that, the whole thing is a bit wooly. And some of the music choices are jarring. But, if you find Shaun the Sheep cute you might like this one.	1
81d2c316-197b-44a8-89a2-051214169d9a	  A visually fine Ridley Scott flick that was formula and not the kind I enjoy. There just wasn't enough meat on the bone for me here. How does Matt Damon look that good when he hasn't showered. Why is Jeff Daniels here? His presence is distracting, as is the 70s disco music. The dialogue is brutal, Damon does his best. I've seen a recent movie from "space" that was much better. It was called Gravity. All that being said, The visuals make this movie worth seeing.	1
b2695a98-c024-4022-852f-03d7ab523f07	  The Day Care Generation meets Star Wars and The (Bring Him Home) Martian is the result. No conflict, no anger, no incompetence just hard working people with hidden talents and abilities doing the impossible (with the help of the Chinese) to further science. The movie is as boring as it is plausible and predictable. I suspect the screen play was written from old Friends dialogues ("Hello!) and stuff scraped off of Reddit.	0
2df066e4-3e1b-4cf8-acdb-ff83769e4704	  I watched on the plane , without the enhancement of effects provided by the big screen , it watched as a stand up comedy ( good jokes) , and at times was boring , the script was patched & lacked fluidity , the last scene was kind of stolen from Gravity ( which is a higher quality film ) . I like Matt Damon , but cannot see how this film gets 93% , my note is 60 %	1
5323d16d-f58d-47e8-9ee6-4cca174f8bf0	  Yeah, it looks fantastic and Damon is as charismatic as always but the film lacks tension or dread. I suspect this is due to the scope of the plot, which has too many characters and too little time for most of them. In short less "Apollo 13" and more "Cast Away" would have done a world of good for the movie. Despite what most the general public seems to feel, I'll probably always view this as yet another one of Scott's disappointments.	1
1394de22-ef30-4ad4-b4de-d7498a3c7a84	  OK I finally sat through this movie. One it's LONG, too long. There are major gaps of total boredom where I wanted to leave or at least catch a couple minutes of nap time. Coming around not a bad movie, but not a good one either. How the heck it won a Golden Globe for Major Movie, Musical or Comedy is beyond me. Not a Musical and Not a Comedy. Wait for it to come to your neighborhood Walmart half price bin.	1
101ebb81-6418-4081-a221-a3d6e03c3397	  If you believe in Santa Claus, this movie is for you. To anyone over 6 years-old this is an insult. Ethnic political correctness gone berserk! The female boss, with the help of the Hispanic second-in-command "saves the world" with the idea of the sloppily dressed black youth. More Deiux ex machine than Greeks, Romans, Budhists, Christians combined! I spent the entire 1-1/2 hours hoping for them all to implode and die!	0
76486c91-aafd-4691-aed4-092fb10f25f8	  The Martian clearly indicates that Ridley Scott still has the ability to capture the brilliance of space in a film. With stunning visuals this movie, clearly pleases at a very basic and fundamental level. The performance of Matt Damon is probably one of his best, following a steady buildup to the climax. However, the movie has little to offer in terms of new cinematic experiences. Overall a fun movie to watch, but can be skipped.	1
81253c6f-2f9c-40e0-b44d-fa25c17fa51e	  Two movies. One very good(the first 1.15 of the movie) one very bad. The second part of course. Part one was a captivating story of survival pure and simple. I loved the ingenuity motivated by desperation and all the tension steadily growing because of this. Nicely portrayed by Damon which is no surprise. It seemed to the second half of the movie was hijacked by Hollywood. It shifted gears from a survival flick to a kind of international UN tale of feel goodery. Way to syrupy and hackneyed to anything close to interesting. Even getting China into the mix. I'll give them credit that's a new one at least they could have made it the Russians since the seem to be the space race leaders right now. Anyway my score reflects the skitzo like persona of this movie.	1
9524bc53-a901-4306-beb5-d3b49c8d8b81	  Scienceing the shit out of this movie would have been a better choice rather than adding a half-hour of unnecessary exposition and flimsy character-building and mundane dialog, but it's still pretty good. Matt Damon has really come around to being a leading man and they could have kept most of the attention on him and it would have been better. I thought it was a pretty big plot hole to go unexplained in that Damon's guy is supposed to be a botanist and yet the Mars team brought no seeds or fertilizer or a mini-greenhouse for experiments (Why bring a botanist to Mars then?!) and he has to resort to poop and potatoes to survive. The ending too was pretty ridiculous. Just suspend disbelief and you'll be fine. I'd like to read the book as I've heard it was much richer in pertinent detail.	1
137ae320-59cf-4f04-aa6e-6a56537d55ff	  Ridley Scott is a master of his trade, but I was disappointed in The Martian: photography, lighting, special FX were all dazzling, as can be expected from Mr. Scott; but the attempts at humor were exactly that - attempts. Some of the lightheartedness shone through, but most of the jokes / humorous remarks were constrained. The plot is far-fetched, to say the least. Yes. I know. It's science fiction, but you are meant to believe the mundane stuff (like needing food, water and oxygen) but expected to believe some of the more absurd moments in the film. I was also horribly disappointed that someone (I can't believe Ridley would do this) lifted a great line right from Ron Howard's Apollo 13, when someone refers to a young astro-dynamics wunderkind as a "steely-eyed missile man". Really? Please be more original!!!	1
7b23849e-956b-444b-a17e-ee432a0d2149	  Hollywood seems to be very proud of this movie and I can see why. Great character driven story, awesome cast, and a big budget I'm sure. Nonetheless, it was predictable -- very. I liked the drama, struggle and anticipation of entire arc, but we've seen it before -- too many times. Dressing him in a different suit and putting him on another planet does little to fool us -- again, we've seen this before! Now go on and entertain us for real next time.	1
d5778b72-f835-4d2e-9d64-53d153fadf14	  Ok movie, nowhere near as good as Interstellar. I don't get the 93% rating, 60% maybe. A few major oversights with the film. NASA currently does not have a vehicle to send people into space. Why would you need the Chinese to ferry supplies to orbit, couldn't one of many private companies do the trick. Any trip to Mars will probably be a multinational effort, oh but US exceptionalism prevents any of that happening.	1
c0906022-e13f-436a-b2b7-1bc619b488ac	  This pales in comparison to Castaway. No suspense or tension. The main character was an optimistic botanist who knew how to stay alive until he was rescued so where, might I ask, was the conflict? When he was driving his space vehicle across the terrain (he seemed to have everything on hand he needed plus more) and started singing along to a disco song, I almost walked out. Note to Directors: Please stop having characters lip sinc while driving, mopping the floor, or taking a shower!!!! The rescue at the end was replete with syrupy scenes of onlookers all over the world watching it on jumbo screens while clutching their children tightly. Oh, and catching him while he was catapulted out into space was so stupid I was embarrassed for Matt Damon. I'll never see a Ridley Scott movie again!	0

ead1abb3-881d-4578-9b8d-a93b92efb8b8	  If you actually know anything at all about Mars or space travel, it's hard to get engaged with this movie, with its Martian base the size of several McMansions, and Mars-scapes dominated by obviously sedimentary geology. In other words, it's ridiculously contrived and completely lacking in tension. Also the "global" (i.e. including China) to rescue a single castaway stinks of American triumphalism. Far far below Ridley Scott's best work, such as Blade Runner.	1
72f9af03-e7a4-4a76-82fe-314e6e225e7e	  One of the blockbusters of the year, a good adventure movie but an overrated one as well (8,2 in imdb). The Martian is Ridley Scott's return after his last good movie, Prometheus (2012).Picture this one as a combination of the science of Apollo 13 (1995), combined with the survival element of Cast Away (2000) and the lost in space fun of Gravity (2013). After the recent success of Gravity (7 oscars for an all-right sci-fi adventure movie) it seems that space adventure movies can combine Academy Awards' appreciation with ticket selling.The Martian is very well made, Ridley Scott's direction is impressive at some points and Matt Damon tries his best, but the movie is obviously not thought provocative. Still it's the perfect movie to have your pop corn with.Grade: B-	1

If you didn't read the book and you like a movie without much detail, you'll probably love it.3 out of 5 starsWhat worked: They skimmed over all the detailed sciency stuff behind the antagonist's survival to keep the movie from being too long.What didn't: They skimmed over all the detailed sciency stuff behind the antagonist's survival to keep the movie from being too long.Random thought: It's a shame Irrfan Khan was unavailable to play Venkat Kapoor.	1
0cc0d279-3c3c-4d51-8714-e275f1ce327e	  The cinematography of this Sci-Fi set on Mars was always going to be good, and it is. But the rest of this film is ordinary. There was very little emotion or tension, considering the situation, not enough 'humanness' added to enable us to connect with the characters at a deeper level. And the choice many of the songs was strange and didn't work, only making some long scenes even longer. I felt like I had seen many of the elements done a lot better in other similar movies.	1
2001076b-8ba5-42d3-88ad-bc4bc3cbe433	  I read the book, no, devoured the book. The movie was a let down because it didn't present the dire necessity of rescuing him. There were a lot of flaws and Matt Damon appeared waaaay to comfortable on Mars. The screen play was somewhat flawed because it left out some key road blocks to getting to the MAV and ares landing site.. He was more than worried about food not just running out of ketchup. I did enjoy the 70s music and the cinematography.	1
a2c033f5-ef99-4323-9ad2-12b63a5c4b6a	  Despite an incredible cast, one of my favourite directors at the helm and a relatively charismatic Matt Damon, the only act that truly shines in this film is the last. With a script heavy first two acts, the dialogue needed to exceed the audiences knowledge and have us meet it halfway, instead opting for a far safer and friendlier script. A far greater film lies within a very superficial script, unfortunately tugging neither at the strings of the heart or head.	1
f8870a62-e800-4a8c-b5d2-cf83a0318136	  The movie is super predictable, but just considering it was not exactly the same as "Gravity" and "Interstellar" as it seemed it would be, that's more than enough for me. It's not exactly hilarious, but it's a good new perspective to the 'stranded theme'. It's also cool that it focuses on what the world can do when they work in the same team. I hear it's pretty scientifically accurate too, so that earns it some points. Definitely a flick for science enthusiasts like engineers.	1
28219d68-265c-4b6b-80f0-0a9c3035cfa0	  What a disappointment this movie was after the high score it achieved on rotten tomatoes. The story was implausible, the ending was ridiculous, i found it rather tedious. the casting was contrived (perfectly racially/ gender mixed crews, and launch control staff).. There are no storms on mars. the idea of flying around in space and getting saved by one arms length from drifting into space forever is absurd. Spending 1 billion dollars or more to save one man... the mutiny by the highly trained space crew.. altogether ridiculous..	0
f99d37f7-ccbd-4dfd-b7c5-b44688ab1bda	  This was a well-executed, tightly drawn and witty thriller.It had all the hallmarks of a Ridley Scott ripping yarn. It was fun, slick, spectacular and gripping.But, and I say this with great regret, it failed to deliver on any level other than a shallow ride. And yet there were so many opportunities to explore so many human frailties, strengths and emotions. but Scott seems to have bowed to Hollywood pressure to spin a shallow yarn.Others have commented on it but the deep questions this raises about purpose, about loneliness, about luck, about comradeship, about failure, about bravery, about courage, about the very purpose of space exploration. All came begging with great actors and sets and a story line that would have easily carried them, all went begging.A huge opportunity wasted.A way behind blade runner, alien, and even Gravity.Interstellar tried, wobbled, but tried ay least.	1
169692fb-c934-44ea-9577-39d49ad584d9	  The Mars travel is dry, both literally and figuratively. The support cast is the real star. There is an ok race and gender mix, with plenty of sharp wit, though the film doesn't follow through. Evidently Hollywood remains afflicted by the notion that "diverse" characters are there for contrast and light relief, and that the all-American, white boy and girl must be at centre. By the way, it is only a discredited, old, English law of empire that says you can colonize land merely by cultivating it; the imperialists applied this in order to seize vast amounts of land from native peoples, who hunted for food. Apart from the film's potted territorial ideas (p.i.), it crafts a fairly congenial hero concerned not with aggression, but with inventiveness - though he doesn't match MacGyver's quick sophistication.	1
5933c868-0bf3-4177-a6dc-92853bb351b4	  Room is an interesting film and a very innocent take on a horrendous situation. Though not told only from the perspective of the child, Jack is the center of Room. He is how we experience and learn about the world that is Room. Though I'm not gaga over the film I did enjoy what was presented and how it was presented. It is both dark and horrifying while also containing hope and humour. Considering the subject matter involved... this is a welcomed choice by all those involved.	1
8cd5e81c-25dd-44bb-a6a6-0f7dc076f7d1	  Once you get over some of the incredulous details the director seems to have glossed over (e.g. no one heard the two of them screaming at the top of their lungs from a shed in a suburban neighborhood? The kid was able to grow to be 5 without getting sick once?), you begin to see the world from the child's PoV and you begin to feel the way he does about the outside world, outside "the room". I dont see how the Oscar could be given to Brie Larson while Jacob Tremblay is passed over for best actor, and perhaps the youngest ever. The movie needs some editing from the halfway mark, but watch the movie for Jack.	1
e1bb9591-11d9-48f7-8ff6-78eaebd14030	  It's a fine film to watch when you don't expect much or aren't going to be critical about story-line details. To me it came across as a low budget, first time directors, masterpiece...with an emphasis on low budget and first time director. The acting was superb but I was just so frustrated with the far-fetched scenarios and a slow, somewhat unfinished, 2nd half. I hear the book isn't any different.	1
2a3db28d-05e0-476e-ae08-c9ca7c7411ce	  The first disconnection I felt watching this film was, the age of Jack, was he 5 ? or 7 ? I would believed him more if he was 7.Secondly if he was in that room for all his life, then the script written for him was more for a senior kindergarden.I can't help looking back to Danny Lloyd ( The Shining ) who was very natural which I think how a 5 year old child should be.Good script and performance, I like the story.. but since I felt those disconnection early, it was like watching a movie that was supposed to be set in Toronto, but someone messed up and showed the Empire state building in the background.	1
18082903-0829-4719-9de4-ccf29afebbaf	  This movie was definitely something you don't see every day. For some of you, this movie would be quite boring. For me, it actually seemed to end before I knew it. It kept my interest the whole time. Now there were some details in this movie that were left open or unknown, and I would have liked those to be known. Overall, I guess I can kind of see why this movie would be up for some awards, but this was not one of the best movies this year in my opinion.	1
0010044b-3cf9-49f4-a982-7c11966de08c	  This original story, told from the seemingly narrow, but truthfully abundant and vibrant world of a captive 5 year old, is so intricately woven together with love, and consciousness and motherly protection it is alarming to see the 2nd half of the movie unravel as much as the characters do, during what seems would have been the joyful release of freedom and magical awareness, we struggle to find as much connection and interest as was revealed initially from "room". It's not so much a disappointment as a draining and sad realization of expectations not living up to reality.	1
9ed3b151-c649-4add-8a96-8dd267c5b56f	  Room is fine movie for reasons that have been adequately discussed. What's disappointing about it, however, is that I don't think it succeeds in suggesting a broader meaning to the highly unusual story it recounts, which seems to be drawn from real life. It's not enough to make us feel sorry for the victims of bizarrely horrible circumstances: a narrative has to make us feel that these experiences relate to us as well. Also, I don't see the point of keeping us in the dark for so long about why the mother and child are in the room. There are times when mystery is pointless.	1
98d4081d-d3e3-41aa-8ca2-49f1cb802b61	  "Room" | C+ | During the first half, Larson and Tremblay's smoldering chemistry is beyond Oscar-worthy. The atmosphere is breathtaking and the suspense is brilliant. Things slow the moment the kidnapping sex offender appears on screen. Then, sadly, the film's momentum comes to a screeching halt at the moment the villain reaches a stop sign (unfortunate irony!) and what should've been the most dramatic cinematic moment of the year, fizzles out. The movie falls off a cliff. The second half is chemistry-free with poorly written, cartoon character subplots unworthy of a bad Lifetime TV movie. I pray Larson & Tremblay receive the nominations they deserve, but the writer and director need a remedial course in "Choices Filmmakers Should Avoid At All Costs!"	1
b5f068bb-250a-463f-a841-3951e6dd4c23	  I liked the first movie and after I saw all the reviews going on about how this was the best one yet I had to watch. That's an hour of my life I won't get back. I couldn't finish the second hour. No plot. Ving Rhames looked like he wanted to be anywhere but in that film...Terrible all the way around. I get better, more developed drama and spycraft on The Blacklist each week. Don't waste your money.	0
b5950625-376f-4517-87cb-2e9aeddd03e5	  I am oh-so-confused why anyone rated this above 6/10.I must admit, I hate Tom Cruise. I hate every movie with him requiring an annoying set of camera angles to hide his height.I hate the obligatory running scene, set against something really huge so you cant tell how tall he is.I hate the 1990's He gets punched full force 5 times in the ribs tied to a pole with no way to dampen the kinetic energy and isn't damaged at all.Nothing about him makes me think, Yeah hes a super spy. He seems to play a highly simple unintelligent character yet according to the plot the character is a genius. Give me Jason Bourne any day over this crap.Maybe this one was meant for the kids.	0
06d0766f-ebe9-4105-bf51-1433849ada0c	  Honestly, this was kind of a disappointment. I'm not saying it wasn't entertaining, but there were just so many flaws with this film. I know that people don't watch these movies for the plot and story, (even with a generic and simple script, this movie still had too many plot holes) but even the action was a bit mediocre. Ghost protocol was better. Overall, a pretty forgettable film.	1
91dd08ef-4bde-4d2d-a713-78037903eb1b	  Poor substitute to a Bond film. Its movie making by numbers - a not so remarkable initial action sequence, the world in danger vide an evil organisation, a villain with a hoarse throat who leaves no impression, ordinary plot, unused supporting cast, Alec Baldwin and Jeremy Renner utterly wasted. Tom Cruise now shows his age and its no fun to see him running, running and more running all throughout the movie. Surely there wont be an MI6. Come on people!	1
270a16c4-ba2a-486c-bc2f-3adb14e6087d	  I dunno, I guess I'm just real tired of seeing Tom Cruise single-handedly save the world. He's always seemed like a bit of a lightweight to me, not really a powerful action hero. And the casting in this one is more tongue-in-cheek than serious. Ving Rhames? Jeremy Renner? Alec Baldwin? I mean, Benji is cute and likable, but for an "Impossible Mission Force" it seems like they've got some seriously lightweight, B-movie characters. Anyway, it's yet another absolutely impossible situation that somehow a perfect-in-every-way character manages to resolve. Good for a watch I suppose, but about halfway into it I found myself thinking "Geez, isn't this over yet?".	1
0cc28dd2-fe3b-4f67-86c9-40f56dca780c	  Being inventive and surprising is hard to do in a movie these days, especially in a franchise on this fifth film, but rouge nation went in an unexpected direction more then once. Some good action set pieces that good but not amazing. This movie is kid of forgettable, and I can't put my finger on why that is. I was entertained the whole running time but haven't though about it sense.	1
6b669d6c-ce47-431c-add9-667973147320	  As a kid who was heavily into spy movies, I really enjoyed the original Mission: Impossible film and have been happy to see the sequels churning out with pretty good success. The action scenes scattered throughout this film are amazing to watch and are very well shot. The plot here is pretty mediocre and many of the Simon Pegg comedy moments felt forced and were not overly funny. Overall, a decent addition to the M:I film series.	1
74d0b4fa-3f30-4f9d-87cd-12576fc51c69	  Simon Pegg's Benji is by far the best part of this movie. While Tom Cruise's age defying performance as Ethan is remarkable, he gets left behind by Pegg and even Ferguson. Ultimately, though, it's enjoyable and well assembled movie with real stunts...but ultimately it's pretty forgettable, particularly in the last act. 2 days after watching the film I could t remember if the villain died or not.	1
a44a7ff0-b2c3-4a93-bcb8-61607f136710	  The only thing at stake in this movie is Tom Cruise's slowly diminishing box office prowess. The movie is a rehashed series of stunts and scenes that take you from point to point without ever driving you out of the parking lot. The movie shines brightest when it creates intriguing plot points but inevitably fails to deliver on any of them in a big way. Like most of the Mission Impossible stories, it starts out with larger ambitions and becomes increasingly isolated as we simply focus on Tom Cruise chasing someone.	1
99181895-5fa0-447c-9b6b-5aab1312beee	  I really don't understand how Tom Cruise is still acting. His performance in this is lazy and wooden. A facial expression or two wouldn't go astray. He was really shown up by the cast around him, who all put in a much better performance. I thought this film lost a real opportunity by not using Jeremy Renner in more of an action role - but perhaps Cruise didn't want to be shown up. The story line was what you would expect from this kind of film and was bearable.	0
e8d02b4b-da53-4cab-a31f-511fce3cbe46	  This has to be the most overrated film I've ever seen. 92%? That's just crazy. It's 90 minutes of exposition with almost as much live opera as action, no I'm not kidding. Truly and literally this film ends with a whimper. In the end it runs with watered down trending tropes from other highly successful franchises, particularly the various Sherlock Holmes movies (Moriarty anyone?). But it does way too much explaining and not nearly enough doing. At the bottom, the characters are motiveless. Only Simon Pegg shows up as a person who might be an actual human with an actual life.	1
1d9090b0-d4c8-4cf4-b0fc-d9bad42295b6	  What the fuck is the IMF? International Monetary Fund? This MI was as stereo-typical as you could get. Some arbitrary bad guy comes out of nowhere, kills some chick we don't even know, and sets the plot in motion for world destruction. The big elephant in the room being, why is tom cruise doing anything in this movie other than to make a big splash? Ridiculous? Yes. Nonsensical? Yes. The dude falls off his motorcycle at 100+ km/h because he got a 'glance' from the main girl. The only redeeming quality about this movie was the solid female lead. She definitely kept up with Tom. The only conspiracy out there are these internet ratings that are probably made by hired agencies to boost mediocre to average movies.	1
4d375aec-97f0-4919-962b-0442d266051e	  At times this movie felt like a cheesy bond ripoff, but at other times it had me at the edge of my seat. Its great to see an action thriller that doesn't cop out, and rely on 3-D technology to captivate the audience. If you're a fan of the franchise chances are you'll enjoy this film. However, if this is your first experience of the "Mission: Impossible" universe chances are you too will have a good time. This is a film you should see on the big screen, so go out and see it while its still playing.	1
3087a208-984a-4f7a-9e61-74d3d2197975	  Largely predictable, and very much like previous films in the franchise. Some elements creeping in from "Spooks" and some locations too. A few good set piece action sequences, but not that many. Relatively few things exploding this time. Simon Pegg has a large role and does what he always does. Rebecca Ferguson is a new face (to me) and does very well, particularly in the action sequences. Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise - how much longer can he play the action hero roles? Jeremy Renner is not stretched by his role and Alec Baldwin does what you expect him to do. Solid, but uninspiring.	1
3ee59550-07b5-4010-a018-896e943691a7	  I'm surprised to see it has done so well in reviews. I thought it was significantly dummed-down compared to previous films in the series or any of the modern bond films. I know its a 12A, but it just seemed to one set piece after another with scenes in between in which the characters would sit around laptops and bluntly sum up the plot so far for. The teenagers I was sat near seemed entertained, maybe I'm just becoming jaded and hard to please...	1
28426a13-e105-43ce-a41f-cb349beef9d1	  The movie was mostly entertaining but 93%? Really? It did not break any new ground, not that there really is anything new to be done in this genre. I found it surprisingly slow in parts and felt myself falling asleep a couple of times. Even the motorcycle chase scene seemed weirdly obvious that it would be coming before it happened. Like someone said "hey we could use a chase scene to liven things up here."	1
b86f5184-4acd-4877-aff3-296339130e7c	  Michael Bond's beloved children's character is brought to the big screen in the live-action film Paddington. When his home in Peru is destroyed a young bear cub is sent to London to find a new home, and is taken in by a human family. Unfortunately the writing is rather poor, and relies mostly on stereotypes and clich�s. And the comedy is pretty rote; using a lot of standard jokes and slapstick gags. However, Paddington isn't bad really; it just uninspired and settles for being a formulaic family comedy.	1
bd855afc-94b4-4e60-9e10-6a47cb744d16	  Why was there a villain in my Paddington movie? All the stuff with the family and the search for the explorer was so strong, but the villainous taxidermist stuff just sucked me right out of it. This film have been so much stronger without it. The Browns had a wonderful family dynamic, the interactions between them and Paddington was on par with the book and the cartoon series. But the villain subplot just felt forced and contrived and ruined my enjoyment of the final third of the movie. Hell I groaned the moment she appeared. And its a real shame because there is a good, intelligent movie in here, it just got a little spoiled with an unnecessary plot element.	1

With all of the great reviews of Paddington I really wanted to see it and since no one would go with me I went and I'm glad I did. This is a really sweet movie that actually has some really good laughs. I really enjoyed the family interaction and some of the little quips that I found myself to be the only one in the theater laughing at the time. My main problem with the movie is what is revealed in the trailers. I mean nothing like spoiling some of the fun scenes eh? I think this kids movie is for more then kids but for those of us who grew up with mom's that read us Paddington at night as well.	1
898446ea-059d-4c2a-acd7-2b5240cc3d66	  I was very disappointed with this. It started out great, telling why Paddington left Darkest Peru, and how he met the Browns, then the mishap with the bathtub, but then of course they have to have violence, and a taxidermist starts trying to kidnap Paddington, and murder him, there were children on either side of me, and behind me crying because they were afraid, and thought that Paddington was dead, so no I will not see this movie again, which is said because I am a huge Paddington fan , and read his stories everyday to a preschool naproom.	0
33df025b-9a53-40e0-adb7-10a3f202ddec	  Paddington is a hugely cherised character, so making a live-action film of the most adorable bear in the world has been quite a risk. Forunately director Paul King has clearly an immense amount of reverence for the furball, and in terms of the character itself the film succeeds admirably. The animation is lively and beautiful, and Ben Whishaw's vocal performance is wonderful. But everything else around the character is amiss, like Sally Hawkins' annoying performance, Nicole Kidman's cartoonish villain, Jim Broadbent's awfully goofy accent, and the excessive mawkishness. There are only a couple truly funny jokes, but mostly the humor is uninspired and the old lessons about taking care of outcasts and learning to accept different people as who they are all too familiar. Paddington is one of those family comedies that will certainly appeal to children, but grown-up audiences will find disappointment. Nostalgia won't help either.	0
aaca1693-c8a0-43d5-8fba-e2b5e33afc0d	  Could have been so much better but the writers and producerz got lazy. Much of the plot is a pale copy of 101 dalmations, with the house setting derived from peter pan. Great performances from Hugh Bonneville, his screen wife and the two kids are undermined by shallow efforts from julie Walters and Nicole Kidman. Some very good moments, although if you have seen the trailer you've seen most of them but some leaden bits as well.	1
8a5e602b-a416-41c8-b7a6-ad8c630948ad	  Film plays like a piece of ISIS propaganda. It attempts to show on one side their harsh law while at the same time trying to show justification for their actions whilst giving them a conscience, rather than show them to be the inhumane monsters that most of even the Islamic world knows them to be. One of the other problems with this is the lack of a moral center of the main characters who are supposed to be in opposition to ISIS. The main character thinks it's perfectly reasonable to kill a man as revenge for killing his cow without even a second thought and receives no objection from his wife who then commits suicide against ISIS in revenge, leaving their daughter an orphan. If you like films with morally degenerate, unlikable characters then this is the film for you.	0

A cattle herder lives outside Timbuktu's strict rules. Where no man can play music, play soccer or have a cigarette without breaking the laws. The herder is living a primitive, but nice life with his wife and daughter. That is until a tragic event happens.This film is slow and I miss happenings that effect me.

c6e4d3b9-cde3-45fd-a8f7-b07b55255248	  Wow, one of the most over-rated films I've ever watched. I expect foreign films such as this to be inflated by all the snooty critics, but this film had virtually no story, no point, and the bulk of the acting was just bad. All the long shots of nothingness and the flips to scenes unrelated to the 'plot' smelled of self-indulgence. I'm all for subtlety, but this was ridiculous. Some cool music and beauty shots, though.	0
405dc5ef-622d-4127-9998-fa7092a6751f	  Timbuktu way be well filmed, well made and it is important and very relevant, but it fails to bring the power and importance from the script to life with uninspired direction, very poor characters and above all slow and boring approach. It is naturally important and politics fans will most definitely find it appealing, but for others, this is a weak, so-so movie that did not deserve any of its nominations for sure and it is the weakest nominee for Best Foreign Film without a doubt.	1
180c00ac-46bc-4137-8b4f-dc0fab0a920a	  This is a beautiful film, well shot and terribly moving. Focussing on the story of peaceful shepperd Kidane and his family, the film also portrays the new emerging fundamentalist laws and restrictions imposed on the local population in the villages. No music, no cigarettes, no soccer and women have to wera gloves. In this uncertain climate, the world and time seem to have stopped and only cars, cell phones and Kalashnikov reminds us that the story takes place today. In this meditative landscape, filled with a rare beauty, we will be the witnesses of the tragedy of the human condition who seems to be precarious and fragile fromevery perspective. This is a film where men look small and somehow powerless over the poised beauty and harshness of their environment. Definitely a good film, a beautiful tale from one of the master of world cinema.	1
e9893a4a-6a0e-4dae-a715-1159bc8e00b6	  A raw and gritty documentary, Amy looks at the turbulent life of singer/song writer Amy Winehouse. Through the use of homemade videos and other various footage from concerts and interviews, the film provides a personal and intimate portrayal of Winehouse. And interspersed throughout the footage, her family and friends discuss her rise to fame and the troubles that she faced coping with the lifestyle that came with it. Yet sadly this is a very familiar tale, and frankly, the incoherent mumblings of Winehouse's music (which require subtitles in the film) aren't that compelling. While it has an interesting style to it, Amy is just the same old story of fame going awry.	1
82531c81-1fde-4bd0-b313-73f4dd7fd00c	  I adore Amy Winehouse and this documentary felt like a necessary retelling, especially in comparison to the unfair brutality of the press during her actual lifetime. I wish it had been more insightful though, it felt very two-dimensional in comparison to the larger than life force that was Amy Winehouse, whether or not she felt that way about herself. It's also a bit too soft in its depiction of the poisonous people in her life that lead her to and allowed her to use the drugs and alcohol which eventually killed her. Certainly she has to take some blame for her self-destructive behavior, but it does seem like a shame to have the same people who controlled her in life- which eventually lead her to die at such a young age- still have control of her retelling after death.	1

977e7b71-fddf-4812-bd6f-651fba5a1291	  Interesting look at her world through mainly personal video footage but is ultimately not a good movie as it makes her the victim when in actuality she was a young talented person whose own addictive personality and Daddy issues ruined her life. A lot of this is not a pleasant watch due to the voyeurism of the whole thing but it's still interesting, more for the music and watching her slowly change more than anything else.	1
79623f97-fe29-4faa-a823-d98a64f7ffa1	  These reviews are biased because most viewers would not go to see the film unless they are already fans of Amy Winehouse music. The 90% rating should therefore be taken with a large grain of salt. I saw the film, and am not a real Amy Winehouse fan. To me, the film was overly prying, very hard to understand (the speaking) and not very informative. it was more of an exploitation film of her tragic life. Some good moments of her performing, but more strange moments that the public wasn't meant to see. I wasn't really impressed by it.	0
df40b135-cfb9-42a8-add8-65ea0f9e2623	  Without Jesus Christ, we all are lost. Amy like many celebrities that died before and many that will die in the years to come, are fixated on getting a bigger and bigger high becoming completely absorbed in self. Jesus gives us the answer and it is not in self but it is in loving him. As he sacrificed himself for us we know that he loves us and nothing is greater. He wants us to love Him and TRULY love one another. Stop looking in a mirror but step out in service. The movie gives her story in history but does not provide the answer. A tale we hear about everyday.	1

d930def6-a66e-46fb-82c0-12db06ff8ad3	  How interested you are in the subject will determine how long you feel this movie is. I felt like it was a bit too long, at a hefty 127 minutes. We get some serious non-biased insight on the singer, with some and emotional moments. There is also some nice musical parts, and ultimately it boils down to a tragedy. With an enabler husband, opportunistic father, Amy Winehouse couldn't cope with the pressures of stardom and it cost her her life. It shows the nasty facets of the music industry, but also the quiet reflective beautiful person underneath all the scandal and mockery. Amy is a solid documentary, if a bit long.	1
bbf52405-ed6d-4f35-b640-ab450e8e84a9	  I had two big problems with this movie. First it almost completely skips over her childhood which is really where her problems stem from. Second her dad which IMO is the root of most if not all of her issues basically gets a free pass through out the movie. He's never called out on all the screwed up things he has and is doing to his daughter. Also at almost 2 1/2 hours long it is a little drawn out.	0
0be3d3da-5712-4f89-8294-8d3587cf20bc	  Didn't really have much insight on Amy Winehouse except to point out that she really really loved drugs. She was talented and there is enough of her music that you can appreciate that but either you don't really get a good understanding of someone who sang the lyrics so famously "They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, 'No, no, no.'" or, perhaps, there just wasn't much more to her.	1
02c29798-05b3-4aba-bf7b-dff0ede06368	  As fascinating and worthy as its subject is, the film about her rise and fall is ultimately only partially successful. It wonderfully captures the special talent and enduring work it generated from first to last frame. Alas, it provides little clear insight into the destructive demons that cut it short, seeming to lay blame on a network of people and culture of fame functioning like a whirlpool from which Winehouse had no escape. As an autopsy of addiction, the film fails; as a videologue of an iconic voice, it flies.	1
047d5b30-aec6-4bdf-9294-9b3b9c3b01c3	  Unsure of why this film has been rated so highly. It's ability to finally conclude the Rocky franchise in a respectful, dignified manor is about all I enjoy it for. The boxing scenes are like any other film's, they're nothing special (Southpaw is much better). The acting, solid, but nothing special. The film work - like a less egocentric version of what Rocky always has and will be. Watch if you like Rocky and/or boxing (I like boxing) and do not watch otherwise.	1
8f4c05b2-af50-4c2a-b7c2-198399018089	  Creed has all the ingredients you'd expect from a Rocky film with a few twists and turns along the way. Strong, consistent performances are delivered cast wide. Sylvester Stallone brings the pathos, Tessa Thompson gives us a developed, three dimensional, love interest (for Johnson) whilst the highly effective Anthony Bellew proves more than just a dynamic match for Michael B.Jordan's sulky Adonis Johnson. It's unlikely to be the last in the saga but the platform is rebuilt with solid foundations for future offerings.	1
be3c0921-91df-4b6b-92a9-a2c4afd09a5a	  This is good fun and a worthy entry into the up and down back catalogue of Rocky films. Tonally it does find itself a little stranded, not quite brave enough to tell an honest urban tale of Creed's story and not quite cheesey enough to go full Rocky. It still is fun though, if a tad simplistic and the fight scenes are great...who has a title fight at Goodison Park though?!? What a dump!	1
b85befdb-0581-4690-8d4d-d89c810c27e8	  Ding, ding... seconds out, more of the same please. So carrying on and passing the torch to Apollo Creed's son. We find Rocky taking over the Mickey role and training Creed's son Adonis. Cue montage of training, chasing chickens etc. Okay you get the idea, enjoyable but nothing new. Does this mean we will be getting more from this franchise?.. probably. If you like the Rocky movies go see, for the rest of you might just want to go do something else instead. Watching paint dry, anyone?	1
8443ed0d-cbb7-4cc4-afd4-902588d9af90	  I enjoyed the movie. The music was very emotional. The credibility of the movie took a dive during the "Liverpool scenes". At some point the boxers exit their dressing rooms to enter the ring. In the scene the camera shows an EXIT sign overhead. There are no such signs in England. So then, I started wondering where the the "Liverpool scenes were filmed. I asked myself, is it possible the producers were too cheap to fly to Liverpool? Well, it turns out, they were too cheap to film anything in England. I surmised, from the ending credits that the "Liverpool" scenes were done in Georgia. This production gaffe, really let me down. It was so distracting.	0
d22499da-ffa5-4cc8-b090-d4dc6dec454f	  Despite underappreciated performances by Michael B. Jordan and Phylicia Rashad and fine fight scene cinematography, these elements aren't enough to save this overlong, excessively padded exercise in trite predictability. The film offers precious little fresh material to this long-running franchise, ultimately falling back on the familiar to carry the picture. Its badly written script and dreadful performance by Tessa Thompson as the protagonist's love interest weigh the movie down even further. And, even though this offering incorporates some of the best work Sylvester Stallone has done in years, his portrayal is basically more of the same and falls far short of the numerous accolades being undeservedly heaped on it. Die-hard fans of the series will undoubtedly enjoy this release, but casual viewers who've seen other installments in the "Rocky" mythology are likely to come away unimpressed.	1
e09db04e-9633-4d2b-8fdf-fb8fa9141626	  Take Stallone out of this movie, change the titul to JOHNSON and this movie would not get half of the rating it has now. Every performance, except Stallone's, is just OK. The reasons of main character actions are the same old story of wanting to prove himself, but it is done with no emotional depth to the character. The romance between Adonis and Bianca seems forced. In the end it's just a mediocre sports movie with mostly boring characters, except Rocky, and the ending is taken straight from ''Rocky''. In fact , the whole movie is basically remake of ''Rocky''. Verdict: One of the most overrated movie of 2015.	0
e50fea82-e15e-408f-8102-efcd808c3c6a	  Creed only really gets interesting when Rocky Balboa enters the movie. I didn't care as much about Adonis and his story - I just wanted to know more about what was going on in Rocky's life. The fight sequences are well done, though, and there is some real emotion in this film. I think of this movie as more of a footnote in the Rocky story than as an official part of the Rocky series.	1
fff56aeb-0b66-43a1-98c2-ca82ad59bc88	  I was disappointed in short. Every time the movie started to pick up steam it would quickly cut back to something boring. The Creed kid's love interest for instance grinds the movie to a halt every time she hits the screen, and it was a lot. Now I like Rocky and Sly just as much as anybody and indeed he's pretty good and has a fight of his own to make, so all is not lost in his scenes, but sheesh, the rest beyond the training and boxing was pretty somnolent. Not to say that others aren't going to like it, I just thought it wasted a lot of time on mundane BS.	1
c2c96030-7ff7-4323-bf0b-daa0a5ebf5df	  Michael B. Jordan shines once again, proving he is the future - the present? - of Hollywood actors. Stallone and Tessa Thompson were comparably convincing. That said, a great cast and a 2Pac song does not a great movie make. Not even a great Rocky movie. The movie lacks a strong presence of the emotional journey of "I got something to prove" or "I have a threat to something very dear to me" that the best and worst Rocky movies featured, is somewhat overlong, has too many modernizations for hardcore Rocky fans (in theory), and ultimately reminds us that writers Ryan Coogler and Aaron Covington are probably best suited doing romantic comedies. Still, not a waste, and if you're going to resurrect Rocky, this is probably one of the better ways of doing it.	1
6ac79335-adc6-4b75-aa12-32112b692372	  This is a remake of the original Rocky with a few plot twists. All of the Rocky franchise obligatory scenes are present...unknown gets a shot at the title, training with an old pro (Rocky in this case), neighborhood kids rally behind the boxer, press conference, etc. The romance drags a bit, but otherwise it kept moving. This wasn't on the top of my list, but it is what it is...	0
42c58eed-544b-4e8b-9f1f-32bc39acb9c1	  How does Creed rate 93%? Same old tired formula audacious enough to toss in the Rocky theme music during the predictable rising up from the ashes training regimen. As for character development, okay at best. (BTW, surely there's got to be a more muscular Brit amongst the 50 million or so options to play "Pretty Rickey Conlan". Who could keep a straight face when Pretty Rickey slipped out of his robe for the long awaited rumble?)	0
76ea07da-13f8-480a-87b8-7124f9afa4ea	  With it getting a 93% rotten tomato score, I was sure this was going to be a great move. Alas. Of the 130 minutes of the movie, about 15 of them are riveting. The last 10 minutes are fantastic. You can feel every punch landed. There is emotion and grit. But the other 115 minutes or so are just slow. There are no really strong performances. The relationships are not engaging. Overall, I was disappointed, though I did walk out on a high note due to the ending being strong.	1
210015b3-b57f-4fc2-b314-060075832040	  Creed definitely earns its spots in the Rocky universe, but I feel all the raving reviews are a little crazy. MBJ is a fine actor and is great in all the non boxing scenes, but he just doesn't have the presence as a boxer. There's nothing unique about his fighting style whereas all the boxers in the Rocky movies did, even Tommy Gunn. The writers focused a lot more on his backstory and relationships with Rocky and the girlfriend rather than his boxing. A better balance would have definitely made me rate this higher. No complaints anywhere else. Sly is still awesome.	1
4a5fb37f-f0f8-40b3-91da-e489e01fc7f1	  Creed has a good story, but way too similar to the original Rocky! Creed's illegitmate son must fight personal demons and needs the help of Rocky to fight in an once in a lifetime fight. A boxer working through tough odds, as Creed gets the shot at the title just like the Original Rocky. Creed even has the love interest sub story. The story goes full circle with Rocky as Micky and Creed becomes Rocky. The story is about people and personalities. Rocky comes to grips with loss and aging. Directed well with good boxing choreography. I give Creed 2 stars.	0
63a6c623-71d3-4bf7-b0c4-89dda3926ff7	  "Creed" (aka Rocky 7) is heartfelt and features good performances from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone, but the story is too implausible. (How can a man with no professional training become a title contender in months? How can a post-op cancer patient undergoing chemo travel oversees to coach a prize fight? How come Creed's climactic opponent seems to have over thirty pounds on him?) Also, the subplot with the girl is perfunctory.	1
209bffc1-b0a0-44dd-9d7f-8ba656b9cccf	  This is the 2nd WORST Rocky movie only better than 5. There's a cultural shift in Hollywood and America in general that now loves anything black even if it's not good. This shift happened once Obama came into office. This movie is just okay. It's not anywhere near as good as 1-4 nor does it stand against Rocky Balboa. Don't be fooled by the white guilt everything black is cool movement.	1
33b930c2-5c4f-4ebb-8b5b-0b24c2a608ea	  I suspected CREED was not as great as critics and audiences were saying, but I wasn't incredibly disappointed. For one thing, Stallone continues to be a great Rocky Balboa. The story is good but dragged out and other characters are not fleshed out quite enough to sustain the length of the film. Also several scenes which should have an enormous emotional impact fall flat. At any rate, I'm glad I saw it.	1
b492b2e2-2112-48a8-8bf9-2ea48c1f150e	  i think i expected to much after seeing fruitvale...heavy symbolism works well in a story like that, but it comes off as catering to people like they don;t get it in a story like this...kind of alienates people who actually do train hard to get where they are, this guy goes from almost no training to beating the #1 pound for pound, and his motivation is just not real..."i'm not a mistake"....he comes from a multi-million dollar home with a multi-million dollar job....just doesn't have a reason to be that angry...wasn't that entertaining	1
4e54f467-51aa-4e06-918c-7ad3140a75c5	  A pretty formulaic boxing movie with a punchy soundtrack that spins off from the Rocky series. Most of it is predictable - but not entirely. One particular moment in the story was unexpected - but I can't tell you which one without spoiling the plot. The problem with boxing movies is that they seem to rely quite heavily on the boxers training - and there's only so much of the training you can watch without getting bored. While CREED might be an adequate movie, it doesn't reach the creativity of the recent Southpaw starring Jake Gyllenhaal. Sylvester Stallone is pretty good and exceeded my expectations. If you really like watching realistic boxing, then maybe give it a go. As a continuation of the Rocky franchise, it's ok.	1
8478e214-1011-4169-bd6d-58449836feac	  Most of the reason I went to this movie is because it has received a whole lot of hype. As far as what I thought of this movie, I can tell you that the story was kind of interesting, but there were some scenes here and there that I felt were not necessary. For example, they tried to through a little romance in the movie for Michael B. Jordan's character, and I felt that the movie could have been just as good or better without that. As far as the fighting scenes go, they were very good, and I went sort of on the edge of my seat at the end. As far as comparing this movie with Southpaw, I can say that they are close to the same on my list, but I still think that Southpaw was a little bit better. Anyway, I would recommend this to any movie person.	1
6243080b-db60-4a5e-9ac6-b4fd865001bc	  Too predictable. The movie bases itself off old nostalgia from the old Rocky movies and cannot stand on its own. The story is the same story from the old Rocky movies. Constant repetition "You are Apollo Creed's son" over and over and over again, we get it. You are Apollo Creed's son, how many times can you hear the same thing over again? I fell asleep. Too boring and predictable.	0
7b9c0ea4-12d8-4944-bdb3-b83c19d203fd	  Despite universally great reviews, this movie was only so-so.Stallone was fine but Michael Jordan, though handsome, was not believable in his role. The film is overly long and could have been helped by editing out some subplots which did nothing to advance the story.Watchable... but disappointing given all that I had read before seeing it. This installment of the Rocky series pales when judged in relation to the original, emotionally captivating chapter. Even the soundtrack seemed less than uplifting.	1
72132f06-f260-4f16-a4f2-80438f5307c1	  Nothing like the original Rocky's. Slow start. The movie dragged on and on. Some of the training scenes were really cheesy. When Adonis is running through the streets of Philly, gangsters on dirt bikes and four wheelers are riding next to him doing wheelies. They tried to copy the DMX video. Adonis randomly switches training gyms. He only has one fight prior to the final. The finally fight scene is awful. The champion looks out of shape and noting like a champion boxer. Not worth seeing in theater.	0
52f7817e-2b9f-473b-8ed4-ade5f495fe0e	  Certainly the best "Rocky" film we've seen since episode III. Lower-key, with better acting and cinematography. The fight scenes are still a bit over-the-top, but the way they are shot is refreshing and gives Creed its own vibe versus its predecessors. Michael B Jordan is well-suited to the role of a man trying to come to terms with his famous namesake. Tessa Thompson is mesmerizing but underused in the second half. It still has a bit of that Rocky rah-rah element and perhaps would have been better with a little less Stallone, but overall the movie works because it pays homage to the earlier films (especially III and IV) while forging its own path. The writing is on the wall for sequels. Rocky fans will appreciate this outing.	1
7ec97969-001a-4d9f-921e-a64065fec7fa	  As proof that the maxim "don't mention the war" has well and truly ceased to apply, the krauts have ripped off Vertigo and still managed to make it about the holocaust. Reasonably well put together (especially when it comes to the central performance by Nina Hoss) but it's too slick for the subject matter, and at barely 90 minutes, you'll still figure out exactly where it's going too soon into the piece.	1
53cfde5f-6486-4fb1-8a0b-8fbc84506b83	  A reworking of "Vertigo" set in the rubble post-World War II, when Europe and its various countries weren't too sure of their identities any more. Nelly has survived the concentration camps, but needed some plastic surgery; when she returns to the husband who divorced and betrayed her, he thinks she's a stranger he can use to get at her inheritance. Nina Hoss is resourceful enough as an actress that you go with her in the charade, wondering how far she'll take the role playing "herself," but a nagging sense of impatience is hard to dismiss at times, and though the socko climax--set to Weill's song "Speak Low"--has a punch, after that the movie more or less shrugs. It's been made with talent and craft, but it holds its cards a little too closely to the vest.	1
ae1e57c5-24f0-4387-94e2-74ee4eefa9ff	  Director Christian Petzold and actress Nina Hoss have now brought us a string of accomplished films exploring Germany's past and present, culminating with the extraordinary BARBARA. What a disappoint it is to report on PHOENIX. A metaphorical conception of a concentration camp survivor given a new face (literally) only to come back to Berlin to follow her husband, the man that betrayed her. PHOENIX is worthy of Sirk or Fassbinder. Petzold's direction is without merit and he gives one of our best actresses nothing to do. A total misfire that I found downright dull.	1
ea82b836-bd6d-4b17-936f-237aa687d371	  Was it great? No. Was it good? Yeah, man it was good. It was like watching an episode of Big Brother with vampires, So I simultaneously wanted to laugh my ass off and shoot myself. MAYBE if they hadn't been roommates it would have felt more like a mockumentary than b-roll from a discarded reality show. The movie itself is funny, charming, witty, & smart so it has three things going for it my last girlfriend didn't and serial killers can be charming so kudos to that bitch. Back to my point then, good movie, not great, but definitely good!	1
76d7241e-81ef-4ff0-9a45-6be4b4c13584	  "Remember guys, we're werewolves, not swear wolves!". This wasn't quite as funny as I was expecting but it did have some great one liners in it! Brilliant set up for a movie as a documentary crew follow a flatshare of vampires through such testing times as enforcing a dish washing rota and not staining the sofa while drinking human blood. The stand off with the werewolves was one of the highlights. I felt it lost something midway through but still worth sticking around until the end.	1
af4c7b25-4f8f-470c-93da-84baf904609b	  Led to believe that this would be funny. Silly, it not witty or truly comic. Instead it's just -- SAD. I felt sorry for the poor guys and everyone they knew. Trapped in tedium, no hope, no goals, no pride or enjoyment in who they are and what they can do, living in a dismal house (when they could easily do better), sniping and bitching amongst themselves about the same trivia we capitalist wage slaves do. I think that was supposed to be the "joke." Well, it's not even a one-joke film. I'm sorry I saw it.	0
bb201ce9-769d-4fbe-a1ec-490c6a6f06f3	  What We Do in the Shadows is a silly and zany vampire mockumentary from the people who brought you Flight of the Conchords. There's not much of a plot to speak of, but watching them bicker over flat chores or trying to show on camera is funny enough, and there are some great visual effects with the flying aspect. The only aspect I didn't like was the zombies, as they would not fit in with society so that makes no sense.	1
066f2930-d98f-447a-a5c5-b0c389e84b6c	  If you thought vampire movies had reached saturation point, think again, because What We Do In The Shadows manages to lend it a thankfully comical bent. Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement lead a solid cast of Kiwi actors playing a small group of inept but lovable bloodsuckers living in a flat together in Wellington--The comedy horror is so hard to get right. Then using the Vampire genre and the equally overused mockumentary style you are pushing a boulder up hill. So the mere fact that this film feels fresh and leaves me wanting more is more than a poke, yes there is more than a poke, in the right direction... Sometimes the scariest thing about being a vampire is doing the dishes!!	1
774963bc-aeed-4ddb-b322-59d2fe2b5b22	  A documentary crew follow around a group of vampires living together in a share house in Wellington, New Zealand. We see how they live, eking out a life in the dark, trying to find people to feed on, party in trendy nightclubs and argue over who does the housework. When the Nosferatu-like Petyr turns Nick, a potential meal, into one of the undead, they find it a challenge to teach him the ways of eternal life. This film has its moments, it has quite a few belly laughs but even at 70 minutes, the one note premise feels quite stretched. It's a good film but it could have been better. Still worth a watch though.	1
e921c96d-4169-4946-808d-583e9782bc81	  This looked like it had so much promise but turned out to fall way below the mark. There are occasional inspired moments but overall nothing really to sink one's teeth into. Felt like a high school amateur night. Actors did their best with what was a superficial script. The first act is the best but it quickly becomes lifeless and directionless. I suppose if you've been living for thousands of years life would become pretty boring. If your taste is not for over the top mockumentary then give this a miss. If you like silly then suck it and see.	1

McCarthy is hilarious, and Statham's deadpan delivery never misses.While there is a lot to like about this film, it stretches the suspension of disbelief to its limits. At times it tries to walk the tightrope of pseudo-realism and Naked Gun-style farce but totters back and forth confusingly.

39162816-7223-4b63-9187-3e36beede291	  Hilariously funny, the action-comedy Spy is a clever spoofing of the spy genre. When an arms dealer learns the identities of the CIA's top operatives, the CIA sends untested data analyst Susan Cooper into the field in order to track down the location of a nuclear weapon that the dealer is selling. Starring Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, Jason Statham and Jude Law, the film has a strong cast. And, the comedy is quite clever, and does a wonderful job at lampooning the genre tropes and clich�s. However, McCarthy's brand of humor gets a little tiring after a while, and is kind of crass. Still, Spy is tremendously entertaining and delivers a lot of laughs.	1
e4848fcf-b250-4c07-9a62-71387d5e22af	  Melissa McCarthy plays a CIA analyst Susan Cooper who guides the super spy Jude Law around as he performs his dangerous undercover missions. One mission goes awry and soon a ruthless villain (Rose Byrne) knows the identity of all the agents. This forces the hand of the CIA director as they must put Cooper out into the field. This scenario writes itself as you have a overweight nonathletic woman doing one of the most dangerous jobs. Spy has its moments of comedy for sure, and for me Jason Statham who is one of the other agents steals every scene and offers more comedy than McCarthy did. Spy has many forced offense scathing jokes between McCarthy and Byrne to try and keep the film on all cylinders as well. Spy is a good enough action comedy, but I would not recommend it to everyone.	1

a26f74e7-ab31-4b00-9725-e32886b92d0b	  A really bland and generic parody on spy films. The film doesn't discover anything new, the jokes are for the most part unoriginal and Melissa McCarthy plays the same role she always plays. On the plus side, the action portion is filmed well with Statham and Serafinowicz being the funniest and biggest highlights of the film. Fresh jokes are just far too rare to make this anything more than a watchable film if you really don't have anything else to do or watch.	1

509f0129-1368-48ce-9074-5dff435b9e60	  Ugh! A horrible showcase for Melissa McCarthy. The entire first half of the movie was just her jumping from one set piece to another, prattling on as if it were a one-woman show. It got better in the 2nd half when she just couldn't talk so much. Then her sense of humour and timing worked much better.Jason Statham is good at comedy. Who knew?I particularly hate it when producers get non-Italians to speak lousy Italian while pretending to be Italians based on bullshit stereotypes.Best line of the movie goes to McCarthy: "Thank God your hair broke your fall!"	0
6814642c-604b-463b-aa1e-ca3d89ad6607	  I guess I thought it would be a little funnier, but most of the humor was still fairly decent. McCarthy seems like a decent comedian, but at least during this film I thought I would be laughing a little more (not that it wasn't funny at all). Most of the raunchy stuff felt pretty basic to me, but the jokes aren't something you see in a lot of films it seemed like to me. Pretty clever plot for the most part with enough of the humor-here-and-there type thing going on, but overall it just didn't seem to get to me as much as it may have to other people.	1
d45da47f-a772-4333-92a6-1860b4087f69	  Yes, you're right: it's another Bond spoof.This time, it's up to unassuming CIA desk analyst Susan Cooper to turn undercover, after her latest mission for her in-the-field partner goes wrong, leading to an inversion of the usual suave sophisticated super-spy trope.Never really all that funny (even if Jason Statham shows some unexpected comedy skills), nor - truth be told - really that interesting, with most of the best bits (yet again) shown in the trailer.	0
5b91931f-be83-41fb-93ba-b61305a1bcdd	  Thank God Jason Statham turned out funny otherwise it is hard to know who else would have accomplished the mission of making me laugh. Melissa McCarthy has done worse but her brand of expletive-filled insults and physical "hey look I'm considered unattractive' comedy again fails to touch my funny bone. Also, it is only a quarter-way through when you realise the spy spoof genre is now officially played out, though admittedly the unconventional looking female agent twist adds a new dimension. A few jokes here and there hit the mark but it fires jokes out nearly every second that the laws of probability determine at least a few will be good.	1
f0a5a4b4-0c63-46fd-b4f7-4bea722a6d9a	  If you like comedy Paul Feig, then of course, see this movie. I do not like this mountain is not funny jokes below the belt and a long shot of male genitalia do not attract me. It was only a couple of jokes that bring a smile to my face, and almost all of them were connected with the character Statham. Just like an actor works Jude Law and Rose Byrne. But Melissa McCarthy was the same as in other films Feig, and it begins to strain. The plot is quite predictable, although in some places and caused concern. Comedy has not fulfilled its main task, she did not laugh. This is a very subjective opinion.	0
3ef59671-d6cd-40a2-b9b2-492b940c1929	  This movie could have been great but when Ms. McCarthy's character (and others) was supposed to be showing how tough she was it was fuck this and fuck that and mother fucker, etc. There could have been a bit of that, but there was just too much. Ms. McCarthy is a good enough actress that I forget her size, but the fucks coming out of her mouth just brought it back.	1
27418022-364f-4b1c-9469-ed217fc8fffc	  It's not half bad. There are plenty of laughs to be had here. At the end of the day though, it's fairly paint by numbers with plenty of cringe-worthy moments and not quite enough connecting tissue between the best comic bits. Most seem to want to overlook this because it's a female lead in an action-comedy - and that's novel and progressive and should be rewarded, but this isn't up to the quality of say Bridesmaids. It's middling fair and drags through the middle of its two hour run time. Certainly worth a watch, just not much better than any of a dozen other spy comedies you'll find out there.	1
c3debb82-8eb9-498d-b026-f45d8f800911	  It seems that writer's block is overcome with profanity. Can't think of a good line? Just write: This F'ing thing is F'ing BS!!". If you can get the F-word in a sentence 6 or more times you must win a prize. This 2 hour profanity laced comedy with absurd gratuitous pictures of a large penis and more sexual innuendo than 10 Bond films combined was, in a word, ridiculous. The sad thing is - it could have been a really good movie - instead it ended up as a raunchy B- film, unworthy of being called satire...	0
525e7be4-65d4-4ee5-baad-b52f297a505c	  This was funny at times, but could have been a lot better if they didn't try to make every word, sentence and line a joke. We get it, she's awkward. Loud and clear. What I found most interesting was how the audience is beaten over the head, constantly, with how weak of a woman they make her character out to be but then balance it off with making the rest of the women in the movie so confident, powerful and dominant to balance it out. Very prescribed.	1
86450e40-c2ca-4935-9ef8-044ea9cfe5c7	  Against my better judgement, I gave it a go after seeing how highly it rated on RT. I love Melissa McCarthy, and I'd want to build a movie around her too, but this was broad and tedious. Even McCarthy couldn't save it from itself. With no one to bounce off except a few wooden comedy lightweights, she never stood a chance.This might just be me 'getting old', but if Spy passes for a 93% comedy then pass me the vial containing the throat-dissolving liquid. Fuck me.	0
1e1f9be2-f0be-4e1f-b1c8-eae42086c261	  If it was a spy action movie, good. If it was a spy comedy, not great and boring. Problem was I dint know this is comedy or serious action movie! Only Melissa McCarthy did comedy and she was boring and not funny. British comedian Miranda Hart was funnier. So many jokes were unfunny and disgusting! Why so many people uses fart and vomit jokes?! Ugh! I hated it! Acting was not great, it was a really uncomfortable and annoying movie. Unrated version was dirtier and crazier than Theatrical version, I think... Paul Feig's best movie is still Bridesmaids, because so many funny women were in it. If you don't like these kind of movies, you shouldn't watch it! Disappointed...	1
c9c1ff5d-66ac-41c2-812b-4c3eec8ea894	  Wow What a surprise, Spy is not a boring parody spy movie with cheap laughs, lazy action scenes, terrible script and terrible performances, instead it's a smart spy movie with funny laughs, entertaining action scenes with great script and engaging performances. Melissa McCarthy's talent truly shines in this film and she carries the movie on her own, surely Jude Law, Jason Statham and Rose Byrne give us great performances but it's McCarthy that truly stands out. The villains and the story here are not a big deal but thanks to the combination of clever humor, funny laughs and entertaining action scenes this movie works as a comedy spy movie !!!	1
bbf509b0-a55b-488d-b9ce-4592ff641778	  This is the most I've liked Melissa McCarthy since she was in Bridesmaids. It contained a lot of laughs and had a plot that did enough to keep me engaged throughout. Like many others, I thought that Jason Statham and his constantly hilarious one-liners were the highlight of the movie. By far the worst part was Miranda Hart in her sidekick role; the character was awful and every time she was on screen I just wanted her gone.	1
6da53b22-fcdb-40e4-85c3-cd335ed8a5f8	  A spy comedy starring Melissa McCarthy. Getting fantastic reviews and being directed by someone who is known for directing good comedy films, I expected this film to be a lot better. Instead, it just felt generic with a few laughs here and there. Just to note, the biggest laugh I had was because of Jason Statham's fantastic role in the movie. The movie was funny though, don't get me wrong, but it was just inconsistent and it felt very forced at times. But overall, maybe the humor was just not for me.	1
3a905a01-74ad-4378-bc5a-209968d205da	  It's an action comedy with forgettable action scenes and a couple big laughs, mixed in with some chuckle worthy lines. It's alright at best. Melissa McCarthy does her job just fine. Her character was always involved in the best scenes in the film and all the laughs she brings isn't from stupid physical comedy (for the most part). Like I said though, it's alright at best. I don't know if it's worth watching the entire thing for maybe 2 laugh out loud scenes. Everything in between that is really forgettable and boring. Overall I would say this was by no means bad, but could have certainly been much, much better. If you really, really like action comedies, you'll probably have a blast with it. Everyone else I would expect to say either "fine" or "meh".	1
55896ac3-75aa-4db6-bfdb-2863e31d395a	  Unoriginal, flatly executed, and overblown, Spy is the sort of comedy that thinks it's hilarious and assumes you do as well, without earning it. The very set-up of a heavy-set and mild mannered Melissa McCarthy being put in a James-bond esque role sounds perhaps mildly amusing, and it is, but its novelty wears off quickly. The gags are heavily exaggerated and much too drawn out, the plot absurdly nonsensical, and the humor much too one-note. The movie thinks constant fat/ugly jokes about McCarthy is simply hysterical, and thinks it's even more hysterical when she turns the tables by having an "f bomb" tirade. It's not. The film feels like an SNL skit stretched way too far.Disappointing.1.5/5 Stars	0
7d954ce1-e8bd-4b86-9bc2-920dfa71b255	  I do not remember seeing another comedy this funny in a long long time. I laughed out loud, many times. Utterly ridiculous but filled with brilliant spy parody characters with a hilarious cast of Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham, Allison Janney and Jude Law! Plus 50 cent doing a cameo performance! Liked the film showing that women can kick ass and that italian slime balls are not always what they seem. My absolute favorite, in his absurdness, Aldo :) the Italian spy, or was he?	1
4d13d00c-a5af-48b2-9fda-811dbf397884	  There were things that I did find enjoyable about this. However, there were too many things I found wrong with this that I constantly see in American comedies. A lack of creativity behind the camera, and what's expected to be funny is dialogue that is rude and mean spirited that goes on for too long. The reason I feel this got so many positive review is because we all find it empowering to see a woman like Melissa McCarthy kicking ass, but to compare it to a better spy comedy like Kingsman, it just doesn't compare. And why are there so many goddamn Brits working in the CIA in this film? I understand this is supposed to be a Bond spoof but maybe make up an international spy organization if you want something like that to work.	0
95cb050e-6977-4703-81bc-d4a2507fd2b6	  I think this is a first to have a morbidly obese woman as a spy hero. It beat an ideological drum to much due to her being large and a woman which sometimes annoyed me. She had to deal with a lot of agency sexism which is nonsense since this isn't 1950. It portrayed male spouse as rude, stupid, and sexist and she put them in their places as she went. The female villainess was equally stupid and gullible. It has funny stuff in it but I think the social messages were overboard, and I am not a big fan of preachy movies.	1
265688e2-8ee5-44c4-82b3-5422f3835211	  In the Past most of Melissa McCarthy's work wasn't well received, until now. This is Melissa McCarthy's best picture to date in my opinion. She plays the role of a CIA supervisor who wants to become an agent in the field, she gets her chance to do so when she goes on a mission to get revenge for her boyfriend who is presumed dead. What I liked best about the film is the fact that all of the jokes and slapstick scenes were very well written and preformed. Action star Jason Statham shows a different side of himself as a somewhat comical character. Be prepared for plenty of laughs when you go the see the film but don't bring the little ones.	1
42ceb76a-5c8c-4bbe-834c-9edd1b47ed9b	  Another dopey comedy of situations that are not credible, as it turns out it is pretty good. McCarthy is good as doing something with a bit of vulnerability. There are plenty of strong female roles here. I was reluctant because the trailer seemed so much like the last few blow-hard McCarthy roles. Stathum dials up his usual Machismo just a few notches to strike comedy gold. Peter Serafinowicz (Aldo) is a scene stealer.	1
f947d140-de7a-4c7b-b0ce-85c978c15333	  I am shocked by the excellent reviews "Spy" is getting, especially from critics. I would think this is the film that critics would love to hate. I am a Melissa McCarthy fan, but her shtick fell flat, even with me. Much of the graphic violence and vulgar language seemed unnecessary. There were some funny moments and out-right laughs but overall, "Spy" is just a slightly above average film.	1
9001424f-6a33-45d2-af39-9f5db73504b4	  What an awful unfunny movie. I've gone to see 3 movies this summer, and this was by far the worst. Didn't laugh once. Also This is a legit question, did you pay people to give it positive reviews? I have no idea how people could sit through 2 hours of this trash and give it a recommendation. Melissa McCarthy isn't funny and neither are any of the dumb cast who signed on. 50 cent is in it, wow. Supporting cast is garbage, jokes are stale, plot was utterly incoherent. The whole movie felt like everyone just calls Ms. McCarthy fat, audience laughs, then repeat with new character intervals every 5 minute.	0
162441b9-753b-46b0-8c14-f22e5f753258	  I'm not in the bandwagon of hating Melissa McCarthy, but I really enjoyed this spy comedy. It has many laugh-out-loud moments with some great improvisation and a unexpectedly hilarious performance from Jason Statham makes this one of the funnier films I've seen this year. The plot is nothing new or original in terms of what a Spy film is, but it's still an enjoyable comedy. Give it a watch. Mostly likely, it will get a sequel.	1
8fd3e10f-513c-4c47-a6f3-4fe53fbbefb3	  Overall a good picture and a great idea. McCarthy is excellent. What detracts from the movie is stuff I see too often now a days;1- It's too long. The movie is based on a very good idea. They over work it;2- They try too hard. E.g. the banter between McCarthy and Statham gets tiresome and is over played. The problem is with the Statham part;3- Pointless and overbearing gratuitous cursing. What's with the desperate need to load pictures down with pointless f-bombs???	1
80e1ccd1-4d25-4300-a6c3-f2dce3a4706b	  Another case where my high hopes for a movie effects how much I enjoy it. Dont get me wrong I did really like it however I expected a very side splittingly funny movie. It does give good laughs Id say abit less than Bridesmaids and I also expected more Jason Statham and actually expect him to kick some ass instead of McCarthy, never the less this was a very good of what seems to be the first of a few "Spy" movies	1
d2b58c7f-2361-4adf-9602-1df49c755bc2	  Hilarious! Another sleeper hit for sure. Spy lacks the elegant humour of Kingsman, but makes up with the endearing humour of Melissa McCarthy as the unexpected spy, Susan Cooper. Loved the originality of the plot, which was a refreshing change from the suave Bond spy genre that sees Melissa McCarthy take the lead as Susan Cooper, the frumpy CIA operative who finally gets to go undercover. Loved how Jason Statham turns up in this action comedy in a role that pokes fun at his tough guy persona. Expect a sequel.	1
b67e60e8-1330-4525-981e-b7bae08a2618	  I don't think I will remember this movie too well a year from today, but today I do like it. Emily Blunt puts on a very good performance and the story has a unique spin to it. The action sequences create a lot of tension and the directing is very good, I particularly liked the use of infrared and night vision in the final action sequence. Some bits of the movie are overplayed and unoriginal, like the annoyingly coy police character Brolin plays, but some people may like it. This isn't a unforgettable movie, but it is certainly a little better than an average action picture.	1
6380ee02-38f4-4d16-8708-518c4c9b049d	  I forced myself to sit through the first hour and a half of this movie. It was all blood and violence with almost no substance. I was ready to give it one star. I continued to watch because I love Benicio Del Toro and it was so highly rated on RT. The last half hour was really good and so I had to give it two and a half stars. All in all, a mediocre film.	1
13317bdc-a6ab-4c4c-affc-7437e67d903b	  Very surprised this is getting such high reviews, I found this movie to be a real letdown despite the talented cast. Very cliched plot, and the characters (especially Mexicans) are portrayed as caricatures. Comes across as propaganda that the United States should increase resources and get tougher on the war on drugs, despite the evidence that the policy is misguided and the war unwinnable. Some of the plot elements are so outrageous and unbelievable, even in the fantasy land of a Hollywood script. Terrible film, nothing interesting or redeeming. I found it almost unwatchable, impossible to take seriously, and difficult to finish.	0
1f61c63b-7954-4926-9898-25c75254f5db	  Terrible movie with a complete unbelievable plot. So we are meant to believe, that Diaz, the US based drug boss, is driving through the deserted mexican desert late at night to see his boss Fausto, with no armed escort. And when they reach the gate fo Fausto's house, Alejandro shoot Diaz and the neck, exits the car while Diaz still managed to drive the short distance to the gate. Come On! Then Alejandro takes out the three guards and only three guards guarding Fauasto's entire housing complex. Stupid, stupid movie!	0
d14766e7-ada5-43af-ae90-fa4cb94a805a	  I'm honestly not sure where the hype came from on this one, nor the crazy high critic reviews. The movie was slow, plodding, explained little, and ultimately went almost nowhere. The protagonist (Blunt), if you could call her that, was unlikable, and really the only character you even sort of liked (but not really) was Benicio del Toro... who himself was a one-dimensional character as well.Ultimately, I had high hopes for this, given the cast, the acclaim, etc - but wouldn't even put this on the background-noise category in my house.That said, some of the cinematography was terrific, and there were definitely a few interesting moments. Enough to float the movie though? No way.	0
477a4d1b-4bc0-4125-93cb-e325fe23d0a7	  Terrible script and Blunt's character, yet another female protagonist, fails epically to convince the audience she is really a cop. This film's scenes where terribly assembled and to much focus of the plot, went back and forth from Blunt's emotional fragility to conspiracy at play. Always reaching for a cigaret was really poor directing. Choice of music and tone for scenes where totally wrong. What a mess. Villeneuve's directorship suffered from the bad habits of his fellow Quebec film colleagues... confusion.	0
1bcbe56d-7ec7-4a82-8e4e-7779591c4e21	  This movie was so incredibly, laughably bad. I watched a bunch of people drive around for half the movie without talking. Then, when they did finally get around to discussing the plot, no one wanted to tell anyone else what was going on. I'm not even sure they knew themselves. Helicopter thermal vision and the quote from Benicio del Toro; "You are asking how a watch works, when you should just mind the time," stand out to me. At least it provided the most nonsensical quote I will be recycling when anyone asks me a question this year. Worst movie I saw this year. At least it made me laugh.	0
8fc46e85-77fb-4614-9b2e-c148920fe2c8	  I don't usually leave RT reviews, but I feel I need to with this one. I feel really disappointed with it, and that it's completely overrated. It opens really exciting, and looks like it's going to be a brilliant movie. I LOOKS great, it FEELS great, but the story really is very poor... if you've not seen it, stop reading now.Spoilers ahead: You meet Emily blunt's character, then you're left hanging for around 40 minutes to know why she is even in the movie, and once you do find out, she has little to nothing to do with the plot. The plot is so simple, yet they stretch it out, and then the movie ends, with one final look at her, and she does nothing. Oh well...	1
f345197a-b229-49a5-bb32-2f377c374b6a	  Everyone who says this movie is intriguing, interesting, captivating, etc. is lying. It's boring and slow. Plain and simple. There's nothing to this film that makes it any better than a crappy 90s police drama... Emily Blunt is a wonderful actress, but not in this. She's truly a great talent who got caught up in a bad project, please forgive her and give her another chance. If you hated Gravity, Titanic, Slumdog Millionaire and other movies that are ridiculously overrated please avoid this. The Sicario has no clothes.	0
055cd528-59e7-42fa-86f2-21a0d4457c2c	  The movie portrays a pretty accurate picture of what the situation in Mexico actually is. It really is that gruesome and scary. However, it slowly starts to slide into a James Bond-esque kinda film in which everything revolves around Benicio's character being some flawless marksman mastermind and it kinda loses the reality aspect to me since then. It's a well made movie, but it really isn't the kind of things I like to watch or think about. Nothing personal	1
7768ad32-a51b-4d31-ad75-a26fea571919	  Have no clue what the RT critics saw in this film. Lots of gratuitous violence, brutality, savagery, OK, it's a drug war film; so what? Emily Blunt, always eye candy, sees outlandishly ill suited for this role. Josh Brolin has one tone throughout; smug, cocky asshole. Del Toro seems to be sleepwalking most of the time. Dull, poorly paced, irrelevant. Stay away.	1
ca125f0a-8f46-4ea6-95f5-e0ed78fc8e2e	  This is a good enough gangster movie. Benicio and Blunt are great, but Blunt's character isn't believable and I can't empathize with her. There is a bar scene where she acts human, but that was jarringly out of place. In the third act Benicio's character develops some depth. This is a good story, but it comes off as a poorly-done No Country for Old Men. The characters just don't have any depth.	1
b337d6a7-092e-4672-b130-7dcd5ed4580d	  Heavy on tension but light on character, I can't remember a single name after seeing it only an hour ago. By the end this is basically No Country for Mexican Men with a similar tone to the Coen Bros. Oscar-winning film of years past but without any character (villain or hero) to become fully invested in. If dark isn't your thing, then avoid at all costs as Sicario never deviates from it's 'realistic' setting of just how gray the war on drugs really is.	1
0f75c0a5-14c5-43e4-a600-d9f96d60f1fa	  Sicario is an extremely dark and brooding movie that takes itself to the extreme of gore and murder. The plot ends up being overly convoluted and almost annoying, especially Benecio Del Toro's character, however he does play him perfectly. Then you have Emily Blunt's character who is just a complete moron who keeps getting pulled in more and more blindly when Josh Brolin basically just acts like a prick the entire time. The story has many of it's shock value moments and progresses fairly well without too much stop-starting but did not personally appeal to me.	0
cd3817a0-1725-402a-acc8-25de25450f79	  I don't think I will remember this movie too well a year from today, but today I do like it. Emily Blunt puts on a very good performance and the story has a unique spin to it. The action sequences create a lot of tension and the directing is very good, I particularly liked the use of infrared and night vision in the final action sequence. Some bits of the movie are overplayed and unoriginal, like the annoyingly coy police character Brolin plays, but some people may like it. This isn't a unforgettable movie, but it is certainly a little better than an average action picture.	1
6fd79876-844c-47a5-83ff-5c309baf7f14	  Dirty things happen in a dirty war. For all it's superficial down and dirty credentials, full of mumblecore and meaningful looks, it's still in essence, a flagelistic, formulaic, police procedural. Emily Blunt plays the moral compass, she quivers, she smokes, she spins, she smokes again. Benicio del Toro represents the outcome with baggy eyed authority whilst Josh Brolin's amoral character view represents the problem. As a cake, Sicario's ingredients are crude but it has an icing of great accomplishment.	1
29dbbc7c-6de3-4cd2-a31d-ff73309f542a	  Benicio Del Toro was fantastic!!! But the main character Emily Blundt is written as naive and unbelievable. Anyone who deals with that world of corruption and drug trafficking should not be a I'm going to tell on you if your not 100% by the book in procedures. These are not construction workers-these are people who work for the Mexican drug cartel who would shoot you without a second thought and say its not personal. But your going to turn in the people who saved your life for not being kind to murderers. Time went quickly and Del Toro will get a deserved Oscar supporting actor nod.	0
09828ff7-75a0-4fea-abbb-65f92b5d19a4	  If you know the word sicario, it's probably from Narcos. Like that show, this is a perfectly competent movie ruined by another clueless gringo protagonist who is totally out of their element. If The Martian is "competence porn', this is incompetence porn. Doesn't say much for viewers that we presumably need to see these stories told through that kind of lens. Nicely done movie but has nothing interesting to say except the flimsy "am I really worse than you?" tacked on at the end.	0
a0bb8444-8d1f-46d2-8b7f-87e855b7e870	  Very disappointing movie - the main character (Blunt) is no more than a tag along and has almost zero effect on the main plot which is driven by more interesting characters. Hard to capture the dual morality in this confused film except for a sense of helplessness. After an hour you kind of hope it's going somewhere, but it doesn't.A lot of violence and good photography doesn't make this a good movie.	0
1baa7530-77ac-4dfa-8c1d-20252c5303d7	  A violent and dark thriller with some very intense and suspense-filled moments, this is an effective and often powerful film with a political message after the carnage has settled. Emily Blunt's performance stands out, much in the same way as Jodie Forster's did in Silence of the Lambs, as she is not only the main character but the only female character in a sea of male testosterone - which makes the decision strange when she was sidelined in the finale confrontation. I suppose that this is illustrative of the film's insistence on realism and grittiness over contrivances and for that, I do applaud, but as a result, the downbeat and disconnected ending feels less than satisfying but maybe the gender unfairness is the point here?	1
1aa73079-01e3-43bd-a181-80bbee319385	  The vulnerability in Emily Blunt's last scene is brilliant. But I didn't buy her as the hard-ass, which surprised me, given her performance in Edge of Tomorrow. Also, why is her character so dumb? If you're going to build a dumb character, you have to give her something to redeem her. Here, there was nothing -- no humor, no interesting back story. Just one more dumb American who realizes what the stars and stripes really do to the rest of the world. (At least, though, it takes a critical view of the U.S.'s involvement in foreign affairs instead of just spewing more propaganda.)	1
5300eeff-5697-480b-836c-acd4d6072d62	  The film had great tension n suspense, but ruined itself by having such little action and it became so boring, actually it was terrible af, it does this horrible job of trying to make Emily Blunt look unattractive also she was annoying. I don't even remember a single thing about it. Oh wait- there was guns, bombs, bullets, dead bodies all over and on screen you read 'smoking kills', that was cool. (2.5/5)	0
a9917f9c-7d99-41d6-b66e-ac9acd6d9ca4	  This one gets a three star for Brolin's work as a dirtbag CIA guy - a role he was born to play - providing the nuance for his future career. Benecio Del Toro is a statue in his role as a Hispanic psychopath, and Emily Blunt is hard to believe as anything but an eyepiece. You've seen this movie in one form or another over the past forty years, so don't expect much, because you won't get it.	1
7e304870-3dec-4ed8-b126-1dc0222a5773	  great performances, but very little character development. the editing was too slow. it had a lot of drawn out shots and awkwardly lingering scenes. they could have cut 20-30 min off easily. it was tonally odd. it didn't own being a vengeance flick, nor intrigue, nor thriller. i felt a lack of background music to carry any kind of feeling. i was just left with mild tension throughout the film with no real highs or lows.	0
cafa4b25-2d68-4c3e-8b89-0e61ffefc682	  Dark, brooding and oppressive sums up Sicario, The movie starts with a FBI raid on a suspected drug Cartel's home and the discovery of what actually the house contains. It then moves along into darker country as it shows the other end of the law enforcement practiced by those with little morals to get the job done. Emily Blunt's character (Kate Macer) spends most of the movie looking appalled at the lengths Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) go to take down the Cartel and anyone involved with them. There is a point when Blunt's character asks 'What is our mission?' To which Brolin replies 'To dramatically over react'. Which gives you a idea where this is going to lead. The end builds up to a predictably conclusion of whether Alejandro (Del Toro) will get revenge on the Cartel's leader.	1
ac3f014c-7a4a-4607-a33b-effdcf66b238	  I think I'm the only person on Earth that couldn't get past Emily Blunt's character being a weak, whiny, compromised woman who was supposed to represent the FBI in this movie. Del Toro was phenomenal as the hitman... loved his cool, calm, no bs character whom I felt was written the precise way someone that works around the Cartel should. Anyone that's lived on the border knows it's not rocker launcher bad but the depiction of the mangled bodies hanging from bridges was spot on. Couldn't get past her character, completely ruined the rest for me. But, that's my unpopular opinion.	0
e7ec9eb1-466f-4f6e-bf04-258383492354	  Massively overhyped movie. While Blunt is more than capable of kicking ass and taking names (from her work in Edge of Tomorrow), she is almost exclusively both a victim of the powerful men around her, and a pawn in their schemes. The scheme's themselves are fairly interesting, but her disappointing role in them colors my impression of the movie.There's only so many times you can see a supposedly strong, assertive woman beaten up by the men around her.	0
6869c384-fc54-4ee0-aa8f-c828bc31e18b	  This was an OK movie, CERTAINLY not worth 4 or 5 stars. This is not an extraordinary movie, nor is it thought-provoking. Shallow characters, lack of suspense, fairly dry dialogue. This is not a movie that changes the way you you think about the war on drugs. At least not anyone who is remotely aware. The acting was fine and good, the plot fine and good, the movie fine and good. But I can't imagine paying to watch this now that I have seen it. It was just disappointing, particularly after all the rave reviews. IAs it is, don't feel any better for having spent two hours of my time watching this movie.	1
52cf8486-c853-4e70-9572-72861ab96a96	  Having just watched Narco on Netflix I felt like I've seen this story before. The problem is that the main theme of the story is the incomprehensibility of the drug wars. The problem is that it left the movie incomprehensible too, sometimes. The bottom line is that this wouldn't be an issue if either 1) Americans stopped using cocaine or 2) it was legalized. But this movie is about the crime, not the thought behind it. My favorite character was Benicio Del Toro, who always brings such depth to any role.	1
5684c561-7ce7-48ec-adae-0a545ac276b0	  She seems like a nice woman, but in the end, all she's done is collect a lot of crap. That's enough to sustain a ten minute Sixty Minutes piece, but not a full length documentary. After twenty minutes, the film goes completely flaccid, having nothing left to say or show. I was left feeling: "Just think what this woman could have done if she had been interested in something that actually matters."	1
c9c33eef-f17c-4aa7-9e8f-980d5b45d15d	  I was disappointed. It is exactly what the title says, a montage. The director seems to want to portray Cobain's mind as chaotic, which it likely was. He leaves out most of the events that lead up to Cobain's suicide and abruptly ends with the overdose in Rome. There is no mention of the You Know You're Right recording sessions and honestly very little mention of In Utero. Anything you get from this film can be received by purchasing Cobain's published diaries. You may be better off purchasing the diary because it offer more for the reader to interpret rather than seeing things through the eyes of this director. There are large holes in the plot of this film. It is far from a comprehensive look into the life of an artist. It is the approved version. It is only what certain parties want you to see.	1
7c035dd2-e0da-4b01-933b-5aad1277ce07	  definitely enjoyed seeing Kurt growing up.The concert footage I have already seen before. Krist was genuine and I enjoyed his interview. Tracy Marander was wonderful, it's a shame he didn't stay with her. You could tell she really loved him. The director said he worked on this for 7 years......that is truly hard to believe. I was also surprised at how cold Kurt's family seemed. Why did this movie put Kurt down so much?!? I thought it was supposed to be about Kurt, not Courtney trying to polish her image. There should have been tons of more never before seen footage and music. Disappointed to say the least. True Nirvana fans will see right through it!!	0
5c5983a6-4b45-4a4a-909a-ef9b25345fba	  If you're familiar with the mythology of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana, the epic rise out of nowhere-Washington to the biggest rock God of them all, then this is a splendid film which greatly humanizes Kurt and Courtney and checks in with Krist Novoselic in his balding middle-age. The endless home movies from Kurt's childhood up to his last days show sides of him that were not well known before and add something different to the way he and those close to him have been portrayed up till now. Likewise the quotes and illustrations from his journal fill in this artful portrait of the sarcastic lead singer of Nirvana.	1
32cf2fce-625e-4974-ba86-0a2790237c5b	  An amateur porn would be less intimate that what is shown in this movie. As the documentary itself reveals, Cobain hated being ridiculed, judged for his life rather than for his music, and more generally being exposed, chewed by and eventually sentenced by strangers who were and are morbidly attracted by how he was in his privacy. Despite its positive elements-such as the richness of the materia or the animation parts-I could not help but feeling uneasy for the most part of it, a little ashamed of me partaking in this, commercially-driven, and socially shared act of violation.	0
ed0b09d6-98c4-4bc2-896c-c2e403f37f6a	  In a feature too long for my tasting, Brett Morgan cleverly knits together the remains of what was a short but fruitful rockstar career. The film never fails to entertain, but lacks the ability to tell a new story. The most important additions are the Love-Cobain couple's home-videos, which leave an image of the artist that should be remembered. But that is not an addition we can thank the makers for. What we can thank them for however, is the bril animation sequences.	1
d58149a3-be5d-4ecd-93e6-4c54bf986039	  The title refers to the year 1971, the year that Gary Hook (Jack O'Connell), a private in the British army, funds himself alone on the streets of Belfast. That predicament makes him a sitting duck for the warring forces of Catholic nationalists, already embroiled in their own internal conflicts with the notorious IRA and other insurgents, and Protestant loyalists.Basically, Gary is in deep shit. '71, a barcing, hard-charging debut from TV director Yann Demange, makes sure we feel every wincing, violent moment with Gary, the threat of death lurking around every corner. Director Paul Greengrass brought documentary-like immediacy in his telling of the Troubles in 2002's Bloody Sunday, but Demange's film, starring an outstanding O'Connell, is seeking to make the personal more political. It can be a bit much, but why harp on an ambitious film that provides so many knockout moments? You don't.	1
8b172c3f-d2df-47d9-a7aa-b7937617d16d	  Not worth the 82 % and definitely not 97%. Scenes were so slow and lack of differentiation between characters. LOTS of "close calls" moments. Main character never showed any military skills whatsoever. Everything in the movie had no substance and was too ironic. Besides the significant history role that its supposed be there were only like 20 main characters who were boring, WHOLE MOVIE IS BORING DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR ONE DOLLAR AND 61 Cents. Not going to give a full review although I watched the whole movie because there really was nothing good about the movie.	0
7dee30db-bd3b-4ce5-8521-a25b810b96d2	  I don't know what's with everybody's hype on this one. I thought, performance wise, that was great. But as a thriller, that was not as engaging or some sort. Maybe of its uninteresting plot. Though this guy, the protagonist, was a soldier, accidentally abandoned by his unit following the riot happening in Belfast 71. Till such, he was chased by a number of civilians and make his way through survival. The only part I was interested in, where he was chased, the bombing scene and the last part of the film. That's it. I thought this was more of a "sleeper thriller" that should have been better. It's okay, I like the 70's look of this film. Just a one time watch. 3/5	1
4cf9f535-f0ae-424d-b983-9d8a20afb96c	  Intriguing possibilities unrealized was my feeling when I left the theater. The protagonist is a private in the British Army occuping Belfast in 1971. He gets lost and there's lots of shooting, some period cars, and really bad haircuts. But as someone who lived through that awful haircut era, I wanted a lot more. The origins of the Irish apartheid and religious persection would have been a nice start, but not there. Barely worth the trip.	1
ce78dec9-a1f0-4c89-bb6a-3bd1f38304eb	  An uneven mix of attributes combines to make a moderately effective thriller that had potential to be better. The set-up, with an English solider abandoned alone in IRA-run Belfast, conveys the claustrophobia of civil war far better than most efforts. The big problem is the production design's commitment to historically authentic blandness. To be fair, it's easy to see why the protagonist's army uniform can be overlooked so easily when everything within sight is roughly the colour of manure, but the same beige-ness means the near absence of visual cues to assist with recognition when the story gets complicated. The kind of frustrating effort that's alright, but should have been better.	1

6ee84d6d-ee79-440f-82ae-90050c8acd32	  Gritty. Some of the dialogue was hard to understand. It was also hard to follow who was whom, because they all wore brown clothes: the undercover military men, the Catholics, the Protestants, and the traitors. Couldn't keep up. We didnt' need to see a long death scene of one of the pursuers, nor repeated close-ups of the main character's flesh wound. The scene where he stumbles down the street after the pub bomb went on far too long. At the end, he is taken into a building and has a very dirty face, but a few minutes later when he is rescued his face is very clean. And what was up with the comrade who was wrestling with him??	1

007e5de8-cf1d-4fc2-bdda-8c2648108809	  Introduced by a hard-hitting boxing fight; the ethos of '71 is immediately understood. It is brutal, thrilling and an utterly dramatic directorial debut from Yann Demange... Finely Wrought--Set against the complex backdrop of the beginnings of Northern Ireland in 71 but before Bloody Sunday really turned the tide in the favor of the IRA in 72 this is an extremely well made taught piece of drama... Compelling story, well told, populated with believable characters!!	1
7416308d-799b-46af-9b29-ef5daa81a0be	  I found the plot tedious and like the main character, it limped from one scene to another. The scenes just after the explosion on the Shankhill were contrived. We got the message after about five seconds that the soldier was in shock, deaf and confused. It seemed to go on forever. The best acting I thought came from the young Loyalist lad who was killed in the explosion. As for the captain in charge of the sneaky beaky squad, from personal experience I have never met a serving officer who spoke with a broad accent, with the exception of all the officers portrayed by Sean Bean in Sharpe's Rifles. The ending was weak and just seemed to fizzle out. This film could have been much better.	1
46d0aec4-06e0-4dea-8dee-5006521e68d4	  I hate to say it but i was completely underwhelmed. To say this movie was a slow burn is a understatement. The movie felt like it was at one pace the entire time and so was both of the lead performances. Blanchett And Mara are both fine here but rarely do either of them go above the register of "blah". The film is quite beautifully filmed and the aesthetic of the 50's is great i just felt like nothing was ever happening even when something was.	1
4e1e1216-53ab-4ec2-99b1-27111072fb1f	  I was really interested in seeing Carol because of the Oscar nominations and I'm a big fan of Cate Blanchette. I was disappointed. The acting was good, but the movie was slow paced and, actually, a bit boring. I did like Rooney Mara's character and performance. Cate was good too, but I believe the movie suffers from a predictable story and was very slow paced. I give it 3 stars because of the superb acting, but I waited to see this after all the other nominated movies. You might consider doing the same.	1
1e5bda06-f016-4589-858e-51901f57bc0d	  Beautiful to look at but lacks real depth. The viewer is kept at arms length from both of the women and you never get a sense of what really makes them tick. The film shows a view from the outside, figuratively and literally, through numerous foggy and rain sprinkled windows. It's difficult to care about either character as neither is humanized. It takes more than a pretty face, marvelous clothing and classic cars to pull off a true quality film. This one falls short.	1
7291d48f-ca47-47df-ada8-57f0b35c3b1c	  This film had so much potential, given its cast and subject matter, but it was underwhelming and far too long. The plot felt dragged on and none of the characters had any backbone. The talent in this cast was not present in the film, and left me wondering if it was the directing or the acting that was slacking. Many scenes felt awkward and unnecessary and I believe the film would have been much more powerful had it focused more on the two main characters relationship and made it more concise.	0
5875ed57-b685-443e-9413-759263428693	  A big yawn for this film that was clearly made for the oscars due to the fact that, if you get off with somebody of your own sex and you're not really gay, then you have a free pass to the nominations party. I am particularly annoyed that they gave Blachett the best actress nom and Mara the best supporting actress nom. This is the wrong way around. Rooney Mara has a bigger part in this film and should be well insulted by this. The story is certainly not special, it is all just a stage for the big les-up.	0
04639127-3faf-4f2a-af52-6a80a53914bb	  I cannot understand why this movie is being held up as being an example of superior movie-making. I found it aggravating. There are lots of long, loving looks exchanged between the two, but there is never the sense that either of them has the faintest idea who the other really is. So why the deep devotion to each other? The audience is never told. In fact it's never clear why they are attracted to each other to begin with--the "opposites attract" thing doesn't work here either, because frankly, there is no clarity whether they are opposite or alike. I had expected to like it, but instead found myself angry with the director for making the audience work so hard for so little payoff.	1
f90f4eae-33cb-4074-b233-e64689038569	  Carol didn't do it for me. First off, it was pretty boring. It didn't feel like too much of note actually happened throughout the entirety of the running time. Cate Blanchett played the titular character in a really cold way, which meant I never completed trusted or cared about her. Kyle Chandler (who was the man as Coach T in Friday Night Lights) was wasted on a character that was only ever angry or on the brink of anger. Rooney Mara was quite good in the other main role, and Sarah Paulson was awesome as Carol's best friend from way back.	0
b1dfad5e-0252-4661-8d3b-c97109713d70	  While this film is beautifully and sensitively directed by Todd Haynes, it fails as a love story because Cate Blanchett's 'Carol' is so bloodless and reptilian that her desire for Therese, played by Rooney Mara, comes across as predatory and creepy. Her performance is so stagey it almost felt to me like she was trapped in the heady aura of her own perfume - there was not one moment when I believed her, or believed her as a genuine, living breathing human being falling in love with another. Rooney Mara is a much more honest actress and if at times her blank, entranced stare gets a bit annoying its because she is just playing off of what Ms Blanchett is giving her which is a statuesque performance rather than a human connection. Well done Todd Haynes.	1
8375ec32-9a03-4f18-9957-f7e7ee5db3da	  Carol is alright, I guess. As far as beige romance films go, it has a very solid pairing at its center, and when Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett share the screen, their chemistry is undeniable. Mara is particularly fantastic throughout, but Blanchett is shockingly a bit hammy. While their chemistry makes their relationship believable, its a stoic sort of chemistry, which renders the film a mild slog. Its fantastic that it comes across as more than a statement film, while not ignoring the realities of its period, but its less than compelling.	1
76ea3e30-8b12-4a19-84ef-dc910ccf8064	  Its all well done and super boring. There is nothing sympathetic or compelling about either of these characters. This is a slow burn of a movie which i am not a fan of, but the friend i saw it with likes slow and she didn't like it so its not just me. Some part of me thinks that's just because its set in the 50's about a lesbian relationship critics have to give it a good review.	0
ba66c7e5-9752-4e14-bda0-88a89ee16424	  Agh... I wanted to love this movie, and there were plenty of lush, gorgeously presented moments to enjoy while for a few seconds at a time, through this drawn out story, you were treated to the "plot" but truly the thoughtful, stifled, reflection grew painful to me really quickly and I found myself wishing death would envelope me so I could escape. I honestly felt the scenes, where Blanchett was allowed to do more than look in the mirror or light a cigarette, were worth the price of admission, and Mara is just exquisite throughout, but I could not spark any light or hope for the entire 2 hours otherwise.	0
662444d3-259d-44a5-9742-a01d9231fb2b	  If "Carol" were "Carl" critics would complain this is a sexist retro and mostly boring movie about a predatory 1950's man in his 50's seducing and further confusing a young, confused and mostly stupid young woman. Alas, it's hailed as a period piece of intolerance. Great writing, acting (except poor Kyle Chandler give a totally stiff stereotype), beautiful filming, very slow, and manipulative, and a politically correct ending, but poor Terese!	0
280cc1df-10d7-46f3-9b0c-c5a9a86bdc25	  Should Cate Blanchett win an Oscar? Probably. Should this film be nominated for cinematography? Sure. But where was the editor? This movie was SO slow I wanted to leave in the middle of it. The second half was better than the first, andI did like how they ended the film. But the first hour? SO slow and nothing happened! I would have been happier waiting till this film came out on DVD.	1
5434feb1-8d8d-4011-9055-67088278fa51	  I hate to say it but i was completely underwhelmed. To say this movie was a slow burn is a understatement. The movie felt like it was at one pace the entire time and so was both of the lead performances. Blanchett And Mara are both fine here but rarely do either of them go above the register of "blah". The film is quite beautifully filmed and the aesthetic of the 50's is great i just felt like nothing was ever happening even when something was.	1
96758d47-d84a-469c-9153-204b378b6530	  I usually love a slow-burn film with great acting, which I expected this to be. But it was just dull, with little chemistry between the two leads, minor characters who seemed to have inexplicable or no motivation for their behaviour, and poor and clunky dialogue. It looked great. In fact, it was like watching a 2-hour Revlon commercial. There was a scene towards the end the film where Blanchett's performance struck just the right chord and it was very moving, but it had nothing to do with the main relationship which just wasn't credible for me.	0
cdec25f3-dd15-424d-8b8a-c1601c18a9e2	  An older serial philanderer, exploits a younger naive and confused store clerk. Living up to the lesbian pulp source material inspired by a Hot blond in a mink coat the author once saw, she defied the convention of pulp literature at her time, by hinting at a happy ending.The being said, Cate Blanchett's character was inconsistent and the "A Brief Encounter" homages hurt me so. I feel sorry for lesbians if this is championed as an expression of lesbian love.	1
e720c15c-2eb2-48d2-9158-cc3d280018c9	  Cate Blanchett was superb, of course, and Rooney Mara held her own. It's an interesting story, emotionally stimulating & authentic, and pretty damn sexy at times. However, I thought it was too long, which diluted its impact by the time I made it to the end. Blanchett's character is also just so incredibly privileged that it was hard to feel the oppression and prejudice as much as I normally might.	1
3e6de18b-372e-41ab-ad95-2765821d610a	  Saw the movie, "Carol", tonight at The Little. Very disappointing. The whole time I kept waiting for something to happen. It was soooo slow and predictable. The camera hovered over the actors faces so long, that was the most acting... them holding the same face.Trying to be "artsy" I suppose. Even the sex scene was boring and too long. (Although most guys would prob disagree, it waaass lesbian.) The only interesting thing was the fashion of the time...clothing & accessories, hairstyles, furniture, buildings, food & drinks and, especially, cars.	0
7a8448f7-22bc-407d-9d65-740307e680a1	  Cate Blanchett delivers a powerhouse performance, but that aside this film is a disappointment, neither incisive in its look at American social norms in the 1950s nor emotional when it needs to be. Rooney Mara is also unconvincing as Blanchett's love interest, sadly displaying the range she showed in Prometheus, although her's is far from the only underdeveloped character. Blanchett's estranged husband Kyle Chandler's behaviour makes little sense, and considering the nods the film makes towards the paradox between society's need for public faces and what really want on in private, the length of time the romantic leads take to consummate their relationship is odd. Todd Haynes' film is unquestionably well meaning and is a feast for the senses, and there are certainly both likeable and funny moments. A lesbian romance shot through a very Hollywood lens though was always going to struggle to convince.	1
b32bbf66-7b56-477e-a04f-5d1664846611	  A film about two women falling in love could not have had less realistic content about lesbianism. There is minimal affection between the two characters--out of context Carol and Therese could have been two female friends. There is no development in their relationship and the rising action that supposedly suggested they were falling for each other lacked actual emotional and physical contact. All of the characters were rudimentary at best. In fact, Mara's character relied heavily on the trope of a wide-eyed introverted young girl. The lack of depth in the character development seemed to be substituted for a pseudo-indie aesthetic with pano shots of landscapes and sad piano music. The plot itself was disjointed and in some places not explained. I was very disappointed after seeing the TomatoMeter rating.	0
25a70904-14f3-4ed5-a5d2-e14481259948	  A lesbian melodrama that's beautiful to look at but not much else. In many ways, this film echoes many of the "forbidden relationship in an intolerant time" movies from years ago with a more upbeat conclusion. It's also reminiscent of director Todd Haynes' earlier far superior work, "Far From Heaven," but he offers precious little that's especially new here. The stylish period production values, while visually opulent, ultimately aren't enough to carry a story based on an inherently thin, predictable narrative.	1
a0aad9d0-809c-42e5-bb47-e552086804e3	  The core of the movie - the romance between the two women - was rather underwhelming. For a rather slow paced movie of almost two hours runtime, the lovers did not manage to develope any chemistry or deep connection (at least to me as a viewer) aside from longingly staring at each other. Their fascination for each other is obvious and portrayed well, but "love" on a deeper level is not credible and developed enough. Blanchett and Mara both are great actresses on their own, they portray interesting characters and the film is beautiful to look at, but the lack of chemistry drags down this promising movie for me.	0
4646bd73-6e91-464a-84e1-5d89246c8146	  If I could give this zero stars I would. It is perhaps the most soulless, self-indulgent movie full of empty pregnant pauses. long stares. There was NO character development, the script was utterly vacant and woeful. Oh my God the entire movie was like watching paint dry. What Cate Blanchett saw in this script is utterly beyond me. I was with a friend who wanted to see 'what would happen; (nothing as it turns out), otherwise I'd have walked out of the first movie I've perhaps walked out ever. Utter rubbish. And I LOVE Cate Blanchett and Kyle Chandler and was looking forward to a sensitive portrayal of love in same sex couples. I'm retching. It was dreadful. And if it wins any awards - I'm giving up on Hollywood.	0
9b130ca8-0e5f-4de0-acc5-0ad03a4be957	  I swear this could have easily been cut down to about one hour with how much time is spent with NOTHING happening, except some music playing that's supposed to make us feel something. Honestly, the performances here are fine, and it's visually gorgeous, but the soundtrack is overpowering and there's so much time between actual character interactions that it was hard to regain focus when something actually happened. There are so many significant gazes here that at some point it started to seem pretentious. I also figured out one plot point pretty soon after one character was introduced. Again, I did like all the actors here and thought they were very good, especially Rooney and Blanchett, and when they actually interact the movie works, but there's just so much empty space and music telling me to feel that I was bored though most of it and can't give it the full recommendation.	1
71160f67-7e93-4b18-aa4b-485d12a66e82	  "Carol" is a love story. It's an ok love story, but it remains a goddamn love story. Nothing more, nothing less. Yeah I know it's about "lesbians in the '50s blah blah blah", but that fact (the selling point) leads to very little emotional tension: thanks to Haynes' artsy fartsy direction, this is extremely slow. It basically just alternates between realistically written and played dialogues and god-awfully long, silent staring into space with melancholic music in the background. Get on with it.	1
0e6186d9-4b1b-4b84-acfa-72896a99b55c	  I was strangely unmoved by this film. I found that I didn't emphasise with either of the main characters - I didn;t really understand what motivated Rooney Mara's character at all - she seemed to say Yes to everything without ever showing any real hunger for life or experience. The husband seemed like a crude caricature. Cate Blanchett stood out as a woman in a dilemma and played with great power and style. But overall I don't see why it is receiving the praises which it is	1
e56b0256-b4f5-46ea-bc14-643b6507dff2	  A very slow paced forbidden love story from another era ... Blanchett, elegant but fragile, and trapped in a marriage she does not want to be in spots and is instantly smitten with the coquettish Rooney Mara who is best as the doe eyed Audrey Hepburn esque shop girl. It's also great to see Sarah Paulson (who has been such a stalwart of the American Horror Story series, get more silver screen exposure). There is a denouement part way through the film that you think might send the film spiraling into a very dark place - that never transpires, so we are left with a very lovely film - it just could have done with a bit more umpf ... however, you can not deny what an impact Film4 is having on this years film output, with another good co-production.	1
dc7e83aa-f13a-4105-9c7e-1c513f9264b3	  I'm having a flashback to the '90s when Elaine Benes from Seinfeld and I were the only ones who hated The English Patient... But I was truly underwhelmed by this movie, maybe because of all the hype? Yes, the period costumes and cinematography are awesome. Yes, Cate Blanchettt could read the ingredients on a tube of toothpaste and I'd think she'd deserve an Oscar. But the writing is terrible and the actors outside of Blanchett just, well, "meh." Partly I think it's because there isn't much to do with any of the characters -- which is different from their playing their roles as intentionally understated. And I didn't feel like there was a bit of chemistry between Blanchett and Mara, so that kind of added to it. Apologies to all those who enjoyed this, but I just wasn't one of them.	0
97ea57bc-64db-4d74-beb5-f2ff3328d5a5	  Mostly just not my kind of film. It starts a week before this couple's 45th anniversary, when he receives a letter stating his girlfriend's body, who fell from a glacier several years before the couple met, had been found. It then proceeds through the events of each day leading up to the anniversary party. Mostly it concentrates on Champling's wife character, and she's by far the bright spot here. I found this rather tedious -- it's 90 minutes felt like two hours -- as I was able to predict most of the story beats. I cannot deny, however, that it is a mostly realistic examination of how such a long marriage would handle that situation. That said, this kind of story just doesn't appeal to me.	1
c0d29377-453c-4e62-95ec-23f65ae9d6a3	  I was intrigued by the rave reviews, so I went to see this. I DO love the soundtrack, but the story? Meh. A lot of work and talent went into this but I left the theater wondering why anyone would put so much effort into a story that leaves viewers -- especially older ones -- feeling insulted, like your life doesn't matter, get over it, you're done. This was a big beige blah bore. The only other good thing (besides the soundtrack) is that as a senior I didn't pay full price.	0
a7b52d40-fb7e-46e1-acbf-0634f7de13c0	  Although I knew the title did not refer to the run-time, I often began questioning that as I wondered how many of these 45 years I sat through so far. To say this film moves at a snail's pace would be an insult to the snail. There is actually a story here that could have been interesting but the film makers found the most boring way to present it. The action took place about 50 years ago and is told by an elderly couple in bed before they fall asleep. Both characters agree that they are sleepy, and so was the audience. There are many long shots of the the elderly people just looking around or waiting. Sure, this could be realistic, but who cares? This is a movie! MOVE! This is the perfect film to watch if you have trouble sleeping.	0
76f3d51e-5932-4b42-b8b8-e1ef84e76805	  As an "older person", my interest in this film was piqued, following a TV appearance from the two lead actors. They were keen to dispel any notions that this movie was stereotypical clich�, when it came to portraying a relationship, between two older people.It may well have achieved that goal but the result was one of the dullest movies I've ever seen.After half an hour, I was fighting back the urge to take a leaf out of the Fast Show book and ask my wife, "Anyone fancy a pint"?I really tried to empathise but all I could see was an insecure, relatively bossy, middle-class wife and a bullied, unfulfilled, dithering husband.At the death, as were asked to consider the tortured, "Where to next?" expression on Ms Rampling's fizzog, all I could think of was "Who cares"?	0
4864dc4b-8ac0-4200-8af9-b91b711c5f3b	  Wow!! Can't quite understand the hoopla about this film. From the beginning, just dialogue that goes no where, to the end, where it ends where we expected it to end all along. Imagine if you lost your keys, and every family member kept repeating, "Where could your keys be? Are they in your pocket? Oh no, I thought I saw them in the basement!!!" Then here comes the climax. You found your keys where you usually keep them!!! Boring dialogue, and the movie is completely filmed at this beach house, with the characters going in and out of the house jibber jabbering, and then onto the beach, and then back in the house, "Oh, where is Elly!!" Wow, come on. This movie sucked.	0

c8e403e3-01ae-4194-a079-2efbee56e8f1	  Retroactively released after the success of A Separation and The Past, About Elly is a simple drama that occurs over one weekend that spirals out of control. A school teacher named Elly is invited to a getaway near a beach, but things quickly escalate when she disappears. Then more secrets and lies get uncovered, and what follows is a tense drama with solid performances. It doesn't have the bite of Farhadi's later movies, but its still a decent watch for a minimalist drama with lots of insight into that culture.	1
5d315e35-d507-4959-9fe0-fdcb7bfa4586	  Watch only if your copy has good English translation. The takeaway is a glimpse of modern Iran: it's both conservative (the sacredness of marriage, unmarried couples don't go on trips together) and the dark side of it (domestic abuse). At the same time, the characters seemed normal, have access to cellphones, women drive cars and seem cheerful and content, at least in the First Act of the film. Unfortunately, we got a poorly translated copy in that one of the characters, visibly very upset, was offered a "sedative" in which the upset character said "toilet". At least, my Baes and I have a new inside joke. ??	1
6c87c068-f767-40ca-8970-946b23fa673b	  Best part of the film: the waves at the beach. Which in a way symbolize the entire story. What I did not like was the end, we never knew if it really was her at the morgue, or what was up with the boyfriend and many other things. Then again, maybe that was the beauty of the film, it kept you guessing and did not give you away its secrets, even in the end.	1
82e3b576-a5fb-43ea-ab19-6fed3b25fa05	  This dreary, tedious collection of cinematic clich�s veers from farce to hysteria without for a second ringing true. Edward Albee and Ingmar Bergman did an infinitely better job of progressively revealing the flaws in the character of their protagonists and their marriages. Jerky hand-held photography scarcely merits the acclaim it has received. The open-ended denouement is another tired cinematic device used to better effect in dozens of films. To be sure a fil-maker working against the odds under a harsh political regime deserves top marks for courage but he deserves better than the complete abandonement of critical scrutiny by admiring reviewers.	0
d64ff866-7ba3-451f-b20e-034ee29632d2	  Some stories are just too simple and pointless to be made into a feature film, and it appears that all of Farhadi's movies follow the same uber realistic trend of mundane stories that try way to hard to be pretentious.He excels at telling what should not be told, and just throwing a whole bunch of little events that establish a lot on their own, but are just utterly boring and pointless when used as part of a bigger picture, so you're bombarded with lots of "reality" scenes about moments that you tend to skip when they take place in your own life, let alone watch in a movie, all building up to a story that you wouldn't remember the second day if it was told to you by a friend.	1
85faed7a-0242-4397-b067-005c3866b356	  Interesting setup, and it gets to harness the duplicity and suspense of humanoid robot stories, but it never explores its full potential and ends up coming down to the very familiar binary question of every other humanoid robot story.Ex Machina presents us with gorgeous special effects and some of the best-looking androids you'll ever see, but also has the indie quality of a low-budget 3-person play whose dialogue isn't going to blow you away. Also, are we supposed to believe that a hyperintelligent guy who loves alcohol and has created his own humanoids HASN'T found a way to prevent hangovers?	1

It feels a little claustrophobic at times considering there are only 4 characters and everything takes place in the same house. The ending also isn't that satisfying. Who is good, who is bad, what happens next? I felt like I was left hanging. But it's worth the price of admission just to see that dance party scene alone.	1
1f70b549-8bc4-4ac7-ad68-4bbe9a7fdb5a	  I enjoyed watching the film. But it was just fine, not remarkable in any way.

The movie certainly plays with this question and does so in an entertaining way. But I didn't come away thinking anything more about the subject and I would like to have done.	1
dc367f08-b88a-4136-9364-6ba174a5fe3b	  I didn't have the privilege to see this film in one sitting. I saw 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there. It was a long journey, but I have completed Ex Machina, and it was good. It's one of those movies that really make you think and takes you on many twists and turns. This is not your average Hollywood Science-Fiction movie. This in my opinion walks the borderline of Hollywood Sci-Fi and Art House Genre Films. It has many surreal elements and very distinct aesthetics. Hard to explain without giving away the plot. A fairly deep and complex movie that will entertain you if you are willing to really pay attention to what's happening on screen.	1

Two times I had to turn down my volume to the horrible noise (not music) that was made in the movie.

It's one of those movies that gets very complex and twisted, and I guess the plot and premise were kinda cool. So I guess I like it. But it was too contrived I suppose. And the ending just sucked. Overall I'd say it was just okay as a robot movie.	1
4c7e035e-2851-4fc6-a847-84520fc1ceed	  Interesting setup, and it gets to harness the duplicity and suspense of humanoid robot stories, but it never explores its full potential and ends up coming down to the very familiar binary question of every other humanoid robot story.Ex Machina presents us with gorgeous special effects and some of the best-looking androids you'll ever see, but also has the indie quality of a low-budget 3-person play whose dialogue isn't going to blow you away. Also, are we supposed to believe that a hyperintelligent guy who loves alcohol and has created his own humanoids HASN'T found a way to prevent hangovers?	1
57be4b35-96ce-41a7-b1c9-fcc5fedd8611	  Science fiction just isn't my genre. Especially in film because I liked this movie. Technically everything was well done but personally it didn't click with me. This is why I'm terrified to watch Star Wars. I'm afraid that like many science fiction movies I'll appreciate it but I won't love it. The acting and the story was great. This movie would be perfect if you love sci-fi (Unlike me).	1
1b96feda-2775-4d8f-8197-6469ac39db50	  An interesting take on A.I. that I'm finding hard to review. It's weird, because I didn't really like any of the characters. Even the protagonist, Caleb, is hard to relate with due to his poor choices, and complete inability to read Nathan. Nathan is hard to get as well. Why would he even invite someone up there at all if he was going to be so suspicious and hard on them? It's an odd dynamic. Ava is well played, but a bit too "sexed up". This is casually explained away by Nathan, but I wonder what the real reason was(aka filmmaker reason: sex sells). I was definitely intrigued all the way to the end.	1
a7461a4d-86d8-4274-99b7-8e7e2a9cb5cc	  I thought this movie was pretty good but also extremely overrated. The special effects are seamless, it is amazing that the girl looks so much like a robot. The acting from the three main leads were great, I was interested in the movie all the way through. I did see the ending coming right away and there is a huge plot hole at the end of the movie that has me scratching my head on why most movie critics did not catch it. Minor spoiler alert, dumbest helicopter pilot ever. I do say watch it but, don't get your hopes up.	1
ecf1e2a9-a8c9-4eac-a4ef-1eeebefca4fd	  I can't fault the actors for the most part in my dislike of this film. They preformed their roles adequately. Don't think I don't understand what is happening in this film either. I am quite familiar with the Turing test. Despite that, I left this movie wishing for my time back and feeling I had seen many too many full frontal shots. I found this movie disturbing and in no way enjoyable.	0
bdc4d92e-47d7-4e83-a1b1-7cebd35fbac8	  Maybe I'm just a bit old and jaded; but I've seen this before. It took me about 10 minutes to know exactly where this film was heading. The female characters had about as much sexual charisma as department store mannequins. And the men had just about as much internal insight. The Stepford Wives ring a bell to anyone. Even manufactured women get fed up with men and want to murder them. Maybe it's new ground for some, but it's the same old story with slightly better special effects.	1
20eca4bb-a844-4704-bb15-b96d35929feb	  Alex Garland writes and directs Ex Machina. An internet mogul has created a brand new AI and wants to determine if will pass the Turing test by having the best coder in his company interact with her. Over the course of a week, the 3 interact with each other in such matters that build suspense and have each character questioning there own values, morals and sense of being. Ex Machina had some great concepts, and has a solid vision, but a part of me wondered if this film had suited better with a different director. Ex Machina is well worth watching, well styled, but some of the plot holes such as the cameras and black outs, and sequences left me wanting some more substance.	1
63ed0ccf-7fe6-48db-8a7d-1b4cac5ac6c8	  Lovely to look at, but for a movie about intelligence, it's pretty dumb.1. The whole thing on sexuality is so retarded, I don't even know where to start, except they should read some Butler and talk to the gender queer community. 2. Power - where does she get her energy, and when her energy system runs out or falls apart - then what? (This is a common criticism with most SciFi, as everyone so often thinks they get energy for free - but that's the dominant mythology in a fossil fuel society)3. Where does he get all the booze and food in such a remote location?There's more - so much more - that is wrong with this movie. Ignore it - don't bother with it - it's just techno porn for the masses.	0
936f5ff1-128d-4f84-a327-d57a3d412bc9	  Exceptionally crafted film that gathers itself slowly arching toward a crescendo. The promise of the premise leans toward enlightenment, but lands solidly in film genre. To be clear, this is a film about smart people, not a film for smart people. Each moment in the well-crafted rise in tension was...expected. Each reveal a scenario imagined within 5 minutes of the film. The dialogue fumbled toward profound but never took hold of it. This film has ambition, is expertly done, but isn't a seminal film. The directorial detail was the real genius here. Garland (the director) is slated to direct Halo, and based on this film, it's a well deserved shot at greatness.	1
c6fff854-ac10-4220-a2a2-f280b7b62c83	  Initial idea was good. Very interesting concept, though it has similar elements to other films about AI and human looking robots. I found it lacking though. Just something didn't click, but visually it was stunning. Acting was decent. Plot had promise but the end result left me unsatisfied, despite the psychological creepiness and dark twist. Some of the characters' actions were at times unbelievable and therefore frustrating. Overall enjoyable but could have been better.	1
c26d0f02-918f-4263-959e-6bbc46884709	  One of the slowest moving flims ever. After watching an hour and 38 minutes, with more than an hour remaining, we turned the movie off. Watching 2 guys say nothing important or plot revealing, and a sexy "robot" girl is a complete waste of time. There is something to do with a "Turing Test" that is point made over and over again, but it is never explained or spoken of other than the mention. Don't know how this got 90+%, but I would discourage anyone from renting this flop.	0
832c9e83-3b6f-467e-9641-f34c4a989c77	  To me, Ex machine is just another film without believable (in this case, even human) female characters of substance. In fact, the only female character is decidedly inhuman and, we find out in the end of the film, manipulative and entirely dependent on her/its sexuality to get her way. In her/its effort all the traditional ployes are used: wide open eyes, innocent "questions", decoration of the body, etc. It's the least innovative story I've ever seen, its been told countless times. This time, she just happens to actually be a robot and not just acting like tone. Bottom line: is this where we are 50 years after the feminist revolution? Geez!	0
b6914a2a-b542-4303-bdad-c913438b439a	  All the elements are here for a potentially great piece of science fiction, and yet when it needs to explode with the full force of all the ideas it's been circling it fizzles because Garland opts for a conventional thriller ending. This wouldn't be so disappointing if he didn't spend the rest of the movie teasing us with so much good material (Oscar Isaac's genius/bro/sociopath Caleb is a wonderfully unique invention). If Garland can ever figure out a third act that matches the rest of what he's written (see 2007's "Sunshine" as well), then he'll truly make something amazing.	1
e4bbc7ef-a2a0-43aa-84b8-602b99930a8c	  About 90 minutes too long. Some good ideas in here but it's something that could have just as easily been covered in one hour, perhaps in a "Black Mirror" or "Twilight Zone" format, but as a 2.5 hr feature it's just too long, and dull, and Gleeson seems to be working alone throughout to fill the screen. Weak supporting cast, little in engaging special effects and uninteresting sets, mar what could have been a novel (if sensationalist) twist on a sci-fi theme that's been done to death.	1
3ed057d7-7805-4a8c-8222-0ee2ef442e88	  Can't really recommend this. The production values were good. Since this is my field a lot of the tech stuff was pretty grating but I early decided to look past that for the entertainment value but that didn't really pan out either due to the stupidity of the plot. Stark contrast between this and another unrelated film seen at the same time (Away from her) which also had high ratings but deservedly so, unlike this slick but formulaic property.	0
a042ef18-7452-4c01-923a-d02410e7fdbe	  This is a film about Americans by non-Americans, and even though the accents are nearly perfect, the stereotypes are fully intact; "profanity is never insulting, and evil Americans are purely evil."Otherwise, its a clever adaptation of a familiar old science-fiction theme; the computer who things it's human and sometimes vice-versa. In the end, you get the feeling it's a film about "them" and not a film about "us."	1
6e02de24-a079-4eea-b4a0-c40020060cd8	  I was going to go on about how this was done before with The Act of Killing but then I see this is a follow-up film by the same bloke. This also shows murderers describing their acts with ignorant pride but this seems to be more of a family issue as he was trying to find the people responsible for killing his brother. I have to say, some of the interviews were a little bit awkward and unnecessary. Unlike the previous film, here, he seems to milking it all a little bit. Still, a good job exposing the horrible things that have gone on and seem to be still a real problem in Indonesia. I still have no urge to go there.	1
d7a64c67-6bb9-4097-83dd-ed0033e39d5f	  An interesting story but that doesn't always make an interesting movie. Slow-moving, inattentive, and insignificant, Bridge of Spies doesn't live up to any of the excitement or intrigue that was promised. I do not wish to imply it was a poorly made movie, it was just very beige. Hanks did what Hanks does. Spielberg did what Spielberg was. It was a decent film but it will quickly be forgotten.	1
a86f2d26-577d-4e17-a948-2250894c34a6	  A cautionary tale: Don't read a book immediately prior to watching the movie. You will be horribly disappointed.The film version of this story was tremendously disjointed, provided no foundation for splurts in the story, such as Frederick Pryor's arrest, how and where Gary Powers was shot down, the history of Abel, the Russian spy, and the entirety of the cold war scenario in Germany, especially the building of the wall.This time in US history was vastly terrifying, particularly to the young who lived through it (me). The movie does not immerse the viewer in any contiguous tale or impart any true historical context. It focuses on Attorney James Donovan, who is only a piece of a vastly complex story. Spielberg and the Coens did a horrible job.	0
ba3ff80f-df67-4b9b-ab9e-adca443f534c	  The film's imagined 1950s is a conservative's wet dream. In the US, Stepford wives fawn over their hero husbands, and no black people cross the screen. In the Soviet bloc, state officials and soldiers are callous or duplicitous; torture is wantonly practiced; and all colors appear to have been expropriated from the screen, leaving the Soviets portrayed only in shades of grey.Shades of grey are likewise absent in the politics of Bridge of Spies. It is liberal agitprop, reenacting the pivotal manoeuvre of Cold War liberalism: train the spotlight on one's staunch and self-righteous support for liberal values while accommodating conservative forces and conjuring up humanitarian reasons for expanding Washington's imperial clout.	0
c0b635ed-de15-47bd-be11-040c66e43855	  Here is a film that promises much, but for me, is a little thin on the delivery. I found this movie to be disappointingly formulaic and very predictable. There was little real suspense within the plot, which seemed disappointing since that was its main marketing point. Tom Hanks was the all American Hero, which we have seen a number of times before. However, for me, the film was rescued by Mark Rylance who squeezed every last drop of humour from his role with classic understatement. A more unlikely spy you could hardly wish to find. His appearances in the film are completely believable.	1
9a37d753-2606-424e-ad2a-7023f3d3513b	  Much better than War Horse eheh. :X seriously, I think Spielberg just fell of the entire pedestal for me when I gained political conscience. As a film, it's as "well constructed" as it can be, I won't mind Rylance winning the Oscar, but ugh... hated the final minutes.While I can still see the same guy that made two of the defining masterpieces of the last decade back to back (A.I., Minority Report) - who can film that place crash with such intensity nowadays? - I now see the lack of greys in his work. :(	1
23c3fe50-9e53-407f-8c58-da505bb4f64a	  The new Spielberg film is exactly what you would expect from the master of family entertainment. A classic film, well shot and photographed. The cast is fine though Mark Rylance is definitely the stand out in this political thriller. Tom Hanks is likable as always and does the job. Now i found the film fair and square that's unquestionable. Spielberg does know how to shoot a movie but somehow the film unraveled without any surprises or deep suspense. Some of the scenes were over the top and quite cliches but overall the film had its moments. The soundtrack was also very plain and unsurprising... a more tensed score would have maybe lifted a little bit the movie towards something more Hitchcock-ian. It's a well made film without much surprises but it will appeal to a broad audience.	1
8de4ff33-6702-43f0-b279-c25f54de87f6	  Enjoyable enough, though about 30 minutes too long, and crippled by Spielberg's pathological inability to trust the audience to figure anything out on their own. To wit, the tacked-on ending, a specialty. Really, the same people are on the train and just have to give him a sickly smile? The best part is Rylance, a treasure. And the production design and other technical credits, all flawless as we have learned to expect from Mr. S. Hanks, gunning for the Jimmy Stewart lifetime achievement award, is a bit too perfect to buy. Even if it's true in real life.	1
7b5b82b2-adfd-4f60-b5d2-84ea3d37b9a3	  "Bridge of Spies" is boring, un compelling, and doesn't deserve the review it got. Going into his movie, I thought it would be better because it got a 92% critics review, 90% audience review, and because it was a Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg film. About 90% of this film were conversations between Tom Hanks' character and another character. There were only about 10 minutes of action, which were all presented in the trailer. This movie is not worth seeing.	1
4fa84848-9110-4631-8a1f-c0e7a0694c1a	  Coming from Steven Spielberg, it should not be much of a surprise the film is told through a liberal/left-wing prism. For other films it might work fine but for grey spy film of this stature, it makes things kinda ham-fisted. Of course, the basic rule of watching a film is to enjoy it as it is! Not how it should be. In that sense, it is a good thriller with exceptional cinematography and art direction.	1
73caacd1-47d6-456d-9ab5-570fd0172b95	  A decent movie, but it really bogs down in the section on Donovan's negotiations in East Germany. Also, so much corny tear-jerkiness and patriotic mistiness. Yeah Spielberg, we get that East Germany was a failed and brutal state. Did you really have to rub it in by having Donovan witness people actually being shot while trying to climb the wall? I doubt Donovan did witness that. It seems too perfect to be true. Did you really have to include those scenes of people reading the newspaper in the train? Or the kids climbing the fence? You made a lump swell in my throat, and now I feel like I've been used by cheap seducer.	1
befa8c44-801f-4806-adfa-1f9cb57bbe6c	  To be honest I am disappointed with Spileberg , It's not an issue with the screenplay or acting. In fact both of them were spectacular and they had to be after all we had Coen brothers and Hanks backing it. However , what causes the disappointment is soporific tone of story-telling. The perspectives that Spielberg wanted to portray are fragile and not convincing enough to captivate the audience. What stood out was the portrayal of Donovan's character in upholding the values of justice despite a contraindicating public opinions and pressure from highly powerful authorities. But that seemed to be the single most motive of that movie. That seemed to narrow as a scope , the Berlin wall incident and the Russian Spying incident felt like appendices to the long drawn legal and diplomatic battle. Also the facts were pretty misleading and differ from reality.	1
27f3f7b5-5b62-478a-9b70-1a82dc85d495	  Tom Hanks is clearly one of the top actors out there these days, and he shows it again here in the Steven Spielberg film Bridge of Spies. I wouldn't classify this as a great film whatsoever, but I enjoyed it. I mean I was hoping for a little more suspense and intrigue, but this one is laid out in a straight-forward manner. The good here is certainly the acting, set pieces are top notch and really the relationship between Hanks and his the spy he is defending Mark Rylance. What this isn't is a tense thriller but more of a relationship drama and a story of a guy who won't let his morals be compromised. Not one of the great Spielberg works, but certainly a good movie.	1
b06b3ab7-c8b8-479f-8326-a40912c07715	  Upon exiting from the well-crafted but bloodless film, the one word that came to mind was "underwhelming". Tom Hanks was solid ... but he's always solid. For a film about a tremendously intriguing and significant historic event, this film had almost no intrigue. Every character seemed to have an emotional range that ran the gamut from A to B, as they old saying goes. I wanted this movie to be fascinating, engaging and a bit messy, as I imagine the even was. Instead it was clinical, low-key and overly sober.	1
896547b5-a255-43b8-a684-1b064d31325d	  Good film, brilliantly acted by Tom Hanks, and masterly produced pulling the various storylines together. For seniors, this will bring back the old memories of the U2 flights and Gary Powers being shot down, and the spy trials of the period. There is a low level tension throughout the film, but it is just way too long and you can't wait for it to be over. For people who can't spend this much time at the theater, you can enjoy it just fine on DVD. But you'll definitely want to see it.	1
0840880a-4bd2-47ab-832e-27091bab9816	  There are a lot of good things with Spielberg's latest which, technically speaking, might be his most accomplished film since Minority Report. That's why it saddens me to observe that Bridge of Spies is, nonetheless, hypocritical and patriotic entertainment that never really enlightens or lives up to the message it tries to uphold. Skating in the thinness of its message - which intends to be of duality and reasonable thought-process-, the movie is quick to remind Americans of the constitution and even quicker to showcase Russians and East Berliners as evil figures and a threat to the American way of life. Considering the potential depth and impact of such story to the unification of beliefs, Bridge of Spies feels like a missed opportunity.	1
bef416e2-31d5-4fb9-b014-a959234c324a	  The film fails to surprise and feels too safe and a story already told. Better. Mark Rylance is brilliant and will probably win some awards though. Tom Hanks is doing a terrific Tom Hanks and Amy Ryan has rarely been as underused as here. I saved the best for last: The music hasn't been composed by John Williams and my ears will be forever grateful. Final verdict: Solid but no passion there.	1
a20a70aa-e290-4787-ae7f-b3518b51f7c8	  Bridge of Spies is a flat, anemic telling of the Gary Powers spy swap of the early 60's. The narrative has few dramatic points, and relies too much on Spielberg's rose-colored historical gaze, from dining room scenes to ridiculous over-the-head symbolic moments. No time is given to the political issues that surrounded the development of the U-2 spy plane program, and little is learned about "Rudolf Abel," the Soviet spy in the swap. The negotiations have little dramatic substance; apart from Power's plane being hit, there is almost no dynamic range to this film, save some witty quips offered by the Coen brothers. A sleepy, thin story that would better serve as a tv movie.	0
2fce7542-e4a7-443c-a595-0cf8a03e4554	  I'm swimming against conventional wisdom on this one, but I found this work to be disappointing, mainly because it's a great idea spoiled by too much star power, schmaltzy over-appeals, and overwhelming CGI. The appeal was the Francis Gary Powers story, which was overwhelmed. Hanks does his normal clipped deliver, and is Tom Hanks, not his character - could have been Forrest Gump in a suit. All the acting appeared stylized. This one will get some nominations, but for me, was a disappointment.	1
d6b41e33-287f-4792-bd4a-81f08e34e4ca	  I figured with this movie being released in October, being about the Soviet Union, being inspired by true events, and with this movie having Tom Hanks, I would think this has academy award nominee written all over it. I can tell you that this movie does have an interesting story, and the cast was pretty good. I do think that this movie went on a little long though. All in all, in my opinion, this is a pretty good movie, but I do not see it as one of the best movies of the year.	1
2c398353-a4a2-47ed-afa2-6dda9888140d	  It's hard to rate a Spielberg movie. Do I fault it for its unabashed sentimentality? Or, do I praise it? Bridge Of Spies is a neat and tidy movie. There's nothing sloppy about it. In fact, it looks great! But there's no real intensity to it...no momentum. And you never get the feeling things are going to turn out bad. BoS gives you what you usually get from a Spielberg movie: reassurance.	1
3c6d5573-7fa4-4c3c-823f-58482c60396d	  It does not surprise me that this film has received very high ratings. It was a good movie. Solid Spielberg and Hanks effort. The problem I had with it was how glaringly "left" the movie was, which again, coming from Spielberg doesn't surprise me. The movie is very sympathetic to a Soviet spy who was in this country stealing classified information for the Soviets. Spielberg wants us to down right like this character. This plays well in today's society but it loses its base on reality when taken out of context which is the time the activities occurred. There was during the Cold War, and still is for me, a line between providing a competent defense under the Constitution for an agent from a nation who's interests were hostile regarding our nation, and befriending the same.	1
c0d082d2-ea0a-437f-abbe-a9ffab9d51b7	  What I got to say about "Bridge of Spies" is a true story that is so riveting movie. The performances by the whole cast is good. "Tom Hanks is at his very best." The directing by Steven Spielberg is good. "Mr. Spielberg's vision for this movie is a knockout." The screenplay by Matt Charman and the Coen brothers is good. The cinematography is fine but I have to say that there is some shaky cam in some parts but other then that it's fine. The score in this movie I personally love the score so much. Finally, the effects are fine. "I have to report that "Bridge of Spies" is a movie that finds new life in Hollywood's classic Cold War espionage thriller."	1
8181bf9a-0163-40cf-abfd-553a05d309f6	  A great slice of life film that chooses to see the humor in what could have been a much more depressing film. However, that jovial spirit took away from the characters, teetering towards tired stereotypes a little too often for my taste. I think I would have preferred some more honesty throughout the entire film, instead of just at the end. That said, I loved Alexandra, she was really the best character in the film.Also- It's impressive that this was shot on iPhones but I found the camera work to be inconsistent, especially towards the beginning.	1
51d89a05-7ef7-402c-a497-93d684699ddd	  I have to admit, I just don't see what all the hype is over this film...I totally agree with another critic's partial assessment of the movie (and I am taking this direct quote because I could not have said it better:"...the film's colors are as electric as the characters' emotions, the setups and framing are fairly conventional..." The pretty much sums it up: conventional. You basically have a very vibrant looking film, a great aesthetic, and some very good acting; but the story is extremely basic and, well, just not that interesting. Take away the whole cross-dressing, transgender element and you simply have another overrated "mumblecore" piece that plays out like an extended tv sitcom episode.	0

649be486-d8f3-43ef-bfd5-3de21a558a0f	  It's funny how a film lauded by so many can be a complete miss for others. I have read and heard so many people commenting on how excellent the acting was, but I found everyone aside from Mya Taylor to be uninspiring. It should mean more than to just have people say words on screen to be considered great acting, hence why we don't parade Tara Reid and Adam Sandler around as the cream of the crop. Between the gimmick of shooting on an iPhone, which didn't add to the film experience in anyway, to the overall lack of quality in the edit, story, and acting, this film is tailored for the "festival crowd" who will always seek the oddities in art and herald them as masterpieces.	0
05db3fa8-8bc0-4f3a-89f9-7becee8a4855	  I made it through about 20 minutes of this film before I had to turn it off. It may be a unique film, but I found it annoying, grating and pointless. Maybe it is because I lived in these parts of LA and have known a lot of people like this - I'm not real fond of the attitudes, language, style & speech patterns. I'm not sure why so many critics found it so wonderful.	0
862d61ca-1417-497f-b2d0-b172aadfe4d1	  Tangerine had the potential to be the most refreshing holiday film in years - a gonzo Christmas film fit for the least spirited. However, the film's relentless energy and pacing is thrown off by the visual style. The ridiculously fast shutter speed and burning color palette make for a bizarre, borderline nauseating experience, like a ninety-minute Instagram video, shot in CinemaScope, with three filters on it. The film was shot on an iPhone, so it might have been just that.	1
137fd90c-a634-4358-9f71-a0cf34d46d6e	  LA's bright skies mask something much darker this holiday season: Angry prostitutes, an unfaithful Armenian taxi driver, drug usage, and plenty of bodily fluids. Director Sean Baker and plenty of critics would have you think that "Tangerine" is some form of high art, but the disgusting acts on display here don't look any prettier through a glittery lens, in front of giant murals, under LA's beautiful sunset, or with classical music playing over it. Would it be bad if I said that, within the first half-hour, I thought this was the next outrageous Larry Charles social commentary starring Sacha Baron Cohen with an ironic underlying message about friendship? That aside, there's nothing special to see here.	1

cf61d585-90df-4a12-94f7-116e266dfdae	  "Tangerine," proves that anyone with an iPhone can be Steven Spielberg. The entire movie was shot on an iPhone 5. Strictly for adults. Watch it once then do the "Three B's." Burn it, bury it or blow it up. Stars no one you'll know, but that OK, but that's OK, as the real star is the story and the way it is told and filmed. If you want to take a walk on the wild side, venture outside the box, check out this VERY adult adventure. Filmed on the seedy streets that I travel everyday.	1
ac6d01ed-4993-433c-af8a-fd43dab4e6ef	  If you?ve ever fantasized about shooting a full-length movie with your iPhone, you should check out ?Tangerine.? Director/editor/co-cinematographer/co-writer Sean Baker?s movie about transsexual working girls on the deserted sidewalks of Hollywood was considered good enough to be featured at Sundance. It?s Christmas eve at Donut Time, but for Sindee (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) and her friend Alexandra (Myra Taylor), it?s just another night, until Alex lets slip that her pimp boyfriend cheated on her while she was briefly behind bars. But not just with anyone: with a white female sex worker. Furious to find this woman, she goes on a rampage, taking us on a tour of her marginalized world. Meanwhile we follow an Armenian cab driver as he juggles to keep his sordid secrets from his old-country family. His worst nightmare is realized in a hilarious denouement at Donut Time.	1

It's quite mediocre and predictable for most of the part. The shock value, which I feel inevitable for such movie, was negligible. The twists are meaningless as they're pretty predictable to be a twist in its real sense, thereby adding to the dissatisfaction. But since the stories, excluding the last one, weren't a drag and overall it was about average (having okay performances, not extremely boring, etc.), I decided to give it such a fine rating.	0

9d5a808e-8441-4fc5-94fa-96bbce15fc32	  There are some crazy moments in this Spanish language film, that would be too bonkers in any other language. It's basically a series of six shorts (some longer than others) - the road rage episode is by far and away this best, and the opening plane crash film feels eerily uncomfortable in the light of the German Wings crash. Personally, I would have enjoyed a bit of plot invention that connected the episodes, either through cross over characters or references, to give the whole thing a bit more cohesion - having said that, it's still perfectly wicked at times.	1
7148c3d3-7553-4f48-9eb9-a34a83a82095	  Wild Tales has been called both "fun" and "funny," but it's neither of those things. It's a gnarly Argentine anthology film whose unconnected chapters straddle the line between black comedy and gruesome soap opera; it may appeal to those who found humor in Gone Girl or the Saw movies. Black comedies always run the risk of being too black to be comical, and I'd say director and writer Dami�n Szifron is trying to find humor in things that aren't humorous, but his presence is apathetic and his writing is lazy...so is he even trying? Wild Tales is too focused on wallowing in its own awfulness to crack very many jokes, and when it does, they never register above cheap cynicism.	0
ab3f3135-9dd9-4ca3-ac3f-dbe6eee96fbb	  Seen as the debut feature that it is, it shows great promise from witer/director and star Desiree Akhavan. The witty one liners are there, the deadpan comedic timing is pretty decent but when the movie tries to dig deeper it sort of fails. Not that there's nothing interesting there, it's just that the really insightful snippets are buried under layers of aimless soulsearching that drag down the pace to a near standstill. Akhavan has some darlings she needs to kill, but she's going in the right direction.	1
51194977-bb3a-4c65-9b9d-56f018de2fe6	  This was the worst movie i've seen in a long time. It had no plot was about nothing. I can best describe it as being in the mind of a schizophrenic who was on acid and dreaming. However it was not about schizophrenia. It was a voyage of a woman, who lost her dog, had a bad childhood and was paranoid big brother was watching her. Sums it in a nutshell, thats all I could get out of it.	0

The ensemble cast is fine, but the script comes across as episodic and meandering, never quite coming together as a compelling, effective cohesive whole. The shifts in tone from humorous to serious seem a bit extreme at times as well. To be sure, I'm genuinely at a loss to understand all the attention being paid to this film in a year that saw many other -- and better -- foreign language releases.	1

After moving back to his hometown with his wife, Simon Callum's past comes back to haunt him when a former classmate from high school attempts to befriend him. Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, and Joel Edgerton lead the cast and give solid performances. But the pacing is rather slow, and the dark history between the characters is drawn out so long that it kind of loses some of its intrigue.

ad7e7082-4290-4fed-a364-8a5f53bd8bdb	  I watched this because of the great reviews but my wife and I were both confused at the end as to why it garnished such amazing reviews from critics. It's a good movie it's just not a 93% movie. The plot line is a little too "wacky" once it unfolds and if you're into faced paced action flicks you might be dozing off midway through. I wouldn't watch it again but I might recommend it to people who I know enjoy trillers, action people not so much.	1
23252ffb-e3df-4df5-85d2-f15655d78b15	  Hackneyed, but surprisingly above-average in parts. But then it all falls apart with a bobbled ending. One of those movies that after it you just feel frustrated, and dumb people are like "GOOD, THATS WHAT THE MOVIE WANTED YOU TO FEEL" and its like fuck you dude, that's not what I mean, it's just an ending that takes a really careful paintbrush to be able to pull off, and it wasn't pulled off.	0
3602fedb-5964-432a-b69c-660daeeea6dc	  Character actor Joel Edgerton (who I've seen in things over the years but this is the first I've learned his name), wrote, directed and co-stars in this thriller starring Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall. It's about an up and coming couple starting fresh in a new city (the husband's hometown) when he get a promotion and is looking to move up the ladder. But their life is slowly turned upside down when a old high school acquaintance comes back into the husband's life. It seems simple and a little creepy at first, but it takes a turn when you realize there is more to the history of these two characters than it initially seems. It's a nice slow burn thriller with a good cast. It isn't anything special, but it was entertaining for the most part.	1
d7ec4c0e-5044-46fe-a348-acc616a2720e	  Worth watching, but quite easy to figure out the greatest conceit. When it was sold as a big surprise, my wife and I looked at each other, having verbalized it a half-hour or more before. There are some silly plot holes about protagonist "security experts", glass houses and the lack of home security systems. I immediately came up with several things they could have done to fix these issues and elevate the screenplay, but alas, they did not. In the end, it was predictable, decent and somewhat entertaining.	1
a66df4fc-238c-497e-94c3-b7d56e9b47d9	  This movie (which for all you Mayfield Class of '97 folks could be subtitled "The Ballad of Paul Munson") has its moments but if you've seen as many movies as I have you'll see the "twist" coming a mile away. The ageless Jason Bateman is the best part of this movie as I still can't decide if I like Joel Edgerton or not. He was great in "Warrior" and is a spitting image of a young Kurt Russell but he stunk in "Exodus" and was just so-so here as a creepy stalker. Plus that chicks with short hair just don't do it for me. Temper your expectations with this one friends despite the 93% on RT.	1
38a30123-77e4-4a17-91e4-1853609aa03d	  Overly rated & hyped. But gets a passing grade. Took a while for it to get to the crux. A crucial one - the effects of "bullying" can last a Lifetime. So it's not just something that happens to people when they were kids / teens - it also keeps-on happening. And a lot of times, "it's too late" to try and fix it, the damage has been done. Unfortunately, the effects are very serious. Technically, bullying should be a CRIME, punishable by Law. The moral of the movie gets an A+, the movie itself gets a B- grade.	1
103b1d16-49b5-4bab-88fe-d39726c07487	  This has acceptable basic sentiments against bullying. Opening on the real estate theme, It is guaranteed an audience among those about whom it is talking - the ambitious, white middle class. It continues stylishly, with plenty to observe in fashion and decorating choices. The characters, good and bad, are all clean, fit-looking, well dressed and softly spoken. The script, direction and editing are rather slow and clunky, but not fatally so. It would have got an extra star except that films should not depict animal cruelty, because it is not possible to tell whether it was faked or not.	0
2601b837-2bd3-400b-b394-f56cc5d2a5f7	  The gift was terribly boring with a few cheap jump scares. Nothing special, has an un-unique story about bullying and how "what goes around comes around". Everything was so predictable to the point where me and my husband made a game out of it. Something would happen and we would lean in and whisper to each other exactly what was revealed in the ending. Yes, weirdo Gordo was creepy, and not at all a nice fellow, but Simon was worse. Nothing but a bland "bullied gets revenge on his bully" story. I don't understand how this has such a high rating	0
a813e0e3-b855-4ff0-ac68-373ad08b443b	  The Gift is a pretty decent thriller that for a reason I can't quite put my finger on never quite got to that next level. Even when playing a mostly nice guy in Arrested Development, Jason Bateman always came across as being a little bit smug. This quality makes him perfectly cast as husband 'Simon'. The reveal of the secret from the past makes a lot of sense from a storytelling perspective, which is a lot more than many thrillers of this type can say.	1
96e04e4e-9da3-402e-bece-c95127cf138e	  I remember when I saw Alan Alda play the bad guy as a psychiatrist - it was tough to watch as he was so beloved to me. He acted the part, though. I think The Gift did not give me enough of the psyche of "evil" that I was looking for. Good movie, but all main characters were not as developed as they could have been. Otherwise, quite predictable from the previews.	1
579e84c7-0f0b-4b3f-850a-832a3236617f	  The acting was on point, the sets were both beautiful and eerie, the dialogue and build-up was interesting - so I can't, for the life of me, understand what about this movie was so damn forgettable. I will admit, it kept me on the edge of my seat while I was watching it, but left my thoughts pretty much instantly after I walked out of the movie theater. Got my hopes up high due to the hype, and was most definitely let down.	1
37ec8bf0-117f-4ab5-ac42-2920fb8ad8f1	  The Gift. The title should be renamed to the Gift I need to return. Way to slow in setting up the plot. Boring dialogue to get you interested. Characters were claimed up and pushed and pushed for answers. I called the ending at the midpoint of the movie. The actors were believable but predictable. Justin Bateman played the save stereotyped character he always played. Truly and sleeper. And the Ending, well lets put it this way, a test can prove the movie out. Really not worth the popcorn I purchased nor is it worth a seeing again.	0
8b3632f6-8ff4-436a-a14f-810e0ed32606	  93% really? Did we see the same movie? It had the obligatory 2 jump out of your seat scares andd creepy stalker but then maybe the creepy guy had a good reason for being creepy but he stays creepy and then gets super creepy, The resolution is what you would expect but the ending leaves you hanging and just feeling like you need a shower. I liked Jason Bateman. Rebecca Hall was probably the best of all.	0
ebdf3673-7f54-497c-afbf-324743b3ade8	  I saw the movie today. I didn't enjoy it at all. In fact, I walked out of the movie theater feeling like I need to watch another movie just to get gunk left over by this one out of my brain. The plot was very silly. Everyone was hysterical. The only good thing was the acting. Jason Batesman did a superb job. if you watch movies to be entertained, skip this one!	0
a96884a7-a1ac-4127-af32-a6e6b8f5d8bf	  Basically, I spent the entire movie thinking, "Wow, this is really slow moving, but I'm sure once things start to happen it'll be amazing!" Turns out things never started happening. Or rather, they did, and then every time a plot started to develop, it would get dropped and move on to something new, only to repeat the process. There's no resolution. The only character who's even remotely likable is the wife, and that's not saying much, so there's not really anyone to root for. There's no background info and really no reason for the things that are happening, and the ending is completely unsatisfying. It had great potential, but it felt like everyone involved just didn't care.	0
3c92e5a3-9279-481a-9e53-ff94cd6cff97	  I don't even understand how anyone can think this movie is anything other than derivative, disjointed, gratuitous, and inauthentic. Even actors of this caliber cannot rise above this script. So many other movies have done this type of story better. I am SHOCKED at how well it's doing on rotten tomatoes. Had I not been with a friend (who I later learned felt the same way), I would have gone home to read a book.	0
512e78a6-140e-41e1-9f83-0e62f0d1014d	  This is not a good movie. One of those rare movies where I wonder what the critics were thinking. I read the user review that said it's not for soccer moms. I'm not a soccer mom. I thought it would be quirky like Juno. If you think this is going to be like Juno, do not watch it. This girls is not quirky and sweet or relatable in any way.	0
161f176a-5552-4a7e-a9c8-8db7debee763	  This film is heavy-handed with uninspired direction. At first the movie appears float along guileless, no doubt trying to imitate the poignant tone of earlier breakout international indie films like After the Wedding or Grbavica. It ends up simply beating you over the head with its premise in every exchange after minute 30.Furthermore, I don't know what was more annoying: the main actress' over-acting or the under-acting from almost everyone else (with the exception of the mom and the main character's co-worker).Brazil has had and will have many better, more original movies than this so save yourself an hour and 48 minutes and skip it.	0

17e77da0-cda5-4b7f-adc0-414b242ce609	  This film reminded me of 1950's "brainwashing" movies, complete with the creepy music and dark shadows. Only it's 60 years later and those theories have been totally debunked. Clearly, Gibney (and I presume Wright) haven't read the literature discrediting those theories. For Gibney, supposedly a sophisticated, intelligent filmmaker, to foist such a one-sided piece of propaganda off on us is unforgivable. Those attending a Gibney film have a right to expect we will be treated as informed, sophisticated participants in the film experience, not condescended to with pre-packaged views about which he provides too little actual information for us to make up our own minds.	0
c9d2caa1-beed-4e46-ba1b-746db3d5debb	  As entertainment this is a good film. But don't look here for enlightenment as it is scripted so the viewer blames greedy bankers and capitalism instead of the true perpetrators Congress, Bush and Obama. The comparisons to the great depression are out of a liberal arts major's wet dream. Both collapses occurred because of bad government. Here, the actual reasons for the debacle are never exposed. It also warns you not to blame immigrants despite the flood of foreign labor since 2001 putting 20 million middle class Americans out of work (thus the housing crisis) and giving every new job to foreigners at much lower wages.	0
59e6ccc3-3e72-4c1a-bd7f-79aa596ffd0e	  Last year we had Steve Carell wear a funny nose and this year he's a wearing a strange wig in the most convoluted film you'll see this year. You'll need a degree in Economics to understand it. Seriously the performances are all very good but as soon as I came out of the screening all I could hear were people saying, "I was good but I didn't understand it." And that's where the movie fails and it's 2 hour and 10 minute run time felt like a good 3 hours. The Big Short? You'll be wishing it was Cut Short.	0
8b1fc425-1bdd-43f3-aa1e-2407071ba373	  Quite inaccurate on the consumer lending side, but then most bankers on the investment side wouldn't give a crap anyway. It was NOT a misunderstanding about Adjustable Rate Mortgages that started it all, but it was a misunderstanding about the loan structures. One of these days investment bankers may figure out what they didn't know. Since they're all so smart. Anyway, if I were going to make a big large, splashy statement movie like this, I'd at least try to get the facts straight.	0
663ae723-c66a-4ca8-9dec-9a91ce8fb56e	  Though well made and acted, "The Big Short" is an extremely bias film, focusing primarily on the concept that large banks are evil corporations.. The film maker did not mention the substantial easing of requirements of "sub-prime" loans of "Fannie Mae" in '99 to those who could not qualify for such loans, nor the false statements by Barney Frank on the stability of FNMA until the crash of '08. Additionally, the elimination of the Glass-Steagall Act the same year was never mentioned; though, this elimination would not have caused the collapse without the substantial easing of sub-prime market. Add the full truth that corporations and Congress are in bed together, and this is a 3 1/2 star movie/documentary.	0
d7a6a383-e4ba-4a80-b12e-7468b413ed34	  A much needed film that would have benefited so much more without relying on celebrity cameos, aka Selena Gomez, to explain to us the complicated financial matters in this country. The film has the right ideas for a good satire, but it didn't really go anywhere other than questionable editing that induced a severe migraine and felt like one big credit card commercials with A-listers endorsing it (with the exception of Steven Carell's performance).	0
7143f127-a09c-4b0f-b9ec-3d99524f67b7	  I truly disliked this movie. They tried to pass it off as a documentary-type movie with actors playing real people most of us have never heard of. It was mostly about mortgage-backed securities and CDOs and how some people saw a collapse of the economy as a result of sub-primed mortgages being packaged with AAA mortgages and sold as bonds. Only in the very end of the movie did they address the bank bailouts after Bears Stearns and Lehman Bros, AIG collapsed.	0
62dcbd73-9f92-4d40-81b0-f7e6d7474055	  Saw it this evening. I did not see humor. Not a comedy to me.Saw what I think is banks revealed.Use or get other people's money to make money.Lots of gambling.Looks like it is a game of numbers and if you are in control of numbers you can do anything with numbers.Banks were bailed out and it looked like problem was not fixed.It is just a game of numbers.Movie was okay, but can't rate highly.I guess I know few banking terms now, so I got a few take aways.	0
b6cfa68d-ae7c-4138-83f5-4b152a84db8d	  I had to leave a quarter of the way through it because every scene bounced around until I finally became motion sick and had to get out of there. Every few scenes, it blared hard rock or rap, which was annoying. And if that wasn't bad enough, every few scenes besides that, it showed vulgarity and was extremely sexist and crude toward young women. It was boring and self important, and I've seen many documentaries on this subject that were much more entertaining than this Hollywood made movie. I doubt I'll ever rent it to watch the rest of it.	0
589e3d21-dbf4-431a-8048-6f08d78ab267	  Throughout the film I was reminded of how I already watched Wolf of Wall Street. Throughout Wolf of Wall Street, I was reminded of how I already watched Goodfellas. Throughout Goodfellas, I was happy. There seems to be a problem. But, unlike Wolf of Wall Street or Goodfellas, this had a soundtrack consisting of all-time great rock artists like Metallica, Pantera, Guns N' Roses and Led Zeppelin. Also fuck you.	0
f4a48976-ae07-499d-910f-18e9fc7ca344	  What a bunch of horsecrap. No mention of Fanny and Freddie's gigantic enabling role in backing these loans. No mention of any of the politicians who sold the subprime concept. They try to spin critics as 'anti immigrant', blame Greenspan who spoke before congress warning of the subprime bubble but was IGNORED. Don't waste your money. Critic's rating here fall in at 99% on my personal "Rottentomatoes Lie Index (RLI)" You know something is truly rotten in tomato land when everything by Michael Moore gets 98%.	0
3d744753-c3f8-439b-a96c-b7515e4f0106	  An inter-generational movie about a quest to abort a child, grandchild and great-grandchild. Lets all bond and get closer through abortion... I wouldn't doubt it if Planned Parenthood financed most of this. You mix in some LGBT theme and of course it's catnip for the critics that are employed by left-wing media outlets. It's as bad as having Christian ministers critiquing Passion of the Christ. I'll give it one star for Lily Tomlin. Next, a story about inner city kids bonding through dog fighting.	0

In a scene that sets out to be more prophetic than it actually is, our titular character, played by Lily Tomlin, claims that hatred and ignorance is the way the world errs most. But hatred is what fuels Tomlin-she rips on everyone who does not fall into her mold, that of the new wave. It's a tireless effort that is boosted by the supporting cast rather than in-your-face leads. Recent films like Me and Earl and the Dying Girl do this "small landscape" genre right, while Grandma relies more on propaganda and clich�s than structure.	0

e2f3fff9-f80d-4276-ae02-8bae1dc9676f	  Sorely disappointed given the cast and the framing of the movie in the trailer. This is much more of a drama than a comedy, with a lot of character development centered around Grandma. There seemed to be a lot of untapped potential for the actors whose characters I felt were flat so that I wasn't drawn in enough to care about what happened to them. The screen writing I felt lacked punch and the directing seemed canned, like he wanted you to know it was acting, not real.	0
d81bad7c-e705-410a-a74e-eba26d0cd6a3	  I so wanted to like this for Lily but I hated it. I kept waiting for it to redeem itself & make it worth sitting thru but I felt dirty & depressed & very unhappy with her for taking such a role in such a rotten tomato movie. I have no idea how people are rating this so high. My friend felt exactly like I did. I liked her car. I laughed about twice. I felt ashamed of the language used in front of that poor granddaughter who was subjected to both women. I think it set back right to choose a million miles with disgusting remarks. I just really hated this movie. Awful. Sorry Lily - don't know what anyone was thinking or trying to say in this monster.	0
6902f6f2-596c-42f1-87c5-5a18a4cffa06	  Talk about a waste of good talent and a huge disappointment! DO writers in Hollywood think that all aging feminists are nothing but angry nasty old women? LIly Tomlin's character is just plain unlikeable...similar to BIll Murray's character in St Voncent...just plain nasty. ALl of the trailers lesad you to think that it's a comedy...well, if she weren't so vitriolic and mean there may have been humor....but there just wasn't. And I found NO chemistry between grandma and granddaughter. So throw in the fact that many of you will dislike the preaching about abortion and lesbianism and the older woman/younger woman relationship and you've simply got a hot mess. And that is not easy to accomplish with such a stellar cast.	0
97eb70e8-6dae-4165-b855-20886a82df99	  The trailer made me groan but then those glowing reviews! GRANDMA is like an annoying person you don't want to be around. But worst of all is just how utterly contrived and typical it is. OK, it's better than the really crappy trailer, and thank god it's only 75 minutes long. Even Tomlin is nothing special. In fact, she's actually better in the truly dreadful FRANKIE & GRACE. So she may be on a roll but a roll down Niagara Falls is still the end of your life. Yikes. You can skip GRANDMA. Really no reason to see it. Small thing, please let me age like Sam Elliott.	0
1a652bbf-7bb6-4564-a974-c50038ec40d7	  Seriously????? The only thing right w/this full-of-itself "movie" was that it was SHORT. Part porn (I guess the fact that it's "animated" gave it license to get away w/doing things that would have merited an "X" rating if real humans were involved)- and the balance just a HUGE YAWN. One of those movies you hope will have SOME KIND of point, but never does. A serious contender for the WORST piece of cinematic garbage I have ever seen. Don't waste your TIME or MONEY.	0

d54602d4-3dfd-4515-9ab4-0ab941304587	  Not brilliant, I say. It is the sort of movie for which an entirely misleading trailer, which makes everyone want to see it, is devised from out-of-context shots and scraps of dialog. Similar, that is, to many other mediocre films.Then critics hype it to heaven and no one feels comfortable criticizing it. Promising start, then hard to say what it all means after the first third or so. What I learned was: A) those puppets ARE cute as hell; B) especially when they're having sex; C) also, like their human counterparts, middle-aged male puppets easily fall for damaged self-deprecating younger female puppets, then may treat them poorly because?? -- not addressed; and 4) fabulously clever artwork doesn't make a story. Felt almost nothing, but yep, cast was ADORABLE!	0
57819cc6-d563-42af-9ad0-a0001624098c	  Nice visuals. Worst Kaufman script, ever. Makes fun of stale, redundant conversations...meant to be ironic...but, the irony is in how boring that makes the film. All we need to do is pay close attention in real life to experience the drivel put forth here. Oh, and an affair in a hotel room...wow, how unique. And, using a male voice for females other than Lisa...wow, how Jenner.It is really sad...no wonder it needed Kickstarter for funding. What it really needed, besides a new script, is a kick in the ASS!	0
5dcb4257-1235-4a84-9b94-bb8d18d533a8	  This movie is awful. If you are going to tell a story about how boring and futile the world is, you can't do it in a boring and futile way. No story. It starts futile and ends futile. I signed up on Rotten Tomatoes just to leave a review for this movie. The critics rating of 92% is just off. I don't care if it's puppets or dogs in tutus, you still have to have an interesting and compelling story. I want those two hours back. Ugh.	0
3e9e721f-ba87-498a-9b54-4854b70e49fd	  Though quite unique, only a lover of Kaufman movie's will appreciate the strange approach to entertainment. Raw sex scenes from puppet characters created laughter from the audience. Telling a son that cum is coming out of "toy" gift from a sex shop is a sign of the sick, disturbing mind of Kaufman. I have to give him a star for creativity, and a half star for symbolism of real life reality.	0
b0e928bb-91a7-4201-9508-eb6933eba1a6	  A handful of chuckles and the use of moderately clever animation can't save this tediously slow and underdeveloped exercise in pointless pretension. Whatever themes of isolation, connection, conformity and individuality that the director was aiming for get buried under heaping piles of mindless, unfocused dialogue that does little to enlighten us about the characters or effectively move the story forward. And, even at the scant runtime of 1:30, it feels a lot longer as we wait for this meandering, self-indulgent missive to finally burn itself out.	0
8d2eb877-cdf4-4ba4-8e78-5bd3012c54a3	  This is my first review of a film on Rotten Tomatoes. I signed up for an account here TO REVIEW this film. It was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Yes, it was that bad.I hated it. For so many reasons. What a waste of my life. Pathetic main character. Pathetic people. Glorifying the pathetic, weak people of this world who can't, no, won't do anything to change their lives. Sad. Pathetic. Way to encourage to be and continue to be a proletariat.I want my two hours back.	0
c7c0545f-cb34-460e-8e8d-5b86b8a6be79	  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!! So disappointed with this movie. As a huge puppet stop motion animation fan, and a Kaufman fan, I was so excited to see this film. The film making was good, but the story line was barely there. They scratched the surface of a few plot points, but nothing really happened. I heard so many good reviews, and I do not understand what i was missing. The depression/alone in the world storyline was something that peaked my interest in the trailer and reviews, but it was just plain unlikable and unrelatable in the film. I wonder if this had been directed by someone more experienced with stop animation, if they would have been able to build a more captivating story. So much of this film was spent on characters just .... pacing around.	0
8e5c2581-9cba-4495-8a58-7f61baadecc5	  The most self-serving shit. I get that the movie is leaning entirely on being an animated film for adults, but the melancholy is worthless because the script generates no sympathy for the main character. At all. The most tired, overused story. Other than the use of voices being kind of cool, nothing new was brought to it. It's one star instead of a half because the animation was good. Get it together, Kaufman.	0
a5a86f54-60de-4401-9e60-cb4d6fc92597	  This felt like a movie that thinks it has a lot to say, but it really has less than nothing to say. It feels like it wants to be profound, but it's really faux-profound. The half-star I'm giving this movie is because of the stop-motion style. I sincerely feel this movie is getting raves because people think it must be about something really deep, when it's exceedingly shallow and hollow.	0
c1b37b55-85ed-4afd-a5e9-f6f6ad5f96c4	  Daily life is monotonous. 'Anomalisa' exemplifies this, but it does so by making the film itself monotonous. It's like when a character in a movie is supposed to be annoying. You want him to be annoying to the other characters, but when that character annoys the audience as well, it's hard to sit through. That sums up this movie. I never wanted to watch a stop-motion version of a guy trying to order room service and get laid. Maybe I'm missing how clever that is or something, but it's just dull.	0
a5a3de44-c1f5-441d-83f2-c1035a836896	  The best biopics don't attempt to tell the whole story. And thankfully "Love & Mercy" adheres to this adage. Instead, the film focuses on two key moments in Brian Wilson's life: as her conceives of the group's transformative sounds and of his rebirth two decades later when he is saved from the grip of his controversial, 24-hour therapist Dr Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). This is helped by the decision to cast two actors to portray Wilson: Paul Dano and John Cusack, both of who do a good job. Elizabeth Banks, too, gives a good performance as Wilson's now-wife, Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks), who he met inside a Cadillac showroom. The other star is the '80s clothes and d�cor that features in the latter story, which is a retrospective feast.	0
affff66c-f881-4051-aae6-1d071c6aa691	  The focus on two different eras of Brian Wilson made this movie feel odd and disjointed. I thoroughly enjoyed the focus on Wilson's early life, with Paul Dano doing a stellar job in his portrayal of The Beach Boys rise to fame and eventual break-up. A below average romantic storyline and a poor casting choice in John Cusack, coupled with the disconnect between the two eras on display, left me wanting more from this film.	0
b99749b9-da68-4470-a39d-fafcd989ae2e	  Paul Dano totally captures Brian Wilson. John Cusack captures a very disturbed but sweet man. Ostensibly they are both playing Wilson, though you'd never really know it. We learn a bit of the truth about Wilson but LOVE AND MERCY is too full of music and entertainment industry cliches to have any impact. And then the fantastical sequences are too sloppy to work in any way. But there is one major standout--Elizabeth Banks who is simply translucent while being totally grounded. Really cool.	0
447f7ac2-fcaf-497b-abce-bbb28ff5c85f	  Paul Dano and John Cusack both provide believable performances, but the lack of any joy in Wilson's music makes for a deeply depressing experience. It may be factual but the movie leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Elizabeth Banks is spot on as usual and yes everyone will hate Paul Giamatti who brings evil to the screen as Eugene Landy. What a shame they completely missed what Wilson's music means to him and his fans.	0
0b203505-fec5-453a-bd4f-945629b4bb70	  This is a movie movie, which doesn't necessarily recommend it for a mainstream audience. It's for Beach Boys fan(atic)s, musicologists, and movie nerds who like unconventional efforts for the sake of unorthodoxy (which helps explain the cult adoration of Tarantino and Pulp Fiction). The parts (Dano, Cusack, Giamatti's scenery-chewing, clinical insights into Brian's muse and his music-making process) are greater than their sum. Having said that, it's one of the very few films of recent note I could stand to see again. Go figure.	0
d501f919-f5cb-4652-82d8-9db9ae11c693	  This movie felt like a mental illness. There was so little story that I felt like I was the one on LSD. Great acting and imagery, just very little plot. Paul Giamatti and John Cusack once again show just how great they are at acting but their talents are almost wasted. I don't know how many times I asked myself, "Is this trip ever going to end?" And that's not a compliment.	0
2b5c8d94-7772-4db4-bd03-a45b247102f9	  This movie was a jumbled, confusing mess. The use of two different actors for the main character was confusing and a foolish casting decision. It just didn't jell or compute. I also think the blonde actress always looked more like a model then a real person. Another bad casting decision. The movie was so poorly directly Hollywood should be ashamed. Other movies about famous people were a lot more interesting and satisfying...Coal Miners Daughter and Walk the line.Save your money.	0
3bf7f30e-2a09-46b5-91a6-414106c149e0	  John Cusack as Brian Wilson? Never! I wasn't able to "buy into" these actors portraying someone as complicated as Brian Wilson..so, I kind of checked out from the get goAt least Paul Dano kind of looked like a younger Brian but even still, I wasn't buying it.Not nearly enough time was spent on both the scale of his LSD usage and his incessant need to compete with the Beatles..totally glossed over these very important contributors to his eventual mental collapse.This is a made for Hollywood movie that could very easily have been an after school TV special....net net, I for one won't "Do It Again"	0
36ab3332-941a-428c-be41-241e06d3990e	  Surprised that this film has such a high rating. Old reused horror antics that have worked much better in other films. The suspense was (to put if lightly) lacking and the story just felt boring with no depth (not entirely neccesary for a good horror flick, but alas this is not a good one) and had no real entertainment value. There was some decent gore but it just felt like a failed attempt to combine creepy ghost aspects with classic slasher themes. Though some parts are done well they are too few with a lot of unmemorable bulk. Definately not one I would recommend...	0
bbbbec01-917a-4845-ad31-1fadb41a00e8	  I'm frankly sick of atrociously bad horror movies like this being churned out these days. The maddening thing about this one is the inexplicably high rating RT has given this sub-amateur and badly acted waste of my time - a rating that genuinely got me eager to watch as this once great genre has so few even above average films these days. Please get some better critics or I may have to turn to (god help me) the Imdb rating system. ouch.	0
df86e861-18f9-4c0d-a470-9884d62f46f4	  Awful acting mixed with a terrible story that is given no explanation until the end credits sequence, bar the occasional monologue of expositional dialogue that felt incredibly forced, resulted in one of the most frustrating watches in a long time. The poor directing, exemplified by camera shots that take you out of the moment by following random actions rather than what matters on screen or focusing on characters to create tension, was the biggest criminal here though. I truly believe the only people who like this film will be those who think that boring and pointless camera shots of a house or car that last an inexplicably long amount of time is equivalent to art.	0

5a3c69c4-f7a7-4a4c-b1f6-35304adc2829	  the plot has several inconsistencies and provides irrelevant characters who are only introduced to die and add screen time. Barbara Crampton only has one emotion of confused sadness throughout the whole thing and characters make really stupid decisions. Halfway through this boring movie all you're waiting for is for the characters to die and this movie does not deliver much great death scenes but hey, at least we get a lot of scenery shots that last for an embarrassingly long time.	0
e5c094ab-226b-4174-a801-c8c7ad82311a	  This film follows every possible trope and cliche of your typical ghost story. I've never been a huge fan of ghost stories, but the ones that work need to follow a certain logic and stick to the rules they've created. This film fails woefully in that endeavor, instead creating a plot and background that is riddled with plot holes. Moreover, the characters are stereotypes and the dialogue is consistently expository, as much of the film is simply characters sharing their feelings. The actors try to do the best with what they've been given, but only Larry Fessenden escapes without looking completely awful by playing to the ridiculousness.	0
45768e73-520f-49c2-9ccd-cddf0e28d8dc	  Poorly paced and scripted, this sophomore effort boasts a few recognizable faces but lacks any real atmosphere or tension. The photography is cramped and banal, the performances seem like third rate impersonations of other, better ones (there's a faux-Nicholson and a Burstyn knock-off,) and the ghosts are dull, scorched, black-eyed zombie specters that jump out in the first ten minutes and then never stop leaping out to grab people's faces with their smoking fingers. The location is a dull one and the house has no particular geography or presence. Haunted houses don't have to be shadowy mansions: think the little suburban dwelling in 'The Grudge'. It's not funny enough to be a camp pastiche and its high rating on RT mystifies me. I can only imagine the reviews were written by the director's friends. A very inauspicious debut. Come back Ty West: all is forgiven.	0
9a0b51bc-c4f6-484a-9483-3e477a2befd4	  I can't believe how terrible this movie was. I'm in total shock it has descent reviews. The only thing good about this movies was Jessica Chastain. This movie had no plot; what on earth was this movie about? A family who owns a gas company who is trying to expand, meanwhile being frequently robbed by as it turns out nobody in particular. Then it's over! A most Violent Year wasn't even violent. What a terrible movie.	0
c03ed16a-95b4-40f4-9ab5-4805255e7c3d	  If you managed to end to watch this movie your certainly are a very patient person, because this movie is exaggeratedly slow, the lack of soundtrack makes it more boring than it already is, the cast doesn't captivate, and about the story, wait... what story? The movie's plot has so many holes, like what are inside the boxes that they are hiding from the police and some coincidences, that the truly crime here is say that this movie has a story.	0

7e68c835-0abe-4cfd-8eea-9d17e52d9d4b	  Very well acted and utterly useless. The entire movie didn't have to happen...the ending negates all the need for the rest of the movie. The characters are stagnant. It's not very violent. The wife who they make out to be a badass never comes into play as being a badass. This movie is slow, pointless and even unrealistic. The dialogue is fine. The acting is good. The rest of the movie is worthless.	0
63fcc545-7daa-4a54-a866-23a81db64569	  A Most Violent Year is not what it sounds like and doesn't offer much violence at all. A film that is dry, boring and drawn out just wasn't what you'd expect. Most of the film is conversations that seem to go in loops. One subject that is constantly brought up is that they need to do something about all that bad things that are happening to the company that eventually makes you yell "DO WHAT?!". A Most Violent Year really doesn't deserve the title as it should've been called A Most Mediocre Year since I would only recommend this to people that enjoy dry movies.	0
2c7d0f81-0cc8-46b1-8b5c-37becadce201	  Do yourself a favor. Wait for this to come out on Blu Ray. Then watch it if there isn't anything else. It was most violent. It wasn't even close. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Very slow throughout the film. Oscar Isaac was a very tame Al Pacino and did a great job of the role. Jessica was just so so as his wife. It just wasn't that great of a movie. I think the audience stayed in their seats shortly after it was over thinking there must be more. There wasn't. I was glad.	0
946b397a-e6ef-4d89-b706-730c5734866a	  At best a third rate Godfather clone. Too fake scenes such as after the purchase of the land at the end and then the former employee who ran away is suddenly there - totally implausible. The sexist role of wife at home, even when working at a desk was in a fancy nightgown with her robe fallen off a shoulder, more than once, too fake and posed. And her "girl" scream when the man shows up at the end with a gun. The male lead had the same demeanor through the whole film which was very monotone and became totally boring. Not a very good script nor directing.	0
e55c91b8-f472-4d5d-a545-3b49e62267d3	  This certain cure for insomnia plays as an adaptation of scenes scraped off the cutting room floors of Godfather and Goodfellas, plus one or two from The Wolf of Wall Street. The monotony is occasionally broken up by the film's only saving grace - the chemistry between Isaac and Chastain, who shine in their scenes together. Unfortunately, they are too few and far between, and this insipid drama shows just how little it has to say about any of the themes it touches on but makes no effort to try and explore. The lack of pace, action and plot development in the screenplay make A Most Violent Year, a most exhaustingly boring film.	0
b9941ce4-2bf6-4491-8005-cdbda1458566	  The most interesting thing about this movie is the title. It's all downhill from there. A more appropriate title for this would be "A Most Boring Movie," although I don't know if that would sell many tickets. Sure, the acting is good, but who cares? When nothing happens, there is barely a plot, it's like saying "that is a pretty shade of brown in your mud."	0
b4022687-52ef-43ab-bf80-b48eeca57a47	  One way to tell if a movie is bad, it gets a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I swear every movie that's had a good score on this site turns out to be a bad movie like Lincoln - the worst movie ever (high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes). This movie is no exception. Bad directing, bad camera work, lifeless characters, poor acting with unconvincing accents and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a rain forest in New Zealand! Thats funny, I didn't know there were many rain forests in western America. Its basically a low budget Lord of the Rings backdrop played by people with cowboy hats on. Boring as hell!	0
05007c9b-55e1-4506-95fd-2d60d3291703	  Slow West is like an exceptionally well-made student film with some great actors but it's too bright, too pretty and too clean looking to have any real impact. A Western without any grit is a shame. The story is flat, the plot predictable, the music is uninspired and the sound design lacks any punch. The one surprising moment in the film is ruined by such a shallow, obvious visual metaphor it makes a joke of the entire film, causing us to laugh at what should be a tragic situation. Slow West is to Westerns what The Hobbit films were to The Lord of the Rings.	0
dea4de1c-559d-4b9f-b26e-308b58efcf6f	  A more indie version of 50 Shades of Grey, depicting a dominant/submissive relationship in classical Eastern Europe, this film does some interesting things, focusing on the effect of age in relationships, highlighting the differences between love and sex, and creating an interesting juxtaposition where the submissive in the fantasy is actually dominant in the relationship. However, this movie commits the capital sin of being boring. It's visually stunning, with amazing sound and interesting subtext, but the main plot could barely support a short, no less a 100+ minute, leading to a viewing that really drags.	0
87d0dcaa-8066-48ed-b481-98c340738588	  I'm beginning to think that Jesse Eisenberg has a very limited acting range. I've seen him in multiple films now but his mannerism and quick-fire way of talking are always there. Worked in The Social Network but it's getting tiresome now. Unfortunately, it's not the only issue with the film. For a story that is supposed to be dialogue-heavy and thought provoking I'd expect the conversations to be razor-sharp and intellectually piercing. None of that applies to 'The End of the Tour'. The film did not manage to sell me on the idea that David Foster Wallace is a brilliant guy despite multiple claims of that from supporting characters. And that, for a film whose strength should lie just in that, is a big disappointment. Sunset Limited nailed the convention way better.	0
d487bdf1-eb3e-4b06-b06c-5640f0912d0c	  An hour and 45 minutes of people talking. Sometimes it is interesting, but it's hard to keep a movie going that long without a plot. Joan Cusack definitely improves this film whenever she is on screen, but she can't save it. I looked up the real people online after watching this and there were some interesting things that could have made this a better film. I just don't know how someone read this script and thought they have to make this into a movie. There just isn't enough here to hold an hour and 45 minutes.	0
a251842a-8640-4986-b0da-5c609935b855	  I dont know why this got good reviews. This movie sucked horribly and only succeeded at pissing me off. It just shows that the wealthy are blood sucking leeches, the courts are corrupt and the police are mindless and corrupt. No one in America has a heart anymore. These are all facts in real life, why do I need to watch them again in a movie? Talk about salt in a wound. And the ending was BS too. This film basically made me want to move to another country. It shows everything wrong with America, that I try to escape...by watching movies.	0
a2895a00-457b-40a2-a8a8-a8c28982df00	  Very thin plot, maybe there is no plot. Exploiting real life tragedies to beyond 'unexciting' and 'boring' to bank on audience's consciousness by triggering their pity. Worse than real life TV. Protagonist's character arc doesn't make sense. He's full throttle with his ambition until the end of the movie and when there is no possible twist with this - I can't even call it plot - 'plot' he suddenly becomes a sensible person with a conscience but the problem is the person who he became wouldn't have done all those things he did until the last scene in the first place in a million years. Very good acting very bad script.	0
c6d36f2c-2c1c-4882-8005-d4ad5444cc49	  The movie pointed out one obvious thing. NWA was important to music. As for the characters portrayed in the film? They were boring. Once the novelty of watch a guy acting like Eazy E and a dude that looks and sounds like Ice Cube wears off, there isn't that much. I guess Dr. Dre was the main character? I don't know, I didn't get to spend significant time with any of the characters to really care about any of their stories. This guy just took a bunch of other music biopics and pasted them together to make this near-3 hour mess (yeah, I watched the Directpr's Cut.... big mistake).	0
fb92b93f-91ab-43e3-bc1e-73c3c777e09f	  I was really looking forward to this film but I found it to be incredibly corny. It was told from the point of view of the characters to such a degree that they are barely seen even using drugs. Time and again there are these speeches about how "one day I'm gonna make it" and then BAM! there's a career breakthrough right on cue. And the relentless aggression (which is somehow confused with determination or such) is just too tedious and unbelievable.When there is too much ego in autobiography you get corn...very corny corn.	0
0057619b-ec6c-4c94-87bb-da6d5f0d95bf	  I haven't watched this yet but after looking at the trailer, I see zero difference between this film and Get Rich or Die Trying with 50 Cent which I did watch. Why this movie is critically acclaimed and really doesn't tell a story that the broader public would find interest in baffles me. GRoDT wasn't critically acclaimed or nominated for anything (major awards; BET wouldn't really count; too biased) but it's a snub that this one wasn't? The two movies appear identical.	0
ec7a5b53-e8f9-40f6-abab-da42f6eb28a4	  It's OK if you enjoy indulging in the typical Hollywood trope of drugs, violence, sex, foul language, and a general short fuse or intolerance for those unimportant or encouragingly irritating to you in general, playing nearly as big a roles as the characters themselves throughout.What's more, the citizens of the world, complaining about the downward spiral of morality therein, are usually the same ones throwing their money at movies that are the base representation of what is wrong with the world today. I didn't see this movie, and I don't plan on it. I took one look at the rating and knew I wasn't about to promote something that contributes to the "R"otten culture flooding our world today.	0
5bfffc91-aa87-4bd2-8a89-0bd5b23134eb	  This movie was extremely ambitious, and really delivered in the first 45 minutes, it captured the joy and the striffe of the 'rags-to riches' story. But as it dragged on 2 and a half hours it became clear the movie was trying to tackle way too much. It lacked a cohesive narrative and strong voice and doesn't possess the same punch as biopics in the genre did like for example: 8 mlle. About midway through 'straight outa compton' jumps off the rails, and never regains its focus/momentum.	0
1731740b-1ff4-47cc-950b-b9285eae1ee1	  I may have had too high of expectations, but a movie centered on Eazy-E's rise and subsequent death from HIV and they don't show him with one girl, and the fact that the movie just blows through the entire 90s rap era with 2 second semi-cameos; oh there's snoop, there's 2-Pac, oh ya and bone thugs were there... It starts out fantastic, remenicent of Boys in the Hood, and then just becomes a random fake cameo list.	0
60956480-fad0-4dd2-abcc-c756c3d48f94	  Can you give a movie no stars. I would. It was just plain depressing. Bummer since I was really looking forward to seeing this movie based upon the Movie Info and the audience and critic reviews. And, what a waste of Sam Shepherd. I can't imagine how this movie got 70% in audience appreciation. I'm new to the site so I don't know how to give it a rotten tomato, otherwise I would.	0
afb95a50-fc90-42c9-8c08-ccdb4ac87236	  Feels too staged like a play. Never really comes alive, and the characters aren't that interesting to me. I find it a little funny for that Kristen Stewart seems to be getting so much buzz and praise for her performance, neither her character or performance is all that good or memorable. I don't mean to say she's bad, just merely competent. That's where I find the humor: finally Kristen Stewart gives a competent performance, and it blows people away to see her give an average performance after years of having less emotional range than a block of wood.	0
c4df2be2-5617-4916-8810-430a4ee9abcb	  I can't decide if this film is taking itself seriously or is a parody of the film and theatre businesses.I hope it's a parody because it is full to the brim with unlikable, pretentious, self-involved people dealing with manufactured millionaire lifestyle problems. Nobody feels any emotion stronger than some underlying dissatisfaction with their current lot.The best I can say about this is it made me go outside for a breath of fresh air and some sunshine, grateful I didn't inhabit that world.	0
2acd057e-fe07-4f42-a208-398b3a35081d	  The only good part in this film was the last 15 minutes. They wasted the first 80% of it on the rambling insecurities of Binoche's character while she prepares for the role in her play, and Kristen Stewarts performance FINALLY warmed up halfway through. Then, in the last 15 minutes, they decide to actually move forward with the plot and introduce the New Sigrid to the Old Sigrid. It would've been a much more interesting film if they had expanded this portion, rather than using the relationship between Binoche and Stewart as a metaphor for Sigrid and Helena. The pervasive product placement of iPhone and facebook and youtube throughout the movie are surprisingly even more frequent and obnoxious than Stewart's attempts to sound and appear 'natural.'	0

5a2e11bd-217b-4fca-8b17-7c0d07012385	  This is a film that for me had very little going for it for my tastes. Its centred around an actress in the peak of her career and asked to play a character that made her famous 20 years earlier. The film was too moody with alot of talking without making it interesting and I felt nothing for the characters or the story as it felt really rigid. Kristen Stewart however was really good in support just a shame that the movie wasnt great at all	0
6c63c665-c470-482f-97f2-68551f0ed766	  There must be some middle ground between the summer blockbuster blow'em-up sequels and the European borefests that my local movie theaters have been offering lately. This is one of those stories within a story that also follows a seeming trend that none of the characters should be likable. On top of all that none of the lines sound like anything humans would say. There was momentary relief whenever Binoche laughed or the travelogue views of tSwiss Alps brought the screen alive. I could imagine this as the first effort of a high school playwright in love with symbolism and fond of gimmickry but nothing more, sigh an abuse of my time.	0
18822c29-80eb-4a65-a7de-4139d8cd8f0b	  Oh, how boring this movie is! It's got some great actors - Juliette Binoche (Godzilla) and Chlo� Grace Moretz (The Equalizer) both put in solid performances. But, wait for it ... Kristen Stewart (Twilight Saga) carries the day in this one - she's even better than Binoche! The essential premise has potential but is never realised. The script is just so tedious I couldn't wait for the movie to finish. The clouds referenced in the title, which are a real phenomenon, were the most interesting thing about the movie - I learnt something! But that interest was very brief indeed. Don't bother with this one.	0
2e1fef02-fc75-4543-92bd-61034416bd85	  Although Juliette Binoche is a terrific actress and Kristen Stewart acquits herself very well, the film meanders and is essentially pointless with an "ending" that is French cinema at its...worst. Confilcts try to develop but this ends up being a meditation on the horrors of aging, especially when you're an actress. Surprisingly effective is Chloe Grace Moretz as the emerging ingenue who demonstates adolescent rage yet delivers a fine performance. But overall I left asking myself what did that mean and what was the point.	0
2c9bdbc0-1400-49ca-9c1d-f1ab87a3dc01	  Am I the only person in the world who found this film so obvious, improbable, and dull-as-a-meat-fart? Honestly!!! Juliette Binoche is criminally bad in most scenes, chloe grace moretz is infinitely punchable and self aware, and the "play within the play" is so poorly written, that for me to believe it's a masterwork of it's time is for me to believe that everyone in the world of this film is an idiot. Though judging by the gushing reviews of this film, i am thoroughly convinced that the joke is on us. You've been had. Congratulations. You all just ate a piece of "merde" and were told it is the French word for cake.	0
be3d8058-c507-4598-9c79-25cb834c0f9f	  It's a fine hommage to old-school acting and filmmaking, and esp. the powerful role of the assistant, and Kristen Stewart and Lars Eidinger are just natural superstars in their screen presence. Even if Stewart has to wear glasses. But and unconvincing storyline about an actors problem meta-topic without any humor and an unconvincing fatal attraction makes it not that interesting and engaging, even if true, and Assayas is still not a very capable filmmaker. He is together with Spike Lee the only A-list director with still major craft problems. Here the editing in some scenes is amateurish sloppy and the actors shouldn't be caught watching to the director in scenes. Not once, twice.But I would forgiven that if the ending would have made any sense.	0
8d58a473-ee24-48c8-91dd-a353cfe151f8	  Acquired taste? Another thing that takes an acquire taste is sadism. I had a hard time with this movie for too many reasons. I don't know who is rating this thing so high but please don't be fooled. This movie is a super weird abstract social commentary on the norms in relationships in society... as far as I can tell. The big question for me is how they were able to get so many stars to be in this movie which is shot on the same level as some of the student films I've seen coming out of the local Junior College. This movie will definitely leave you wanting... to punch yourself in the face for making the choice to see it.	0
020b0060-7c5d-4889-873e-e9f078defb01	  You'll either hate it or love it. I would've loved it if it ending 30 minutes earlier than it did. At almost 2 hours in length, it challenges even the purest die-hard to stay as interested towards the end as you were during the first half of it. It definitely has an acquired taste, hence you'll either love it, or hate it. Unfortunately, I don't know of any prerequisite factoid that will help you decide which camp you will fall under before even watching it.	0
6267c090-16b9-4b1f-960b-5d984926e9ac	  The critics will say it's thought provoking and rewarding just to let everyone know they "get it". But in reality it's a boring and tedious exploration of a thought that could easily be condensed into a 10 minute short film instead of a slow 2 hour burn to a predictable and unsatisfying end. I could go into more detail why I thought it was a train wreck but it's wasted enough of my time already.	0
6bd7e772-4b2b-4096-bf3b-5e25221cbac8	  This movie fell into the "What the f**k" category ... the concept is so off the wall that it failed to work for me. Sometimes I like wacky, but I just kept saying WTF WTF, it never feels like a good movie when you laugh in incredulity - definitely glad I don't live in the world the movie is set in. The acting is bizarre befitting this dystopia, but nobody does a bad job here. The fate of the dog was totally unnecessary, and that's not the only thing that was disturbing. The only part I did like was the sign language that Farrell and Weisz's shortsighted characters invent - the rest of it I think I will leave, and just say watch under advisement.	0
7fd347ff-f850-4c0f-9a8d-3ba3c4f46081	  A dissenting voice. This is one of those movies that critics and movie buffs love, and ordinary movie fans like me find completely pointless. Many critics describe it as 'hilarious'. Really? I saw it in a respectably full Picturehouse in the UK (ie the kind of cinema that attracts keen moviegoers) and it barely raised a titter. Lots of talent, competently deployed, but ... for what? It's described as satirical, but satire requires a real and recognisable target, and needs to make points that hurt. Not for the first time, the Tomatometer led me astray with this one.	0
2dd16e59-8003-41b9-875b-2359de455aed	  Just like Jobs himself, the movie is condescending and obsessed with theatrics and offers no real insight of any kind. I suppose Fassbender's portrayal of Jobs is decent, but that still means that this is two hours of watching a guy be an insulting, pretentious jerk and treat everyone around him like garbage. I don't have to endure that to tell you three brief statements about the history of Apple, which is the extent to which this movie amounts. Both Boyle and Sorkin have had strong offerings in the past, but this certainly didn't coalesce into anything palatable.	0
a01b4acf-5fed-42fb-aa4c-17ea5a12b47d	  A biopic that rings hollow and phony from start to finish. Yes, we're well aware of the title character's shady reputation from news reports and other films, but this stagey, pretentious, poorly written and at times needlessly cryptic account of his life becomes truly laughable and tiresome. Michael Fassbender's overwrought, constantly mugging for the camera performance screams "I dare you not to nominate me for an Oscar for this portrayal" (sheesh). Were it not for the solid supporting performances of Kate Winslet and Jeff Daniels, there would be nothing to recommend here. It's now easy to see why the early reviews weren't so kind to this release; it doesn't deserve the praise it has received since.	0
ba1609a8-90b9-4b8e-b1fc-05d50289d15b	  If you read the biography about Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson I'd suggest: don't watch that movie. While I was watching it, I wanted to leave because the actor was not representing Steve Jobs very well, they did not mention anything about his other kids or his other wife or his disease. Furthermore, it is sad to make such a bad and imperfect movie about a man who lived for perfectionism and change. Don't watch that movie, really.	0
c5ead7bc-369f-42b2-a326-36583ff112c2	  So bummed. I swear I feel like spent the past two hours harshing on a deceased beloved Uncle. It's almost sacrilegious in my opinion. This movie is allegedly about Steve Jobs, as indicated by the title, but it's really about a nasty man yelling at other people and being abusive and neglectful to his daughter. It's an awful movie to experience if you are at all in touch with humanity. The fact that the movie is fiction is even more upsetting. I think Universal should refund our money. I left feeling just really, really really sad all around.	0
f060dfa6-27ca-4dcc-b0d6-7570eb0ef86a	  The direction and acting are the reason for the half star. The writing, while fast-paced and jargon-loaded, was so schlocky plot-wise. As if ex-girlfriends and bastard children are going to show up backstage before every product launch and Jobs is going to give them the time of day. I don't care if the President of the United States showed up just before a product launch. They were going to have to wait. What a contrived bunch of B.S. And the whole story arc with the daughter" "Love me daddy" with whkt's-her-name getting involved and insisting he do something as if she was anybody in real life. The whole thing was silly all the way up to the forced "tear-jerker" end where father and daughter make amends. I def was expecting more. Way more.	0
7c0ea897-c37b-4fcd-8dee-57f14028f0bb	  What a disappointment. If you enjoy watching an a*hole have lots of heated dialogue with individuals then you may like this. I was really looking forward to this movie based on my love of Apple, and the brilliance behind Apple, but this was truly disappointing. Lack of plot development, I guess I missed knowing ahead of time the movie is supposed to focus behind 3 product launches, but it made for lack of development in the movie.	0
31d926c7-b8ea-44c2-99aa-eca4366e738c	  I can't believe I just spent money on 2 hours and 2 minutes of Aaron Sorkin's genius envy. Wow, does Sorkin have self-esteem issues or what? The movie is basically non-stop arguing, thing is though, the words aren't really quotes from Jobs but rather fiction/fantasy rants invented by Sorkin. Not entertaining and the only thing I learned is that I will never pay to see another Sorkin movie. Sony REALLY dodged a bullet when it dropped the project.	0
92bac48d-f818-45a9-aa61-dee40b7b755d	  Talk about a missed mark and a giant disappointment. I don't understand why Skorkin had to dream up so much fiction around Jobs' personal relationships and work. He took what should and could have been a fascinating depiction of one of the most interesting people of our time and instead made up a story that is almost unrecognizable from what happened in real life. Why? I'm so confused by this movie and the other reviews. The advertising and movie descriptions imply that it is a movie about Steve Jobs' life but that is actually quite a stretch. The acting was good (loved the cast) but otherwise I feel duped in having spent what we spent on movie tickets.	0
79a658ec-1a77-413c-a529-b04b315510e4	  Found myself falling asleep during the first half of the movie. General synopsis: Steve Jobs has a brilliant mind for marketing computers, but behind closed doors, he is an egotistical asshole who doesn't give his colleagues their due; Secondly, he initially refuses to acknowledge that his daughter is really his, but as she gets older, he wants to reconcile with her and prove to her that he loves her. The End. Boring movie. Two hours of my life I will never get back (and I like both Aaron Sorkin and Michael Fassbender)	0
192d6c76-4154-47d9-a8a6-7589a6eaf801	  What a mess. I was hoping this movie would provide some insights into why Jobs made Apple so successful, but it wasn't even close. This was more about Jobs' demons in his personal relationships with people. It showed really nothing why Jobs wanted a corporate suit like John Sculley to run Apple. There were some flashbacks about Jobs vision for changing the world, but that's nothing new. This was just such a disappointment when there was so much meat left on the bone. It was shallow and Jobs came off as condescending to everyone else at Apple. No one would be inspired by such an asshat; they would just leave. Jobs almost killed Apple with his unrealistic demands and meddling in technical decisions. The actors pulled off good performances, but with such lousy execution and a childish script that's all they could do.	0
da978fe4-d78c-49f0-b23a-b89a4150fe44	  Boo. Hiss. Ummm.... what was that? Well.... the opening scene was very witty and hilarious. And that was it. It was pure waste after that. And the acting! I know LeBron's excuse. He's an athlete, not a professional actor. The same goes for the other athletes in the film. But Amy Schumer?! Her acting was horrendous! The critics need to be ashamed of themselves for certifying this film as fresh.	0
9a9ea088-84c5-475a-ae22-4bfbc4cafdb6	  I watched this movie based on the strength of the reviews. I have to say it might be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is painfully slow, not funny and although scattered with clever pop culture references, it us ultimately mean spirited, no fun, longwinded, not believable and a huge waste of time. Please don't waste your time. This movie should have never been made. This makes me not want o trust movie reviews.	0
6f1cb54f-0ed9-41bd-b975-1b2889451b1a	  Amy Schumer's humor style is very sexist, and i think this trainwreck scipt/story really suit her, well, of course, because she's the one who wrote it..HAHAI don't like Billl Harder though, because i think he's not that handsome to be a leading man, not like Paul Rudd. Buttt in the end of the movie when he's standing at the basket ball stadium, he's quite charming :) Funny movie but not my style of funny..	0
be386c60-79f0-4ae3-8507-96e7e0bbd158	  I really wanted to see this movie in the theater but it came and went. Watched the DVD for 20 minutes then went. The first twenty fwas certainly no comedic hook. Couldn't beleive there was like half a laugh in that amount of time. Then a week later it was still in the machine so I watched from where I left off. Serves me right but doen't serve me rightly. When LE bron James is the star of the show, don't go. Still no really good laughs, maybe a couple. Then it gets really like hearstringy and ploty and I'm like geting emotional for these characters I like who are dying and breaking up and F. Sometimes you have to beleive it when people say pass. PASS.	0
4a8f8e09-340e-4b38-9854-a7cc6055b609	  After the first 20 minutes I checked to see how long the movie went for. 2 hours 10minutes!!!! By the 1 hour point my wife was asleep, and I hired this move for her! But I saw it through, with one thought "Comedy is a hit or miss", I think it missed me. I've never seen Amy Schumer before and I doubt I'll watch her again. "Crass" sums up her comedic approach. The use of profanities in comedy has always been the fall back for the uneducated and their inability to get a laugh. I did feel sorry for Bill Hader getting lumped with the side-kick role to promote Schumer. The best part is spotting the cameos. Daniel Radcliffe, Marisa Tomei, Matthew Broderick, Marv Albert, and Chris Evert.	0
63d2e793-b570-420e-990f-7ca90036573f	  Shameless, at times funny, but at times totally tasteless. Maybe it improved as it went on but I was so grossed out by the first few scenes I turned it off after 20 min (saw it on a plane.) Her off color, pardon my french, slutty jokes, are perfect for a drunk night out at a comedy club, not so good for a feel good romp. It just didn't sit right.	0
59fd23b9-3461-4d2a-b0db-ee969dc50e87	  Trainwreck is just painful to watch at times. Amu Schumer is NOT a leading lady and it has nothing to do with her looks, which is what feminists will claim. She is, quite frankly, obnoxious. Surprisingly she isn't a bad actress but too often her true personality comes through and, as a protagonist, it destroys much of the film. I think she would be better suited for the obnoxious friend of the main girl. Bill Hader does a solid job but is mostly forgettable. Honestly, the only reason this film is worth watching is for the plethora of celebrity cameos, highlighted by LeBron James. They all play versions of themselves in hilarious skits that fit neatly into the plot. If it wasn't for James, John Cena, Amare Stoudemire, etc. this film would be among the worst comedies I've seen in recent memory.	0
