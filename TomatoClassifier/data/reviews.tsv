9af5724a-86e0-41b4-9103-9a2947f14196	  George Miller unleashes a feverish, ferocious film and it's an intense wild ride. Acrobatic "Mad Max: Fury Road" is thrilling and treats the audience to some astonishing action sequences. But the action doesn't dull the emotional impact and that's mainly due to Charlize Theron's fierce performance."Mad Max: Fury Road" is a ride worth taking. Wall-to-wall pumped-up adrenalized fun, it's ridiculously good.	2
78e5097d-6162-4d6f-9f73-d483718fdba3	  George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the most, lush and vivid movies I've seen in a long time. The cinematography for this film is an absolute marvel- showcasing the sprawling outback desert through hues of oranges and reds during the daytime, contrasting it with beautiful midnight blues at night. All this comes together to give the movie a very lively atmosphere. The score alleviates the sense of rush and is smartly used diegetically as well as non-diegetically. The action scenes are shot brilliantly with minimal special effect, furthering its case as a masterpiece. Finally the acting especially that of Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa is top-notch and no character is left needing further characterisation. Tom Hardy's Max is a man of little words, but the performances are so strong that the movie doesn't need dialogue in order to flourish. This movie is definitely not hyped up- go see it and then go see it again.Rating: 5/5	2
8f5ea78a-eee3-4952-8f37-e00b31375729	  Apparently, it takes an old veteran like George Miller to show this new generation of young filmmakers how action can be exhilarating, and so he gives us this high-octane, adrenaline-fueled roller coaster of a movie that is technically flawless, visually astonishing and looks amazing in 3D.	2
6e7dd5de-fd56-4994-9205-d4d751f94d4b	  A glorious symphonic ballet of wanton destruction whose visual poetry dazzles and amazes. Whereas the current popular political correctness deems all life as precious, this weekend jaunt through the local park with the baby in the stroller yells to differ (reminding one of exactly what planet one dwells on). Standing ovation for George Miller, whose charming eloquence about the well hidden truth of modern society is jaw-droppingly stunning. The best apocalyptic vision seen for some time.	2

63a5ff41-7295-4468-99fc-14a365d456fa	  30 years after the release of 'Thunderdome' Mad Max is finally back. The lone wolf, the single warrior, the loner, the lone soldier, the outcast, the outsider, the man with no name...errr...named Max. The hype has been stratospheric for this one, I have gone into this expecting truly mind blowing things, the greatest action movie ever made? lets see, I will be brutally honest in every aspect.So the bottom line, this is virtually based around one sequence from 'Mad Max 2' and made into an entire movie. We all know which sequence, the one with that bloody great gas tanker covered in gun turrets and spikes. That sequence was epic on so many levels, a truly award winning vision of distopian science fiction...where all the goodies get killed, awesome. Now, in this tale Max has been captured by the War boys who are all led by Immortan Joe. Your standard gang of barbaric lunatics, only this time not kitted out in S&M gear, no this time they are all painted up in a tribal sort of way. Long story short, Max has gotta reluctantly help out Charlize Theron's character of Furiosa (with the help of Nicholas Hoult's ill War Boy character, Nux) in saving some damsels in distress from Joe whilst trying to reach some fabled lush green lands. This of course equals a whole load of vehicle chases across the outback which basically never stop.The first sequence we see is Max's classic and gorgeous black pursuit special (the now famous 1973 Ford XB Falcon GT) getting trashed, wait what??!! I heard about this before hand and I have to say I don't like it one bit, I wanted to see that fucking car in action once again, damn it Miller! Not quite sure how Max's super fast special manages to get wiped out by the collection of clown cars chasing him but never mind, it bloody happened didn't it, ugh!So one of the first things we see as the real story kicks in is Immortan Joe's citadel which appears to built into a fecking massive cliff. How the hell did they manage to do that? there's like some sprawling catacombs in this rock by the looks of it, I wouldn't of thought anyone had any time in between killing each other and building ridiculous killer automobiles. This is actually one aspect that didn't sit well with me, this whole idea felt way too grand and over the top for a Mad Max movie, it looked like something from the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy...only with cars instead of orcs. Then if I really wanted to be picky I would ask how everyone is so muscular in this dead post-apocalyptic world, meh don't question it. Its here we start to see the strange freakish array of characters that inhabit this new Earth, gotta say I loved what I saw here for the most part. Miller has always been good at creating these bizarre characters for this franchise and he nails it again here.Most of the bad guys are just big rippling baldies covered in white paint for some reason (the War Boys), not much background given but they look intimidating for sure. Other citadel dwellers and bad guys come in various shapes and sizes such as the creepy looking Corpus Colossus, a physically disabled child of Joe with exceptional intelligence (a real person with a real disability). Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones), a huge muscular mammoth of a man, dim-witted and another son of Joe. The Bullet Farmer who is some ugly aging bloke in a suit of bullets and...is a farmer?, hence is name. The People Eater is a big fat bald guy (everyone is bald in the distopian future) who I guess eats people? Again hence is name and the reason he's so fat, he also looks to have lost his nose because he wears some kind of metal plate there. The Doof Warrior who is some crazy blind bloke that rides a war rig (the Doof Wagon) into battle strapped to some huge speakers and playing a fire spouting guitar. This guy seems to have become the new Boba Fett of the movie world but he doesn't actually do anything, in fact I fail to see the point of him or the drummers other than simply to look cool. Admittedly he does look cool, certainly unique with his mothers face for a mask (oh yes), but basically pointless.Lastly we have Immortan Joe who is easily the most effective looking character I've seen in years. His mask appears to be some kind of breathing apparatus that is attached to some kind of bellows around his neck. The mask is slightly reminiscent of an old WWII pilots oxygen mask but with a terrifying line of big teeth like a skeleton. Not too sure about his ending though, was his mask like...attached to has face and skull? He also seems to wear some kind of transparent body armour with medals and whatnot attached, obviously he suffers from some kind of affliction or disease. Visually this guy looks fucking amazing, the makeup really tops it off with his pale ghostly complexion and silver balding, widows peak hair line. All in all the selection of characters gave off a very 'Dune-esque' (1984) vibe in my opinion.The action is virtually constant here, its the trademark of the movie (and franchise), non-stop. The main bulk of the action centres around Max and co trying to escape on the tanker under a barrage of gunfire and explosions. Now yeah, we've seen this before in 'Mad Max 2' but this has been ramped up to maximum overdrive, its insane! There are vehicles being torn up and flipped all over, metal mechanical shrapnel shattering all over the desert, bodies are flying everywhere, War Boys are leaping around on pole vault type things hurling explosives, gunfire, stabbings, fisticuffs...all happening on and off various extreme vehicle creations. It all looks completely real (because all the stunts were real), its highly impressive and shows great achievement in both eruptive action and practical effects. On top of that the location work, scenery shots, panoramas and the crisp, bold colour palette really look nothing short of gorgeous, it almost looks too good for this type of movie. Gives you faith in movies again it really does.That's not to say the action saves it completely, in my view. Amongst all this grade A action you do have to wonder how Max, Joe and others manage to survive some of the horrific fender benders they get into. The good guys battle their way away from the citadel, all that way, only to come back again and do it all again? wut?! The canyon sequence stuck out as a very daft cheesy notion. This biker gang that hides out there, living in and around the canyon walls, which they ride about on...with motorbikes? bit risky isn't it. Also, where did they all get their matching costumes? When the good guys come back through the canyon, do they go a different way? didn't it get blocked off. And it does all seem nuts that all this happens purely because Joe wants his girls back. He unleashes his entire armada and risks everything just for some ass? can't you find more girls in your citadel? Oh and in the end the citadel bad guys just let Max and co into their city and take over? huh? he just killed your leader.The greatest action flick ever? hmmm not too sure about that, its certainly up there but I still find myself preferring the gritty cult classic 'Mad Max 2' with Gibson. I think Hardy does a reasonable job but he is no Mad Max if you ask me. One thing I hated actually was the deliberate lack of dialog from Max, it worked well in the older films (MM2) simply because there was less to explain, 'MM2' was like a bloody 80's videogame it was so straight forward. Here there are things that could use background information plus the amount of times Max gets into a situation (mainly at the start) where I really wanted him to just speak! say something!! Explain your situation to Furiosa then she might not try to kill you...ugh! I found that actually frustrating and it didn't need to be like that.Still, the fact that the goodies went back on themselves towards the end really made me groan frankly. Its like Miller didn't know how to end it so he just made them go back and run the same gauntlet all over again, easy option for more of the same. I won't lie and say I didn't like it, but I won't lie and say I thought it was a stunning movie, the action is monumental at first but after the initial hardcore, automobile, carnage sequence, things felt a little tamer. The initial visual shock and awe that hit my eyeballs, making them swell, started to ease off. So awe-inspiring visuals all round and some great characters...visually at least. Is this a good flick? yes, yes is it, its a very engaging solid action movie, buts lets not get too carried away. Its really a one trick pony if you're honest about it, big gas tanker with goodies fights off hordes of baddies, rinse, wash and repeat until credits. The only real difference is its Furiosa's story, and to a degree, Nux too, unfortunately Max is just along for the ride in his 30 year old reboot.	2
ebfe5eee-1de3-417e-83cc-c7c5d19feee8	  Damn! I never knew I could like an action movie this much. Made me want to watch the original 3. This movie was out of this world awesome!	2
b600b6a2-2054-4a39-a5e7-29a51448c717	  'Fury Road' rips through conventional action movie norms to provide a visceral experience. Miller's choice to use practical effects pays off tenfold, as the stuntmen and pyrotechnics deserve as much recognition as the perfect cast. The Mad Max franchise is back, and so far its a wild ride.	2
5080e1f9-72eb-4547-8b6c-353bea7628e8	  This is by far the best film of the summer. I feast of action and drama. I will say that while it did a great job of capturing the essence of the original films, it was lacking the "hardcore sensory overload / punk rock" feeling that the first two films had. Not necessarily a bad thing...I just missed that feeling.	2
5d0253a5-e643-43c8-9ea7-5b2781960bd4	  Apocalyptic films are usually a hit or miss subject. Many are forgettable or cliched to the point of being one big joke, kind of like the film within the film by the Mackenzie brothers in Strange Brew. Some films get it really right, while others get it really, really wrong with disastrous and silly results.When one thinks of the modern apocalyptic film the template for that genre of cinema was crafted by George Miller. His major debut Mad Max (1979) was less apocalyptic and more a '70's exploitation car chase flick sent to hell and back, making the film an achievement in film making. It pushed the envelope at the end of the decade.It would be the sequel to that film, Mad Max 2 or The Road Warrior here in the states, that would define Miller's vision of the world beyond the end, the people that lived after the "event". The Road Warrior is one of those rare films that exceeds its predecessor with a story that, while simple, is presented in a way that is unforgettable and burns itself into your psyche.We'll skip Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. It has its place and its moments, but is really a film that Miller cared very little about as he left the world of Max for thirty years.Mad Max: Fury Road is a return to the supercharged film that The Road Warrior happened to be. Max (Tom Hardy) once again runs afoul of a mutant clan using slave labor and water to control their little piece of a broken world. Led by Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keayes-Byrne, who played the Toe Cutter in the original film) a chase ensues after Furiosa (Charlize Theron in an awesome performance) steals a commodity that is sacred to the enraged leader.A simple story if there ever was one, but this goes beyond that. Fury Road is open to close action with very little time to catch your breath. Some films are called a roller coaster ride, that age old cliche that they slap on posters. Fury Road is like going into hell without any looking back. It's funny that a film set in a fictional version of our world can draw so many parallels to life itself.What really stands out in Fury Road is the role of women. For a film titled Mad Max, the strongest character in the film is Furiosa, a warrior that does not give up, leading her ironic cargo to a promised land that may or may not exist. Distant memories or wishful thinking? There are moments when Max feels like a side character and this is Furiosa's movie. It's an amazing thing to see in film where a woman is neither a pawn nor a gimmick, but an integral piece to the film. She is the center that everything about Fury Road revolves around.I was more than sketchy when I heard that another Mad Max film was on the way. So many returns in the last decade have floundered over the indulgences of these sequels and reboots. It's about a 50/50 split in that arena. Fury Road is probably the best of the bunch and is probably one of the best films of 2015 so far. It is a credit to credit masterpiece that really cuts at the other blockbusters of this year and the almost stagnant world of super hero movies. Fury Road is, ironically, a breath of fresh air in a cinematic universe that tends to regurgitate last years product. Dare I say that this film is Miller's masterpiece, possibly even surpassing The Road Warrior? I don't know, but I really, REALLY want to watch it again.	2
57aabbb4-c4d4-4f95-bab8-1f807cb123c4	  Its possibly one of the greatest action movies ever made. A mind-blowing visual feast for the eyes and ears with spectacular action sequences, fights and chases. Tom Hardy is a man of few words but delivering none the less and giving a strong performance showing he is more than a worthy replacement for Mel Gibson. It also provides plenty of strong female characters as well, Charlize Theron is pure power. Its The Fast and the Furious in ways only The Expendables can imagine. It's pure mad-man brilliance from a fine artist in fine form. Director, George Miller rocks this film with is gorgeous and explosive vision. An action movie masterpiece that will blow you away.	2
6c91c275-9723-4265-8420-a98c9ec5babd	  George Miller's long-awaited sequel is grandiose in scale of action-sequences overall, and it is marvelous to say the least. Mad Max: Fury Road is an exhilarating-overdose of monumental thrills and sound. The film's post-apocalyptic feel is stronger and the performances are impressive, especially Charlize Theron. It also has enough of a concise story to make this one of Miller's most exceptional works and one of the best summer blockbusters, let alone overall films, of the year. 4.5/5	2
5e3b323d-95c2-41b5-af9d-af5bc8d8f432	  An action packed thrill ride that leaves your bum tense! Thoroughly enjoyable, havent seen the originals but makes me want to!	2
245caec5-ab55-4c88-8f6d-fd638e6b40eb	  Allow me to begin with a confession. I had to see Mad Max: Fury Road again. I knew minutes into the film that my appetite would not be quenched and I needed to see it again, which I did less than 12 hours later. A week later I saw it a third time in the theater. The reason I did this is obvious in one regard - it's a highly enjoyable, pulse-pounding, amazing spectacle of first-class stuntwork and mad genius so rarely accomplished on such a large, splendid scale of destruction. The other reason, from a writing standpoint, is that I needed to see the movie again or else my review of Fury Road was going to consist of nothing but an unending stream of positive adjectives vomited upon the page in excitement. And for you, dear reader, I wanted to do better. Also, I wanted to see Mad Max: Fury Road again and I honestly wouldn't mind in the slightest seeing it again.In the post-apocalyptic future, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) is an aging warlord with his own fiefdom. He controls the water supply and has an army of gearhead warriors to enforce his rule. His trusted driver, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), is leading a caravan for supplies when she goes rogue, driving off into the desert. Furiosa has taken Immortan Joe's "property," namely his five wives. Enraged, Immortan Joe gathers a posse of death vehicles and riders and heads off to reclaim his "property." Max (Tom Hardy) is a drifter thrust into the middle of this conflict when he's strapped to a car and driven out into the desert, part of the Immortan Joe rapid response forces. There are few things more exhilarating in the realm of motion pictures than a well-executed, well-developed action sequence, and Mad Max: Fury Road is a blistering, awe-inspiring masterpiece of brilliant carnage. What director George Miller has achieved onscreen is visionary. The level of execution is so rarely seen at such a large scale, and with so many moving parts, that I was delighted and curious how something this extraordinary could escape the risk-averse studio system. I'm trying my best to restrain myself from sheer hyperbole, but this is an instant classic in the world of action cinema and a definite top five all-time action film (for those keeping track, I would say last year's Raid sequel would also qualify for that status). The movie provided me a font of joy that did not let up until the end credits ushered me out of the theater. The action sequences are epic in their scale, with dozens of different vehicles in hot pursuit, and yet Miller brilliantly orients his audience to every moment of his symphony of demolition. There are so many different parts to the action but the audience knows everything that happens. The sheer sense of momentum and pacing is overwhelming and giddy. The action sequences develop organically, with new consequences throwing our characters into different and dire directions. There's also a startling amount of variety with the action sequences. Fury Road has been described as a two-hour chase film, and that's accurate to a degree, but there are breaks in between the sequences, small moments to catch your breath and learn more about our characters and their hostile world. Each sequence is different enough that the action doesn't ever feel redundant, even when the third act literally requires the characters to backtrack. The adrenaline just doesn't turn off from the get-go, and Miller keeps throwing out new tricks, new stunts, and new cars to astound and amaze. Simply put, Fury Road shames other American film releases. The stuntwork is another facet that just raises the bar when it comes to action movies. Miller emphasized practical effects whenever possible, and the emphasis pay off with a heightened sense of realism onscreen. It's real cars being smashed to real bits, real stuntmen being tossed around. In an age of CGI over saturation, it's all too easy to become numb to big screen spectacle because of how hollow it all comes across visually. Just this past month with the Avengers sequel, I knew that all the fight scenes were mostly CGI or actors against green screens, and it eases off the enjoyment of the moment. Don't even get me started on the deluge of CGI carnage in the last Hobbit film. Real physical objects and physical interaction offer so much more believability in an age of increasing disbelief with special effects. With Miller's focus on practical effects first and foremost, it brings that sense of crazy excitement back and it ensures that Fury Road will hold up better over time. I also appreciated just how much thought Miller and his team put into crafting their world. Every detail feels like it adds to the overall richness of Miller's vision. The designs of the cars, the use of scrap, the fact that a pulley system is operated with children running up giant wheels, it all contributes to making the world better realized and more alive. The level of thought put into weird and deadly concepts in this movie is fantastic. Once the main characters pass through a bog of land, we see people dressed in cloaks traversing the land on stilts, and it's little passing details such as this that make the movie feel more complete. I enjoyed that one of Max's heroic attributes is that he's specified for his blood type, being O the universal donor. The fact that Miller finds a satisfying way to bring this attribute back as a payoff is also appreciated. I also enjoyed how Miller expands upon the family of Immortan Joe, with his bevy of freakish sons and brothers and peculiarities. I enjoyed the fact that Miller isn't afraid to embrace the weird of his dystopia, symbolized best by a blind guitar player attached to a roaming wall of speakers who can shoot flames out of his instrument. Every time the movie cut back to this guitar playing pace setter, I smiled, and I smiled a lot during this movie.Some have grumbled that Max is a supporting player in a movie that bears his name, but I would argue he is a co-lead and the real star is rightfully Imperator Furiosa. Max is not replaced with Furiosa, rather they have an inter-dependant relationship where they're both vulnerable and they both come to trust the other but without a romantic mingling. These are both wounded, shaken, mistrusting, and volatile people, and to watch their shared sense of teamwork and the gradual opening and reliance upon one another, it is itself an affecting and emotionally satisfying relationship. But back to Furiosa, it's really her story because she is the one with the personal connection o the mission. Max has always kind of been a wandering warrior who finds himself in other people's battles. Consider him a post-apocalyptic Man with No Name. Furiosa is the leader who has planned and implemented the escape from Immortan Joe, and it's she that deserves our attention. I enjoyed the fact that Miller doesn't even have to explain her past. We know she's suffered trauma, physical and likely sexual, and he assumes the audience does not need Furiosa's past abuse spelled out specifically for them, or seen in grisly flashback. She's a strong woman who is far from helpless with one arm. This is a story about women liberating themselves from sexual slavery under a corrupt patriarchy (more on the thematic relevance below). Theron is our leader and the ferocity in her eyes is all you need to know you believe that this woman will do whatever it takes for freedom.The other aspect that's very clear is that Fury Road is a decidedly feminist film but it never stoops to preaching or even directly calling attention to its efforts. It's a ruined world where men with unchecked power have exploited the vulnerable, where women are treated as "property" and valued for breeding purposes. Our heroes are by and large women who have rejected their roles in this society or are fleeing their impositions. And with Furiosa as lead, it paints a more than convincing picture of women being just as capable and badass in the post-apocalypse (I want to go as Furiosa for Halloween). It's a movie that portrays women struggling against an unjust system that devalues them but Fury Road doesn't wallow in their suffering. It doesn't have to in order to get its points across. It also treats the wives in a manner that lacks sexualization. Immortan Joe has treated them as property but Miller treats them as human beings, even going as far as to give them distinguished personalities. I'm not saying they approach three-dimensional characters but they're certainly not just eye candy. There's a sequence where they wash each other with a hose, and you could see the myriad ways this moment would go tawdry for some cheap titillation. What the Men's Rights Activists (sadly this is actually a thing) seem to have lost in their caterwauling is that feminism is not a zero-sum game; one person gaining stature and opportunity does not mean it's taken away from another. Just because Furiosa is strong it doesn't make Max weak. Furiosa being a compelling lead character does not diminish Max. It makes him an even better character because he recognizes her value and his own limitations, like a scene where he voluntarily hands over a rifle because he knows she's the better marksman. No one has to explicitly point and say, "Girls can do it too."There's also a fascinating commentary on the danger of religious fundamentalism with the war boys. These powder-white young men are Immortan Joe's armed forces and they are promised a swift appearance at the gates of their paradise if they die in battle ("Witness me!" is their exclamation before sacrifice). They spray paint their faces chrome ("Eternal, shiny and chrome") and then go in for the kamikaze kill. Again, the theme is ripe and obvious but without requiring characters to comment. Nux (Nicholas Hoult, wonderfully deranged and then sincere) actually has the closest thing to a character arc, going from hopeful martyr to independent thinker. He begins as a clumsy yet determined antagonist and becomes a resourceful and unexpected ally. This is practically a flawless film on a technical level. The cinematography by John Seale (Cold Mountain) is bright with lush colors that pop on the big screen. We've been treated to far too many color degraded films, so it's nice to view a movie that wants to use all the colors at its disposal. The musical score by Junkie XL (300: Rise of an Empire) is stirring and pulse-pounding with its heavy percussion, but there's a languid melody that returns again and again that is emotionally resonant. It's surprising how the score will punctuate the bombast and wailing guitars with a lovely string arrangement, like when we rush into the sandstorm and a car is blown into the sky. The editing is outstanding by Margaret Sixel (Happy Feet) and she keeps the audience informed with every new twist and turn, and with so many moving parts and changing dynamics, that is a miracle itself. The production design by Colin Gibson beautifully expands and informs this strange world. There isn't a department in Fury Road that wasn't at the top of their game.If I had to quibble, I could accept the argument that Mad Max: Fury Road lacks the substance to be much more than an exhilarating action ride. The dialogue can be a bit on-the-nose, Hardy mumbles through a majority of his miniscule lines, and the characters aren't as fleshed out as they could be and the plot is rather bare bones. However, I view its narrative economy as a virtue, as there isn't a moment or scene wasted in telling this breakneck tour de force of post-apocalyptic demolition. Rarely does an artist get to work at this level in the studio system let alone succeed with a final product that still manages to be strange, mordant, uncompromising, and completely riveting. This is a near-perfect action movie and a thrilling high-wire act of practical filmmaking bravado. Mad Max: Fury Road is the standard I am going to judge all summer movies by for the rest of the year, and I imagine many will be found wanting. I could continue to heap praise on the movie but the most persuasive stance I can make is that if you fail to see Fury Road on the big screen, you will always regret this decision. I am a disciple of Fury Road and witness my brethren and me. This movie was made for the biggest screen, the loudest sound system, and an endless bucket of popcorn. Nate's Grade: A	2
a4d0f1d3-afb5-4d08-9378-299656f7229c	  The visuals and production of this film are incredibly imaginative. The action sequences are different and fun, and while the story isn't great, it also isn't like many other movies out there. This film's uniqueness sets itself apart from your typical summer action flick.	2
36d9d3c6-97df-4c2e-84e4-1c425b222507	  Max accompanies a woman trying to rescue pregnant concubines from a despotic ruler.While there's no doubt that some of the action sequences are well-choreographed and mildly entertaining, the most important part of a film is its story. This one doesn't get started until about thirty minutes in, and the character development is sloppy, uneven, and unnaturally rushed. For example, we're supposed to believe that the frenetic war boy abandons his blind faith because of one embarrassing maneuver and the fact that he got to stare into a girl's eyes for two minutes. Those must be some eyes.The reason that story is so important, especially in action films, is that the audience must be kept in suspense about how the action sequence will end. Here, there's no doubt about who will survive; the only question is how, which isn't that entertaining.This film's champions shouldn't think that I don't get the gender politics here. I understand that the film puts women in positions of power, that it stands against sex slavery, and that its depiction of women is more progressive than many other films in the genre. That's all great and the reason why the film got one star instead of a half.Overall, this story is weak, and all the chase sequences in the world can't rescue a weak story.	0
59d27a0d-c3e2-4143-9663-c457430278aa	  Considering the wave of terrible 90's Scifi sequels/remakes we've had fired our way in the past few years (Terminator, Robocop, Total Recall etc.) Fury Road's success has been more than a pleasant surprise.It takes a lot of very 80's dystopian post-apocalyptic sensibilities and puts it in modern context. The relevant storytelling, characterization and heavy play on social themes make it a compelling tale but it's the barebones, relentlessly unforgiving visuals that make it a thrilling ride through and through.There's more to the world of Mad Max than sand dunes and angry people with automobiles though, with very little screen time Miller manages to convey a very elaborate society full of warrior tribes, caste systems and cultural/religious customs that are intriguing if not visually iconic.Let's also not forget the cast of characters representing a variety of minorities without feeling like forced tokens. A phenomenal performance by Charlize Theron breathes badassery into Furiosa and the manic Nux played by Hoult! It seems the best way to bring back the "strong silent type" hero is to in fact keep him silent. (who would've guessed?) Hardy skims by as Max with stern looks, grunts and single syllable words and for that we love him.At the end of the day Fury Road is both a nonsensical, visceral action packed adventure about a bunch of rebels fighting the system but also an intelligent character study with a dab of social commentary. Some of these folks are larger than life (Max) others victims/villains turned heroes (Furiosa, Breeders, Nux) which ever you appreciate more you're both cheering and enamored by the spectacle.	2
2230b950-fd5d-4372-9eca-ac0efe232650	  Over thirty years since the last instalment in the "Mad Max" franchise, Tom Hardy takes over the leading role once helmed by Mel Gibson, and takes the character to unseen heights. George Miller definitely waited for the perfect time to release this picture, coming out in an age where every action film relies on CGI. Displaying a perfect balance of practical and CG effects, the action pieces in this film are breathtaking to behold. Everyone in this film gives it their all, injecting fuel into this franchise that was believed to be dead long ago. The two main questions people will ask about this picture is does it live up to the original trilogy and will it welcome newcomers. I will say that you do not have to view the original films in order to know what is going on here, but it definitely will not attract people who have no clue what they are in for. "Mad Max: Fury Road" is a breathtaking spectacle (better than any I have seen in a long time), but it was a little too short on characters to really care about EVERYTHING that was going down. By the end of this film, I realized that it definitely was spectacle over substance, but the spectacle was so incredible that it will almost overshadow the bad upon every single viewing. In the end, I will say something that I have never said about any movie. It is a flawless film with many issues. My brain was going nuts during my viewing of this film, and I loved that. If you are planning on seeing this, please do so in the theatre, it is worth it. "Mad Max: Fury Road" is awesome!	2
5007a0bd-856b-4190-a9a1-572ebe123300	  Impressive action pretty much throughout, but I left the theatre pretty "mehhh" overall. For every awesome thing I can think of, there's three other weird things I can tell you about the movie. From what I hear, fans of the originals may get a lot more out of this one than people new to the franchise will......	2
7a9519ac-888a-4601-b67d-48d329b07686	  George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road holds no bounds in its trek across the desert landscape. "What a lovely day."Littered with little character buildup and a paper thin plot-line, the 2 hour adventure goes off-road with tons of vehicle carnage. There are enough story details, as needed, but ultimately, it's all there to setup the next incident on "fury road."The violence is erratic, over the top, and highly entertaining. A good combination of CG, as well as real vehicle demolishings come as advertised. There is so much going on, the film manages to leave the want for even more.Tom Hardy is a man of few words, it is no wonder the film belongs to Charlize Theron with Nicholas Hoult following in her footsteps. Seriously, the film could have been called Furiosa road.There's no secret here. Mad Max: Fury Road delivers what is expected of it.	2
cc3f59ce-34b7-4c00-a960-d9bdb1a53d1e	  A visual treat from start to finish! The costumes, the stunts, the action...every scene just bursts with vitality. Not to forget the sound...wow!! This is what the cinema is made for! Great to have this franchise back on our screens but it could've just done with being 15 minutes shorter.	2
1ce959db-34d0-4e65-8371-3be5b0371982	  Good heavens, this was awful. No plot, no character development, no point. Nothing but a pair of long chase scenes. Just hideous.	0
79f7401b-578f-40b5-9999-c8df3e4133e7	  An exciting, nonstop, thrilling story from beginning to end.	2
ea436c51-4607-4484-b41d-60a640906747	  Let me preface this by saying I'm not a fan of Mad Max. I was bored in Mad Max and was almost bored in The Road Warrior.I was underwhelmed. I heard all of the hype about how Mad Max: Fury Road was one of the greatest movies ever made and how it's a cinematic masterpiece. About how it gives you a rush and sometimes you need a break just to slow your heartbeat. I honestly don't get it.Maybe the hype behind the movie is what I see when I see Fury Road. What I see when I watch Fury Road is something that is just all spectacle. Is the action good to look at. You're damn right it is. The car carnage of the wasteland is incredible to look at. There's a guy with a flamethrower guitar! But that's not what I want to stand out the most when I see a movie.The main thing I look for when I'm watching a movie like this a a combination of exciting and engaging action, as well as a good story. This movie lacks the story part because it is too simple. There is not a lot about the wasteland and it's inhabitants that makes me interested about them. How did Furiosa get that arm? How did Imorton Joe rise to power? Who were those people that Max was haunted by? Who were those people on the sticks? There is no context given so I'm not interested and do not care. Is Furiosa a badass? Yes! But as cool as that is I don't care about her because I know so little.In summation Mad Max: Fury Road is all spectacle and nice to look at, but really nothing else.	1
37c648c6-5949-45d5-af46-ee519a11de86	  Post-modern feminism in the post-apocalypse. Good, but not great. Would have rated worse, were it not for some cool vehicles. A bit of a disappointment.	1

48709049-d721-4ff0-b2b0-c566eb8f1799	  Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best action films I've ever seen. A genuine work of art, it might by one of the top 3 contenders at the Oscars for Best Picture! It also DEFINITELY deserves to get recognition for it's use of vfx.	2
7867b544-8cec-4300-a219-f4a43b8648e8	  I'm not ready to hail it as the masterpiece that everyone else is calling it, but Mad Max: Fury Road is still a hell of a film. Needless to say the action is awesome, but the performances are fantastic and work hand in hand with the narrative and themes, and Charlize Theron as Furiosa is a triumph of a character.	2

4b5e808d-f775-4cb3-ab1f-4dae54441850	  The post-apocalyptic film can be hit or miss, but Mad Max: Fury Road has some of the best action and chase scenes put on film in the 21st century. Tom Hardy is a breakthrough action star to go along with his recent success as a dramatic actor. He's going to win an Oscar at some point. George Miller writes and directs this film as well as anyone, even at 70. I love it when women overshadow men in the action scenes!	2

924f9bc3-8665-492d-95ee-93fb5df9b1ea	  Great movie and I loved the fact that traditional methods of special effects were used, like with the new star wars movie, but I felt that it doesn't totally live up to the hype that most people give it. It's great, but not the best.	2
a95423d0-e723-4d95-89b2-b2d118a6822b	  Just when I thought the action movie genre really couldn't do anything else new and different, this proves me entirely wrong. Intense Action, distinctive style, and a concrete story make this a worthy installment in the Mad Max series	2

f640763e-d397-4693-98f9-f94d28c42229	  Two hours of insanity. Miller proves he is the king of gonzo high-profile action movies and a towering cinematic genius.	2
995017e8-f1a6-4124-abaf-2128b0995c00	  Mad Max: Fury Road improves upon its predecessors with a fourth round of breathtaking action. Writer-director George Miller finds himself at his peak bringing back to life the Road Warrior with a whole new cast that delivers some of the brightest performances of the year: Hardy was great, but it is Theron that owns the show with her iconic Furiosa that shall be reminded as of the most compelling contemporary heroins.	2
d0152e34-72b4-4b1d-bdda-585673f2aeac	  Fantastic action movie!!!! Spoiled ALL other actions movies for me. I've seen it twice in the theater and once at home. STILL LOVE IT!!!!!	2
de46568b-5048-4f70-b812-473828d82392	  i cant get enough of this movie. I pretty much think overall todays movies are garbage (they dont make em the way they used to), but this movie punches you in the face & doesnt let up. Thank you George for making a great piece of exciting entertainment	2
49456ddd-d3a4-4260-ae7d-3c059ee49e72	  A surprisingly worthy sequel to the original series. The director captured the ambiance of the desolate Mad Max universe through excellent photography and music. The action scenes are very good but I am saturated by the genre.	2
c78ccfee-46ae-4336-8046-16c9b712d805	  Mad Max: Fury Road is the best movie of 2015 hands down. It's one of those movies that gets better and better after each viewing, and it's the perfect example of how to do an action movie.	2
f4b9b19e-2cee-4f8c-9c00-4e12ecc062cb	  So, to preface, I have never seen a Mad Max movie. And everyone was telling me that I have to watch this, I would love it so on and so forth. And I'll be honest, in the first 15 minutes, I had no clue what I had gotten myself into. It was a little overwhelming. The types of movies that just throw you into a world with no explanation always throw me for a minute. But, what I will say is that once I'm in, I am sucked in 100%. And this I was sucked in 1000%. What is this society? Why is almost everyone from it sick? How did Furiosa become the only woman in power? Why is there a flame throwing guitar? Now, these are all questions that are still swirling around my brain, but in the moment, I could have cared less. I was simply along for the ride. The visuals are absolutely stunning (that sandstorm at the beginning. Holy hell.) The acting from the main characters is on point. (Charlize Theron is my queen.) The chase scene in the last half hour had me incredibly stressed out in the best way possible. The storyline was deeper than a typical action movie. I could honestly keep going. I would love to watch this again, now that I understand everything, and just dive in and go along for the ride.	2

0cb7c4f2-d7de-4d1c-94b7-a356a7725be3	  One of my favorite movies of this year, and possibly of all time!!! This movie was stylistically and visually beautiful. There was some really great world-building in this movie, and I love the subtly incorporated Viking/Nordic cultural influences in the Mad Max post-apocalyptic universe. I actually wasn't a huge fan of Tom Hardy, and likewise was also not blown away by Charlize Theron or any of the other acting in this movie. However, this movie was so beautiful, I couldn't resist giving this movie a resounding 5/5 stars!	2
4385dde4-8132-41eb-9fe9-50404e88b75c	  I found this movie to be incomprehensible and stupid - rescued to the two star level only by its stunning art design.Supposedly this is some "post apocalyptic" world we're in, but there is no back story presented to create any context for the characters or their motivations. Mad Max gets kidnapped and strapped to the front of a vehicle, and we watch cars blow each other up. There's not that much more going on - until maybe 60% into the movie when the Charlize Theron character explains she's trying to get back home - and eventually needs to return to where the movie started.There are bizarre kings and crazed punks and a few siren slaves whose presence appears, again with little context. People spray themselves with paint, one truck has a wonderful rock guitarist strapped to the front, whose axe shoots flames out of its neck. And this goes on for two and a quarter hours.However, the way the visuals are conceived is stunning. The home city has mammoth levels strung on hyper-industrial styled gears, with muscular percussionists pounding out something - for some reason. It looks cool. But to no intelligent end.	0

414ff708-f747-4e2e-ab34-ddcc564979dc	  As far as action films go, this is hands down one of the best of all time in my book. Nothing can amount to the fast-paced action. And for today's standards, with so many companies relying on cgi stuff, it is amazing to see a director/film finally taking the bold step to make an action film the good ole fashioned way, with real stunts and actors. George Miller really knocked this one out of the park. Not to mention a great performance by Hardy & Theron.	2
ce18601a-f8be-457d-9799-e1afcafeb3ae	  Just an excuse for a video game. Turned it off.	0
b02a7996-2b1d-4c53-b0f8-bbde53afe762	  In an era where action movies rely heavily on CGI, it's refreshing to see a movie like Mad Max. The film is a great combination of story, character development, stunts and action that's over the top in just the perfect amount.	2
bc9ccdc4-a5e3-44af-8f20-fefd5c6c18b2	  Boring. Mindless. All that running across the desert for no reason. Shallow, meaningless characters. Weird, stupid setup. Nothing believable or fun here.	0
fc5020da-c2c2-4559-8a25-60289c1dca54	  Artsie fartsie , whacked out crap. No wonder it was nominated for Best Picture the Academy is as whacked as this movie. Some films you just don't remake. Run far away from this !	0
af8827d5-5983-4517-88d3-2a6c2172beaa	  Better than the original with Mel Gibson and with an array of powerful female characters, this is a great action movie but should not have been a Best Movie nominee.	1

78629485-029a-4e26-8ab3-8c11b16f1ea4	  Mad Max: Fury Road is a continuation of the previous Mad Maxes and I thought this was pretty darn good. Watching this Mad Max you're sitting there going like, what am I witnessing? If you have never seen a Mad Max before that will be your reaction. Everything about the Mad Max universe is so different and special Bringing back Miller was the by far the best decision.Without him this movie would not have been anything close to what is was. Miller makes the movie feel like an original Mad Max film. From the weird skull guys, bad ass cars, and post apocalyptic wasteland, A great thing about Mad Max are the characters. Charlize Theron plays Furiosa, a girl who has stolen precious cargo from main villain, Immortan Joe, that all of his followers are after. Charlize Theron as Furiosa was the highlight of the movie. She is the most interesting and most impactful than any other character on screen. Fury Road is the ultimate thrill ride and definition of a good action movie. The action sequences and visual effects are so beautiful and amazing. Every shot is as real as it gets and looks spectacular. Definitely one of the best looking films of the year. The movie is so alive and bright that it makes it hard to keep your eyes off the screen because you don't want to miss anything. My biggest flaw in Mad Max is sadly Tom Hardy's portrayal of Max. I didn't feel his performance was strong enough or energetic like the character should be. But I overall I loved Fury Road. It's action scenes were amazing, awesome characters, and extremely well directed. Should be a fun watch for any Mad Max or action movie fan.	2
4b44c9a9-39e1-464c-814c-d2cd2ca5e8cc	  ish. no character build up so you even give a second thought to these people. not even close to the first mad max movie.	0

0c92f425-945a-4ec6-a1e0-2812bd7e1645	  Mad Max is the newest masterpiece in the infamous Mad Max movie franchise by George Miller, who returns after 30 years to direct this movie.Evey now and then, we have certain movies that become milestones for how great an action film can be. 1981: Raiders of the Lost Ark. 1988: Die Hard1991: Terminator 2: Judgemtn Day. 1999: The Matrix. 2008: The Dark Knight.and 2015, MAD, MAX, FURY ROAD!This movie is absolutely incredible! It is unbelievable, it is riveting, it is beautifully chaotic and desructive, and it is without question the best action movie of the decade. No other movie the past 6 years comes close to this masterpiece in terms of practical effects, stunt work, visual effects, sound editing, cinematography, directing and minimalistic, yet effective storytelling and qorld-building. Everything you need to know about its characters is told through actions, and decisions over heavy handed exposition. The pacing is something out of this world, being so extremely super crazy, yet so super awesome at the same time. While the story is nothing complez, it is still there, and serves its purpose rightfully without any forced scenery or visual pleasure.	2
9175de5d-5ab9-4ca0-a59d-146175ba68b0	  Horrifically gorgeous and beyond phenomenal, Mad Max: Fury Road's incredible aspects makes 2015 a year of success for cinematic experiences.	2

The movie was extremely monotonous, had little to no story, and I truly felt dumber for having watched it.... I liked the original Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome, not so much, but it was still head and shoulders above this one.... It is visually amazing, no question. But there was no story and dialog was barely above grunting...	0
db3a4beb-6eb4-4ff1-a678-c03085bf6a78	  I really had no desire to see this movie at first because I actually never saw a Mad Max film. But when I saw the trailers, I was blown away and I immediately became intrigued. Looking at the visuals and the action, this looks like everything I want to see in an action movie. After watching this film, I felt ashamed that I never saw a Mad Max film because Fury Road is AWESOME! It is such an adrenaline-filled rush that I feel like taking a nap after watching it. The entire movie is like one big chase. At first, I didn't think that much about it. I saw it as just a fun, heart-pumping thrill ride. I didn't think it had much story and not enough exposition for me to understand the characters. I thought because maybe it was part of a franchise and I didn't see the other films. But after multiple viewings, I saw that it was telling their story the whole time. It was all told through a visual medium. It's a film that doesn't contain much dialogue, so you need to follow the story through its visuals. Because of this, you can immediately understand the characters and the world they live in. The film also has a surprising amount of feeling and emotion. This helps us feel for the characters and adds a sense of humanity to the film. I say that the only people who wouldn't like the film are those who can't handle this kind of action or for those who have never seen a Mad Max film. But even some people who have never seen a Mad Max movie, like me, can still find a lot of enjoyment in it. I know I did. Mad Max: Fury Road was some of the most fun I've had all year and I'm sure it will please all fans of the franchise.	2
ea754575-6d88-499e-8d26-98419365c1db	  Excellent writing, great acting, a wacky and playful tone, amazing visuals. For what this film is (An Action-Adventure Post-Apocalypse Car-Chase film) Mad Max is perfect.	2
97703ee2-fd52-40b0-8118-0698683979d8	  Brilliant addition to the classic franchise that both manages to reboot with a new lead actor while continue the excellent story. Tom Hardy fills in for Max perfectly, rightly playing him as a man of few words but with a dark past. While some complained that is really more of Furiosa's story (wonderfully played by Charlize Theron), they forget Max is essentially the mysterious stranger who shows up to reluctantly save the day in each film since "The Road Warrior" (still the best of the franchise). The rest of the cast is also excellent, particularly Hugh Keays-Byrne as the villainous Imortan Joe. Behind the camera, George Miller crafts a brutal yet beautiful vision of the apocalypse like the never seen. The action sequences are breathtaking, made more so than they were done by real stunt people, and crafts a original world complete with its own religion ("Witness Me!" has fast become a popular sci-fi phrase) vehicles & costumes (Joe is a monstrous sight). Not just one of the best action movies in years but the best film of 2015.	2

ca9720cf-4df4-4e12-878f-60aa624b7df4	  Although its won audiences and critics alike the world over, this is not the definitive Mad Max film. A likeable cast heads a dystopian piece packed full of beautiful cinematics and jaw clenching action sequences. Yet despite this I left the film feeling a lack of awe and inspiration. This is in part due to the tiresome plot which acts as a prophetic odyssey but instead frames as a consistent action pursuit romp. Although played by the talented Hardy I found the titular lead underwhelming and underdeveloped. I feel this had less to do with Hardy's performative efforts and more to do with the characterisation in the script and plot. This may be in part a nostalgic attempt by Miller to homage its previous incarnation or an unfortunate side-effect from the emphasis on Theron's Furiosa. Whatever the reason, I find the underwhelming nature of such an original and iconoclast character to be a great departure from Gibson's lunatic apocalypse cop and as such the major downfall of the piece. Whilst certainly a good movie, one can't help thinking its not deserving of the multitudes of praise which it is being given	2

Also, for once in a long time, the hero in the movie is a woman, which automatically adds a different effect and meaning to the story, but it also makes it 100% better.	2

You cant help but noticing of the originality in this post apocalyptic world. It was so in depth that it reminds me of Tolkien. That's saying a lot. I mean seriously, he would write short novels about a stupid sword. I LOVED every aspect of this movie and hope George Miller has more to come!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2

9da9c354-9bdc-4518-822d-079ce796175e	  George Miller's Fury Road is full of car chases...in fact the whole film is a hyper presentation of the Mad Max world. Miller started out actually dealing with editing and the vehicle chases in the earlier Mad Max movies. This film is sped up literally in order to keep the pace and you definitely lose a sense of rational. It is a chase to be remembered with wild special effects. Tom Hardy is passable as Mad Max although he could be any man fighting his way through a dystopian society. Charlize Theron added her touch to her heroine of the piece with a relish that would make Sigourney Weaver in Aliens proud. Yet I kept on saying that this film is nominated against films like Spotlight and The Revenant. It certainly is well made though I do not think it warrants the nominations. I loved George Miller's eye for detail; he hired a mega team to handle it all. And its focus for detail showed up in earlier films. My favorite would be Babe; a story about a pig's life. Yet this picture is beyond Cecil B. DeMille and borders on a Pink Floyd' The Wall approach. You know there's a good guy, people to be saved, and the bad guys. And you work your way to the end. Afterwards you feel assaulted (the theatre had the volume turned on super high) and left breathless. It is a roller coaster ride of a movie. Yet I left the theatre not knowing or caring much for the characters. i wanted to explore Max's psyche further; he was no more than a persona much like Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name. In the age of video games, you would hope that detail would not be lost. In this case you will lose yourself in the design of the movie. Fantastic special effects and makeup are present. You can't help but admire the technical artistry. You just hope there would be more heart lurking somewhere in such a technical achievement.	1

I don't think it's that great and was not as good as i expect. I like it a little bit but that's because of tom hardy, There was no plot, Just explosions and best screening effects, There was not much acting. Part 1 of this movie i feel like leaving the movie theatre because it's just copying insurgent but i have seen 2 walk out. My Legs were shaking and shocked about seeing this movie. I thought the rest of the movie would be horrible and just makes me wanna give up on the rotten tomatoes website. let's just focus on the positive things, There are 3. What I heard is this was stunning and indeed a courage of dismandable filmmaking. Let me just tell you a few.The Plot Gone Horribly wrong, The Story is all about action and the acting was really really good!My Score Opinion: 67/100	2
a09f226c-be4e-4f5c-a2ba-0ee06bc3cddb	  This film looks great. It should win a few of the lesser oscars due to how it looks on our screens. The story is basic, the cast are not challenged to put in a good performance but this is still a very enjoyable film.	2
a0da8480-8573-4092-9f24-fcc2de7a733e	  It's a highly stylized, action packed, bloody, gory, over-the-top film that probably appeals to the majority of 18 to 30-year-olds who've spent a lot of time playing equally bloody video games. The story is pretty basic: women escape from hell looking for liberty and life, only to return after killing the evil ruler and his main henchmen to start anew. Oh, and the top babe almost, I said almost (remember now this is the apocalyptic future; no time for hope here) has feelings for her accidental saviour. Ah, what a romance. With many of the horrific, destructive fight scenes fought at such an exaggerated, frantic pace, it's a surprise all involved don't merely die from heart attacks. But you get a general idea what the film is going for when the bossman's babe is dead, and he has one of his henchmen cut the dead mom open only to see if his baby is alive, and upon finding that he is dead (I almost had a baby brother! I almost had a baby brother!) he is tossed aside like so much dead meat. At times the antics of the death squad is so silly its almost comical, such as when they spray their teeth with chrome, an allusion to the love for the shiny vehicles they worship as they hope for a battle death to take them via glory to Valhalla. An often silly, even unnecessarily abusive film to convey a story of little import that means little to most, that is unless you're an aspiring death squad recruit looking to take out the boss man to glory and victory. Spray! Spray!	1

e2a86251-9a5f-47b9-bce2-25822d46c8a9	  My anticipation was high. Academy Award nomination for best picture. Almost 100% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. Over 80% on IMDB. Charlize Theron. Great reviews. But this is where the fun stops.What a dud it was, despite all the action. Story? "A woman rebels against a tyrannical ruler in post apocalyptic Australia in search for her homeland with the help of a group of female prisoners, a psychotic worshiper(sic), and a drifter named Max."I guess if you have great memories of the original movie or if you have a thing for George Miller, this was the greatest thing ever --especially in super duper 3d. To me, it was a never-ending car chase from point A to B and then back to A, filled with fighting scenes, flat characters, supermodels turned wannabe-actresses and an almost mute protagonist. What else did I expect from a schizophrenic writer/director who not only created the Mad Max franchise nearly forty years ago, but whose last three writing and directing credits are Babe: Pig In The City and Happy Feet 1 & 2?I guess I expected too much. Even with so much garbage polluting the big screen these days, this one didn't rise above most of the big budget muck that we get to 'enjoy' as entertainment. I'm not even going to waste more words on this one. Sorry, I didn't get it. Shame it made almost half a billion dollars at the box office. There will surely be more of the same this year or the next.Pros: lots of hypeCons: everything elseVerdict: avoid	0
ceda2c37-d725-4a92-993f-f524f8f1bf01	  Although quite grotesque in it's style and imagery - something I rarely like - in cinematographic and storytelling terms, it's highly refined.I did not like it at first, the introduction fell flat with me, some scenes felt sped-up and it was just weird. I also felt that the world felt absurd and comic-y, and indeed it is. The film does not shy away from this fact, it actually embraces it.The characters felt real and their motivations felt real enough for me to eventually be drawn in, despite the absurdity of the setting.And this, I can respect.Yes, it had some gruesome scenes of violence, but it didn't focus on them.This was my first Mad Max film, I assume the flashbacks/hallucinations somehow connect to the previous films. Happily, they weren't overused and the plot didn't hinge entirely upon them, so even a newb like me can enjoy this film.	2
fb0bbc16-63d7-4d48-977d-9ec625025190	  Fury Road illustrates how far the Mad Max story has evolved or devolved as this viewer would attest. Upstream, the first Mad Max was a unique & exhilarating dystopian nightmare of a semi-horrific road rage film encapsulating the raw brutishness of the Australian collective consciousness of the 1970s. Remember it wasn't made that long after Aboriginal First nations peoples gained the right to vote. And then truck engine sized cars roamed the Aussie roads where roadside eucalyptus trees had big American copies of GM and Ford cars wrapped around the trees making them look like tinsel on Aussie Christmas trees set in the blinding heat and dust of the outback. One could be forgiven for feeling like being in A George Miller film even outside the cinema in the Australian reality of the time. Fury Road has a Jerry Bruckheimer-ish feel to it with Australian models who act like a gang of bangers from Zoolander walking down the catwalk with David Bowie wincing at their garish Derelict Ozzie-style clothing. But the film has somehow captured an audience who seeks solace in a cinema from the ever-present real thrills and spills of the dominant paradigm of daily worldwide terrorism events.	0

073bcf33-0871-4b08-af30-698bf9c4de92	  Another sign the Apocalypse has (literally) descended upon the Motion Picture Academy: Mad Max: Fury Road gets 10 Oscar nominations, including a Best Picture. I'm sorry but did they see the same film I did?! It was Fast and Furious in fright wigs and KISS makeup! And the only acting was Charlize Theron with one arm and a shaved head snarling at everybody. Of all the great films to come out of Australia over the last 40 years and they pick this?!! With profound apologies to Trumbo, Steve Jobs, The Danish Girl and especially Straight Out of Compton, this is just piss poor entertainment politics. (Come back "Doomsday" all is forgiven!)	0

72d7ed39-4ff6-4b0c-a2d2-04a8d359abe5	  I was one of the many that has never seen a Mad Max film, so I wasn't expecting much. I was blown away in that regard! Max Max is insanity on the silver screen; chaotic when there is action going on and surprisingly quiet and peaceful in lulls. The pacing is excellent.Tom Hardy plays Max, a man of little words but many actions. He was captured by Imperator Joe and his War boys, and enslaved to them, forced to give his blood to keep the sick war boys alive and make them stronger.While Hardy is the leading name, I feel that the two best performances were actually by Charlize Theron as the fierce Imperator Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult as Nux, the endearingly reverent War boy. Despite the performances, Miller's vision is by far what makes the film a rousing success.Mad Max is white-knuckle excitement at its highest octane, and I would be hard pressed to deny that I had so much fun watching it.	2
4b03a727-b67b-4cb6-a32c-581d802f9b32	  The best film of 2015 and maybe of the decade so far.	2
74bca9ff-c69d-4ce6-89f5-d8443813f60a	  Absolutely nuts and a visual and auditory spectacle. Anyone who saw a trailer for this movie got an idea of what they were in for when coming in to see Mad Max: Fury Road. Few viewers besides the most ardent of fans will remember or perhaps even alive when the last film came out three decades ago, but Fury Road will surely push them to dig up that one and retrace the history of the series.Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron both are fantastic, and the action scenes are fun and exciting to watch. However, any attempt to fully describe the experience of watching Mad Max is in for an impossible task. Just watch it.In my first viewing, while I had some appreciation for the emotional heart of the film, it didn't hit as hard for me as it apparently did for others. However, after giving it another go, I came to grasp the heart and the message. One of the most entertaining watches in a while...*guitar riff*.	2

14593933-2115-4588-bb10-88f24e1c30e1	  Shockingly bad- particularly considering the attention it's getting. The characters are thin and barely have a believable moment. The acting is good for the most part- it's the writing, the dialogue, and ultimately the directing. The story arc is simple- not necessarily a bad thing in an action movie- but the actions of virtually every character is so far off the believability track it quickly becomes a jumbled mess. The director was more obviously more interested in creating a visually stunning string of intense scenes than a good story. Should have been cut down to a seven minute music video.	0
031c337b-e1dc-480e-af6a-45e810b3bd7f	  Not exactly my full cup of tea, but not a bad film. Is it deserving of an Oscar nomination over others, I don't think so. However, George Miller does a great job with special effects and action scenes. Tom Hardy is not bad, but Theron is the star of the film. Very well done...but not my favorite movie of 2015.	2
bdb7498e-62ab-4b91-9269-f250cec1c7e2	  Rating this movie is hard for me because I completely don't get the whole Mad Max thing. I tried with the older movies since they were highly reviewed and was bored with them and tried the updated version after having it in my queue \ for two months and was bored with it too. Yes the visuals are fantastic, Charlize Theron is fantastic of course, but I just couldn't get past how shallow and silly the whole premise of it all is. Sure, there are some ironies there and as a popcorn flick for the masses it is not exactly difficult to follow. I just can't do it and despite the manic action sequences I was bored and as soon as they said they were going all the way BACK to where they started I was out. I simply do not have the patience to go through all of that nonsense in reverse and could care less how it ended. I rate the story at like maybe a half star but gave it 3 because Charlize's screen presence mixed with the high budget style and CGI is worthwhile just to look at despite the story line. I can't forget to mention Nicholas Hoult, who has officially sealed his title as World's Most Endearing Zombie.	1

3236667f-0238-4eac-afd0-fc01c4fdefbb	  An action masterpiece through and through, it's plain and simple! Since the days of 'Die Hard' and 'Terminator', the action genre has turned into a repetitive, over-the-top array of films trying too hard to create entertaining sequences that instead look too cheesy due to bad composition or an overuse of CGI, of course along the way we have had some fine exceptions in the style of 'Casino Royale' and 'The Dark Knight', but certain directors *cough* Michael Bay... don't seem to be able to use their knowledge of an action sequence to its full potential and instead have constant fiery explosions and over-the-top shaky camerawork among other things... oh but then there's 'Mad Max: Fury Road', talk about epic action pieces. It has been 30 years since the release of 'Beyond Thunderdome' back in 1985, and George Miller decided to return to the directorial chair for a Mad Max reboot, and my God, he truly is a mastermind of action. After creating the epic scale of an action film in the form of 'Mad Max: The Road Warrior' it was going to be hard to live up to the previous films in the franchise, but Miller didn't just do that, he excelled at it and instead beat his previous films. With Tom Hardy as the new face of Max and Namibia as the new backdrop for post-apocalyptic Australia, 'Fury Road' is an exhilarating action fest that goes beyond its boundaries in creating what might just be one of the greatest action films ever made. Hearing that nearly 90% of the stunts and effects were practical literally blew me away, the sequences are extravagant and complex with frequent fireballs and car crashes filling the screen. George Miller's 2015 vigorous tale blends emotion and brutality with drama and action to reignite Australia's greatest film franchise and create the epitome of the action genre.	2

6899798a-8ff6-49de-9a06-f33a05cc0682	  Madness. If this were a hokey movie blog that chose to describe movies in a single word, that is the word I would use to describe this one. When you walk into a movie in 2015 and it grabs you by the exhaust pipe and makes you squeal, you say it is madness. I'm not a world traveller, I'm not a centenarian and I don't drive a cab in New York City. I don't feel or claim to have 'seen it all.' I don't even want to 'see it all.' But in 2015, moviegoers as a breed do have that mentality about them. There is a chip on the shoulder of the undulating masses who put on their jazzy showtime boots and rip a ticket to a flick, shovelling chemical kissed corn fluffs into their mouths on a Friday night. 'Horror? Seen it. Tragedy? Seen it. Comedy? Thriller? Western? Romance? Action? Hell, I've seen plenty of action! I've seen action films you've never even heard about', they might say. And woe to the ever optimistic purveyor of fine action cinema. For he knows not the battle that he is embroiled in is a battle that has already been fought, and lost, before the first frame is even considered. Because the very audience he is so eager to please, with their noses high and their postures erect, have already made their minds up. And who can blame them? For truly they have 'seen it all.' But they haven't seen this. Mad Max: Fury Road is a cinematic revelation. And with its fist clenched tight, it will take great pride in walloping your senses with a kaleidoscopic triptych of master crafts: sight, sound and touch. Not touch in the literal sense perhaps. There won't be any oily chrome under your ass or Outback gravel under your feet (unless you have found the coolest theatre in the world). But the film is so full and so thick with ideas and invention, and pulls it off in such grand fashion, that damned if you won't feel grit between your teeth or wind in your hair as a dozen roaring, manslaughtering vehicles cascade in a symphony of chaotic road rage from stage left to stage right and back again. You will certainly feel the effects of the Australian desert in the dryness of your mouth halfway through the film, when you realize that your mouth has been agape for a solid hour. Because this film, this madness, doesn't ease in. It starts fast and heavy. It starts in bleak conditions and future foreign saturation. It starts this way before you've had time to finish reading that text from your mammy and continues on in this way, with little respite, for two solid hours, until the final battle of petrol and honour commences. Do we lament the lack of dialogue? We don't. Shakespeare, this is not. Flowery, overly descriptive wordplay curling round itself, fighting for attention, for itself and for its creator (not unlike the words you have before you now) would serve only to get in the way of the reason for the (killing) season. This is evidenced in the few blocks of dialogue we are, frankly, hampered with and their awkward placement within the story and equally awkward delivery by the otherwise capable acting talent on roster. But how much exposition do you need? It's all right there in front you. Vehicles, war machines, kitty grinders, good guys, bad guys, damsels in distress, blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts (except, possibly, for the last two). Is there a message beneath the motor oil? There is. And depending on who it is you are and what it is you're looking for, it is perhaps an environmental one. Or a sociopolitical one. Or a feminist one. Or a pre-apocalyptic one. Or even a familial one. Enjoy the one you have. It's the only one you've got. So this, it seems, is something worth seeing. This is for you, moviegoer, you who have seen it all. This is special. And it has a special effect. One beyond the 1,500 some odd special effects shots in the film. Shots which, according to legend, were achieved 90% practically and therefore only 10% digitally (which is astounding when you see them in action). Shots which sported a sea of extras. Extras which sported among their ranks talents as impressive as Olympic athletes and Cirque Du Soleil performers. No, the special effect of which I speak is that rare beast that, if you're lucky, you can experience once in the bluest of moons on the biggest of screens and in three dimensions if you feel so tickled (though that third dimension isn't necessarily a necessity). We call this effect 'pure cinema.' I call it madness.	2
3b6961e1-445b-4d39-84f3-403fa8267bd1	  Quite a shock when I saw the super high rating for this movie. Yes, there were spectacular locations and outstanding chase scenes, but that's it. Bacially, the movie was just one continuous chase scene w/a explosion fest thrown in for good measure. What's missing? Well, a damn story for starters. Very weak at best, with so little character development it left gaping holes in the whole escape from the tyrannical bad man scenario.Another glaring omission, was no Australian actors! This apocalyptic world of Mad Max is suppose to be in Australia. I guess the Casting Director went out for drink when these actors were chosen. Bad idea. All American accents, and NO Aussies. Maybe for this flick, it didn't make much difference as there is so little dialog between actors and their weak-ass story. Non-stop chase scenes w/gratuitous killing gets a bit stale w/o a decent story to fill-in. Under The Thunderdome quality it ain't there by a long shot. BTW, I am a BIG Mad Max fan, but this re-boot misses the mark for me.	1
a802ede0-4134-4fa3-b580-9e44e554bbae	  Cant believe this is up for Best Picture on several contests, including oscar. Visually spectacular. But soon could not tell who was shooting and killing who. But then, it really didn't matter, as long as someone was shooting and killing someone.	1
76e9903a-7ddf-41d4-b93c-ad099176488b	  WHAT A LOVELY DAY, INDEED. this movie is everything the trailers made it look like it would be - a totally insane thrill ride roller coaster of a film from start to end.The film opens with revving car engines, the perfect prelude to the smashing, racing, crashing action you're about to see. The casting is pretty awesomely perfect, and Tom Hardy's demeanor fulls up the pages of script he doesn't talk through.A few big takeaways: obviously, the action and stunts were breathtaking. If there's a film out there that makes a better case for practical stunts and effects, I haven't seen it. Everything in this movie is based around real explosions, real crashes, and the interaction with the physical environment, therefore you end up with an incredible scale of thought and detail put into the reasons for everything and some pretty amazing visuals to accompany the story. Another thing is the extreme visualism with which George Miller has brought back to Mad Max is absolutely stunning; it creates amazing editing and action that is so in your face but at the same time easy to follow and understand. Finally, the soundtrack almost never leaves and, while loud and crazy, sets its paces and sticks with the action incredibly well. The movie is even self-aware about it's music, pairing it with a specific vehicle in the film that forces the viewer to be reminded about the music playing and brings it to light constantly, but not so much as to distract.As with most, there's also an incredible feminism empowerment plotline to the story that shines, but doesn't feel forced. There's just strong and powerful female characters that kick all the ass, straight and simple. There's no reason why or why not, and that's what all movies and filmmakers should take as a huge lesson from Fury Road.Definitely make a point to get to the theater for this one - a small screen will GUARANTEED not do the action justice. I'll be seeing it in IMAX next week, which I would also recommend.	2

2177b930-aca5-4039-bb4b-dd581ca7b582	  Holland may not be as striking of a hero as Gibson, but he carries the film with the help of other memorable characters. The movie winds up feeling like one long chase, which does get tiring eventually, but the action is grand and things get rough. Fury Road is a fun time, with modern effects and techniques but it feels classy.	2
97096aa9-fad1-4545-bded-6deeaf4e4ed5	  Overall, this film was not good... just a Michael Bay want-to-be "big explosions but no real plot and no character development at all"... I was extremely surprised that it was nominated for Best Film at the Golden Globes! The film that should not be nominated for any awards! Except for maybe "Special FX"... but for a film, it's laughable.	0

c447dbb5-7a7c-41d6-9e11-ec87706443e9	  I watched this on an airplane, just as everyone else was leaving. It's probably not an ideal setting to watch this A-list action movie, but that's okay. I jotted down notes. Here they are:- My first Mad Max movie- Great action movie, decent drama- Action was fun and extremely fast-paced, sometimes to the level of not following what was happening- I did enjoy the action, but for a two-hour movie, it could have used more variety- Sprawling world of a desert, which, as empty as it was, was easy to understand in its geography- Disconnection between characters led to an aura of mystery- The cause was established in a short and sweet package; don't expect anything revolutionary or elaborate- Characters connect simply on grounds of not liking status quo and seeking redemption, without one of our heroes (Tom Hardy) even revealing his name until near the climax- Extra points for avoiding romantic mumbo jumbo in favour of developing strong female roles, led by Charlize Theron- Ultimately, redemption is achieved...? It's unclear, perhaps so that sequels are justifiedTo round up my points in a paragraph, I hesitate to hail this as one of the best action movies of all time. None of the characters were memorable, even in their mysterious ways. Neither was there a singular great action moment that still resonates in me. The whole package was definitely greater than the sum of its parts, and, as a whole, I had a good time. As a drama, the relationships between all of the characters, with a silent agreement to fight for the same cause, intrigued me most. As an action movie, I can see myself having an even greater time, when watching this on a screen larger than my head. I cannot speak for Mad Max fans, so as a newcomer to the franchise, I dig the world. You are definitely still relevant, George Miller.	2

5018b2d9-45c0-4c45-a6e2-a14baf78458b	  This is what happens when you have a visionary filmmaker with an idea in his head for 30 years. A film so energetic, so well-oiled and with a story that moves along faster than Max's own Interceptor that you just want to keep going back in over and over again once its finished. The first thing I love about it is Miller's direction. He almost completely does away with the shaky-cam fight scenes of recent action films and now, finally, we have someone who knows when to employ what technique. When to use slow motion (or when to go fast motion), when to cut to maintain suspension of disbelief but also to keep the viewers understanding of the scene and all its players intact. Miller also accomplishes something extraordinary with the characters of the film - here we have fully fleshed out, three dimensional characters but with barely a word of dialogue. Characters are developed as we see the world they live in. We feel for Nux because at the start he is just cannon fodder, unremarkable when standing next to the other warboys (A surprisingly easy thing to relate to in the real world). We feel for Furiosa because she has made it through so many implied hardships and has come out fighting on the other side. The character of Max is already developed fully through the canon of the original films, but Miller recreates this character by showing us his past through his fevered hallucinations, so the film works as a standalone piece as well as a part of the canon. Something else this film has received noteworthy praise for is its female leads, and personally I have yet to see a film do this as well as this one does. Yes, the female characters in this film are in the foreground and are all holding their own with the men, but it never addresses this, it just lets them do their thing, almost as if - could it be possible - woman can be proactive too??!	2

7274e5a7-42da-4970-bf95-e2c5b7bcdd53	  Awful bastardization of the franchise. Tom Hardy actually does a decent job, but it not allowed to run with it, as Charlize Theron's character takes over. We were promised a film spanning the time between Mad Max & Road Warrior. Instead we got a remake of Road Warrior. Mother's milk? Really? What was Miller thinking?	0
9c777927-eaff-4012-ae88-8a0096f86d57	  Mad Max is non-stop, nitro-injected, action-movie glory. Nobody is making movies like this and I doubt anyone ever will with such success. Like the hunt for resources in the vast, barren world of George Miller's imagination, you'll truly have to scavenge for a single pot-hole on the Fury Road.	2

bdab5791-3c50-4c15-a6df-31cba779055f	  This is the first Mad Max film I have watched. Sure, I've seen clips from the earlier ones but it never grabbed me. If it was not for several friends telling me about the anti-patriarchy themes I may have passed over this one as well. I am glad that I did not. I watched it originally in the theater a week, or two, into it's release and I knew that it would easily be one of my favorite films of the year (especially considering how few new films I watch in their year of release). The bottom line is that the story is more important than the vehicle. It is an incredible action film and marrying the story with the action is important and it's main strength but I am suggesting that the action/chase movie is could be bigger. There is little time spent on building relationships between the characters and the viewer. Now is a good time to remember that I prefer drama films so this could be the perfect feminist action film and I may not recognize how perfect it is.I waited to watch it a second time because I wanted to have a better sound system which I now have. The first time one of the diesel engine turns over it sounded perfect and then I turned the base down; I could feel the nails shaking loose.Mad Max: Fury Road is an important movie and should be enjoyed.	2

a3936190-aeab-4150-8ac6-861b9171e015	  The purpose of a metaphor is to compare a subject to another thing so that your listener better understands the point you're trying to convey. I will do that now. One of my favorite metaphors for describing movies, other than sandwiches and burgers, is to compare them to complex machinery. A movie is like a machine in that it is full of moving parts, all of which work with each other to perform the machine's job. With many machines, not all of the parts may be functioning, but they still more or less work. It's only when all the parts work as they're supposed to that the machine works at its optimum capacity. This is how I'd describe Mad Max: Fury Road, George Miller's return to the franchise after a 30 year hiatus. (Has it really been that long?) I regret not seeing this one in theater, first viewing it on my laptop, which diminished the experience for me. However, that did not stop me from loving this movie, and my affection towards it has only grown with each subsequent viewing.Fury Road combines two of my favorite things about movies for a really great package: big spectacle and meaningful storytelling. These sometimes get mislabeled as being mutually exclusive, but this film seems to be a big middle finger to that notion. Miller uses big action set pieces to tell a story about survivors, monsters, cults, and the overthrowing of tyranny to set up a benevolent matriarchy. That last one may seem a bit odd for Mad Max, but thankfully the more laid back script keeps it from being too on-the-nose. That's another thing I like about Mad Max, there isn't too much exposition. The opening shot tells you all you need to know to get caught up on the scenario, whether you're a newcomer to the franchise or a returning fan. Everything else important to the story is shown through visuals and character interactions. For example, Max is very different from how we last saw him, and I don't mean that he's played by a different actor. A lot of time has passed since he last interacted with another human being, but this is never told directly to you. Instead, the audience is trusted to figure out by the way Max behaves. He's not so good at talking anymore, speaking in low grunts and pantomiming with a shotgun in order to order people around. Likewise, we know that Immorten Joe's group of followers, the War Boys, are cultists because of their mad devotion and willingness to throw away their lives, even though the word "cult" is never mentioned once in the film. I think the Mad Max movies are a great example of how you can show instead of tell in order to make a more compelling story.There wasn't a single moment that the film lost me. Miller understands the audience's need for practical effects, mostly keeping the CG invisible to viewers. The only really obvious use of CG is the crazy scary sandstorm with the tornadoes and lightning bolts, and, man, wasn't that really cool? Yeah, this whole movie is cool, which is important for an action movie. Thankfully everything's always moving forward, nothing stopped.I could go on and on, but this is just an RT review I'm doing for fun. If this was for a publication, I'd be more thorough and professional-sounding, but nobody's going to read this but me. If you do happen to stumble upon this and wish I wrote more, well, sue me.	2

26bb5e6e-948c-4c22-916e-0a7807c77fd8	  This movie was one of the best hard action movies of all time. Yes very entertaining but never failing to teach lessons on issues such as global warming, depleting world resources, greed, exploitation and poverty, religion, roles of women ect. The movie itself was physically creative and original. It was a road traveled with constant anxiety and wonder with pleasing surprises. And although it barely reaches emotional it is unforgettable.	2

92162cf3-cef0-4d01-afc6-9f30d823303a	  There has been talk of George Miller returning the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Max Rockatansky for quite some time. It seemed unlikely that the director, now known for such family-friendly fare as Babe and Happy Feet would decide to revisit the world he created with the first Mel Gibson as Mad Max back in 1979. So I was surprised when Miller decided to direct another installment with Tom Hardy taking on the role Gibson played in the first three films. Hardy is an excellent choice, he is good actor and has a great physical presence and can suffer photogenically like Mel did (especially in The Road Warrior). But Max is almost a secondary character in this film, Charlize Theron plays Imperator Furiosa whose rebellious act stealing the brides of Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the Toecuter back in the first Mad Max film). Missing an arm (thanks to CGI) and with her hair cut surprisingly short, the de-glamorized Theron is just as riveting and physical in her performance as Hardy. The first half of the film is a chase and second half is a race. And yes, there is a surprising feminist subtext to the film as well as a not-so-surprising environmental subtext to this film.	2
2e13b15f-198c-4eab-9455-4cf14cffa9e7	  Greatest film of 2015 and deserves a watch. It is action packed for the whole movie and keeps you on the edge of your seat. A movie with nearly no dialogue is in my opinion the best movie of the year. Also with all the practical effects makes some damn interesting film making. Everyone should see this well directed and well captured film	2
8cf4c931-dab4-4d1d-8224-67a6d196eb38	  Mad Max Fury Road came out of nowhere and was a fun exhilarating joy ride throughout the entire film.

I've seen the movie seven times on big screen because I know that it won't replicated anywhere, this is probably the only film that I appreciate all of the non-action sequences because the action are so mind-blowing and spectacular that I felt it melted my face afterwards, I think I hurt my jaw after watching this film.	2
bcf42a34-6d36-449c-bd3b-1cffd15b60e6	  First, the positives. Theron and Hardy were magnificient and was rightly cast for this movie. The stunts were amazing as well as the CGI. Not a dull moment really, the movie kept a good pace and 2 hrs flew by.Now, those are what makes this bearable, if you can get past the ridiculous story, ridiculous premise, etc... To be honest? Perhaps it is a cultural thing. As an Asian, I just can't seem to understand why would anyone think up of such a ridiculous post-apocalyptic future. Perhaps this is what happens to white men when the world goes awry.EDIT: I changed this from 2 stars to 4 after watching it a couple more times. I think it really is about getting past the premise. This is not meant to be a serious film, just an action packed science fiction. Also, reading up on more of the pre-stories helped understand a lot of misconceptions in the film.	2

I can't even say this film had to be acted all that well because it's secondary to the action sequences and Maxes grunts which I guess is also part of the action cause it definitely isn't part of the dialogue. Having Charlize didn't hurt. No story. A mind numbing ride without too much effort required by any of the actors to portray anything other than shock, fear, dismay and hope.

The first 30 minutes set the tone perfectly : do not expect any coherence, depth of characters or, well, anything other than full in-you-face action here. Nothing stands up to scrutiny, no character holds up to any real logic, and of course it has nothing to do with the first movies of the same franchise.Let it be noted that Charlize Theron is the real main character here, and plays her part with talent and charisma, which sorely lack in Tom Hardy.	0
985b6244-a869-41fc-932a-1a0cfe27be5c	  As a fan of the original Mad Max trilogy, I was hesitant to watch this one as there was an American input to an Australian classic, but realizing George Miller was at the helm, I gave in and was happy I did. Tom Hardy did the role justice, but wasn't as good as Mel Gibson, and unlike most of the other reviewers I wasn't overly impressed with Theron. The hit is George Miller's vision of what an action movie should be, so I can recommend this one to all Mad Max fans	2

f0aa0199-622c-4a98-951a-45b51c7afdfe	  The surprise smash hit of 2015, Mad Max: Fury Road is a sequel/reboot to George Miller's Mad Max (1979). What's strange about Miller is that apart from his Mad Max franchise his biggest accomplishments have been writing both Babe and Happy Feet. Very peculiar then that from the same director comes literally the most action packed film of the last decade. Unfortunately however this very strength becomes its greatest weakness.Whilst visually stunning there is barely a narrative driving the action foreword. The story goes that in a post apocalyptic wasteland, where chrome and oil are worshipped and water is in short supply, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) decides to run away from Immortal Joe, the man in charge of said chrome, oil and water, taking all of his 'wives' with her. That's essentially it, what follows next is a two hour long car chase. Somehow this Max character (Tom Hardy) tags along for the ride and apart from being able to drive in a straight line and being nifty with a wrench doesn't really add much.Theron's Furiosa is amazingly bad-ass and the only really likeable character. It's worth mentioning that it's great to see a strong female lead in an action film such as this. Hardy's Max on the other hand barely says ten words and doesn't really feel justified as the titular character. Nicholas Hoult gives an unrecognisable performance as Nux a young 'war boy' but any real hope of a character arc, for him and nearly all characters, is sacrificed in place of crane cam shots of exploding vehicles.The mostly practical visual effects are amazing to behold and Miller should be applauded for his return to physical effects and sparse use of green screen. It's visually stunning but only remains interesting for so long. Coming in at exactly two hours it felt at least half an hour too long. When Max and friends finally escape their pursuers I thought it was over and the perfect ending point, however this was not the case. They make the decision to return through the desert from where they came to confront their captor. At this point I felt cheated, not only were all the previous car chases pointless now there was to be another half hour of exactly the same.Fury Road is an amazing technical achievement and should be recognised as such but unfortunately in order to uphold this, narrative and character development are sacrificed.	1

5cdc7d63-0d78-41cd-8a1b-fcd6f923aab6	  15 year old production hiatus, drastic changes in shooting locations, cast revamp. The fact that Mad Max Fury Road, the 4th installment of a long forgotten but highly revered franchise was made braving all these odds is nothing short of an incredible event in the recent movie history. And oh yes it's a sight to behold.Fury road takes us back to the arid dystopia which auteur George miller introduced about 35 years ago. Only now Miller has upped his game by several notches. Thanks to the massive $ 150 mn budget and creative freedom conferred on the creators by the studio. Landscapes are brighter, more dreadful, vehicles bigger and more revved up, the mad madder. Enter Immortan Joe, a ghoulish dictator/self-proclaimed messiah who has taken over an entire citadel by stealing its water supply. Under his wing is an army of ailing skinheads called the 'War Boys' who have been promised slots in Valhalla in exchange for suicidal fanaticism towards Joe and his ideas. This works very well given the downcast society where everyone is looking for redemption . Status quo turns into bedlam when Joe's army imperator, Furiosa (Played by the dazzling Charlize theron) goes rogue after stealing Joe's most prized possessions, his wives during a supply run. What ensues is a long exhilarating, chase sequence between furiosa and Joe accompanied by his army of white minions. Thrown in the midst of all this chaos is Max Rockitanksy who is picked as a human power cell by Nux, a starry eyed war boy for his pursuit on fury road. While max was rigged with ample gadgetry in the previous movies he is stripped down to one single instinct, that of survival (The Famous interceptor is shredded between two giant trucks in one of the scenes). Against will he is forced to help furiosa and the wives flee to a safe haven called the green place. Lean plot? Yes. Shallow? Definitely not. Amidst all the edge of the seat action sequences it is easy to miss the subtexts which the writers have carefully interlaced with the main story line. While the original script was slated as one long chase sequence, it became denser with time like a bottle of aging wine. Furiosa's missing arm (the elephant in the room), freakish figures scavenging swamps, Max's strange time hopping visions might all be part of a bigger universe whose surface was merely grazed in fury road. We will have to wait for the promised sequels to watch these elements unfold. (Yes there are more movies in line). At the helm of the movie is a mastermind who has crafted his art of direction over years. While he might be pretty inconsistent in making movies George Miller's devotion and bravura puts most his younger contemporaries to shame. Millers uses his outlandish creativity and visceral filmmaking style to make some of the most unforgettable action sequences ever made. Oscar winning cinematographer John Seale (The English patient) who came out of retirement for the project delivers with some stunning shots of Namibian Desert. The art direction and production design are equally stellar. Be it the adorable tumors on Nux's neck , the super cool skeleton engraving on the war rigs door or suave interiors of Immortal's Elysium , the amount of detail that has gone into each character, vehicle or set piece is simply staggering. (Check out the vehicle gallery on the official movie to know what I'm talking about). It would be a sin not to mention Margaret Sixel who puts her editing skills to to make the entire movie look like one long thrilling chase sequence. Junkie XL's operatic score works as a perfect complement to the mood of the movie. But the real stars of the movie in my opinion is its stunt crew. It is incredible and admirable how these guys pulled off a majority of death defying, jaw dropping, and plain batshit crazy stunts with real people and real vehicles instead of doing it the easy way. War boys, polecats, flamers would all have stayed as concepts had it not been for their raw calculated gutsiness. My adulation goes for the entire stunt team. This is analog movie making at its best. If you didn't see this on the biggest loudest screen, you definitely missed something. One of the biggest surprises of Fury Road was how the movie was not about Max but Furiosa, a warrior equally or more broken than the titular character (We see what you did there with the deceiving trailers, WB). Deeply conflicted and often poignant she tries to bring sense to a mad society. Played flawlessly by Charlize Theron, Furiosa is easily one of the strongest female characters to emerge out of an action flick. She is definitely among the ranks of Ellen Ripley, Sarah Conor and likes. Replacing Mel Gibson is a more reticent, feral, Tom Hardy who gets the job done but becomes subdued by Furiosa's intense screen charisma. Nicholas Hoult also puts a heartfelt performance as Nux, a rather demure war boy and Hugh Kayes Byrne as the nefarious yet graceful antagonist. Against all the praises I have heard some strong criticisms about the apparent feminist undertones of the story, but I wonder does it really matter? At heart Fury Road is a straight up action flick with beautifully choreographed stunts, minimal dialogues, strong characters and a seemingly linear storyline. There is no subtle way to put it. Fury Road is every adrenaline Junkies dream come true. If road warrior is the punk's Sistine chapel, Fury road is summer action flick's Holy Grail .	2
79ded464-3d06-46b6-83b4-6e6e7680a9ad	  To let you know I had not watched the original Mad Max movies when I had watched this film, so my judgment comes from the film on its own basis, and using that fact I must saw that George Miller does a good job as far as the cinematography of it. John Seale, the cinematographer, does a exceptional job here. There are many shots of the film that feel like the belong here. John Seale also did some of the Harry Potter movies were he also did a great job in. The action is directed to perfection and left me in awe struck at the amount of time and special effects put into this film with no cgi being added to boggle it down. As for characters Tom Hardy is good as Max. He hardly says a word and I really love that when watching the film. I loved that he was all about action and doing stuff and not so much about talking, because a lot of times in the movies just your facial expressions can say so much about a scene, and Tom Hardy was no exception. The fact of the matter is that he was undoubtedly Max. Now Charlize Theron I adored as Furiosa. She was what won the movie for me and made it awesome. I still remember after seeing this film the first thing I thought was "Dam she could be a great Wonder Woman." I mean seriously forget Gal Godat and get Charlize to play Diana, and bet I would love it along with everyone else. I mean the woman really does lead these women from the terrible and crooked husband. Nicholas Hoult and Hugh Keays-Byrne sadly were not as good or interesting. I mean they were just raging fits of anger. They didn't think and they had no brain. I mean really they were not compelling villains at all. In fact I found myself quite bored with them to the point were it didn't make any sense. Now with that being said I am going into all the problems with this film. The lack of story- While there were interesting characters it lacked any type of good characters which hinders the film quite a bit for me cause I do like a good story. That being said there is some story here unlike what people are saying it just takes some time to get to itThe entire first 20 mins were boring- I mean at first I was into it, but it felt like the action sequence would just keep going and going and honestly if it wasn't for my desire to finish my food I probably would have gone to sleep. Not good movie. Not good at all. The villains suck!!!- No really they do. There bad and awful villains to the point were I wanted them all dead. __ OK now that the issues are out the way the film is still decent enough. I won't be recommending it to anyone probably unless there just really into action films tho. Still tho there is a lot that we can still love with Mad Max: Fury Road which is why I am still giving it a 7/10.	1
166e440d-2cb5-4db7-97da-371d64bc74e1	  4.75 stars. What a lovely day! This movie was awesome. Very cool story, over the top action sequences and an awesome aesthetic. Very anxious to see what George Miller has in store for us next. The only knock is it had more CGI than I was expecting, but still awesome nonetheless. I highly recommend this one.	2

edf22203-c0e5-4541-9d17-affe6d9232fc	  Slap post-apocalyptic on anything and It becomes interesting. That was clearly the intent with Mad Max: Fury Road.There was barely any story involved. This coupled with what appeared to be B Grade stunts along with sporadic visual effects, the new Mad Max can definitely be skipped altogether.However, Charlize Theron's performance must be recognized in this movie, which was excellent.	0
4df02fe9-61ad-41c5-b529-a767293176f6	  Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action movie i've ever seen. George Miller returns after 3 decades to continue the saga "MAD MAX" and his return is glorious and epic in every sense. The style of the original trilogy is respected and used the same formula but with better effects and best choreography. The action scenes are amazing, it was a pleasure to see some sequences well made and very well edited in post-production. Tom Hardy is such a good Max as Mel Gibson and the fans will be very satisfied with the final result. Literally, this is the first film that of truth, the 2 hours of film are 2 hours of pure action, exciting, violent and frantic. The climax never drops, the story never becomes loose. I repeat: is the best action movie i've ever seen in a long time. Applause to the whole team, and in particular to the director, George Miller.Review en Espa�ol:Mad Max: Fury Road es la mejor pel�cula de acci�n que jamas he visto.

60287936-3744-47ec-983a-551673fb521e	  Finally got a chance this film. It ROCKS! I see the film as a metaphor for the struggles women experience in what is largely a male dominated society... and Charlize Theron is absolutely badass as the main character! Max, much like the audience, is along for the ride.	2
e9220c50-2bc9-4c4a-a1a4-42e4cd104e7e	  I liked that the movie was about Furiosa, not Max. Furiosa in particular seemed a rich character. Well, I guess that's what you get when you actually have a talented actor at work. Tom Hardy, who I like very much, had a hard time stepping out of the shadow of older Maxes who shall not be named, yet held my attention well. But:1. It seemed that F & M were a perfect match. Why didn't they actually hit it off?2. The ritual of the "culture" was WAY overdone. There's value in ritual, especially for "primitive" cultures like that into which civilization had devolved in the movie; but beyond a certain point, ritual becomes a survival risk.3. Why didn't Furiosa speak Aussie?4. No reason is given for Max leaving, except that Max always leaves. Honestly, couldn't something have been done with that? Why can't Max finally find something that can make up, even just a bit, for the loss of his family?	1
992b5e6a-43a0-4388-9b93-f56efe7c2cd4	  Mad Max: Fury Road is a finely tuned, visually insane and relentlessly kinetic action thriller that brings George Miller's surprisingly thorough fictional world roaring to life.	2
ee1685f3-ec64-4629-8401-cb254bb8f2a8	  Mad Max: Fury Road is maybe the best reboot of all time. The lack of plot and character development is out shined by marvelous action and visual effects.	2
f685da34-8317-4faa-9823-57ac1598ea8b	  So, really now. That's the ''film of the year''? I wonder what the worst film would be like.	0
f4489690-e9e7-4fd9-817d-16dcc3aff7e7	  Frenetic, Furious, Fantastic. Felt like a 4 hour movie but not in a Peter Jackson, King Kong sort of way. Worth the watch. Exhausting.	2
a4d27af1-aa0b-4e4c-b061-8f4aa3f30fe9	  This has to be one of the best pure action movies I've seen in a while. Although it lacks story telling this film exceeds my expectations with excellent action with remarkable cinematography and special effects throughout.	2
156cdcb4-39cf-4713-86e2-d8b7e5c9a3e7	  Wow...still trying to process everything I just saw. Pretty sure there were a few scenes I didn't even blink because so much insane stuff was happening all at once. Did I understand everything that was going on? Not really...but at least it looked pretty. Funny thing is Mad Max really feels like he's barely in the movie, but you won't even care because Charlize Theron is really the star of the movie and she kills it.	2
e6e26ae1-8cc4-4cb9-b0b3-889cab446a7d	  benchmark of action movie	2
094c17f1-80c1-4c9e-acc1-e6bbf069df89	  Although very, very simplistic on the story side of things - with a plot revolving around the protagonists attempts to escape the Citadel before deciding to go back - Mad Max: Fury Road excels on every other front. With brilliant visual and practical effects, tons of creative imagery, engaging characters, great acting, pulse-pounding music, and exhilarating action, Fury Road is a thrilling cinematic experience.	2
87805971-438d-4c44-882c-030be9daef98	  I'm not a gore for gore's sake kind of viewer, but being old school... Mad Max back in the day was one of the goriest movies out there. THIS Mad Max really doesn't have a drop of blood in it. A lot of "crash. boom, bam" but nothing really at stake. If you are expecting to see the old gritty, hardcore Mad Max where death, rape, and dismemberment are just around the corner... you are not going to find it here. If you want another homogenized 21st century type "action" film, it's worth a look.	1

920f8833-4dae-4f82-bb1a-2a7f944d9ca4	  George Miller unleashes a feverish, ferocious film and it's an intense wild ride. Acrobatic "Mad Max: Fury Road" is thrilling and treats the audience to some astonishing action sequences. But the action doesn't dull the emotional impact and that's mainly due to Charlize Theron's fierce performance."Mad Max: Fury Road" is a ride worth taking. Wall-to-wall pumped-up adrenalized fun, it's ridiculously good.	2
20a90b28-8c18-4f23-aa4d-0790dfcac2c8	  The "acting" was fine, the special effects were fine, the fighting and crashing were fine. If there was a story inside the running away then turning around to attack the very place they were running from, I completely missed it. If that was the story, how silly.	0
7ef7866f-70f4-495b-a6b6-a612a9fb52c2	  What a thrill ride, nearly non-stop action for 2 hours, gets your adrenaline pumping all the way. Story aside, it's weird, original and fun. Charlize Theron is the new Sigourney Weaver of tough women roles. Best I've seen this year so far, it makes Avengers Age of Ultron look like a daytime cartoon.	2
de6ab48b-0817-43ea-ba6d-0a3a93dc219b	  No, no, no, no.Not about Mad Max, it's about car chases. Glorious, exploding, no CGI car chases. But that's it. Plot - No. Acting - Barely. Those horrible movie tropes - Yup. Mumbled and dull dialogue - Yup!People be crazy.	0
1bd1d90b-be6e-41ae-81f1-c09985e8c7b1	  Great action, great acting, great story. First three films should have been referred to either in narrative or in character interactions to strengthen life of setting/environment.	2

994fd3c3-f06a-43e6-9303-3814cdea5d1f	  WHAT A DAY WHAT A LOVELY DAY INDEED!!! My god!!! This film kicked my ass!!! This is what action films have been sorely missing for the past ten years or so. Imagine if a 12 year old kid circa 1984 got hold of a lot of black tar heroin and fireworks and decided to make a movie but this time with a bigger budget. This film is great, with some of the best action films ever put to celluloid, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are both terrific as the leads and the film never slows down. This is one of the best films so far of 2015 and one of the best of the last several years. Also can we please get that guitar flamethrower dude in more movies please. We seeing this movie pour yourself a cup of gasoline induced goodness cause this is one of the best films of the year.	2
d9bc6c5b-8be2-42f6-a893-a8930b2d0bd6	  Can't even stop breathing... Charlize Theron deserves Oscars	2
9b23300a-77ea-49be-b91c-52c72c7c5518	  One of the most awaited films this year. I've seen the old film series lately as a warm up, and they where quite good to be honest.This film is even more intense and filled with effects and actions. You get some breaks from the action and the pretty good story makes it whole. The actors are solid but again - this is all about the action. I really dug that guitarist - funny, clever and original.8 out of 10 sips of mothers milk.	2
b8ce5ff7-6ea4-48e0-bd48-4c688441ebbe	  There is no question; this thoroughly modern Max is an extremely entertaining synthesis of mess and noise. The antidote to the onslaught of comic book superheroes and vigilantes of the last few years was anti-hero Max... or so we thought. Director George Miller subverted all our expectations of this film, from tweaking the gender roles in action films to astronomical production aesthetics. Few directors have the tenacity to unleash the kind of physical carnage Miller splashes across the screen here. You'll barely have a second to breathe as he seamlessly shifts from one insane set piece to another, ratcheting up the stakes and assembling his meticulous symphony of carnage with the combined result being one of the most successfully ambitious action extravaganzas committed to film.	2
df18ceaa-6e99-4e8c-a162-ca58b10338c0	  Having never seen a Mad Max film in it's entirety (I know..), and having heard of its strangeness, as someone put it, I went into Mad Max Fury road a little, well, unsure. But, suffice to say, it was good. Very good. The first 20 minutes or so are, to be frank, the weakest part of the movie. Its slow, somewhat uninteresting and as a newcomer its admittedly a little hard to get on board with the madness (pun not intended). But as the movie progresses, um, yeah, so......The action is sensational. This is one of the best action movies I've seen, and its weird how one and a half hours of action can greatly sustain your interest.Tom Hardy as Max was brilliant and so was Charlize Theron as Furiosa, and the setting was prettey sublime. There were a few things that bothered me though. One, was that Nicholas Hoult's character, whilst a great character, had a romance with some girl which blossomed in about 3 minutes, and I'm not even exaggerating.Also there was admittedly a lot of screaming and nothingness in terms of plot. But, honestly, by the time the film concluded, I had the biggest, happiest grin on my face in a long while.	2
a95f7a21-ffe6-4291-b7fb-c83893a066d3	  What a lovely movie! I had never seen a Mad Max movie before this one, and honestly, I don't think it's necessary. Each Mad Max movie pretty much stands on its own, including this one. Even more with this one since Mel Gibson didn't return, and this movie has a very different style to it than the others as well. This movie is very simple in the story department, but the main draw of the film is the extreme, practically non stop action, and just crazy world. George Miller did a great job focusing on practical effects over CG, and it shows in some ridiculously awesome action. The soundtrack is also amazing, perfectly putting the action into a musical form, even serving as the sound effect track for a good portion of the movie. The movie is just really exciting, adrenaline pumping craziness. It's definitely a weird universe though, which I could see turning some people away, and it can also take a while to figure out just exactly what's going on with the world as well, and what story is there is pretty thin, but the main focus of the movie is on the action, world building, visuals, and the soundtrack, and in those areas, I can think of very few films that do as well as Fury Road did.Personal Grade: S+Technical Score: 82%	2
85b44417-7642-4733-ab79-b51130822032	  So boring. Nothing much happens, it's just car-chase action non-stop.	0

6c95a749-b85e-4fc2-a31f-6337329ca9c7	  One of those rare films that gets better with each viewing, Deceptively smart and progressive wrapped in a heart pounding chase.	2
f1777009-8208-4c3c-aff6-58c57ce1bbad	  Believe the hype. Max is back and he's kicking ass. While Tom Hardy isn't quite as good at being Mad Max as Mel Gibson was (srsly, Gibson is a raging bigot. He's already mad), he has the look and his terse acting actually helps him sell his traumatized road warrior persona. Charlize Theron is the woman of the hour as Furiosa, a badass warrior woman out to redeem herself. The plot begins with Max being captured and Furiosa making off with some precious goods that Immortan Joe, the ruler of The Citadel, can't let slip away. Max is serving as a "blood bag" for Nux, a Warboy with terminal cancer. Nux figures chasing down Furiosa is his last chance at immortal glory, so he drags Max along for the ride. Thus, the chase begins.Every character cast for this film is pretty much perfection. If you remember the bizarre characters from Road Warrior, you'll recognize similar horrors and mutants here. The world is dead and irradiated, so there's plenty of twisted creations all around. The gangs themselves are all very well-defined, as are their leaders (I loved the Guntown dude's vehicle). The music is fantastic, and the environments are legit video game-quality otherworldly (the storm sequence and the swamp were particularly awesome). The action as a whole puts the end chase in Road Warrior to absolute shame, which is a tall order but one that Fury Road fulfills.My only issues with the movie were that the 3D stuff was overdone, the movie should have been an hour longer (I still prefer 3-hour movies for films that aspire to real art), and some leaps in logic (apparently everyone in the post-apocalypse has the same blood type). But those things aside, Fury Road is well worth the price of admission. Action movies will be compared to this for a long time to come.	2
641efd84-00bb-476b-9886-ab9829c9982d	  If the first two films of the post-apocalyptic Mad Max saga, became indispensable cult films, and entered through the front door of the big productions unfit for cardiac history. Then Mad Max Fury Road with Mr. Miller, over the years in this wasteland will be finally received into the very gates of Valhalla. And there will be revered as a hero, who made a spectacular masterpiece on human decadence and ultimate redemption, as the true artisan director of those car chases outputs of your own nightmares, and for bringing maximum glory a work 25 years of dedication and sacrifice. These unique virtues it goes without saying that scarce in the film pretentious and empty action today !!	2
e744f4b2-8cba-4c66-b506-e227b0b0cac7	  Well made but meaningful visual style. And totally collapsing story together with average actors performance. That feeling when every time you are in one step from catch the fish but each time it swim away. 6/10	2

To say this movie is a little bit intense is like saying a ghost pepper has a little bit of a kick. This might have spoiled all future action movies for me by setting the bar so ridiculously high. Wow.	2
7cc4bef1-dd37-4200-b249-50b5c923f53f	  Such an incredible movie! I'm going to go and say its definitely, by far, the best one of the franchise! Charlize Theron is the show stealer with Tom Hardy being fantastic in the title role.	2

35ac6a41-70be-4918-8cc1-8ca742f274d6	  It's been 30 years since Max left us in the big screen. Now he comes back with a new actor portraying the lone wolf from Mel Gibson in which he had established 36 years ago. While the film may look like Furiosa's story, Max's character holds on his own and shows that there are men who do selfless things without any thought of reward, nothing but the silent respect that women should give and acknowledge. And when you do, they're gone...going their own way.	2
503fcb46-cc83-44c4-a0f2-cf27dc9b3ae9	  Fury Road is the best movie of the year to date. An outstanding achievement of movie making.	2
be4787af-0296-422b-ac5f-e1f4cc3212bd	  George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the most, lush and vivid movies I've seen in a long time. The cinematography for this film is an absolute marvel- showcasing the sprawling outback desert through hues of oranges and reds during the daytime, contrasting it with beautiful midnight blues at night. All this comes together to give the movie a very lively atmosphere. The score alleviates the sense of rush and is smartly used diegetically as well as non-diegetically. The action scenes are shot brilliantly with minimal special effect, furthering its case as a masterpiece. Finally the acting especially that of Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa is top-notch and no character is left needing further characterisation. Tom Hardy's Max is a man of little words, but the performances are so strong that the movie doesn't need dialogue in order to flourish. This movie is definitely not hyped up- go see it and then go see it again.Rating: 5/5	2

This movie is insane and how George Miller handled the scale of this movie is beyond me. Mad Max: Fury Road is a must see, and is going to go down as one of the better action movies of recent time.	2
39e950d2-59bf-4346-baae-c0ad4a654937	  George Miller burst onto the cinematic landscape in 1979 with the 70's exploitation car chase masterpiece Mad Max then exceeded the brilliance of that debut with a sequel (Mad Max 2) that truly cemented him as a visionary and visceral filmmaker. Now, almost thirty-five years later, Miller demonstrates with Mad Max: Fury Road that he's lost none of his vitality; however, where previously the thinness of plot and character felt appropriate in this franchise, here they read as omission and highlight the fact that at the end of the day this is little more than a well-executed two-hour car chase.Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is the true hero of this story. Despite living in the aggressively patriarchal society of the Citadel ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) she has attained a position of some authority. When she sets out on a trade mission she takes with her a group of Immortan's breeders with the intention of seeking refuge in a remote society of women. Max (Tom Hardy), spends the first half hour of the film held captive as a human blood bag for one of Immortan's goons until he escapes and teams up with Furiosa.Miller's strong point is the detail with which he paints his world. The colours, the costumes, the makeup, the souped up vehicles, the dare-devil stunts, the magnificent collisions, the heavy metal guitarist screeching out the pursuit's soundtrack. It's riveting stuff. Imaginative and witty. And as an exercise in action direction it's pretty flawless. But the film aspires to being more than a thrilling roller coaster ride. It asks us to care. And on this level it falls short.We learn in the opening scene that Max failed to protect his wife and daughter and so (groan) there are subsequent snippets of his daughter haunting him throughout the film. The breeders are all so damn beautiful (including super model Rosie Huntington Whiteley) and given little chance to develop individually that their shared plight is easy to dismiss. The developing bond between Furiosa and Max thankfully doesn't end with a kiss but nor is it of much consequence. Nicholas Hoult, as one of Immortan's gang, has a defined arc in the story which only makes you wonder why him and no one else?Theron, with her buzz cut, racoon eyes and prosthetic arm, makes a fine action heroine. Hardy, similarly, has just the right brooding presence (and pouty lips) to more than comfortably fill Mel's boots. They look great together and I wish they were given more to do than drive from A to B and back again. Another subplot, another significant complication would've been welcome meat on these narrative bones. Fury Road is indeed audacious and thrilling but you'll come away affected far more by Miller's virtuosity than the film itself.	2

78b655ae-7ddc-4ac6-a39a-0b765ba67f7b	  Apparently, it takes an old veteran like George Miller to show this new generation of young filmmakers how action can be exhilarating, and so he gives us this high-octane, adrenaline-fueled roller coaster of a movie that is technically flawless, visually astonishing and looks amazing in 3D.	2
b74cdbb5-879a-4b4f-94c7-92efc2ee3bf8	  What can I say? As far as pure, technical achievement goes, not many films can live up to the heights of this Mad Max entry. The complexity of its action scenes and their individual, often awe-inspiring shots alone aren't the film's only attributes, however. Making beautiful use color in its dessert landscapes, incredible locale and vehicle design, and a perfect use of pacing -- especially in the kinetic energy of action scenes -- director George Miller and his team create something that doesn't really come along often. As much praise as other "artistic" action films like The Dark Knight receive, that example doesn't even come close to the skill on display in the conception and editing of Max's set pieces. It's light on story, but sometimes a film can be almost perfect without one. Sometimes.	2
4d5a0364-5e9c-41af-965a-ee67bbd8b4b4	  "Mad Max: Fury Road" is completely unique. Its visual appeal and creativity can't be denied, but it is also one of the strangest films that you will ever experience. In a market where every genre is saturated with films that recycle the same concepts and ideas, it is rare to find a film as unique as this one. It even feels unique when compared with the "Mad Max" films of the 80's. George Miller is no stranger to the film industry and "Fury Road" may be his masterpiece. I think that it is really cool that Miller wrote a new chapter into his series 30 years after the last film. Most of this story is told without dialogue. The action is constant and the imagery drives the story for better or for worse (we will never forget the brief milking scene or the idea of a "blood bag"). Immortan Joe's mask is terrifying and the production team convincingly transformed all of the actors into nuclear holocaust survivors. I appreciated the performances by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, though any sort of emotion seems to be overshadowed by the previous and next action sequence. This one won't be winning any Oscars in acting categories, but it will certainly make a run in categories like Production Design, Film Editing, and Sound Editing. To be honest, I was a little bit disappointed with the film. It had so much hype for its entire theatrical run, augmented by a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 97%, and I just did not receive the amount of character development as I expect from a critically acclaimed film. Still, I will be the first to admit that I need to see it again to process everything that happened and may adjust my rating afterward. My wife and I are still scratching our heads about the electric guitar guy (who we have discovered is named "The Doof Warrior"). We assumed that he was symbolic or sort of reference to the original films, but apparently he is exactly what he appears to be: a flame-spewing guitarist who pumps up the rest of the troops. I suppose that he left a big enough impression that he is the only character that I have discussed. The most well-written character in the film is Nux and we grow attached to him because he undergoes the greatest transformation. I look forward to watching this film again and believe that the sequels will be even better if they deliver the same amount of action while including a greater transformation of their characters. There are a lot of cheesy sci-fi films from the 70's and 80's that involve vehicles ("Death Race 2000" is the first one that comes to mind), but the vehicles are perfectly incorporated into this film's creative atmosphere and they are just cool. Everybody loves "Mad Max: Fury Road" for its creative post-apocalyptic story and constant stream of action. I believe that the Academy Awards will acknowledge its effort and remind the film industry that action films can blow our minds with more than just the action.	2

82c06a4c-b199-4e71-8f36-1027ed2472c2	  Could one of the best films of 2015 be a sequel to a movie from the 1970s featuring amazing chases, swashbuckling action, all connected through a distinct mythology and set in a time that seems too fantastic to be real? The crazy answer is "yes, yes it can" and the funny thing is I'm not talking about that little film with Star Wars in the title. Since the 1979 original, writer/director (and doctor) George Miller has given the world two other iterations of Mad Max-1981s The Road Warrior and 1985s Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (whom George Ogilvie shared a co-directing credit)-but this newest take proves an old vehicle can learn many new tricks with 2015s Mad Max: Fury Road-a legitimate candidate to be one of the most influential films currently made. With a plot told almost exclusively through visual storytelling, Miller and his staff have truly outdone themselves with what the cinematic medium can do-driving from one scene to the other with frenetic pacing, inspired use of editing (which it should win an Oscar with) and subtle yet dramatic acting from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Hardy and Theron-playing main protagonists Max Rockatanksy and Imperator Furiosa, respectively (you have to love names like that)-epitomize the brawn and finesse of Miller's filmmaking aesthetic. Amid the brutal carnage of the chases there is a chaotic fluidity to it all that evokes a beautiful dance-blending music and movement to please the senses. This level of sophistication has been hinted at in the previous films, often with socially sensitive issues that evoked the times they were made in. With real-world oil shortages in the 70s being a major headline, the preservation and fight for gasoline was at the focal point in the original three. This has now been replaced with the preservation of life, an inspired and logical way to go, showing the value of conscious awareness and preserving this place called home; Earth (similar themes were touched upon in Miller's 2006 Oscar-winning film Happy Feat). The underlining theme of survival (that spans each entry) is representative of what Mad Max: Fury Road is-a film that breathes life, has a "never say die attitude" but expresses the limitless freedom and determination of what people can achieve.	2
cdc3d4f1-0ffc-4a1b-9897-87ae7ad615a5	  To call Mad Max: Fury Road incredible would be an understatement! From a badass cast of characters led by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, to amazing visuals and practical stunt work, all the way to masterful, energetic, and visionary direction from 70 year-old George Miller!

f7557ef0-03db-4229-9d09-856237274b37	  Loud, proud, and yet relentlessly incoherent, Mad Max: Fury Road is a disaster of a film masquerading as bold. A reboot, at least of sorts, of the franchise previously headlined by Mel Gibson, director George Miller brings the outlandish post-apocalyptic world back to the screen. We find Max (Tom Hardy) captured at the hands of a crazed war lord, only to find himself mixed up in the escape of the vaunted female Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and the Warlord's many prized wives. Those that are prone to like Mad Max will point to the action scenes as proof of the film's inventive and unabashedly brutal nature. To a large extent this is true, the film does look good, and the action sequences feature uniquely conceived devices, feel impactful, and are extremely well choreographed and otherwise executed. Mad Max, to be sure, can be fun to watch. This is all fine until the point in which one dares to ask, 'what am I watching'?Simply put, Mad Max is an absolute narrative mess. Very little is explained, only the thinnest most idiotic delivered exposition is ever given, and then the sole purpose is to set up a 10 or 15 minute fight or chase scene, meanwhile leaving any characterization, plot, or coherent narrative structure in the dust. Big vehicles blowing up are good, eyes being gouged out-that's great, but in order to constitute a movie there needs to be some semblance of a storyline, some reason for us to be invested in the characters. The script deficiencies don't stop at a lack of storytelling, the dialogue is extremely sparse and quite literally dumbed-down. It feels as if it's penned by a behavior disorder fifth grader trying to be naughty during language arts. Utter nonsense comes out of characters with inexplicable motivations, histories, or personas. One might think the film's cast, featuring Charlize Theoron and Tom Hardy would be a saving grace. Talented actors as they are, they are adrift in a film that wallows in absurdity and disorganization. Neither actor is developed, and one must ask, why Max had the honor of the film's title? The character of Max in this film is relegated to that of a side character, and a rather uninteresting one at that. The reasons for this are curious and perhaps politically motivated but, regardless, it was a dumb one. Hardy is an incredible talent and to have him so underutilized is perhaps one of the greatest cinematic crimes of 2015. Outrageously terrible. 1.5/5 Stars	0

A striking lack of any real character development for any of the main characters hamstrings what, aside from the absurd visual flares (guitarist on the vehicle, anyone?) could have been a pretty good movie.	0

b5803306-28f6-4254-b1b4-d8c80174ff83	  This movie is fantastic. Mad Max Fury Road feels like it just gulped down a case of 5 hour energy shots all condensed into two hours. To say it is a thrill ride would be an understatement. There is one 5-10 minute scene of the movie where you can catch your breath when they are stopped and trying to figure out where to head, and that is it. The entire movie from the opening second to the finish is packed with non stop fast moving action. Even if you have no idea who the character is or what this movie is about, give it a shot if you are looking for a great action movie. There really isn't too much dialogue at all to talk about. Just know that Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are both really good. And I commend both of them for not being afraid to be part of a movie like this. Some big name actors might find it silly to accept a role in a movie like this with George Miller directing. A 2 hour car chase war with these elaborate man made put together vehicles, it is absolutely awesome to see. You keep waiting to see what the next gang of bandits has in store for the main characters as they are driving across this deserted landscape. It is a downright fun movie with amazing action throughout, surely one of the best movies of the year. God forbid it gets any Oscar attention though, the academy I'm sure is "above" picking films like this, even though they deserve it.	2
130235a0-ab29-4797-9293-f5c080b712d1	  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Some nice special effects, but such a lack of story line that if i hadn't been with friends i would have walked out of the movie theatre. Charlize Theron like always was an amazing actress, and Tom Hardy fulfilled his role, but they could be out doing much better movies, their performance id the only thing that occasionally made this movie watchable. But please don't waste your precious time on this, it is a pointless, senseless jumble of special effects.	0
e00f2b2b-ccd8-4eae-bd3b-c6d54c67be7d	  Does Mad Max: Fury Road have little backstory - and an extremely basic plot? Yes. Does the film reduce its title character to a mere secondary status? Yes. Are there bizarre scenes? Tons. Does Tom Hardy mumble and grunt most of the film? You bet.But all of that is inconsequential to the fact that Fury Road is one of the most visually stunning, engrossing, and glorious films of the year. In an age of overuse of CGI, Fury Road is also a miracle to even exist. But George Miller's proper use of CGI and practicality put other films to shame. This goes for both the stunning scenes of vehicular carnage, as well as the costume designs, including Immortan Joe's mask. This film's cinematography is Oscar-worthy.Charlize Theron gives an iconic performance as Imperator Furiosa. Nicolas Hoult, as Nux, delivers the best character arc of the film. And Tom Hardy - who proved with Locke that he doesn't need to move much to command a fascinating performance - proves that he doesn't need to speak much either to be a captivating. The backstories are implied enough that they don't need to be delved into and fleshed out. What's on the surface is gritty and excellent enough. And the bizarre scenes - including a guitar-wielding flamethrower called the Doof Warrior - add to the film's intensity and post-apocalyptic world-building. Needless to say, Mad Max: Fury Road may be one of the best action thrillers in a long time. It's certainly one of the best films of 2015, by far.	2
5dd8776d-3be7-4738-9432-59ecfd138d02	  An amazing action movie, a shinning light in a sea of mediocrity.	2
8421459b-4ab6-481d-a39a-3cb9c1d5de57	  "If you can't fix what's broken, you'll go insane". This line represents the theme of the entire film and the entire series. Max is a loner running from his past, who eventually finds his humanity again by helping others. Perfect. This film is one of the best of the year. And one of the most breathtaking action flicks in even longer. Definitely a contender for Best Picture, in my opinion.	2
2a02d2f6-9ff6-44d0-918c-855b1c7be05e	  This remake of classic B-movie Mad Max (1979) [the movie that made Mel Gibson a star in one day], is George Miller's attempt to re-film the first (and best known) film of his career with a budget thousand times bigger than the one available in 1979.The result is visually impressive. Absolutely grotesque good and bad heroes fight for gas in a post-apocalyptic future society in a movie that can only be described as post-modern and cyberpunk. The exhilarating action is so intense that even the rotten tomatoes critic got curried away and gave it an almost perfect score (97%). Tom Hardy (known for Inception and The Dark Knight Rises) has become the next big thing in Hollywood due to this remake. Charlize Theron (an absolutely top actress overall) is simply great in the post-feminist role of Imperator Furlosa. Nevertheless, as one might expect, the fight for gas idea, which was original, innovative and to the point in 1979, has not aged very well and seems quite ridiculous today. Still, the movie is top notch as an action film with some very funny moments and you will remember it for some time, not for it's non-existent deeper meanings but for it's overambitious and grotesque cyberpunk environment.Grade: B-	1

896a0341-63c2-4ddb-9eee-86076782cd05	  Fury Road, a�fourth installment in the long dormant Mad Max franchise, feels�simultaneously familiar and inexplicably alien. The desolate backdrop, thrilling chases, and camera work recall The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome but it's all so damn useless. Our long standing hero Max, presumably the character audiences are coming to see, all but�disappears behind�the narratives of new additions�Nux and Furiosa. Why make another Mad Max film if Tom Hardy has to sit�in the passenger seat?Writer/director George Miller never had much success fleshing out back story for his characters or the origin of their world and he seems to have completely lost interest in trying. Viewers who did not see the original trilogy of films are given no understanding of who Max is or why he's fighting for survival alone in the wastes.�Fury Road provides little more information about its�supposed lead than "I used to be a cop" and "Max. My name is Max". Wow. Profound.Friends and fellow reviewers alike have countered these critiques by reminding me of how "beautiful and exciting" the film is. I agree that Fury Road is visually impressive but I'm not sure what's exciting about not using your brain. Tom Hardy grunting�and shooting his way through a thin script certainly doesn't thrill me, no matter how well-lit the sand is. If you want car chases and explosions for hours on end then why not just play the video game?�	0
1e7eb877-2bec-49bf-804d-887e22cfb1d0	  Mad Max Fury Road is an extraordinary movie. The main characters are believable. The set is an nontraditional kinetic display of vehicles. The action has a special rhythm to it, so your eyes don't have to wonder. Lastly, the way the movie is shot is mainly in wide shot; which reveals more of the action.	2

6f718200-b3ce-46d9-92e1-8a2198c250d2	  Alright, I may have been too harsh on Mad Max: Fury Road initially. I still don't think it is in any way a masterpiece, but the action sequences are glorious and at times truly thrilling. George Miller can't be praised enough for avoiding CGI as much as possible, and instead relying on death-defying stunt work, and a huge lot of practical effects. It's hard to imagine how much planning and rehearsal had to go into orchestrating these sequences of pure exhilaration. Still, there is not much beyond the fireworks to hold everything together. The actual story isn't all that compelling or surprising, and a tad more characterization would have been welcome. When it comes to dramatic weight Fury Road is fairly bare bones, to say the least. There are also a lot of stylistic flourishes that I just didn't really care for. With that said, the extended chases are certainly impressive and the cinematography and editing is truly outstanding.	2
fa838cbb-8f85-42d1-805a-1f5faaaf9463	  As a fan of the dystopic movies, I saw the Mad Max trilogy a couple years ago b/c I heard they were shining exemplars of the genre and have great action to boot. I came away disappointed by the lack of an interesting plot to complement the over-the-top action sequences and the post-apocalyptic setting (the two sequels in particular). So you can imagine my excitement when news came of a new sequel. But after seeing rave reviews from friends and critics alike (e.g. this site), I decided to give the franchise another try, expecting somehow this time would be different.Apparently the director decided the problem with his three previous attempts was that there wasn't enough adrenaline and proceeded to make the same mediocre movie, but with everything turned up to 11. So instead of a mere waste time, Fury Road was a spectacular waste of time. I mean this in the literal sense: the action sequences were quite the spectacle and allow us a glimpse of the atavistic savagery that lurks beneath our superficial civility; and the lead actors very much impressed in the physical acting department. But those positives were rendered hollow by a script (one which I can only assume was written by a rather talented 13 year-old) that offers little character development and a plot that can be adequately summed up as (spoiler) "Guy and girl go from point A to point B and back to point A, kill bad guys along the way and save the day". The chases, fights and explosions soon became trite and, after two exhausting hours, something to be tolerated rather than relished. The handful of attempts to humanize the good characters also looked clumsy and forced, as incongruous as the brief tender string interludes amidst the near-constant industrial drumming that filled up most of the run time. In the end, this movie offers neither hope (e.g. Children of Men) nor despair (Brazil), just the anodyne comfort that the good guys won and all is right with the world again -- at least until the next sequel comes along (which shouldn't be long as there is a 5th installment on the way).So in conclusion, if you're looking for 2 hours of mindless vroom and boom interrupted by an alleged plot, this is your flick. But if you appreciate even only an ounce of subtlety and intelligence, avoid this movie like the plague. In fact, if you just want to watch Tom Hardy drive around the whole movie, you would find Locke a far superior alternative.	0

a1f7dbb4-c8c1-4f34-96e9-9d42866c2e1f	  What a Lovely Day Indeed.Writer-Director George Miller has revisited and reinvented his Mad Max franchise quite flamboyantly. In full disclosure, I had no idea that Mad Max was a pre existing franchise until after I saw the first trailer for the film. Although, When I saw Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, I became slightly interested. I believed that these two oozed amazing chemistry. Like the previous installments, there was a nuclear war that led us to this post-apocalyptic world. Food and water are noticeably scarce. From beginning to end, it is non-stop over the top action. It fairly reminded me of the old video game 'Twisted Metal" which we all know is all about absolute mayhem. So many explosions, so many collisions, so much anarchy!!!! This film roars with an absolute vengeance!!!!!! Every aspect of the film is beautiful. The score by Junkie XL was absolutely riveting. It had my heart racing when the action started up and it just felt so perfect. It really placed the film on a more grand scale. This really excites me because XL produced the score for the upcoming film Dawn of Justice, along with Hans Zimmer. So, I am definitely intrigued to see what those two were able to accomplish together. My favorite thing about the film was definitely the camera work. The way that George Miller and John Seale were able to make this world look so visually stunning yet still so destitute is by far some of the best camera work I have seen this year. The rotations and the tracking shots were just wonderful to see. This a film that is made for the big screen. It is absolutely visually stunning. The vehicles they created for this film look like something straight out of a comic book and when you see them you can't help but to stare in awe. It makes this world of desperation something to be slightly desired. The acting definitely is a high point for me as well, because the ball could have easily been dropped if not handled properly. For instance, when Charlize Theron is on screen, she steals every second. She is almost unrecognizable as a tortured soul who has had enough of this so called society. Everything that she does seems so instinctual and sometimes, although justified, barbaric. She really becomes her character and allows herself to be taken into this world.For those that may have grown a bit tired of the post- apocalyptic films that we have been bombarded with over the years, fear not, for Mad Max: Fury Road has successfully changed the game. In the beginning sequence of the film, we meet the eponymous character Max Rockatansky, played by the incomparable Tom Hardy. We quickly realize that he is already in a bit of a pickle. Just from the opening ten minutes, we learn that he's a troubled soul and that he is doing the same thing that everyone else in this world has been forced to do: survive. His survival skills are instantly put to the test once he is captured by the War Boys, the army of Immortan Joe, the film's main antagonist. The capture scene is so well choreographed and so amazing to watch. The world that Miller creates is so unique and beautiful: something that only his mind could conjure up. It's an absolute barren wasteland full of vehicular warfare of the greatest caliber. The film is full of a mass population that looks savage; however, these are just everyday people that are trying to survive. At this time, all that people know is carnage, chaos and catastrophe. Naturally, we should all be able to relate to the survival aspect. There is no order. Only a seemingly tyrannical rule, led by one Immortan Joe. There are some who follow, hence his army of War Boys, and there are some that believe that he is the reason that the world is still the way it is, insert Imperator Furiosa. Fury Road explains how Max, who seems to be a bit of a drifter, meets and works with Imperator Furiosa. Once these two meet up, it is non-stop action. While the action slows down a bit, you learn Furiosa's purpose and it is a rather plausible story arc. As a moviegoer who appreciates dialogue, I was a bit disappointed in some of the writing. Some of it seemed to be forced and other parts seem like they did not belong at all. For example, there is one instance in the film where Miller tries to create some emotional investment between two of the characters. However, in my opinion, it translate well. The film is well paced and at a run time of 2 hours flat, it's a really good film to go see with friends especially if you are an action junkie. Oddly enough, after watching this film, I do not have any interest in viewing the original Mad Max trilogy starring Mel Gibson. I loved this film and I just feel like this is something that can very well stand on its own. A very interesting take on a post apocalyptic world from the Mastermind George Miller. He successfully created one of the best action films I've ever seen.	2

f97053d1-a368-4fd1-9318-1d20ce6889a9	  The effects and setting of the film are pretty cool. I didn't like a lot of the way it was filmed, it was discontinuous, almost like they filmed it slow and used fast motion to make it look more normal. Not much of a plot. Mostly two hours of watching a bunch of cars drive around the desert and people fighting.	1
d7559115-acab-4be9-9fe5-77d7eff21770	  I love the way the women were portrayed in this they were so bad ass. Finally Tom Hardy is getting some world wide recognition that he very much deserves by starring in this movie, no doubt a lot of people will see this movie. Many people were skeptical at first when this movie was announced, however this is a return to form for George Miller the creator of the original movies.	2
0e34fbe6-6608-49dc-8f93-413bbe5667db	  While the background story maybe interesting and a good job done by the actors, stuntmen, special effects and makeup team, the screen play is anything but spectacular. Lack of character development, cheesy dialogue all masked by 2 hours of continuous explosions and brainless action. Quite suitable for those who can appreciate a film with a lack of intelligence.I'm willing to bet most of the hi rated reviews are paid promoters.Enjoy.	0

fccb4b31-e124-414d-ab9d-e04349efd18b	  What a stinker, where is Mel when u need him. They give one of Hollywood's great beauties a stump for an arm. This movie was perfect for a 15 yo male, with no discrimanatory taste. The male lead looked fat, angry, ugly, like he forgot his lines, in different scenes, no acting ability combined with poor direction. I'll bet most of the peeps who watched this never saw the original.	0
0c141fd8-ea55-4bf1-aa9c-eb15a4c6cf82	  Though the action was relentless throughout, the first hour was a little difficult to follow as the dialogue is kept very much to a minimum. The film is essentially a two hour chase movie and because of its basic premise, it was a little too long. Its gender politics is something James Bond could learn from and Tom Hardy is brilliant despite his few lines with his body language alone. The post-apocalyptic world is well made and you can almost smell the petrol but for the most part Mad Max is very loud, bit too long and occasionally listless.	1

e53be022-d49d-4c93-af2f-f934ef1c70eb	  Perhaps not quite as entertaining as The Road Warrior in my opinion, Fury Road is nonetheless a strong installment in George Miller's post-apocalyptic franchise. Despite pacing issues in certain areas and an average story, Mad Max Fury Road has gorgeous cinematography that never ceases to amaze throughout it's run time, insane action sequences coupled by gleefully bizarre characters, vehicles, weapons and clothing design. The performances are adequate as are the characters, and Fury Road is the epitome of a popcorn thrill ride.	2
4206c58e-be47-4bc7-b7f6-5fd8b9f31201	  Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action film of the decade, and one of the year's very best films!	2
1839f196-d2ef-4316-adbe-f8dc619e88c8	  A sequel worth waiting for. By any standard, this is an entertaining and exciting road movie, not dominated by CGI. Action sequences are so well choreographed; you want to see it again. They are filled with fresh ideas and audacity. There is not a boring moment. Tom Hardy's Mad Max is just as alluring too. Let's hope we do not need to wait another 30 years for the next one.	2
2b4c52f5-ada3-4684-a70a-9b1c1321834f	  this is a chase movie with a big budget i gave the original mad max a very low rating but this re-boot is way better. re.4-4.5 its so different to other movies it deserves higher rating.	2
f7bf864b-8de1-48b9-9758-0f9cc3611173	  This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time, if you are going for a movie that doesn't take to seriously in the sence of not being dark and gritty but rather fun for all the family, the cinematography looks outstanding, the colors look like they are to pop out of the screen.	2
91aa180c-0792-4208-9728-dad2c62e3cb4	  Movie of the year. All Australians must see. More Australians in this movie then Western Sydney. The girls are the heroes so is you a feminist this is for you. For more fun check out the movie cast before watching the movie, surprised me, as the history is stunning. And yes Tom Hardy is a great replacement for Mel Gibson. Specially 2015 Mel Gibson. Not shitty like Thunderdome. Closer to MM 2. Watch on big screen with sound up loud. George Millers manipulation of the time frames in scenes makes the movie. You get to See movie, the action is not to fast for the eye. Great movie.	2
3f2093f9-6055-4baf-8a45-1ee149fd41ae	  This movie is one of the most insane and chaotic movies of the summer. With George Miller returning to the helm for another installment of Mad Max, it is our viewing pleasure that we get to witness such a high explosive film. This film stars Tom Hardy, who plays the role of Max, alongside fellow stars Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult. Most of the actors in this movie do a phenomenal job, and even though Tom Hardy's character was the least interesting, he did an amazing job, as always. If we're on the topic of characters, George Miller really fumbled the ball here. Max is definitely the 3rd most interesting character along with being the 2nd strongest character. Charlize Theron's character was definitely put in the spotlight more and she was the bigger bad-ass. I'm not saying this out of opinion, but the movie clearly shows on several occasions that she is the stronger power and even the more interesting. Max had the least amount of depth given to him (which is ironic considering his name is in the title) and he had the most basic, undeveloped back-story you can imagine. They spent more time developing the character of Nicholas Hoult (which was actually a good surprise), rather than developing their main character. This movie though, was filled tons of action and was the equivalent to a 2 hour video game. The cinematography is amazing and everything looks so well done. The CGI is solid for the most part, but the movie does a great job of relying on practical effects and explosions. There were some moments where I felt that the CGI background looked really bad, but other than that, they did a good job of utilizing their budget. On the contrary, watching a video game for 2 hours doesn't leave a whole lot of room for plot development. The movie sports a basic plot that says get from point A to point B. That's all the movie really is. Nothing is really explained and nothing really has meaning. They just see how much action they can fill into 2 hours. Like I said, it makes for an extremely entertaining movie, but I wasn't able to connect to the situation nor the characters. When they tried to develop plot in the movie, it felt like it came to a dead stop. There was a point where nothing was going on and I was actually bored. They seem to throw in random, useless plot elements and it makes me groan. For example, at one point, Max and the crew meet up with these "mothers" that help them fight for their freedom. I'm sure this was connected to the other Mad Max movies, but if it wasn't. then this was the most useless and boring plot device in the movie. They seemed helpless and unnecessary and the whole pit stop derailed the movie. I know it seems like I have a lot of gripes about this movie, but I really don't. It was a great action thriller that was extremely crazy and intense. I love a lot of the unique aspects in this movie and the level of crazy that they go up to. They do things unimaginable to most human beings and it's a really fun summer movie. In the end, Mad Max is certainly worth watching and one that I myself own on Blu-Ray.	2

c29af9f0-1cc8-4cf7-9a0e-2c4a6dec4874	  For a movie with tons of potential, it falls short. Since the film had feminist ideals, everyone automatically loved the film. In terms of the films itself, horrible, stupid, confusing, and pointless.	0
6f680a65-cbb2-4cdf-8a8b-80596907b29b	  One big, rage-fueled drive through a wasteland with no history and no explanation of the characters, this film fails of any drama. The characters are trying to survive a madman, but they have no story, no background, and no hope. Characters die meaninglessly, conventions of the universe are just dropped into the film with no explanation whatsoever, and the plot is indiscernible other than as a pointless fight to the death on a confusing wasteland for reasons that are known only to the characters and not to us.	0
ae1ea942-339d-426f-8ceb-71e845ff4ac3	  Absolute and utter rubbish, I can not believe it has good reviews on here. It's undermined the legitimacy of any rating on the whole site. A car chase one way, then an other,no coherent plot, no development just driving and explosions aimed at a brain dead audience who care not for story, dialogue and a cinematic experience. I despair	0
55b9cd6a-8dc3-4b91-9ec0-688d827c677d	  I don't understand how this movie got such high ratings? I didn't understand anything I watched for 2 hours. Did I need to watch the first one from 1979??? I was 8 and don't remember anything from the movie except the car. What was the silver shit they were spraying in their mouths? Why were they using other people for blood transfusions? Cool special effects, but I still have no other idea what the movie was about.	0

e46dfb26-bdca-44e9-a2ce-2a8f7c1d3e7f	  A proper action movie, and a must watch. Despite a not-so compelling story, and little character development, it stands out in all the other aspects, an action movie could desire for.The main change in cast from Mel Gibson to Tom Hardy, and the character of Furiosa gives a different yet fresh feel from the original series.The action sequences and the carnage is stunning to watch, amidst the arid and difficult landscape.	2
1f952fe7-91a0-4c87-b422-c3819724256f	  Unique and succulently gory, it breaks ground much like 300 did some years ago. Great performances by everyone involved. Few words, lots of excitement.	2

e8e026a7-7c13-460e-9dc5-d1fab1273227	  Physical effects make a triumphant return to the GGI saturated season of summer blockbusters. Max Rockatansky has emerged from the waste land in Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) to show us the light of epic cinema. George Miller gets another bite at the Mad Max apple and produces a Lawrence of Arabia (1962, David Lean, UK) type epic while making a strong feminist statement in a post apocalyptic acid trip fever dream.  I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the uncanny valley but the epic scope of Lawrence of Arabia (1962, David Lean, UK) versus Revenge of the Sith (2005, George Lucas, USA) is apparent to anyone whose viewed both. CGI is helpful and can be a great asset to a filmmaker. Fury Road has over 2,000 visual effects shots[i]. That being said it's not how much CGI you use but how you use it. It's the motion in the ocean not the size of the boat. Often Miller's use of CGI is used to color correct shots, add clouds to the clear Namibian sky, and dessert rocks turned a much richer hue.  After screening Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) themes George Miller was hinting at in Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome (George Miller, AUS, 1985) became much clearer. The Triple Goddess helps redeem Max when he is at his most feral, his humanity holding on by a shred and our titular hero can only manage guttural sounds in lieu of language. Tom Hardy plays the titular character in this latest Mad Max incarnation. Max fights to protect the maiden or in this case maidens. He is aided and rescued by the mother and in this case the mother is the warrior Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron crushes this role), and lastly he is aided by the crone. In Miller's post apocalyptic wasteland the crone is a bunch of motorcycle driving, seed toting, rifle shooting bad ass grandmas. At one point Max washes blood off his hands using the contents of a tanker full of mother's milk.The themes in Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) are often not subtle but don't seem heavy handed in a movie that has little to no exposition. In an era when movies find it necessary to have a pseudoscience explanation for our super heroes and science fiction it's refreshing to have a movie not crow bar in needless exposition. Much like Sergio Leone Miller uses action and his actor's body language and facial expressions to convey story instead of relying on dialogue. In Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) there's no time to waste with monologues as the drums of war beat in the distance and a war party race towards you and among them is flame throwing guitar player strapped to a flat bed full of speakers racing down the dessert with dozens of other maniacs painted white. Oh did I forget to mention the maniacs in white body paint drive hot rods that have gentlemen with explosive spears ridding atop them.  I've heard the notion bandied around that George Lucas is treated unfairly by adult fans who didn't like the prequels. That the movies were not bad they were just now adults and not the target audience as they were in 1977. Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) takes that thesis and crumples it up and tosses it in the rubbish bin. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (George Miller, AUS, 1981) & the Star Wars trilogy live in the same sweet spot in my pre-adolescent heart. In fact they are probably neighbors and enjoying going over each other's homes for summer BBQs or drinks around the holidays. Coincidently they live down the street from Raiders of Lost Ark (Steven Spielberg, USA, 1981). If my review hasn't been clear up till now stop reading this and go see this movie NOW!By Jake Cohen5 out of 5 Martin Riggs(s). RECOMMEND	2

Film is 100 years old and change, and in that time i have seen most every version of the car chase and fight, then mad max comes along and give you 2 hours of action you have never seen before. George Miller does a flawless job of creating and executing this set pieces as well as creating a unique and intriguing post apocalyptic world. This film has strong feminist undertones evening without a complicated plot. Several times the question is asked "who killed the world?" and its clear it wasn't the women. In a time of pretty wise cracking super heroes this throwback style seems so fresh. Possibly the best film of this year.	2

Daring in both ideas and imagery, a spectacular carnival of carnage that puts most other blockbusters to shame.	2

She is as good as she's ever been in this. We know we're going to guess a lot of stuff before it happens, but how it happens and how it's filmed make this a thoroughly enjoyable romp, breathing a solid breath of gasoline fumes into the franchise.

36ac48fb-5785-4476-8a17-254057e34bac	  Where in Valhalla did "Mad Max: Fury Road" (2015) come from...? For years it was nothing more than a ghost story, limping along in production hell, until finally its trailers released and piqued little to no interest. Now, with the feature finally in cinemas, an unwitting audience has had its eyes opened and re-emerged crazed and amazed. Without warning, "Mad Max" has become a must-see theatrical experience and required viewing for filmgoers and filmmakers alike....Don't skip what I just wrote. Must-see is what I put, and must-see is what I mean. This is an unexpected hit that has shaken audiences in the most awe-inspiring and thrilling way imaginable. After a decade of planning, George Miller has finally shown his hand and taken the world by storm - electrical sandstorm, to be precise. After making children's movies for the past couple decades, Miller somehow convinced the studio that he was fit to direct a sequel, not a reboot (the Hollywood weapon of choice), to a film series that hadn't been popular for 30 years. In addition, he seems to somehow have maintained complete creative control over a property of which many millennials (read: target audience) have little to no knowledge. How he pulled this off is a mystery and a miracle - and one of the best things to happen to movies in a long time."The Avengers: Age of Ultron" (2015) has been hotly anticipated, but this summer belongs to the mad.It is simply the most gorgeous, exhilarating film I have seen all year. Breathtaking action is conducted with balletic precision; Miller masterfully leads the eye from beat to beat, giving his scenes room to breathe and his audience a broad scope to behold. He is not afraid to pull back and let every element of his rich, textured world be absorbed, studied, and most importantly, understood in the midst of incredible chaos. The direction and editing stands in stark contrast to the claustrophobic, frenetic camerawork that has dominated action films over the past decade.It's been reported that Miller spent the years leading up to production crafting every element of this post-apocalyptic future in the greatest detail. From mechanical body art and dashboard decor to endless storyboards and a choreography of violent, perpetual motion, Miller's own gleeful madness has crafted a movie so eye-popping in its reality that repeat viewings are a happy necessity. The camera brilliantly frames and deftly tracks through increasingly intricate, explosive, and dynamic chase scenes with deft purpose.Cinematographer John Seale presents us with generously saturated shots, resplendent with deep blues and fiery reds. Even the night scenes are a triumph of art: Seale overexposed these shots during daylight before giving them their midnight blue tint, thus allowing the shade and depth of the elements to be captured and clarified in the dark. Even if you hate everything else about the movie (impossible), it's intensely beautiful just to look at.Although titled "Mad Max", Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron absolutely share the lead, with the warrior Imperator Furiosa given just as much narrative depth - if not more - than Hardy's wild dog of a Max. Like Max, Furiosa is a professional badass - even with a missing hand. Their gradual alliance is destined to be one of the most classic pairings in cinema. The nihilistic Max is put to the test by the idealistic Furiosa, her sense of morality a bright light in a dark future. In turn, Furiosa's gambit against Hugh "I Played Toecutter" Keays-Byrne's tyrannical Immortan Joe proves disastrous without Max's honed, remorseless instincts. Both the hero and anti-hero plunge into the insanity with only a faint hope of rising above their personal tragedies.Significant portions of the thundering soundtrack are played by Immortan Joe's own band on the run, a raging, tireless team of drummers led by a mutant guitarist shredding an axe so rock 'n' roll that it literally spurts flames. The absurd concept is a wonderfully bizarre choice for the film and a terrible temptation for those of us forced to drive the speed limit on the way home."Mad Max: Fury Road" is a spectacular victory in filmmaking and has rightfully earned its status as a new standard for action movies. Its balance of practical, in-camera effects with tangible CGI imagery, coupled with Miller's patient planning and meticulous layout of his story, is exactly why a movie that could've been another run-of-the-mill action flick has instead become an instant classic....What a film! WHAT A LOVELY FILM!!	2
531d6547-e822-44b6-ae11-d7316dcc8fa8	  The best description for this movie that I can come up with is that it's like a combination of Looney Tunes (Road Runner & Wily Coyote), Fast & Furious, and Mario Kart on STEROIDS! While the story and plot are very simplistic, the visual elements of Mad Max are all amazing to witness (WITNESS ME!). From the practical action sequences to the undeniably incredible production values and stellar acting, MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is definitely an over-the-top masterpiece.	2
304faa7b-0658-4291-add2-741a23c3f40a	  A woman has to drive a car from point A to point B. Then she turns left. what follows is a thrillride like no other that will leave you breathless by the end. This movie will ride eternal, shiny and chrome.	2
6c3c8463-27b7-48d9-bdb5-b77e81be58e4	  Fury Road will make you question if you've seen a real action movie lately. With non-stop sequences and a fantastic ensemble, you are never disappointed.	2

f53e3ebe-fd15-45e5-88cb-6f5b087694b7	  It's not often that remakes can match the original. In this case, it's my opinion that this remake surpasses the original in many ways. The film is dark and light in equal amounts and Hardy & Theron are outstanding. Special mention for art direction & set design.	2

6e7497df-5520-4bda-9387-26ebb5dfb2fd	  Mad Max is amazing. Pure adrenalin awesomeness. Editing is wonderfully coherent for the action scenes. Really wanna see a how it was made of it. Theron was fantastic.	2
c497b2d2-9674-4667-bf78-8772726ac756	  Impressive hyperkinetic action movie, redefining the standards of the genre.Top visuals and consistency. 3D is a must.Dusty deserted landscapes makes you cough. Don't drink too much coffee before watching it!	2
f5420a60-d0d1-4899-b1af-7071bbf89338	  Excellent action, excellent effects, and excellent performances. The title however, should read, "Mad Furiosa". But that's not a bad thing.	2

f27cc9ae-a645-470b-b640-4dbcc257bcbf	  It is certainly a visual and aural feast and a stunt junkie's wet dream but without much else it does get a bit tiresome. There is very little character development and why it is called Mad Max is beyond me, he is practically a nothing character in this. There are a few interludes where characters take a breath to let us know why we should care about what is going on then off they go again and we realise we don't.	1

842c019f-1281-4585-908d-77cfec0fe0cb	  Really stupid movie that is absolutely nothing but a 2 hour chase scene. Now, I like chase scenes as much as anyone, but not for the entire movie and not in lieu of a plot. Any plot. Not even anywhere close to the originals.	0

10ba5cba-2d62-4a67-96b0-a0fefe0e4d86	  I was really really young when the first movie of Mad Max came out and it was kind of weird. I liked it back then but for obvious reasons it kind of scared me, so it was a bittersweet feeling back then. Watching this one, I kind of went down the memory lane and really enjoyed it! It was both nostalgic but also intense for me, and it did not let me down in terms of effects or the general feeling I had imprinted in my mind! The acting was OK, and I am not sure if it really matters. The movie is so action packed and intense that even less talented actors could have pulled it off I think. I was amazed by the costumes, the make up, the vehicles, everything! The music of the movie was so good! I liked the "bad guys" as they seemed and were really really bad and I enjoyed every minute of the chase that goes on for almost the entire movie! The fiction part was there, but it's something you expect in such movies.I was really really close to rate it with a 9 out of 10, but I decided that an 8 is closer to the truth based on other movies of the genre. If I could, I would give an 8.5 to it!	2

b0fc3ceb-49b2-45bb-bc52-afd653161ebe	  Mad Max Fury Road could quite possibly be the best film of 2015, it came out in May and I still have not seen anything better, and we are in November. The action is amazing, some of the best action sequences ever put to film. Furiosa is really the main character of this film as she drives the plot quite literally, Max really only says a few things the entire movie, he is still badass though. The practical effects are what make this movie worth seeing, they could have easily done these amazing action scenes with a computer but that would take away the immersion and this movie would not be what it was, the only drawback is that there is a time when the film really slows down and it gets kinda boring. 4.75/5	2
8ce26176-b6ff-4343-aa54-9eb1875e13c2	  In this fast-paced chase that doesn't stop moving, George Miller finds himself directing not just the movie, but the viewer also. Taking us on a Rip-roaring ride for the ages.	2
f87046ee-246a-4d4d-b1a9-5e1f3b4f2796	  What a disappointment. Only the third movie that I've left mid way. Does no justice the the 1st and 2nd in the set	0
85a784a8-4250-4ee3-ac71-35eaad8cee80	  Is it any good? Yes, it's exceptional. Is it as crazy as it looks? Crazier. Did Tom Hardy deliver? Absolutely, he nailed those thirteen or so lines.	2
12fe21cb-8384-42ea-ac4e-78b0c91dd19a	  great film full on action and not over the top.	2
4f4e0fd8-7ed2-4f69-b851-b98fc76182ad	  Hands down one of the best and most artistic action films I've ever seen. Highly recommended. I'll be watching out for Mr. Hardy now!	2
24d6fe5b-de5e-467d-97fa-386798bce5a3	  How, oh how, can the critics have got this so wrong? Incessant, witless, virtually plotless cartoon action, devoid of everything that made the previous Mad Max films terrific.	0
c4a4cbbb-6c0c-4b86-b452-5f3a832d0c5d	  This one is like an aquarium screensaver, it looks cool but is not something you want to sit and watch for two hours.	0

ed246846-bb63-4635-9b5d-c6f786edea8a	  I am a huge fan of Tom Hardy, he is a very talented actor that commands the screen and seems to be very versatile, however because once again he goes through the film grunting and mumbling I have had to know half a star off. At first I thought he was going to attempt an Aussie accent but soon went straight back into Bain. Nevertheless I do believe he controlled the screen well! The storyline itself was good, simple yet easy to relate and gave a good sense of morality. The main stand out element to this film was the superb special effects and stunts which has been one of the best I've seen within the last 10 years. The film itself knows exactly what it is and plays well upon it, high octane, none stop, balls out action! Contender for film of the year...please stop grunting Tom...	2
886e7d82-c228-4da5-8496-3a4cc4f1a090	  It could have last 45 minutes less, and so doing concentrating action and sparing some useless footage. A lost occasion for a better movie. Back to life? Naiiing the coffin, I would rather say.	0
857f6e54-3508-4fec-9388-3220ed6b9054	  One of the weirdest movies I ever seen.	2
9c25da6a-92a8-4734-890f-3123e8830748	  One of the very best action films ever made, Fury Road is a testament to what all movies should strive to be: A medium so creative it transports us to places our minds couldn't even possibly conceive themselves. The post-apocalyptic world and society in the film is fascinating to examine, and the action sequences that take place within them will have audiences' collective jaws on the floor for the two hour non-stop thrill ride. A 21st century masterpiece.	2
e29659bb-700c-4735-9950-7b30281829b2	  Containing many, many car chases with lots and lots of thrills and spills along the way, it took me a while to settle in to this action blockbuster. Helped along by some touching human elements and occasional comical ones, 'Mad' Max is strangely the most 'normal' character in the film.	1
ed0ca817-16f1-400d-9a9a-f13585f266e2	  Great art direction, strong characters. Great FX.Only notice, I felt like the ending was a little rushed, especially when the middle was that developed.	2
c1f4cc32-ccc3-46a4-a108-40102afcba19	  Mad Max: Fury Road, much like its protagonists, operates on sheer force and drive (pun intended). The thrills and style of this movie are unmatched.	2

38581a97-2f73-402a-bac0-604d927cd51f	  So much action! It was non-stop! Even I was exhausted by the time the movie was over and I watched it from my couch while wearing my pjs.	2
9614c6a5-8a58-46d9-9bbc-c9c32771ee9c	  A glorious symphonic ballet of wanton destruction whose visual poetry dazzles and amazes. Whereas the current popular political correctness deems all life as precious, this weekend jaunt through the local park with the baby in the stroller yells to differ (reminding one of exactly what planet one dwells on). Standing ovation for George Miller, whose charming eloquence about the well hidden truth of modern society is jaw-droppingly stunning. The best apocalyptic vision seen for some time.	2
de62c255-a899-4d16-939c-e324fc5133de	  The movie is beautiful. But Max is not good like Mel Gibson!!!	2

28ae7bba-c8ab-4e44-b944-8086bcfc7955	  I expected to see stylized visuals, amazing action scenes, and awesome backdrops and settings. However, the film's plot and narrative were great surprises. They are both far better then I could have imagined. There are some very minor nitpicks that I can make. However, they do not draw away from what is a great movie, and one I would recommend to anyone.	2

aae2628a-b6a5-40fb-9b2c-1c766edf84c8	  This is a mesmerizing and beautiful cinematic experience that has shaken the film as a whole and resurrected the action genre from the deepest of depths. This film is glorious, magnificent, mad, and raw. Above all, Mad Max Fury Road is a masterpiece, and will stand the test of time as the greatest that cinema has to offer. Thank you George Miller, thank you.	2
4d46d2ac-42a2-446a-9a0e-53f9e8acc092	  May be I was expecting too much, but this feels like retelling of an old story.... everything is predictable. Just ended up watching it for the action....	0
5e08a4b7-623c-44e8-897d-af6fb7947eaf	  I would say that this movie is pretty much the kind of movie that I expected it to be. That being said I think it was a bit softer than I hoped it to be. I think that, again, the Hollywood plonkers have opted to make a movie that got a more palate rating (to them and their cash registers) than what it should have been. It is not as obvious as with Robocop and a few other movies but the feeling is there.It is still a fairly entertaining movie. It is of course yet another special effects movie and as such it does not disappoint. It differs from a lot of the usual special effects movies in that the effects are pretty down to Earth in a bizarre way. We are not talking about superheroes or near magical technologies here but instead we have a devastated landscape, scrounged together equipment and a totally ludicrous desire to blow up the last remains of human civilisation. The bizarre vehicle designs and the totally ridicules behaviour of a lot of people in this movie is alone worth watching it to be honest.As with the previous Mad Max movies this one stretches the bounds of reality (I hope) when it comes to human behaviour and how they waste the few precious resources, specifically gasoline and bullets, that remains after the apocalypse. It provides some spectacular scenery but it also puts a bit of "what the f..." feeling to it all. Not that this part is not expected from a Mad Max movie though.What I think was my latest let-down in the movie was the Mad Max character itself. To me he is supposed to be a real bad-ass. In this movie he was not really that impressive. He certainly was far from the original Mad Max character in my opinion and was really overshadowed by the Furiosa character. I could have lived with that if this character would have been really impressive but she was not. She was cool but she was still underwhelming when comparing to anything in the original bad-ass Mad Max universe. I would say that Tina Turner and Mel Gibson still rules!Still it is a decent futuristic, apocalyptic action movie, maybe not living up to this old movie geeks expectations, but not at all a wasted movie evening. The sound track of the Blu-ray certainly gave my subwoofer an exercise as well.	2
0e78b39c-f803-4124-bb11-1be62c1343fd	  A superb film packed with intense edge of your seat action, powerhouse performances and a fresh sense of absolute craziness which carries throughout the entire run time. It's a fun, entertaining and thrilling chase film with compelling characters, perfectly choreographed action and suspense. Not to mention, it is utterly unpredictable. By far one of the best films I have seen all year and absolutely gets an A*.	2
2dd10ffa-aebe-4892-922a-6bfc1a42094d	  Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best action movies i have ever seen. It has redefined the action genre and had the best practical effects i have ever seen.this movie does have some flaws, one being when you think back the story was't the greatest. Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicolas Hoult and Hugh Keays-Byrne all give outstanding performances.	2

7be24b85-3bdf-49c8-a22c-fab31a897fa4	  This movie is way better than I thought it would be. It's mindless action fun, of course, but it's an incredible ride, an adrenaline rush from start to finish.� I honestly cannot believe that this is the same director that did the first Mad Max films more than 30 years ago.� The direction is so fresh and energetic, it seems like someone MUCH younger with a fresh perspective on action films would be responsible for such a film.� I'll admit that I was never a fan of the first films (never even saw the third) and found them exceptionally boring.� This film is a complete 180 of the originals, it's jam-packed with action, action and more action.� And it's all awesome.� The whole film is a series of car-chase/fight scenes (Car chases!� Fights!� Fights on top of cars!), yet it never gets boring.� It's visually eye-popping, everything is well-choreographed and composed, and the stunt-work is freakin' incredible.� Luckily, there are some moments of down time where we do get to learn a bit about the� characters. It's just enough to let the audience catch its breath, then off it goes again.� The film doesn't bother explaining the hows and whys of this dystopian future, but shows you the world and society as it is now, complete with a culture that is surprisingly well-developed.� The story isn't that deep or compelling, but it's got more substance than I expected it to.� The acting is solid too, especially by Charlize Theron, who is completely believable as a badass (don't let the title fool you, this movie is Theron's show).�� I do wish there had been a little more explanation of the backstory, sometimes the story and characters' motivations get a bit murky... but there is simply not enough room for that in the movie like this, it would have disrupted the flow.� This movie is pure action spectacle and raw entertainment.� It's a Wham Bam Thank you Ma'am, and everything a summer action flick should be.	2

Sometime I like a movie better but not worse, this one breaks that. 98% to a movie I would give 15% and that is for special effects and because Charlize Theron.

24ce95b0-bfff-4393-8693-84ebc7f9514d	  Mad Max: Fury Road was far from a perfect film but it was much more enjoyable than I anticipated. It was exciting, the acting was great, the story (yes, unlike what you've been told there's actually a story) was captivating and, while not really all that original, it felt fresh and unique in how it was told. Overall, this was very entertaining and I look forward to future installments. The negatives were that Charlize Theron has way too large of a role. Even in the trailer and promotional posters, she's clearly the star. Does this hurt the film? Not necessarily but it feels unnecessary. The story should've focused more on Max. We got almost no backstory for his character whatsoever and he maybe speaks a dozen lines. The other element that was a weak point was that some of the scenes were a bit too ridiculous. I expect some of it but not to the extent where you have a guy standing on top of a vehicle traveling at high speeds through the desert while playing an electric guitar with flames coming out of the tip. Yeah, that happens.	2

ce0d9fcc-4f01-4711-8c4e-3dca790eb96b	  While Fury Road is superior to it's predecessors and profits from interesting characters, clever dialog, some great make-up and costume design and fantastic use of practical effects rarely seen nowadays, it also suffers from a lack of a compelling story and fails to take advantage of Tom Hardy's suitable portrayal of Max Rockatansky.	2
af96af02-437a-4b6b-b399-6600c400dd63	  I was worried at first, what with all the hype, that this existentially 2-hr chase movie would be an underwhelming pile of tripe. Of course, it is a very simplistic action blow-em up. Characters are archetypes, dialogue comes with a fair amount of spittle, and there are no real revelations here. It is really succeeds best at drawing you in visually and not letting go. You are chained to this balls-out burst of blood and oil spectacle which hurtles along at such a pace that thinking too reflexively is not advised. There has been much made of the film's feminist elements, and they are intentional and well-intended. However, it falls short in the end; as the plot still relies on the trope of the strong silent man with the brave plan whom the queen needs to convince her to not despair and risk the messy death again to do the "logical" thing. Come for the satisfying crunch of righteous fury, stay for a captivating sequence of explosions.	2

d30daf7c-c43a-40bb-bdff-7dd3ced63985	  This movie is completely crazy and full of weird characters. But if you watched the other movies from the series, you know that this is what you expect when you go see a Mad Max movie. With that in mind this is an amazing ride full of action and crazy car chases with a little bit o story here and there.	2

e5d9229c-9748-40b8-9ac4-117b0e5bc06a	  A headbanging thunderous movie with enough action to fill several more sequels - the guitar guy alone could have his own movie! Awesome summer popcorn madness.	2
992fa8f0-7dbd-480c-b2b4-087af369e1c5	  Far and away the best action picture of 2015 (and possibly of all time), Mad Max: Fury Road crackles with outstanding visual design, superb narrative symbolism, and fascinating editing. There isn't a boring second in the whole picture.	2
2f37671c-a3d7-4a91-a524-576a87d0371e	  I gotta say, a lot of people hyped this movie up big time, and I feel like it didn't meet such high expectations. A second watch is probably in order. Nevertheless, it was a highly entertaining action flick. You can leave plot at the door, it's all about crazy action, and it does crazy action very well. Despite being a gritty story, visually its beautiful.	2
dfd57d41-187e-47a1-a215-cb54544ac814	  Really great visuals and really great action. Characters range from "meh" to good. Hardly anything that can be called a story. Sadly, doesn't live up to all the hype it's been given. It wasn't really meant to be much more than a really good action flick, but, at least for me, that can't make it a great film. At least not as good as I was led to believe.	1
14fbfcac-d9f4-4e62-b638-f51a54f0095f	  Rarely a film of such epic scale has come with so much anticipation and mystery all at once. The long delayed George Miller 's fourth Mad Max film in the franchise is finally hitting the screens and let me tell you, the 30 years gap between Thunderdome and Furry Road was well worth the wait. The film is actually more a reboot than a sequel and it's maybe for the best. Mastermind G. Miller is back with the most incredible slice of dystopian madness you'll ever experience at the movies these days. When everything look and feel the same with avalanche of CGI and total lack of depth, Miller manages to give his film not only heart and guts but a look absolutely unique and beyond anything I have seen so far. Combining the best of technology and old school film making this new episode of the adventure of the lone desert 'Samurai' has a taste of madness like you will rarely see. Inspired by paintings of Dali and Goya for the visuals and probably a few more, the film plays like a massive chase across the desert, restless and uncompromising, nightmarish as hell but gorgeous as can be. Many themes are tackled along the chase and Miller seems to have understood a long time ago that men are beasts with no real future unless women take control and bring back the necessary balance our world needs if we wish to survive and have a future. The character of Furiosa is shown as an equal to Max and some scenes show them looking very similar to each-others, both broken and desperate for redemption. This films manages to bring back the old school adventure flick, a no brainer on the outside but with a lot of depth if you look closer. Miller is a genius on his own, shots after shots he builds a tension of a rare intensity and manages to offer to his audience a film that will definitely surprise a lot of people through it's unusual pace, messages and visuals. The soundtrack is amazing with a lot of percussions during the chases across the desert, pushing the madness as to have a group of drummers playing on the rooftop of a truck and a heavy metal player blasting his flame thrower guitar while chained to one of the trucks. By now you have figured out that you are dealing with a film like no others, filled with images from another world. It will take me a few days to recover from the experience because i haven't been thrilled by a film this much since El Topo of legendary director A. Jodorowski. By now all hope is for another episode soon, a Mad Max: Furiosa would be quite thrilling, let's only hope mister Georgy won't wait 30 years this time... (BTW did i mention that i have seen the film 11 times in all the movie theaters of the Bay Area? You are a fan or a foe...)	2
e4f8e97b-fa62-4fcf-90fd-3d86d182d054	  Mad Max: Fury Road. It's been 30 years since the last time we experienced the escapades of Max Rockatansky and his leader-clad dystopian future. Were the years of waiting worth it? Hell yeah! but not as much as everyone thinks. Of course, it's an action movie, and a phenomenal one at that. Fast-paced, outlandish, and incredibly creative driving sequences make up a decent portion of the film, and these scenes are incredible. But of course, this is what everyone is expecting. I'm noticing very few people are asking "how's the story?" or "how about the characters?" or "how does a dystopian future lead to cult driven biker gangs?" This is the biggest problem with the film, nothing is explained. Why is Max captured by the strange cult? Who is Immortal Joe? How does he have control of all the water? What is the basis of his religion? Who is Furiosa? Why is she leading this convoy? What's the story of all the other gangs? Are they friendly with each other? enemies? Why do Joe's minions spray chrome on their face? Why is Max really involved in all this? All these questions and more will NOT be answered in this film. This is what turned me away during my second viewing of this film. There's a lot of sacrifice of character development and filing in plot holes to make room for all the action. But in theory, that's what Mad Max is. The only film that really had slow moments and focused on the story was Beyond Thunderdome, a film that's overblown by the other two, as well as getting lost in the 80's. At the end of the day, that's all Fury Road is, a chase movie. Although I personally prefer Road Warrior if I'm watching a chase movie. But Mad Max is definitely a great addition to the emerging genre of the Secretly Smart Dick Flicks	2
b1c9362f-337e-4ddd-ae39-ddca4b498ef9	  Even at the beginning, there's no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.The film shares Max Rockatansky's (Tom Hardy) adventures. Max is an ex highway patrolman. He's been haunted by the past, by family he never saved. He meets the Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is being pursued by the dictatorial Wasteland leader "Joe". Furiosa reaches for Max for help in keeping the 'Five Wives'-women she brought with her-into safety, as Joe's deranged breed of warriors called The War Boys, that are barely humans, are raging across the desert to capture them. This pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape, suddenly sending them into a game of survival.After a rip-roaring opening chase sequence, Max is held captive in the Citadel, the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader "Joe" is ruling over. The grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land. This brings the entire populace crippling under his control. As for Max, he becomes merely a blood bag for Nux (Nick Hoult) one of Joe's War Boys, who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader, who has promised them the glory of getting into Valhalla, the promised land.Everything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur, even the feverish chase, even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence. Miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clich�s and retreads, surging into the cinemas, today. It's a visual feast, but surprisingly, with sense. It's explosive in every unimaginable ways, but it's not devoid of a human story, which in this case, is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movie's payroll. Tom Hardy is utterly capable as the main hero, but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on Theron's character. At some point, there would be a sense that Max isn't the only one playing under the spotlight, as it gets evident Furiosa is equally as massive as his role is. Hardy here is singularly stunning, playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required. His mission transcends past his emotional torments and he's never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past. Same can be said with Furiosa, who is not only running from Joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip, but also to bring every woman into safety, back to freedom where they belong.Much of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of Joe's subjugated land, while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way. It's like it doesn't know how to stop, and if it does, that's surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece. There's an enigmatic style Miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world, and it keeps the momentum in tack, if not ever progressing. The tone of the movie, all those vividly dark colors, that magically shifts from something to another, imparts a drowning experience, only it's enjoying and looks festive to the eyes. This makes every eye-squashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza, turning all those burning combustions, metal blasts, and endless pursuits, from mere technical marvels into a hair-raising escapade.Amid these sanity-grabbing action sequences, though, is an emotional streak that keeps Max and Furiousa's humanity alive. This prompts them to survival, into carrying out their similar humane causes, clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society. This turns the movie into something visceral, cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand. It will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives. This needs to be experienced, felt, and forever cherished. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, ignites eternal fire, and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history	2
0d95a146-41bd-4d6f-a7a3-0daf9f7eb2a8	  Good action and good special effects. Story... nothing special. Theron but specially Hardy cannot show their best...	1
c16010f8-0bdf-4ea9-b8f8-dc5410d23813	  If you're into nonstop action and gore, you'll love this critically acclaimed flick. I enjoyed George Miller's Fury Road as much as the next viewer, but I still couldn't help feeling a little empty based on the lack of actual involvement of the titular character. I get Charlize Theron's Furiosa is vital to the progression of the series, but I need more participation from Max. Nonetheless, it's a worthwhile watch. The coolest random bit of this summer was the flamethrowing guitar guy. Amazing stuff.	2
c8cb6524-e521-417e-99fb-ad95b7b5595b	  Best action movie ever. I saw it three times in the theaters.	2
1e2a62e3-3901-44a9-a475-933c794852a6	  Not my type of movie, but well done. A mess of a plot, hard to follow.	1
879e6ada-0e83-428d-9a19-52efe05138b3	  This movie in a nutshell: Victoria's Secret supermodels, one of which is pregnant, run off with Bane from Batman and a really butch amputee Charlize Theron across a barren wasteland, while being chased by the characters of Twisted Metal. Basically, the plot of Waterworld with even crazier characters, but on dirt. At least the cinematography was pretty impressive.	0
c5932a92-8266-4641-833f-eb209c1a1e77	  "Visceral" is the word most often associated with Fury Road, and it's the right word to describe this film. Everything is satisfyingly crunchy, from the roar of deranged V8 rat rods and muscle cars, to the spectacular action sequences, to the colour-saturated landscape, to the pounding soundtrack, capped off by the unforgettable flame-throwing, guitar-wielding, red-onesie-clad Doof Warrior.From the moment it starts, you'll be dragged along for a pulse pounding chase across the desert. It's a simple enough story, but it's obvious from the start that plenty of thought has been put into constructing this dystopian reality. Small touches will jump out at you, like the intricately designed roof of the War Rig or the ritual scarification of the war boys, that will complete your sense of immersion in this world.The only reason it doesn't get the full five stars is because of the lack of Australian humour, although even that appears in places, and for a touch of sentimentality that jars somewhat with the nihilistic survival themes that characterise the Mad Max films.Other than that, so close to perfect that it doesn't matter! Greatest film of 2015, hands down!	2

6f851970-1eb4-4162-aa65-a0ea35e0a144	  While moderately overhyped. Mad Max: Fury Road is still a really good movie. In fact I will go to as far and say that its pretty great. And for someone who is not too familiar with the other mad max movies I can safely say that anyone who hasn't seen them will find a lot to enjoy and it may introduce new fans of The series. While Tom Hardy may not share much resemblance to Mel Gibson He does a good job at making the role his own as well as preforming some great stunt work which is what I want to see from this guy. But by far the best Character/performance in the Whole movie is Charlize Theron as Furiosa who steels the entire show and makes it her movie. In fact she is more of a hero than max is in this movie. Visually this movie is absolutely fantastic. This movie is gorgeous to look at if this film wins the Oscar for best Cinematography I will not be disappointed. The number 1 thing fans go for in this kind of film is the action and boy do we get a lot of it. The action scenes pretty much take up take up almost the entire movie and to say that it keeps you on the edge of your seat would be an understatement. But once in a while the film slows down so that we can learn more about the characters especially Furiosa now granted it is very short lived just so that we can get back to the action but I at least give the filmmakers for at least trying for trying to help us latch on to the main character and making us feel for them during the action scenes. Also did why is no one talking about Nicolas Hoult in the movie. He did a great job and I really felt sorry for his character. My only problems with the film would be that the flash backs that max kept having did get a little overused. Yes we get it movie he has a dark past you had 3 Movies to establish this. Also the Villain was really underdeveloped but with a good look and a bad ass voice that does not matter. All around a great film and probably the best experience watching a movie in a while.	2
0e5546d1-4caa-4863-989b-d05d1d8b6528	  Simply one of the best action movies ever made!	2
8b7fc5cb-19ef-48c2-9901-37edfa60bce5	  For a movie that's essentially one super-long chase scene (with pit stops), it packs a huge amount of narrative power. Character arcs are well-defined, histories are intriguingly hinted at, and the world-building is mind-boggling. And all this done in the midst of spectacular action sequences. But what strikes one the most is how ANGRY it is (as if the "Fury" in the title and character named "Furiosa" weren't obvious enough) - angry at the state of women in a destructive patriarchal society such as the world we live in. And that is the reason why this could very well be a game-changer.	2
b93e1dcc-0739-4de9-a919-2ae0ec439ade	  A great revival to the series. We needed a new one after thunderdome.	2
cfac0a09-aa45-495e-991c-29e5cd5c8741	  The best action movie in years.	2
2b596eb9-77d9-44bd-97c4-2561d7a523c4	  Tom Hardy is constrained even without the face mask, however it's adrenalin, over-the-top action that fuels this bonkers desert race. Hugely enjoyable from mad start to mad finish.	2
46cbe57d-9ae4-408e-b6e6-5de05b0e6250	  Not quite as good a story as the originals, and Mel Gibson boasts a better 'mad max', however the visuals happened to be very engrossing and wonderful to look at.	2
a31f55f5-db6f-4ccd-9b23-a9e32277853c	  I was really looking forward to this film because it got such good reviews and a couple friends said how much they liked it. I thought that there wasn't really much of a story. It was just a lot of mind numbing action and explosions. All of that was really cool to watch, burt there wasn't much more to the film than that. I think the best thing about the film, that made it interesting to me, was the way in which it was filmed. Visually, it was a very unique and interesting film, and I I liked that aspect very much, but the story was pretty simple. I was expecting more.	1
6df9ec99-88df-436a-ae27-6f510962d510	  Wafer-thin plot, but the shear creativity of the visuals and out-and-out lunacy of the stunt-work make for an incredible and exciting two hours.	2

6b343537-923a-4b94-bde5-029e0961d3c1	  A thrill ride from start to finish, Fury Road sets a new archetype for modern day action movies, and most will fail to compete. Fury Road just goes to show what can be accomplished with commitment to vision and piratical effects.	2
19688a61-3ebb-4604-acb1-469d6ee5eae5	  THIS. This is an action movie. I hate action movies because the stories are often vapid. The story in Mad Max: Fury Road is meaningful, It's powerful. And it's matched only by the stunning cinematography. This movie is gorgeously shot and perfectly edited. Every action scene is natural. It isn't forced, even if there are some very choreographed scenes. It works. And considering the movement of the vehicles as these shots take place, it feels real. I'm sure there are some effects used, but the scale is epic and reminds me of the intensity of the chariot races in "Ben-Hur." Simply said, this movie is brilliant.	2
e7285ed1-cbcd-4f41-a40c-14a707b894f3	  God this movie is "Mad" fun! Yes, the movie takes it's time to develop but it's an awesome ride till the end. Over-the-top stunts, great speed and mild gore with the occasional laugh moments (The GUITAR GUY is awesome). Catch this movie if you can... Perhaps stop thinking much about the story and you will be in for a hell of a ride!	2
f62d4226-b14c-4b6e-aab0-65420c2812e7	  Spectacularly shot action movie, but nothing more than one big car chase.	2
fe694343-e549-4d1d-854f-b395e1bd71c5	  God that was boring for an action movie. Just couldn't care about these characters. Didn't really understand their motivations. The world didn't make any sense. Some of the f/x were fun. Lots of practical stunts and such that you don't see much any more. But really, a 2 hour car chase? Yawn.	0
dd03b0be-d977-4a06-8eb9-46115550de45	  George Miller gives us exciting action, a simple story and great performances from Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy and Nicholas Hoult in the 4th Mad Max movie.	2

c8e4094c-dca2-45b2-bc46-b73247a9d1c0	  A waste of time. Ultra violence and not much of a story.	0
7f7fde5f-7f2c-4008-b38c-59788425312e	  I hate this kind of action, but the symbolism is quite strong. The plot is not great, some concepts are pushed to the limit (in a bad way) but you have to recognize their bravery in executing something like this.	1

90ee209e-4913-4fa5-9f04-4d1d0cb1247e	  Mad Max: Fury Road is a visceral ride, featuring incredibly impressive action scenes, some surprisingly strong performances from TomHardy, Charlize Theron, and Nicholas Hoult, and achingly beautiful cinematography. While Inside Out is probably the strongest film of 2015 I've seen in cerebral heft, Fury Road will probably be higher on my fend of 2015 list act due to the fact that I can see myself revisiting this one many times. Verdict: A	2
e50c68bd-ae5d-472a-9e8e-7f54c38c029a	  Unbelievably good. Better with each subsequent viewing. George Miller cements his legacy by expanding both his post apocalyptic universe and the scope of action films. The problem with this film is. . . just kidding, there are no problems. This is a sci-fi action film will impact film making from this point forward.	2

66a4a326-8cdf-4377-b02a-7f3e2a71a9b8	  Upon watching The Road Warrior, I assumed that the rough-around-the-edges low-budget look to the whole affair was part of the charm (at least it looks like budgetary constraints to a modern audience). It turns out that the only thing holding The Road Warrior back was a huge pile of money and a light technological touch-up. Mad Max Fury Road uses The Road Warrior as a baseline and takes it to its natural conclusion, a riptide of cars, guns, and hellfire that starts thirty seconds in and keeps going for two hour straight. Its not without its missteps, and some of its flourishes fall flat, but overall, Miller has shown us exactly how good a post-apocalyptic joyride can be.	2
3e4c65dc-bd60-4114-99bc-02aba7e5e66c	  this movie sucks! the plot sucks...no sorry at all.. it was a petty movie. good to watch when boredom strikes but not when you really want to see something really good. sad!	0

Mad Max is essentially one long car chase, yet unlike most CGI summer action films Max never feels bloated or fake. Theron is the real star here, with Max along for the ride, but the film is stronger (and smarter) for it. Absolutely spectacular. One of the best action films so far this new century.	2

a19cb9f8-ffb2-4c5f-b1fd-6d21cf74293d	  Redefines "non-stop action". Fury Road has to be the longest car chase sequence ever.	2
f7e8830b-36f4-4834-9dec-22f2dd171d7f	  The best action movie since 2014's The Guest and the most rewatchable movie since 2012's Frances Ha.	2
f342a53b-c5b1-4e1e-a747-98f2011d34b0	  The most boring show, with a set of dirty painted faces. Don't waste your money.	0

d7ae2568-535f-4df3-a0b3-34c0ddd0fd60	  My boyfriend wanted to see this movie more than I did and when we left the theater together with 20 minutes still on the clock, by that time I think he enjoyed the movie less than I had! What was George Miller thinking when he decided to redo his original movie? Maybe it was to cover up the Mel Gibson controversy, now he has another mess to dispose of. Like Gibson or not, and the original was a bit before my time, the new Mad Max is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I don't know what the lead actors' names are and don't want to know either, because their completely uninspired performances have me wanting to forget everything about them. Oh, Charlize Theron, not my favorite and further down on the list after Fury Road. The movie reminds me more of the Italian knockoff films made to resemble Mad Max than the original Mad max series of films. Action movies do not captivate my interest normally, and this movie reinforced the norm.	0
878481f2-aa43-41f4-8c74-ba5a643bd615	  how the hell does this get 97%??? People opinions of movies have really taken a nosedive in the 2000s	0
ded90ac4-6dea-4de5-8c79-365fa30c214f	  Just plain bad. Not sure what the fuss was about. Absolutely minimal exposition, so-so action (it just feels so small scale, and not particularly exciting.	0
892b9e72-7027-4f21-9e21-d48d0288fd1e	  I had read mixed reviews about the movie but wanted to watch it anyway and I really enjoyed it, the cinematography was great I thought. I'd like to see more Mad Max movies with Tom Hardy as he played the role really well. Charlize Theron and Nic Hoult did a fine job as well.	2
e3ea80a0-12fd-4d68-b414-1ccdd503ba05	  One of the best action movies I've seen. The visuals are outstanding. Tom Hardy continues to show his range as an actor. The only drawback for me on this movie is there was little in the way of downtime between the action for us to connect with the main characters. I would've liked to seen some more scenes involving Theron and Hardy to develop their chemistry. Overall though, wow, you'll have a tough time catching your breath..	2

9cedf555-cf0a-407c-9842-45e0a59881e7	  A masterclass of film making. This is an action film with the right blend of carefully handled character development. You are left to draw on your knowledge of Mad Max and his world to figure out how things stand. It doesn't lack for story at all - it simply doesn't spoonfeed you. I watched this a second time with my friend at the biggest IMAX in Europe, and I can safely say that it changed my outlook on action movies.So interesting to see the cyclical inspiration of Max Max > Borderlands > Mad Max too!	2
9218d263-ce05-4a1a-be1b-a0da368d8f9b	  Great action movie, beautiful effects and cinematography	2
632c1a8c-8787-4d46-8654-762da92f22eb	  Great action and a wonderful sense of time and place. Mad Max builds it's own world with finesse.	2
aaa2c0ee-1640-4689-81fd-a5ce338ad782	  This movie is an adreline action pack from begin to end and the new look to Miller original franchise is great.Theron played a good Max and Theron she's great as Furiosa.Yeah welcome back Max!	2
015c70f0-d29e-4e5b-8d06-331e95cb6ca5	  Definitely one of the top movies of the year !	2
806523a4-db3e-4147-8742-3b0102c0dbac	  One of the best action movies ever. The asset of the movie is that it relies more on the action than the story.	2
c7d24d0e-5199-4e37-b4d5-1af88ba4cfa5	  This movie has all the things I missed so much. Brutal, dark and irredeemable world, a ton of good elaborate details and many of talented actors. More over, a spirit of the old Max not only was saved but, IMHO, became more strong.	2
43aee628-f2ae-4291-8cdb-393042113064	  Mad Max: Furry Road is a non-stop thrill ride, but I only wish there was more story and character development.	2
09b72289-db80-48f1-975e-4ecde829e03e	  No character development. Whatever little immersion there is, is stripped away whenever Harding speaks. The sped up action sequences keep immersion at bay. The introduction doesn't leave you very impressed with Harding's character, so when we meet Theron's, she isn't built up as a bad ass very well - as its rooted in her hand-to-hand combat with Max.As for world building: spilling water? Are we to believe that anyone survives on such a brief outpour with so much lost to the ground? And what gasoline shortage - everyone and their grandmother, seemingly literally, has an engine in good working order and plenty of juice. Wouldn't have cared less if Max bought it, didn't care when his car bought it. The actors just don't pull any of their scenes off. When the villain fixes to hate the heroes (death of pre-mature son) it looks like he may of just called it a day (silly mask didn't help the actor). When the young hottie takes to meaning business with watching the back or using a gun, it doesn't even live up to the clich�. Zero sexual tension through-out. The Nux and redhead relation wasn't even sweet - again the scenes were weaker than the clich�. I don't even know any names besides Nux and Max.I did like the cinematography of the cool desert night. However, this is where they hatched the idea of travelling 160 days on bikes. Well, maybe if they travelled a mile a day. And of course in a post-apocalyptic world that was short on gas beforehand, there are plentiful bikes - in good working order - enough that the stranger guy gets one laden with supplies and brimming with fuel.Harding is either a bad actor or wrongly cast. Mel Gibson, or any number of others, would have shown guile when turning them all back towards the citadel, a bit of sexual tension when the blonde was in tight beside him in the hatch, and so on.	0
cd6683f0-1ba3-4243-bf6b-d3d6ad32cb20	  OK. Sure... Honestly I'm not really sure what the point of watching this movie is. It's just weird and intense. Not in an out and out bad way, but not in a really compelling way either.	1
432482df-a790-4ddb-9234-0f5158dd9663	  Mind numbing repetition. I don't understand how this film gets good reviews. The story is thin, characters are thinner, mostly this is two hours of car chases and crashes in the desert. It assumes too much. Mad Max was a character driven film where we see Max go from a family man that wants to live in peace, to his trial by fire towards the Road Warrior. By Thunderdome we knew Max, so so it was the development of others against Max's foil that made the story. In this weak tale a Warlord named Joe keeps many wives and has many more sons. Imperator Furiosa helps several of Joe's wives escape while on a "gas run". When Furiosa takes a detour Joe finds out immediately and engages in pursuit, catching up quickly, thus begins the bulk of the film, an endless chase scene across the desert. You'll notice I've said nothing of Max as Max appearance in this film is merely gratuitous. He really isn't needed except to convince Furiosa to turn back to the Citadel and that could have been done by any of the characters. This was not a worthy addition to the Mad Max universe. Perhaps it's time for the franchise to die. I'm glad I only paid $1 to see this.	0
bd70204c-9dae-40ad-81b5-f90c9119ee62	  I look to Rotten Tomatoes to provide me with expert Movie Reviews. In this case I think their rating of 97% must have been influenced through bribery. Mad Max (2015) was visually an ugly movie with stupid dialog and unrealistic special effects. The Original Mad Max w/ Mel Gibson remains a must-see classic.	0
27e23b4a-0490-4e9e-953c-747c787de4e9	  Mad Max is literally the best thing ever.	2
15f18dde-f76f-4dd6-aeb5-1c05fbd1b6fc	  Action packed but lacks in storyline although makes up for the action scenes. Gripping throughout.	2
907121d5-e866-4509-b1f5-2aa23330ef79	  Not even halfway through my first viewing of this fantastic film I knew it will be an instant cult classic. Wont be surprised to see it on "best of the year", "best of the decade" "best ever" lists. It watches more like a music video especially when compared to the early Mad Max films.	2
e681a3f6-d46e-4962-865b-27fee97a292a	  I did not see the other films and this is the worst movie of 2015 in my opinion.	0
919a5c3a-7235-4ad0-94bb-bf4a58a2b098	  Acting and story are paper thin and the action doesn't pick up until the second half. Mad Max him self doesn't have any personality so you don't connect with his character at all. Forgettable unless you spent full price on this then you will be mad for a minute.	0
11e02b52-c88f-427c-a8b9-24eb265bed4b	  This year has been invaded by extravagant movies that feature stunning camerawork and dazzling special effects without a single trace of heart and interpretation. Jurassic World, Avengers Age of Ultron, Everest, Mission Impossible V, Terminator Genisys, Tomorrowland, Joe Wright's Pan, Jupiter Ascending, 50 Shades of Grey, Fantastic Four, Maze Runner II, Insurgent and Furious 7 are examples of great imagery and poor dramatic execution (of course, some of them better than others); but everything is not lost, due to one man and his bizarre but astounding imagination. George Miller and his crew of kamikaze filmmakers depict a desperate world of primeval instincts in this entertaining --and quite possibly essential-- film. Mad Max: Fury Road is a genuine masterpiece in every single aspect: screenwriting, cinematography, sound design, acting, editing, costume design, stunts, music, set decoration, make-up and directing. The film excels in its narrative because of the symbols regarding lost childhood and vanished humanity, strong gender metaphors and the environmental ideas it works with. PERFECTION is an insignificant substantive to describe the best movie of 2015.	2
e5076b8d-05d0-4a2d-9dd7-04404dbbcccb	  There's a lot of good about this movie - It's a great looker, with a great aesthetic and feel. There's action, guns, drugged up skinheads who want to rush to "valhalla" (Or in otherwords, death.), Post apocalyptic setting.. It has a ton of things going for it, but the issue is.. There's no story OR characters.The story is just a simple chase-movie. Main character get caught after which he escapes from being a blood-bag (Skinheaded druggies need his blood to continue functioning.) while accidentally meeting up with a truck full of women who are escaping from the Cult leader of the skinheaded druggies. They're trying to escape to "eden" which by the words of Furiosa (The manly woman who kicks ass) is a green land from which she was stolen from.That's it for the story. 80% of the movie is about getting to that place while fighting lots of skinheads in crazy spiky cars.Characters also aren't built up. Max is the blandest of characters. His character is literally just looking at things angrily and shooting at them. Occasionally sees phantoms of his daughter show up (Which isn't explained at all in the movie.) and shoots more people.Furiosa's reasons for escaping are explained and that's also literally to "save other girls" not really a character trait that has much to it. And otherwise she's also similar to the main character, a hard-ass who gets shit done.And there comes the issue. You will feel interested in side-characters that come from the enemy side because there's simply no reason to LIKE the main characters. Until the end I was actually cheering for the enemies because hey, they were interesting. There was literally a guitar guy who sat on a huge truck which had HUUUGE speakers and was shooting out fire from his guitar!! That's BADASS! Immortan Joe also looks like a barely alive bulgy old man who's like "GO TO VALHALLA NOW".. Which is again.. Pretty neat.But this movie, although it isn't horrible.. There's nothing "GREAT" about it.. It's a solid 60% imho. It's being kept up by its licence and style, but half of the movie is simply less than mediocre.	1

59576ea3-032c-4d07-b18c-2250829d889b	  Was reluctant to go see a re-tread, but well worth it. Over the top action, script, costumes, and stunts. Top to bottom a well done movie. If they made more remakes like this we would be saying WOW that was better than the original. In this case it was.	2
36dbe289-9d12-445c-9e24-4dbbbaeb0b78	  Meh, it was ok, the end sucked quite a lot.	1
33c179fd-abca-4272-b4f1-9f44904e0547	  What a fucking perfect movie. Beginning to end this film does not cease to amaze.	2
2651d081-7222-4cc2-91fd-de51a2acda87	  I have to say, this franchise is better without Mel Gibson.	2
b45feb47-ef12-48e2-aa6a-946ec6ec4b83	  Terrible. 15 minutes of decent movie, but mostly a 2 hour car chase with no plot whatsoever. Absolutely terrible. I want the last two hours of my life back!	0
3c1e3354-fcc2-4bbb-bf89-f5a1b4b13d25	  Good special effects, but not good enough to make up for the horrible story, waste of time. I have no idea how this movie received the reviews it did, childish story. Not worth the red box fees even.	0
59b2bb5c-6ef6-4c3c-967e-26c7c7516954	  I enjoyed this crazy action film quite a bit. I liked how almost all of the action scenes were really filmed and very few involved CGI. It took a little to get into the film as I have never seen any of the previous Mad Max films, but for the most part it didn't have any effect on how much I liked this movie. I didn't see this film in theaters and I heard it was better in theaters and I believe it (if I would have seen it in theaters, I probably would have given it 4 stars instead of 3.5). It sounds like they were be making a sequel and if it's true, I'll try to see that one in theaters.	2
c30f3c9b-42a9-4c65-9dfe-5f49c89775cc	  A solid and exciting action picture. Tom Hardy is good as Mad max but his performance seems shallow compared to that of Mel Gibson in the first three films. Charlize Theron is the real star of this movie but even her performance seems to lack any of subtleties brought to the earlier films in the series by Gibson. Definitely well worth watching and a worthy addition to the genre of postapocalyptic action films.	2
fcb10af3-b6e2-4f39-9643-41093e4cc3bc	  Fury Road is the rare movie that wastes nothing. Not a character, not a crazy vehicle, not a scene, not a single action is this film is done for no reason. Everything is put to absolute perfect use, as we watch amazing practical action play out in a visually cohesive way. But Miller doesn't let the audience get tired, he throws in scenes of tension, character, and emotional weight to round out the glorious apocalyptic spectacle. After watching it three times in three days, I loved it even more the last time.	2
59309bee-12db-4c26-a253-238495fdb960	  one another film :/ but 4\5	2
a43dd754-e268-4e23-88b1-3960293e8a32	  Having watched the first one provided some context to Max's hallucinations, but if you haven't seen any of them, this would still be enjoyable. I haven't seen any of the other ones, so can't say if they would provide any additional context. The action sequences were amazing, which made up most of the film. This is a movie I wish I had seen in the theater!	2
c8dce5d0-bff1-4d81-a3c1-fc3c5e25f3ad	  I was lucky enough to catch a pre-screening in Denver. Since this is an extra-early review, I will go out of my way to avoid spoiling anything.Fury Road doesn't resemble anything else I have ever seen, even including the other Mad Max films. The budget is everywhere on the screen, from the vehicles (I hesitate to call any of them 'cars') to the environment, to the quality of the actors. In every way, it has the feel and atmosphere of a world gone completely insane, with everyone having long since accepted that fact and moved on. Tom Hardy makes the most of a character who is written with all the personality of a block of granite. Even in his most human moments, Max is still closer to a force of nature than a man. Charlize Theron's Furiosa is the brains, heart, and soul of the film, and she does a great job with the role. For essentially eye candy- a role they play admirably- a real attempt is made to give the other women (prominent in the trailers) individual personalities; but this primarily comes off as independent quirks. There are simply too many of them for fully fleshed-out characterization. Still, it's a valiant effort in a film that really didn't need to make it to pull the target audience.There is a strong and undeniable feminist streak running through the film that gets stronger as it goes along, one that has aspects of both nurturing instinct and raw strength. It never feels patronizing- anything that the protagonists achieve has to be torn, tooth and nail, from the hellish wasteland. The 'Immortal' Joe and a rogue's gallery of other assorted baddies are never given the same humanizing respect: they are deformed beasts possessed of an animal cunning and not the smallest drop of decency. Liquids of all kinds play a dominant role in the film, to the point where anything liquid becomes fraught with subtext. It's a simple, unique storytelling technique that works like gangbusters playing against the stark, parched background of the Mad world.Overall, I find it difficult to be overly critical of anything in Fury Road. It delivers on every promise the trailers made and a whole lot more besides, with visceral violence, genuinely incredible action, solid writing, and dozens of moments that made me think 'yes, someone really thought that out properly.' I would hesitate to call it a 'smart' film- that wasn't part of the brief- but it certainly delivers on everything a sane person could ask for, and it is definitely firing on all cylinders.	2

eeae1c6e-0113-4d53-8330-12e856e5b3d5	  To be blunt this Movie is overrated, Now why is that? Well I suppose people find this movie is be "One of the greatest Action Movies in the past decade" due to it's overwhelming use of Explosions and Death to it's artsy weird atmosphere and more use of action than focusing on a story? Nope, people don't seem to realize all of this stuff and are tricked into believed "HOW AWESOME" this movie is, even asshole critics are giving 5 stars to this Eye Sore. So please don't be fooled by It's overwhelming use of action to make you believe it's a telling a complex and interesting action/drama story, because It's not. And yes It does have a plot but It's focusing more on action than it does It's story when It should be a balance, I don't even want to explain the plot because It's way too fucking obscure for me to explain without sounding incredibly stupid, I don't even remember half of the plot in fact. And you're probably thinking "Where's all the positive aspects of this movie for you to give it 3 stars?" I wanted to put everything positive at the beginning but I was just too impatient to wait, this movie is plain and simple Overrated.	1
0a1b891c-716e-48ed-b2e1-0ff27e56e779	  best movie of the year.	2
e9c3f23b-a2cb-478b-8568-36dc904d772d	  An adrenaline filled thrill ride that is almost guaranteed to wow even the most passive movie-goer, Fury Road is filled with interesting characters, strong performances, beautiful visuals, and arguably some the greatest action in cinema history. The overall plot is pretty simple, it's basically an escort mission that you would find in a video game where you have to go from point A to point B, now on paper that doesn't sound too interesting, but the way the film tells its story through the combined use of impressive visuals, interesting characters, and strong non-verbal acting actually give this movie a level of complexity that many movies today lack.	2
096664d9-3212-4e51-9de1-c7fad1ad9dd0	  70-year-old George Miller undoubtedly destroys every other summer blockbuster of 2015, with Tom Hardy wonderfully taking over the role of Mad Max from Mel Gibson.	2

4dcd3f82-9b2b-44c0-a5b3-3cb5a9fda930	  This movie has 97% critical consensus on rottentomatoes... so I'm a bit sad to be joining the 3% who didn't like this movie.It's not for some of the reasons I've seen floating around - it's a Mad Max movie in name only, since Furiosa is the real star, the iconic car is barely in it then destroyed, there's no Mel Gibson, and whatever else. I remember liking Beyond the Thunderdome when I saw it, but I wouldn't call myself a Max aficionado for these details to really matter.I just didn't like it because I was bored. 2 hour movie, and all but 30 minutes of it is car chases. They were well filmed and choreographed and all, but that wasn't enough to make me car about any of the characters or stop me from looking at my watch in desperation wondering if this thing was ever going to end.I'm just glad I didn't see this in theaters.	0

e77ddf9d-d58c-4edd-bf3c-bfded68792c5	  Mad Max Fury Road. Not bad if your a gamer. Reminds you of an action game, except it lacks their depth. Thankfully, this stinking piece of fetid Australian desert-baked roadkill was a free RedBox. 8.3/10 on iMDB and an 87% on Rotten Tomatoes? I want the two hours and 5 iQ points back. Don't bother.	0

b2a839ab-fcfa-4251-9098-3d72afd32510	  There will be those that watch this movie and are left wondering, "What the hell did I just watch?" And to be sure, George Miller can be an acquired taste. But I would suggest you try desperately to acquire it, because the flavors are transcendent!The post-Apocalypse has never looked so good. This film is simply gorgeous to look at. Sure there will be some film snobs tired of the increasingly more common orange/blue palette, but it plays to great effect here. And it makes the Chrome so shiny!Miller has created yet another wonderfully bizarre fictive reality, rich with original characters. If there is to be one criticism of the film it would be that it should drop the Mad Max moniker and simply call itself Fury Road, as Max himself plays much more as a supporting character (indeed he spends much of the film as a hood ornament). The real lead in this film is Charlize Theron's Furiosa, and Theron infuses her performance with such a cool badassery that she seems to be channeling Ellen Ripley, Sarah Conner, and Beatrix Kiddo all at once.The best advice I can give anyone just now diving into the world of George Miller is that it's going to be weird, it doesn't have to make sense, and it's ok to laugh and have fun.	2
f883c42c-1c0b-4f55-8bd5-e212915f9be5	  Action packed with a flame-throwing guitar/bass!	2
1453c212-57f6-4b49-b19e-9b22e4128861	  2 hours of edge of your seat holy fucking shit amazing. Bring a friend, And if they don't want to come fuck em. Bring a couple of drinks and cheer your way through the chaos. I HAD A GREAT TIME!!! AND IT WAS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY!!If I had one criticism I feel like Charlize Theron should of showed up to the gig hungover and looking more like shit. She really didn't match the aura of the movie, A little more back story to her, Even a tease might of been good. But that wouldn't of quite matched her "I'm really unhappy with this hairstyle I just paid $200 for demeanour" AFAIK if shed been as rough as the movie was it could of been the best action movie of all time.	2
c5d7eadd-ab0d-4bcd-a7d4-88c598b2b753	  I watched Mad Max after having heard from nearly everywhere that it was one of the best action movie ever made, although the 2 hours was filled with very few dialogues and a lot of pursuits and violence. I don't know actually what to say on the topic, because the world in which the action take place is very accurately built, and also the character has the same great characterization, both the main and the secondary. The rythm never falls, and also in the moments of calm, you feel that something will roar back soon. There is a total lack of humanity in most of the characters as well, and this give you a strange feel for all the vision. From here to say that is the best action movie ever made, probably passes a lot, and I will not express my opinion on this.	2
2ac50819-02ea-4c2b-9046-b763dac2668d	  I really enjoyed the action pack, adrenaline pump fury as the title suggests. I was fully entertained throughout the end. All the romance junkies looking for a love fest, this film is not for you.	2
57de3106-5583-4e09-845e-e10f36417bbc	  This movie was insane. It was a total trip to watch, all the way through. The world created here(or brought back here) is so alive, despite it's opposite depiction on film. It was beautiful. The scenery, the whole look of the film, was perfect. The stunts, mostly done the old fashioned way, were totally nuts, and fun to watch. Mad Max himself, Tom Hardy, was fine, but not the best character. Charlize Therons Furiosa takes that spot. She kicked ass. This is easily the best action movie I've seen in YEARS. Totally deserves all the recognition.	2
c10310da-0781-424d-be06-e6d85c8afa12	  This film is just one hell of a thrill ride! Lots of great edge-of-your-seat action scenes. Incredibly well done.	2

f90c1770-3084-4a66-a2ca-9580ef8bd912	  The original Mad Max film trilogy of the late 1970's to mid 1980's have long endured as classic, dystopian science fiction movies. They made a star of Mel Gibson and gave us the unforgettable image of Tina Turner in a chainmail cocktail frock. I was a little sceptical at yet another reboot of an old movie franchise, there've just been so many disappointing ones churned out over the years. Here however, we have a great movie, that not only honours the originals but could almost fit easily between any of them. In style, it is more like the first Mad Max movie. It is graphically violent and filled with some great car chase and stunt sequences. The character of Max (now played by Tom Hardy) is almost an anti-hero and says very little. Indeed much of the action and plot centres on Charlize Theron's character, Imperator Furiosa, a one-armed, oil tanker-driving rebel who is trying to rescue a group of concubines from the evil clutches of a local warlord. There's a definite feminist undercurrent to this movie and the female characters are refreshingly strong for a movie of this genre. It is telling that George miller, the original director of the series has returned to his baby and taken it forward. He has managed to recreate the visual feel as well as the spirit of his ground-breaking stories and clearly has a tight control over his vision. This is a real edge of your seat movie. Gripping, good fun and I really would like to see where the "Road Warrior" ends up next. Hopefully, the rumours of more adventures to come are actually true.	2
26682657-df95-4f7c-a197-4e33997ab54e	  i was really surprised by how boring this film was. Also the first time i wasn't astounded by Tom Hardy. Charlize Theron has always been overrated.	1
21ac4b1c-8355-4d24-869a-5eec84f24423	  This movie is epic trash, one long CGI car chase, I would ban this movie from life itself for having less plot development than Wall-E.	0
c3b64356-729f-48e0-9ee0-1a4c5300bbec	  This is a piece of a big and gigantic monstrous action movie ,that gives you the feel that you are inside the film together with the cast!.	2
632a39d3-2838-48f8-a9e9-b79df5a7fa03	  one word to describe this flick...INTENSE! visually stunning action packed 2 hour music video. it barely gives you time to catch your breath	2
b243ff3a-bdfb-4562-839a-80354ba2fb4c	  Mad Max is some horrible fun, and from the very beginning delivered much fire to burn gaping mouths in awe. With intense sequences built with practical effects, George Miller's latest entry to his franchise is sure to bring new fans to his club as he pleases those already in.	2

3e661eef-e3c9-4e45-9ed9-62bac001505d	  Just watched this today. I really enjoyed the movie, but I feel the focus was not about, "Max". I am okay with this because the action and story line kick it! When it comes to car chases in movies these days, I usually fast-forward or go to get more soda. I really enjoyed how the action during the chases worked into the plot. Fun movie.	2
337ee392-5cea-41e4-8cd4-ec1a46d8412b	  First things first, I have to rant a little bit about something that's been bothering me since I finished watching this film last night. And that is the reaction to the film among men's rights activists, or MRAs. Now the very idea of men's rights activism is an absolutely preposterous one since, and think about this, what rights don't men have. Think about it, what rights are these men actually fighting for. What rights DON'T men have? Specifically white men. But, anyway, the reaction to this film was very negative, despite many of them not actually having seen the movie, because of the 'feminist agenda' by having a 'forced female character' in Imperator Furiosa. I guess the complaint comes in the fact that these men believe that women, in action movies, aren't allowed to be badasses because real women take a subservient role to men. Either that or they're damsels in distress or they're the romantic interest for the male lead. These men have got clearly defined roles for women and being strong leaders isn't one of them, at least in films. Even if the film had a forced female character, which it doesn't, as the lead and the one that really drives the narrative forward, it wouldn't be a legitimate complaint. It's not like they make a big deal of Imperator Furiosa being a woman at any point in the film. The film just tells its story and lets its characters speak for themselves. The film having a strong female lead isn't a valid complaint and it will never be, because you are focusing on the gender of the person playing the character and not on the content of the film. So, MRAs and their opinions about this film are not valid and they are human filth. Why would you listen to human filth?With that out of the way, and I do apologize for that but I really had to get it out of my chest, I was honestly really fucking looking forward to this film ever since I first saw the trailer late last year. I really like the original trilogy. The Road Warrior, or Mad Max 2, if I were to compile a list of my favorite action movies, would place very, very highly on that list. Like maybe top 3. I thought that Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was a huge disappointment, but that was probably because of George Miller's lessened involvement. It just wasn't as good as the previous two films in the trilogy. But ever since I saw The Road Warrior, I absolutely fucking loved it. So, when Fury Road was finally announced for release, almost 30 years after the last Mad Max movie came out, I was super excited yet also careful in my expectations, cause the reality might've been that this movie might not have ever matched up to The Road Warrior. Well, I'm here to say this film was pretty much everything it should've been and even then some. You know how I said that The Road Warrior was one of my favorite action films ever. Well, I can definitely say the same about this film. It's really that fucking great. It'd be one thing if it was just for the action/chase sequences, which are out of this fucking world, but the film also has a surprisingly good interesting narrative with some really strong character development for Furiosa, Nux and Max. Here's the thing about Max, while the series is named after his character, since The Road Warrior, all he has been is a pawn in someone else's game. He's a means to an end for some of these people, so that's why I wasn't bothered that Max, while still an integral part to the proceedings, took a backseat to Furiosa because her story to save the wives of Immortan Joe from sex slavery is the driving force of the film. Nothing happens without her involvement. Honestly, Furiosa herself is a fucking badass. I don't give a shit if the MRAs hate me for it, but she's one of the better characters, in any action movie, since, probably, The Bride from Kill Bill. Notice how both those characters are women *gasp*. She's strong and vulnerable all at the same time, like you know there's something about her past that simply fucked her up for life and her actions during the film is sort of her way to redeem herself for what might've happened. Max is also haunted by the past and the people that he failed to protect that ended up dying and how that's the reason that he, usually, goes off on his own rather than stick to a group. Contributing to Furiosa's quest to free the brides also offers him a chance at redemption. Though I do think Nux is the more surprising of all the newer characters, at least from how he transitions from one type of character to something completely different. Nux is, essentially, a War Boy, essentially a fancy name for cannon fodder for Immortan Joe. Nux wants desperately to reach Valhalla, a place where warriors who dies in combat reach in the afterlife, imagine like a heaven or something. Pretty much everything about Nux is about reaching Valhalla because this is all he knows and all that Immortan Joe has taught him. So seeing him evolve as a character is really interesting and Nicholas Hoult is great in the role. Charlize Theron is also pretty incredible as Imperator Furiosa as she, surprisingly, plays the character very subtly. By that I mean the fact that she never hams it up, like there's much more to the Furiosa character than what you actually see on-screen. And that's something that is, hopefully, explored upon if ever a Furiosa prequel ever gets greenlit. Tom Hard is always amazing, so no complains here, but Max is a character that never says, or emotes, much. Have I mentioned how amazing the chase sequences are in this movie? Like the first extended action sequence of the film is one of the best you will see this year, or ever for that matter. The beauty about a film like this is that with, very few exceptions, it's all actually taking place with real vehicles. There's some computer generated crashes here and there, but, by an large, it's actually taking place and that means that it has so much more impact than it would've otherwise. The visual of the apocalyptic dust storm is a sight to behold. I can't even explain how much detail there is in this one desert storm scene with fire tornadoes and shit. It's a visual feast for the eyes honestly. Something tells me that, technically, this scene was probably a bitch to put together. The spectacle of this dust/electrical storm has to be seen to be believed. It's stuff like that that puts this film over the top. The chase sequences in this film are some of the best ever seen on film. Find me a film with better chase sequences than The Road Warrior or Fury Road. I got all fucking day. The costume design is, obviously, excellent. No one does post-apocalyptic costume design better than Mad Max. The Road Warrior pretty much set the standard of what post-apocalyptic costume design looks like. The climactic action sequence is also out of this world. The action in this film is world-class. And, of course, the editing has to be top-notch as well in order for it all to make sense from a visual standpoint. There's so many things going on from a visual perspective in this film that the editing needs to be especially commended because of the difficulties in placing this all together to where it looks amazing to a viewing audience. So Margaret Sixel, the editor of the film, deserves a standing ovation for her work here. I tip my hat off to you madam. But perhaps what I like most about the film is sort of the little moments of character development that you get in between the action sequences. Like how there's a certain respect that's building up between Furiosa and Max throughout the film. They don't do it in a heavy-handed fashion, but you can notice the respect building between the two. The interactions between the wives and the gang of women is really cool as well. Those small little moments of character development is what makes this film and the world feel so fully developed. It's a dark and brutal world to live in and the film does a fabulous job at representing that. With that said, I fucking loved this film if you couldn't tell. My favorite of the year so far and one of the best action films I've ever seen. Though it's so much more than just an action film. That's one of the beautiful things about it. I, obviously, highly recommend this film. Long live Imperator Furiosa.And fuck the MRAs.	2

d9e5ff8a-c7ef-4880-aa43-430db1c5d8dd	  Well, I watched it again. I am still not impressed with this movie. I see tons of action movies, I love them. Yes, the visual effects were amazing, but the rest of the movie falls flat. Lame dialogue, lame characters, etc. One of the villains is a fat guy with an oxygen, really? I was happy with the story until everyone decided opps let's turn around and go back the exact way we can for the past hour and a half of the movie, WTF. Weak story. Where did the ambino war children come from? Why is there no towns other than a gas town? Even shanties would make sense of the story world. Story world environment was lame also. Desert, more desert. I know it was a post nuclear war world, but there could have been more than what we were given. Anyone see Oblivion, way way way better story world environment. I would love to know how people this is an action masterpiece, must not have seen John Wick, Lucy, the new MI movie, which are all 20x better than this. OVERRATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
a3f76e20-7e9b-413d-b195-52e83beb4d44	  One of those films that, much like the turbo charged mega speakers and flame throwing electric guitar, torch the earth in pitch-perfect action. A revelry drum charging into new territory.	2
319940b7-24d4-437e-91d8-a75eba131d89	  The movie is an all-out blast that will leave you in awe even months after seeing it. Practical effects look amazing, and the stunts are extremely well done. The only thing keeping this review from a 5-star rating is an overall lack of focus on the plot, but that's excusable due to how entertaining the film is.	2

9412f0dd-ea6e-4757-b168-b18611b0ac50	  OK it was a really strange, weird and creepy action movie. I think lots of people didn't like it, but I liked it! George Miller (The Witches of Eastwick, Babe, Lorenzo's Oil, Happy Feet) is my favorite director. Mad Max 2 was like this and that's his Aussie style action. Best performer was Charlize Theron, she was calm, cool and wonderful! Tom Hardy was cool too. Nicholas Hoult (About A Boy, Warm Bodies, X-Men: Days of Future Past) looked different and he did nice performance. First I thought story is boring, but climax car chase action sequences were really dynamic, heart pounding and fantastic! 3D effects were really vivid, colorful and amazing! Ending was great! If you like car action movies, you should watch it! 3D is better!	2
a48093d4-ba79-4545-8968-ccc9a14e1baf	  Meaninglessly gory, depressing, ugly and bereft of substance, this movie was by far the most torturous two hours of my life--two hours that I regret that I will never have back (and I've had a sigmoidoscopy before). The characters have about as much backstory and dimension as a toothpick, and the mindless action is stupefyingly dull. While I can never un-watch this overrated drivel, I sincerely hope that my review will help you recover two hours of your life.	0
c4e61c6b-94a7-4b77-94d4-9050f2793dea	  Witness this movie if you haven't already. As someone completely new to Mad Max, I was thoroughly surprised at how much I loved it. Now I gotta see the first three.	2

344bc50d-4b65-4833-a42a-497d30633f4f	  This was the biggest waste of two hours I've spent in a long time. If you're into meaningless undeveloped characters, over the top props, ridiculously impossible in the real world action and shootings, CGI generated stunts, and almost no plot, this is your movie. From the first moment of the movie till the end, its non-stop explosions, chase scenes and gunfire. Thanks, but I'll just play call of duty when I want to watch insane action.	0

d206c1e2-47c3-404e-87d5-5f1bc4b96a30	  "George Miller has said that the best version of his film is in black and white, with no dialogue. BLACK & CHROME is an attempt to realize Miller's alternate vision. The cinematography, the editing, the sound design, and the score, are now represented in a completely new experience." Warner Bros. may have removed the video by now though.Contains some SPOILERS. I just watched Mad Max: Fury Road how director George Miller originally envisioned it being: black and white with no dialogue. This is my first time seeing Fury Road. I missed it in theatres. When the film was coming out and black and white trailer was released for it, that made more sense to me for the setting of the flick, honestly. I was able to follow the narrative from only the visuals. With the exception of grasping all of Imperator Furiosa's backstory, that is. I can kind of guess, but I am still not 100% sure.From what I gathered, she's someone of high command for Immortan Joe. Unlike other women being used for their milk or intercourse (for the purposes of giving Joe a son, hence the words "Our Sons Will Not Be Warlords" along with "We Are Not Things"): she must be unable to bear a child and was forced to become useful by becoming more like a male crony for Joe (i.e. her appearance of having no hair which is what all of the members of Joe's men look like). I wouldn't be surprised if her arm was was lost thanks to Immortan Joe initially either, for her failures I mentioned earlier.Furiosa represents not adhering to societal standards visually, a woman with agency nor solely a love interest, and a character with a disability, all together! YES! Excuse me as I go send George Miller and Charlize Theron hundred of letters of thanks. All of the other women under Joe's tyranny wore dresses of some kind whilst Furiosa did not, reinforcing my belief of her becoming more male-like as she worked for Joe that gained her a high ranking in the process. Not since Ripley from Alien has there been such a cool character that outshines (more like steals the entire show) from the titular Max.On top of that, the Wives aren't exactly damsels in distress, some of them help out. Eventually, Furiosa and Max get assistance from other women of varying ages (including older, you hardly see that!) and color which kick as much as butt as they do. This was something I was sooooo happy to observe. :') The Fury Road character of Nux is another fascinating addition to the motion picture I'd be remiss not to type about. His arc is one of being worthy of going to Valhalla by dying as a man: besides Max he's the lone other prominent male non-antagonist character. He himself is dying, utilizing Max as a "blood bag". Before joining them, he's very child-like, but with Furiosa and Max and the Wives his personality and character matures.Fury Road is an action-packed ride that rarely has any stops. During it, director Miller gives some characterization sandwiched in between all of that as well. The vehicles have tons of personality, what more do you want?! These moments would probably be stronger with dialogue, but I believe I got the gist of the majority of them. It isn't perfect, yet it all works rather well. Currently my top cinematic experience of this year with Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation right behind it.Hrm, I should view the one with dialogue next I think? Or would that ruin the impact of Miller's original vision? Uncertain now.	2
f0be17f7-e70d-4518-82b3-ba66d9392ea4	  There are moments in the history of our culture where we were blessed with something deserving of a title such as "masterpiece". For instance, in music, people generally hail Michael Jackson's "Thriller" album worthy of masterpiece status. With film, the Godfather comes to my mind. This movie, is no ordinary movie. It's a modern day masterpiece. It breaks the mold of films, and gives us something new, something fresh. There isn't a ton of dialogue from the main characters, but the idea is that we don't need it in the first place. Just by looking at Max you almost get this feeling that you know exactly what he is thinking at the time. Sorrow is portrayed beautifully in the little moments and happiness is resurrected in the end. This movie allows for multiple viewings and you really should take advantage of it. Because this is no ordinary film. This is a Mad Max film.	2
e26dcd7f-a656-4197-9bf2-222440f45fbe	  150924: I've spent 24 hours thinking about this film and still find myself wondering what to say. Symphony of special effects comes to mind. Extravaganza of modified vehicles and violence. It seems to me that the first two Mad Max films had a story to them. I didn't really find this much of a story. Fight to escape, and then strangely enough, fight to return. That's about it. Am I over-valuing the first two films? This will be one of those DVDs one can buy spending hours reviewing all the small details missed the first time. And, there are a lot of small details in the characters and vehicles. So many, in fact, that I found myself constantly scanning the screen in an attempt to take them all in. The guy behind me kept holding his breath during the battle scenes. I thought he was going to pass out. Each time the action calmed for a second he took in this big breath. The action is non-stop and there are some endearing, if not enduring, characters. I won't give it more than four stars because it's nothing more than what I've stated. Reminds me a bit of Pacific Rim (2013). You won't be bored.	2
ebdeb11b-5b8c-4c6b-8e37-d5dd4f2fad00	  anti mainstream action movie.. like the flamethrower guitar.. witness me!	2
bb2f6603-6ede-413b-9bd9-3fc7ecfeaee2	  As a action packed movie, this movie nailed it all the day with it's incredible colourful visuals and lack of CGI. The problem was that there wasn't much of 'Mad Max' in this film than the other prequels, which was very disappointing since the entire franchise is depicted on him. Instead the film should've been called "Furiosa: Fury Road" as she was mostly featured through out the film. Another point, was the whole vehicle chase scene was just copied from the second and third installment with more gore and action. Though gotta give credit for those damn monstrous vehicles. See my point is this movie was great and all but I would like to have seen more of Mad Max and a fresh unexpected story to start of the fourth installment after like what 25 years!	1
501c7ce5-42e6-4c97-a1cd-2b1e67ec7d8f	  It definitely lived up to the hype. I would definitely recommend this if anyone was wanting to see it.	2
d30fefe3-b38e-45b9-aedd-6b6607327192	  for nearly 15 years have we only received a handful of action movies that have a well crafted source of action, character, and high octane storytelling.... Fury road is one of those movies. In terms of not only a film having a wide range of being able to show the action in a clear and clever way. Just like how Christopher Nolan revived and changed the superhero comic book genre as we know it today, George Miller has returned to revive and change the action movie genre that we know for the better.	2
a626d727-fb4a-48be-baaa-8924abad1836	  A Mad Max for the Happy Feet Generation 71-year-old director and writer George Miller has taken a 30-year hiatus from Mad Max; but in 2015, Max is back! This is a completely reimagined post-apocalyptic world. Forget Mel Gibson; Tom Hardy gives a fantastic performance as Max. Hardy offered few lines of dialog, but he spoke to the audience thorough his action, he also had help with his supporting cast of Charlize Theron and Nicolas Hoult giving equally as impressive contributions to their respective roles. For those of you who are familiar with the world of Mad Max, you will get a pleasant surprise. I'm not sure if it ever specified as to where in the world this film takes place, but it looks a bit different than the original trilogy. That being said, it was a great improvement, and for those of you who have never seen the old Mad Max or have even heard of the film you will also be presently surprised with a fantastic action film, that ranks among the best ever made. Furiosa (Theron) is charged with taking a war machine to fill it up with gas. When the self proclaimed God, Immortan Joe figures out that she is going off course to escape with all of his wives, he goes mad and follows after her with every car available in his kingdom. Max is a captured "blood bank" for Nux (Hoult), a driver trying to make his name know to Immortan Joe. Braving through a giant sand storm it is a race against time for Furiosa to escape with the other women. When the film is boiled down to its core, it is a two and a half hour car chase on the back drop of an absolutely gorgeous desert landscapes, including a giant sandstorm tornado, and the best action set ever to be put on film. The effects are outstanding and realistic, the acting is phenomenal, and the cinematography is beautiful. Any action film fan will love this, whether or not you are familiar with the mad max story. Taking the time and money out of your day to see this film will be worth every cent.	2
ae33bde0-ff0a-4dd9-8b7e-10981158e199	  This is my first experience of the Mad Max franchise and had much to learn about its story. This movie taught me all i needed to know and its a bizarre world full of character and stunning imagery. Its a strange movie but one that keeps up an impeccable pace and is full of brutal action. Really the whole movie feels like one massive racing scene and on reflection not much happens but the full 2 hours is a fully entertaining adrenaline rush. Im positive this is a movie which can be enjoyed by all due to its unique style and extensive entertainment value.	2
bdbee652-6f1e-41b1-9493-0c8e3fb4f918	  For the first time in as long as I can remember this is a film that actually lives up to it's trailer. Basically go watch the trailer, if that looks like a good time then go watch the movie. It's rarely that easy but honestly Fury Road is such a masterpiece of quintessential action filmmaking that there really isn't much else to say. Director George Miller has reinvigorated the Mad Max mythos with an unexpected surge of gorgeously photographed action set pieces that put every other big budget superhero/action film this summer to shame. Even more surprising than watching a 70 year old George Miller hand Hollywood's action filmmaking elite their own asses, is that Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa is the star of the film. Theron has created a badass for the ages and the decision to have her character drive the narrative is brilliant. This film is a triumph of high energy, action filmmaking and deserves to be seen repeatedly on the largest screen humanly possible.	2
5193d487-f43b-434b-a4f4-50f16fc247a9	  This was a tedious grungy chase / war movie that I couldn't wait to end ! Despite the good art direction everyone looked like they just got back from burning man and Charlize Theron was a waste as an action star . I'm glad I saw it on DVD and didn't waste the money at a theater ! I'm really amazed that so many critics liked this ! I'm being generous with 2 stars ( for the art direction ) Sorry but the rest was a bore !	0
727d0e5d-955e-4529-bafc-ac6cd37016b5	  Weird movie this one. Sure there's a lot of action, explosions and fire but what is it all about? The acting is great and Theron is awesome. Mad Max hasn't got much lines. Oh well I stayed awake most of the time.	2
5d34fd0e-2c08-4aaf-acc5-f2cef089e251	  Loved the original but this new one sucked. If it wasn't for me riding my fitness bike and burning 1400 calories while I watched this, I wouldn't have gotten anything out of this movie.	0

afdc7610-5223-42b5-82ce-022f2c568681	  Finally! A remake of the notorious and infamous post apocalyptic action film, Mad Max, Fury Road. With a collage of profound creativity and limitless imagination, George Miller, cast and crew deserve the industries most distinguished recognition for this incredible production. From costume design to monstrous mutant machines to high risk stunts and a compelling score from the orchestra behind the scenes, this film defies all the stigma of a typical monotonous sequel. The film speed variations, close ups and panning and zooming contributed significantly to the riveting and seamless action. Amazing aerial drone footage and natural settings. Excellent casting and authentic looking extras. This film is a direct result of professionally coordinated hard work. I thought there was just one element it could've used. Tomorrows technology depicted as outdated technology: solar panels. Hybrid and hydrogen energy. Cellular and UHF communications. But there is a certain admiration for the dedicated old school discipline that is just not for sale. If you went to see this movie expecting something resembling "Terms of Endearment", no one is interested in reading your review. Anyone fit to grant this movie with less than 4.5 stars, can never appreciate what it takes to produce ten seconds of a specifically original feature action film like this one.	2
a3d623c3-2010-489c-abdd-76f46344cb7f	  Mad Max: Fury Road is confusing, it's unsettling and it's absolutely entertaining. Even though this is a sequel, George Miller has given us the most unique film of 2015. It really is like nothing you've seen before. Plus, this movie is filled to the brim with impressive practical effects and remarkable stunt work. This is an adrenaline-fueled ride through the mind of a crazy person, and I was happy to be a passenger.	2
eb7a57bc-2076-4856-8d0d-8d308e135ff3	  I can certainly see why this got good reviews, damn.. what a movie! The action scenes in this were something else, probably the best I've ever seen in a long time. The bad guys looked menacing, the visuals were stupendous.. even the old ladies in the final showdown kicked some serious ass. I loved that there was a dude rocking out to some metal during the whole thing hah the only thing that kinda irked me a bit was how things were wrapped up so neatly at the end when they arrived back at the Citadel, but that's the only issue I really had and a very minor one at that. I'm shocked I loved this when I found the original Mad Max trilogy tiresome(I slept through every one). I'm calling it now, BEST MOVIE OF 2015.	2
0c71a38b-49f8-4c9b-b03e-d3de42ca5827	  Entertaining? yes. Visually amazing? yes. Good action and cool style definitely. Best movie of the year? Meh not in my opinion. Best action movie ever? Not even by a long shot. I'm a huge fan of Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron and they were fun just like the movie. I do think it is a bit overrated, If you want action from beginning to end, yeah sure you get that but with basically no substance. It is a fun watch and I actually feel I'll like it even better after a second viewing but can't help but feeling let down after all the hype.	2

df8046a4-3efe-4530-ba31-e5cb6a3826f9	  Dumbest movie I've ever seen. I don't know where these positive reviews are coming from (aside from pot induced stupor). Bad acting, stupid/no dialog, stupid plot, etc. You name the category - failure on all counts. Written and directed for low IQ teenage boys.	0

9576ccab-44d6-490e-9604-296078448525	  This was amazing, a two-hour chase movie with a feminist messege and nothing but action. Mad Max is back. Best movie of 2015 so far, by far.	2
18777554-6b4e-4202-97ee-877fa1710da2	  Badass, no stop action with an incredible blend of CGI and practical effects. 10/10 will watch every weekend!	2
140ae58a-fcb1-4783-9c85-767d2399a11c	  Do I even have to say why this is one of the best action movie , if not the best Action Movie of the 2010's ? It has Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, and a guy playing an electric guitar with a s**tton of giant speakers in the back ....What a Lovley Movie.	2
b2e69e67-fab9-40e4-8ee7-625efe9e3955	  After what people say that Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome a disappointment. I think George Miller will make up for it with Mad Max: Fury Road. Mad Max: Fury Road is currently my favorite action film ever made. It is a modern action classic and easily the best film so far in 2015. It is a Milestone in action film history. Tom Hardy does a descent job as Max Rockatansky not as good as Gibson but good enough for the film. Charlize Theron is also very good I think Furiosa will be an iconic female action character like Ripley and Sarah Connor. The action in this movie is some of the best I've ever seen with great stunt work and no terrible CGI like most action films these days. If you want mindless action unlike The Expendables or Fast And The Furious movies watch Mad Max: Fury Road because it will give you an experience like no other.	2

6b562d39-d1ec-442b-aa60-97715eaceca7	  Some of the best action set pieces I've ever seen on film. This movie is so intense they should have seat belts in the theatres playing this. You can tell that this is a very distinct vision from a director and not a film made by focus groups and studio heads. A different movie making style than your average action movie. The story is pretty barebones and the production design is pretty steampunk/strange and might turn some average viewers off but what a thrill! Not a casual movie to watch. You better hold on to your hats and glasses because this joyride is a brutal one!	2
e04983b7-09a7-4c40-851a-e3e9f5e35804	  Visual effects are so cool. Should change the title to "Crazy Max"...	2
9aac436c-429a-4fb9-9ccc-a4bc3bc092fd	  What a crap story. If it wasn't for the action, this movie wouldn't have a leg to stand on. "Let's hurry up and leave so we can go back." WTF?	0
aec77cfe-c79b-4a75-82e6-985e532dd985	  Unrestrained and insane from start to finish, Mad Max: Fury Road is an enthralling action film which never stops to take a breath.	2
8d6e72bb-08a8-4b17-b632-70c262bb5120	  Over-the-top action film. A great follow-up to the Mad Max trilogy but could have used more dialogue from Tom Hardy and a little history as to how he got here. Actual Tom Hardy says very little in this film and that loses it one star.	2
97374752-6a09-4aa9-8722-9f9e096bbae8	  Amazing movie! Action packed, likable characters, and a story that wraps up nicely. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron deliver a wonderful performance.	2
ecb12f81-d93e-4c2e-a344-6f9abe0cfea6	  Let's be honest: nobody was asking for a reboot of "Mad Max." It's one of those old sci-fi series that were good in the old days, but no one really needed to see again. "Fury Road" completely blew away all expectations. Easily one of the best films of the year, it incorporated so much well-shot action and so much meta-commentary on resource usage and women's rights that it's amazing no one was clamoring for this sooner. Now, everyone wants to be witnessed. Tom Hardy was a solid choice to replace Mel Gibson, but everyone knows that Charlize Theron was the true star of George Miller's return to prominence. Theron's Imperator Furiosa is easily the best written female action character of the last few years and honestly, probably of all time. Her character's sole mission, after achieving military greatness, is to rescue Immortan Joe's concubines from a lifetime of breeding. Her performance is both subtle and in-your-face, which is what pissed off the last remaining "men's rights groups" that still laughably fight for relevance. Theron deserves massive credit for bringing humanity to a world that is massively devoid of such things, but George Miller deserves so much credit for crafting this desolate world. The action scenes are perfect- the creative decisions are beyond impressive, what with an entire vehicle dedicated to a guitarist and his wall of amps. This film is mad impressive: and goddamn, I hope it gets a sequel.	2
a6c58e19-9406-4308-9e62-3fcb7a669346	  2 hours of non stop fun and excitement.	2
625c787a-1e1e-42b7-806b-48ec10bdaf62	  Critics gave this a 97% positive rating. Many were amazed at how Charlize Theron was "transformed" physically to play this role. PROSA possible new drinking game here. Every time you discover a really bad visual blunder or terrible editing job, take a drink. I guarantee you'll see less than half the movie before you're passed out on the couch. Another possible drinking game.....Charlize Theron is beyond beautiful. For this role, she cut all her hair off and rubbed axial grease on her face. Guess what, it's still f**king Charlize Theron only with short hair and grease on her face. So the drinking game is, when you first realize you're looking at the "transformed" Charlize, start drinking and don't stop till you pass out. Unless you have the intellect of a grape, that'll be in the first five minutes of the movie and you'll be spared death by boredom which occurs within a half hour. Positive note and suggestion. It's better to rent the streaming version as opposed to the less expensive physical DVD. This will actually be less expensive in the long run. Having the actual physical DVD, in front of you will give you the strong urge to destroy it and relieve the world of one copy of this crap. Investors gave money to this project. They're out there and they're giving money away. CONSWriter has serious Mother issues. This movie took two hours of my life which I will never get back.	0

1a20e5fd-7c74-4cb7-b321-bbcc1d1865dc	  Mad Max is an absolute masterclass in world-building. Steamrolling (literally) at a breakneck pace, there isn't a dull moment in this quirky post-apocalyptic car chase.	2

8885370f-71a9-4cf8-aab9-695c156ace33	  While it is packed with action packed car chases, fights, and stunning cinematic vistas, this film also does a great job of filling out the backgrounds of the characters during the film. At times it has a theatric feel to it with soliloquy like moments, and at others it is a chaotic circus. You really feel you are in the truck with Max as he, along with Furiosa, leads their group on a quest for a better life.	2
1073e888-fa20-4cb9-a669-04cc977d0855	  Pretty darn good and best movie so far of 2015 and one of very best in past two yrs. The lets turn around part was quite predictable though. Or would have been A 10!	2
166ed90d-6b93-4560-9ded-d7c9a82513a6	  The action sequences are fast paced , the visualization is stunning , the screen presence of Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron binds you to the seats. This 2 hours straight post apocalyptic thriller is deeply entertaining	2
1eac5a5a-ed1e-45ca-8921-59f710454712	  Great film, one of the best of the year without a doubt. The story and acting was great, the costumes, effects, choreography, sets, vehicles were excellent. The highest grades go to the amazing stunts and how the director weaved them seamlessly with the story. This is the best Mad Max film made and an entertaining film from start to finish. Note this film is rated R and is not a family film. This film takes a bleak and heartless time and manages to find humanity and heart where it is conspicuously missing.	2
bc76fd21-bfd1-4418-aed5-108dc49ded61	  I would best compare this film to another film that came out in 2013 by the name of Gravity. Gravity, much like the film I'm reviewing right now, was a spoon fed, overly praised film that places more value on aesthetics than it does on engaging characters or a worthwhile story to be invested in. Just like Gravity, one bewilderment towards the overwhelming positive reception versus the actual quality of the film shouldn't be a surprise since if you remove the technical achievement all you'll have left is superficial entertainment with a two hour car chase. It's a dumb action film with a high budget, and cool car stunts which is sadly all it has to offer.Around this portion of my reviews I would provide a synopsis of Mad Max: Fury Road, but any sort of synopsis should be considered a spoiler. There's very little plot in the film that required three writers to create. To put it in perspective the film without giving away thin specifics is basically like driving a couple miles away from your home to get water while being chased by lunatics, remembering there's no longer anyone guarding your home for some reason, and returning home the same way you came even though it was blocked after an explosion. That is all that occurred within two hours. Like mentioned before, this took the effort of three writers to create is pretty pathetic not just in writing, but filmmaking as a whole.It's titled character, Max, is a man of few words, fewer defining characteristic beside having a tortured past, and less of an engaging character. Max is relegated to a supporting role who just goes with the motion of events. Some attempts are made in providing a backstory to Max, but it is thinly stretched out. All that is told about Max through hallucination is that he failed to protect people. Their importance is never specify almost as if discluding any newcomer in the franchise. If it fails to stand alone as it own entity then it failed before filming began. Nope, instead of providing stronger context it's better if that time was better spent on very long car chases instead.More ridiculous than the thinness of the story is the presentation of serious moments. Car chases take up 90% of the film are bombastic, and loud which when applied to a character, Furiousa, talking about redemption can't be taken seriously. That's the clear points of these moments, though once again I want emphasize it took three people to write this story. Without much exploration into character backgrounds it further deteriorate into an eye candy spectacle that only manages to hold your attention because of it belief it would lose its audience if there wasn't a extensive car chase for every few minutes focus on plot.The film opens up with our main character Max being captured, and in an attempt to escape shows to the viewer(s) how insane the world is. This very early scene shows a crowd of people gathering around to get water with the images presenting a clear picture of how important this resource is in the world. Yet, the three writers felt the imagery of this scene wouldn't be enough to convey the desperation in its world either being water, healthy people, or fertile land which is why lines like "As the world fell, each of us in our ways were broken" is spoon feeding to the definition. Much like the example I use in the opening paragraph, if it was entirely muted (we're talking about virtually no dialogue) the film would actually be an achievement in storytelling regardless if it needed to use simple caricatures for an action movie. Unfortunately, with spoon fed dialogue like that it's a blessing and a curse the characters don't talk as much as they do taking away from the experience.Characters are simplified to very basic character arcs; most notable examples comes in the form of Nux and Furiousa. Nux wants to be taken to Vahala which loosely can be tied to religion as much as Furiousa search for redemption from an event that's makes a very loose connection with the antagonist. Nux doesn't suffer as much as Furiousa in his basic characterization due to his simplistic loyalty painting a clear picture of his arc when he enters the picture. Max goal is to possibly get over past demons and survive without talking much. Now, Max getting over his demons isn't an issue since it's what drives his character to be a better person than he was before. However, Max being muted when Furiosa is trying to kill him is idiotic. He's man of few words, but not very intelligent...or is he? The script can't decide on that as in one scene Max manages to get a truck out a swampland that got mired in the desert by the use of the only conveniently found tree in that area. So his reluctance to speak in a scene where women are trying to run away from the same lunatics chasing Max, and the leader is attempting to kill Max a simple explanation would have avoided a well choreographed, but rather pointless action scene.So earlier I made a rough outline of the film general story by making up an example. That outline has serious issues. First, there is an explosion in a canyon with only one entrance way being shown. That entrance gets blocked by rubble of rocks. Yet, when the characters decide to return to where Max was taken seemingly using the same road. Second, we're in the desert and making further suspend your belief is despite the large locations shown throughout the film Max takes the same route to return to the Citadel (where the film basically starts). Lastly, the antagonist took all of his men when chasing down Max? If not, how come the citizens of the Citadel didn't kill Immortan Joe (the antagonist) if his power was so limited? It would explain the ending, but if so, even if the antagonist did strike fear in the people's eyes the numbers of baddies still in the Citadel is larger of that of what the Immortan Joe took with him when chasing down Max and his Five Wives. In context characters finally stop looking for answers in other places that might not exist, but also in context it basically means the outline of the story is unbelievably goofy.If you're looking for action, but mostly in the car chases variety Mad Max: Fury Road has impressive stunt work. For starter, the way Mad Max: Fury Road is filmed is done like an expert. The camera in these car chases usually follows the cars without shaking the camera. No matter how many cars are on screen together or if there's an explosion the camera doesn't need to shake to emulate the chaotic nature of just occurred in a scene. It does it through visuals favoring long takes with wide shots angle to see every bit of carnage done in the film.Another aspect of the car chases is the smart uses of wide shots throughout lengthy sequences. A common problem for directors of higher budgeted action movies is that a director would make the mistakes of using many mid-shots instead to be closer to the action instead of pulling the camera further for a better flow. One of the best example is a scene where Max is attempting to break the window of a car from his capturer who's planning to kill himself in a blaze glory during a desert storm. In the background, Max is seen struggling to hang onto a car and attempting to break the window while in the foreground his capturer is preparing to kill himself. This paints a picture of struggle, and a time limit within the same shot. This also applies to car crashes as when a car gets destroyed the camera shows the entire car as it gets destroyed. However, instead of pausing to display this demolished car it will instead continue to follow the action. One prime example of a George Miller expert direction is in the film there's tanker that explodes, and how he displays it incorporates many techniques. From this lone scene in a couple of seconds Miller combines CG, shot composition, and editing to seamless effect. As Max is fighting against a Warboy on a pole/ladder that's very close to touching the ground in motion he successfully kills the Warboy; with the ladder now having less weight Max attempts to get himself onto safety in the foreground on a moving car while the background a tanker is exploding within the same frame of shots. This moment doesn't last any longer than seven seconds, but seamlessly through expert uses of CG, shot composition, and editing it's a seamless flow of coherence that Miller often succeed in duplicating throughout the film.The stunt work is nothing short of amazing. Cars are demolished on screen alongside obtaining a high body count from in the film characters death. In general, the stunt will require a dozen or so cars as well participants to do insane set pieces. Not only do the stunt crew having perform a dangerous stunt on constantly moving vehicles, but also do it with visibly little protection and sometimes with props like spears, pipes, baby bottle, spray can, and anything that can be found in this post apocalyptic film. What's pulled off successfully is a string of convincing looking stunts that at some point in the film you'll begin to believe every single stunt was done by actual person. In some scenes a dummies is used, but with an expert stunt crew it blurred the lines between a real person and dummy that it's not even noticeable even among action aficionados.CGI is used in virtually every single shot of the film, though it's mostly use on either filtering colors or enhance the effect of a scene. For instance, going back to the tanker explosion if you removed the CG from that explosion you'll still have the same explosion and stunt in place. The only thing the CG is adding was enhancing the effect of an explosion to give it more visual finesse by darkening smokes and brightening up the flames. Sometimes CG will add an explosion or make a scene colors pop out. Fury Road usage of CG is smart as it only uses it to add to a larger piece of the film instead of it taking over for an entire scene.Set design is also detailed with a rough-hewn general look for the clothings. Getting across a clear picture of this dystopia fascination with worshiping cars like a religion. There is no normal looking car in the film as you have muscle cars on top of tanks, vintage cars on top of oil rigs and things that look like killer porcupines with wheels underneath them. There's a lot to admired from the vehicles including the manic arsonist guitarist surrounded by a wall of amplifiers. The guitarist is also a key feature of the soundtrack, with Junkie XL using the chaotic music to stamp a mark of citizenship upon the particular tribes across the journey, mixing in suspenseful, looming soundbites to show the ever-nearing distance between threats.The acting I can't complain about, but that's mostly because the cast provide a lot more conviction in their portrayals than the script does in providing details. Tom Hardy hardly speaks in the film with most of his performance relegated to simply grunting and facial expressions. Despite the limitation in his performance Tom Hardy sells the image of a broken, desperate man. Everything his character is feeling is received by the viewer properly. Charlize Theron plays Furiousa a cool looking character with a no-nonsense attitude. Playing a complex character whose composure hides a lot of her inner turmoil. Having to display a rough surface while at the same time a character whose holding onto what little hope for a better life there is left. Her chemistry with Hardy is excellent displaying the changes in their relationship through the film going from strangers, to enemies, to partners convincingly.Nicholas Hoult plays Nux a character heavy on a visual arc. He has the most easily definable character traits utilizing them in his portrayal of Nux. A character that enthusiastically goes into blindly following a belief of the antagonist to a more down to earth person contemplating a new view for life. His changes are among the most evident in the film benefiting from a character whose entire journey unlike the other two characters is seen to the finish line. Hugh Keays-Byrne is a appropriate looking "Obviously Evil Bad Guy" type of antagonist. His costume leaves little imagination for what kind of person he is. Consumed in the role Byrne exudes desire, hatred, and vengeance through his portrayal of the film antagonist. I also must give credit to the casting of largely unknown actor Nathan Jones and playing on his strength by giving him little words to speak and allot to express. This movie was expertly put together needless to say.Mad Max: Fury Road will make you mad and furious for the wrong reasons. It's more of an issue of the shallow writing that excuses itself to be a two hour chase scene. Gazing upon it you'll be in awe at the large scale practical stunt work, and gorgeous cinematography before realizing its product of its time that is only appreciated as such. The biggest drawback to the film is it uncertainty to trust the audience; it's powerful images tell its story majestically, but due to the spoon fed dialogue the reward that comes with figuring out what occurred in the story yourself diminishes the impact when it does it for two hours. It's technical achievement on all fronts, but if the spoon fed dialogue was virtually removed than it would have also obtained a storytelling achievement to go along with its wild world.	1
dcfbbaab-fb78-46e2-88e0-99af02652232	  Easily the largest scale Mad Max movie of them all. Let's get one thing straight before I start nitpicking: This is a must-see action movie. This is probably the best action movie that has come out since the 80s when it movies had this kind of ultra violence and carnage. From the minute the movie starts it is going at full speed and it never lets up.So with that out of the way, let's get to nitpicking!First, there is just so much action that it all kind of blends together. That sounds kind of strange, but it is just constant mayhem and destruction that thinking back on the movie I have a hard time picking out one key moment where I can say to someone "Remember when...". This doesn't mean the script is out of control or that there is too much going on to comprehend, it just means that there was so much good that nothing really stood out as great.Tom Hardy is fine in the main role, but at times it felt more like he was doing his Mel Gibson impersonation as opposed to making Max his own. He does a fine job, but nothing tremendous.Many probably wonder how this compares to The Road Warrior (the often considered best of the franchise). Personally, I think The Road Warrior was a better movie. I just found it more memorable with moments and characters that are unforgettable. Plus, the action (while nowhere near the level of Fury Road) was built up to as opposed to just a constant. I can see why someone would like Fury Road more, but I think The Road Warrior accomplished more as one of the all-time great b-movies than Fury Road accomplishes as a big budget Hollywood film.The movie just has so much going on and it's a lot of fun, and there could be no dialogue at all and you would still have a great time watching this movie. It is highly recommended and you need to watch it if you haven't already.	2
1a99ffc0-0b3b-4a5c-b803-56a4fc91f08d	  Justs WOW! I expected a lot and received more. Adrenalin through 120 minutes without any break. The visuals are just stunning. I forgot to miss the plot being busy watching :-P	2
f5462e26-ef6f-4757-a1bc-dbd37959ae0c	  Good action, boring story, bad pacing, good acting.A movie this well liked by almost everyone was sure to disappoint me, and it did. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. The acting was fine, and the action was great. It was the pacing that bothered me and the CG. The story was shoehorned in and it took the backseat like it was supposed to so, no real complaints there. I never really cared for any of the characters or their plights, the use of flashback to humanize Max didn't do that at all and rarely made any sense. It became cartoonish at points, and the other characters were underdeveloped to care about their motivation or plight. The acting was there and there wasn't a bad performance out of anyone.The graphics when not practical, but CG looked terrible and extremely CG. There is an establishing shot of the base in the beginning and it looks like a paper cutout diorama you made in middleschool, it looked like a comic book since there was a thick outline around the people in the foreground, it was weird. Most of the CG was bad, there wasn't enough textures at times, so it had that weird plastic look to it. The pacing was the worst offender in the film. I get that it's an epic car chase, but there were scenes that took too long and didn't really feel like it fit or did anything to further the story. There's this "night" scene (which is clearly a blue filter over the lens of the camera, it's that bad) that nothing seems to happen, I get that they're trying to strength the bond between the two leads, but it felt out of place and annoyed me. Then the whole movie is about running away from the problem (which is totally fine) to go to this "Eden", that takes a great chunk of the movie to get there, but SPOILERS, there's something wrong, "Eden" is dead, so they have to go back to where they came. So the first part of the movie takes 1.5hrs to get to eden and 30mins to go through now an army of cars and ruthless killers (that weren't there going out, but on their tail) to get back to the starting point. "Eden" should have been the middle point, the "blue" scene should have been cut a lot shorter (develop that relationship with action, not exposition, since nothing gets resolved there, since they tell each other their history, kind of, which we the audience already know) and more time should have been given to the fight to go back to the start. There were more problems going to "Eden" (don't remember what it was called in the film), then there was going through a fleet of murderous men and their vehicles. That doesn't make sense. It's a good film, that would have been made better if Miller kept it as a mindless action film and didn't try to make it just above that. The story/pacing and CG were the biggest retarding factors in this film with a very basic and somewhat cliche premise. Ironically, Max is the most useless and unnecessary character in the film, to the point where I think he was a hinderance. His character trope is so cliched it's annoying. Guy with a troubled past that closes himself off to the world, yet it affects him enough to retard progress in the real world. He was overly melodramatic and it got annoying.	1
948d5e8a-c34c-4740-97a5-56ab21018ce9	  Cinematic masterpiece. This movie comes as a breath of fresh air in 2015. George Millers knocks it out of the park. Charlize Theron stole the show as Furiosa. Highly recommended	2
54153f57-38bf-4035-b77d-ceb724ee10d8	  I actually like this one better than the 3rd one...Sorry, Mel Gibson. Beyond Thunder-dome, sucked. This one brought the chase scenes back and all the chaos and mayhem of the road rage. Charlize with one arm was a very surprising move. Overall, it was a good flick...	2
1784f50d-2223-4e3d-bae0-7fe25951d19d	  The best action movie ever made, period. Tom Hardy acquits well, Theron is amazing, and it is absolutely non stop action. It's what I think of when I think of a Mad Max movie. Love the series, but this is easily the best, which is tough to say as it is being that The Road Warrior is so revolutionary on its own. Will never get tired of watching this, not sure how they could top it.	2

1827f4f1-a687-4f95-a323-8fabfa01ca06	  Campy and like a cartoon. Max in this movie has no substance. Huge budgets, models and wild costumes contribute nothing. The story is flat and goes in circles. A waste.	0
88a27564-1644-4d44-b310-2e16c476ff1d	  The acting and storyline, whilst interesting, take a back seat to a two hour non-stop, adrenaline-fueled thrill ride	2

ca2a3005-85d6-47ab-8aa2-81bb87bd1285	  Ah, yeah. What happens when Hollywood goes ape shit with an Aussie classic, throwing a butt load of money at the screen? This. This is what happens. Mad Max Fury Road. If you like car crashes, explosions and more CGI than action, plot or character development , this is the movie for you. Tom Hardy as Max sucks balls. Big ones. Hard. Charlize Theron as Furiosa spends the entire movie with a single facial expression - scowling up and to the left. It's a movie that spends 2 hours going no where - both literally and figuratively. Whereas Daniel Craig breathed new life into James Bond bringing out a dark and sinister side - almost an anti-hero - to a film classic Tom Hardy neuters Max and takes character development no where. He says about three words (does he have an inability to remember scripts or was the scriptwriter just lazy??). If they had put Mel Gibson back in the role he wouldn't even have had to act - just pay him in Jack Daniels, throw him the keys and follow him around with a steady cam. Job done and twice as interesting without the CGI bullshit. A bollocks of a film and crucification of a classic.	0
ed5ed004-9150-4fd2-bf8c-fa48941127d8	  This movie really was awful. Yeah, it had action, but that's it. Barely any dialogue (and the little there was was mediocre... ha! mediocre...), zero character development.Just a bunch of screwed up dudes driving screwed up vehicles, with a couple of girls tossed in so the whole movie wasn't just screwed up dudes.Another movie in what is sure to be a long line of crappy movies, since Hollywood can no longer make decent films.	0

e11a45e4-141f-4397-b73f-abf4ebcf3dd3	  2015 has so far been not only a bad year for films, but also a soul crushing one as scores of mediocre and bad films were praised and financially rewarded. So is this the end of great blockbusters which are attentively detailed, aesthetically unique, packed with good character arcs emanating strong messages?Not if 70 year old George Miller has anything to say about it! Fury Road will go down in history as an instant classic. Viewing of it must be mandatory for any aspiring filmmaker or artist in general. George has managed to boil the action genre down to its purest essence which is to show clarity and fluidity of motion. Ironically by doing so, he has also elevated the genre into a higher form of art! Tom Hardy is the definition of screen presence, flanked by the equally if not more captivating Charlize Theron. If scores and scores of bad films is the condition for having a gem like this once in a while, then I'll have to be Mad not to take it.	2
18ab9e7a-c5b4-439e-9396-894092c04bf3	  Couldn't give it a five star as I missed Mel Gibson. But Charlize makes a great action star.	2

3942f2aa-9cca-4865-b69b-c71be77cfe99	  Someone hired this for me and accidentally got the DVD rather than Bluray. This was fitting because its just like a mindless 2 hour action scene from 10 years ago, (I thought we all agreed this concept sucks!?) Basically a cheesy death metal band chase an anonymous man and or woman possibly other women too, from one side of the desert to the other. People roll vehicles, use RPG's, hop in/out of moving vehicles and eventually much to the audiences relief it all comes to an end at some point. The ironic thing is this film probably has a higher rating than the originals. And if you think there is going to be some of that magic apocalyptic Ozploitation theme from its predecessors think again. A solid action grind for people who enjoy that sort of thing, not much else. Someone in Hollywood should start selling movie 'kits' complete with video game, so you can regurgitate any old classic you want. MEDIOCRE	1

7ba482d4-952e-404d-b08a-ff894bb4f253	  They all say this movie is a masterpice, but I didn't like it at all. It made no sense to me. Ugly post apocalyptic freaky guys, Charlize Theron trying to be bad ass, Mad Max barely speaking, freaky guitar player that rides us to war. Like what? I felt I was on acids or something while watching this movie.	0
07926349-dbc3-4179-b595-b8932855a077	  Story and acting was all on par for another Mad Max installment. However I found the use of CGI in lieu of actual explosions and landscapes to be very tiresome. I was unable to tell if there were actual stunts being performed or whether they were all fake.	1

cff0048b-b6a0-46a2-a5be-d7f94b753661	  Its' powerful creativity in fighting violently, painfully with cringing knives, blood, explosions, metal next to flesh and horrifyingly shocking appearances of painted/disfigured/disabled/bruised characters everywhere on giant highly originally-designed cars across the screen has redefined Hollywood's potential up to where it makes Avengers and Guardians of Galaxy seem like amateurs.	2
5a07a00f-9ac3-4f24-abd5-06c776075a46	  My personal favourite of the Mad Max films, due to excellent performances from Hardy and Theron. Hopefully will get the recognition it deserves come awards season.	2
d365a7a9-2d2c-49c5-aa1b-0e207a6d8ff0	  Much of the movie was set in the desert land so not very pleasing or interesting to watch the scenery. The characters and interactions themselves made up for the lack of scenery though. The story line was easy to follow but not easily predict. A good movie overall.	2
05ab1645-b4fd-4038-ac9f-55fe77895aab	  Excellent movie. Has some of the best effects and fight scenes ever. Lots of action, suspense and drama. Highly recommend. But very violent.	2
c4bbb494-f220-478c-a839-cba15ed123e8	  The entire movie is literally based on a group of people driving around in a souped up semi-trailer blowing stuff up. You may enjoy this if you don't mind a two hour car chase in the desert, but that's really all the movie has to offer.	0
647f8e4f-841a-4baa-9ecf-1ba4163a0ab8	  This movie was just a perpetual train wreck. It just starts in the middle of a story that has no real plot. People drive off into nowhere for no real reason. People drive all the way back because they finally say 'oh hey, water would be a good thing'. The only high points of this whole snore-fest is some mediocre action scenes and some hot women. But the main douche character doesn't even bother to get a congratulatory kiss. I struggled to just finish this movie, hoping and holding out that there would be some sanctification brought from watching this film. No.	0
2b24b465-8096-4f94-8c14-1b8c887d093f	  I was looking forward to this, I bought the Blu Ray too. I will make this short.

88380583-a2ea-4ebb-b1a4-9be21a64743e	  If felt like an endless video of Slipknot. The plot is very simple: Baddies chase goodies from point A to B then the plot gives way to experience it all over again from point B to point A. 12 year olds are gonna love this movie. Yeah, I would say this is a kids's film.Kudos to the strong female action hero and the cool fighter grandmas.	0

01c6497a-a7d6-45c0-885a-8e7a378c573e	  MAD MAX: FURY ROAD was okay -- not near the movie I was expecting and hoping to see. Hell, there are NO LINES for the major actors. The only actor who gets any sort of "character" development is Nicholas Hoult who plays War Boy "Nux". Everyone else just fights everyone else. I'm now glad I didn't see it in the theatre.	1
aa8f5c48-e015-4809-8da4-fb157ebdb8a2	  I'm a big fan of the original movies. I'm also a fan of the actors in this movie, but I don't get the accolades for the movie. The dialogue was weak and Mad Max was almost a non-character in the movie. I really expected more.	0
22b41c7c-2c63-4743-9d06-e326ccaa7c6a	  This was quite possibly the worse movie ever made. People actually got up and left during them movie. I stayed only hoping that it would get better. It sucked. It was horrible. If you watch it and you have half a brain, you will soon realize that you just wasted 2 hours of your life.

a52a734c-54d8-43ae-a750-fb6d7b03e248	  Thrilling, white-knuckle action that gleefully doesn't take itself 100% seriously - the backstory's oil wars leading to a world where battles are fought by large petrol-guzzlers is about as ridiculous as actually having a war truck specifically for a post-apocalypse metal guitarist and his six accompanying drummers just to provide a soundtrack, but it's all here and you can't help but accept it. Theron is formidable and Furiosa is one of the best film action heroes this decade, and it's great to see Hardy taking Max back to the first-Max-film roots. Hoult is also brilliant and almost unrecognisable in a very good way. Great accent work by everyone as well.	2
ae50addb-4d68-4851-944a-7a40f045963e	  gr8 job flipping this tired genre and turning completely on it's head but switching to a female point of view and i said this better the first time i posted this review!!!!!!!!!!!!	2

dad536f4-37d1-4e40-b9b8-1283760e0bd3	  What a grand, insane work of vision is Mad Max: Fury Road. What a bold and visionary exercise has George Miller created. In a world of action movies that are mostly thin soup, this is what you wish for from all of your action movies: something created out of sheer ingenuity and imagination, a movie that gets rolling and doesn't have time to stop; a movie in which the bright and colorful visual palette is so audacious and so fully packed that your eyes can't catch everything that the director is trying to show you the first time around. Half the time you don't understand everything that you're looking at, but you don't really mind. It's so big, so grand, so full that it demands to be seen in a theater. I pity those who hold out for television.What surprises me is that all greatness happens in the midst of a modern practice that I normally despise: The Reboot. Yes, George Miller is rebooting the classic genre that he helped to create, but he's not just slapping a coat of paint on an old fence, he's embracing the new while taking us happily down an old familiar road.Thirty-six years ago, when Miller first conceived of Mad Max, he effectively wrote the book on how to make a movie about the apocalyptic future. His was a world gone mad, a savage and unholy world in which The Bomb had tossed humanity back to its tribal state but only far enough back that it still had trucks and motorcycles to mow each other down with. The participants dressed like professional wrestlers and shot each other at will when they weren't driving spiked vehicles into one another, ready to wage war for a tank of juice. It was unique, it was visionary, and it was such a riotous journey that filmmakers have been chasing his vision ever since.In Mad Max: Fury Road, the McGuffin is a little more potent than just a race for gasoline. The plot here is thin enough that it doesn't bungle the action, but what it boils down to is the soul of humanity. We meet Max (Thomas Hardy) a haunted man suffering with painful bouts of PTSD - he has flashes of memories of people he failed to save. Before we can get a good look at Max, he is captured by The War Boys, a bald and skin-bleached band of cultist working under the thumb of the tyrannical King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a fearsome being where wears plastic armor and a skull mask that is really unsettling - imagine if Sweet Tooth from "Twisted Metal" were a rock star and you've got the idea. His cult is so vast and so audacious that his caravan travels the wastelands of Australia with it's own war drums and guitar solo. No kidding, there's a guy in this army whose function is to play guitar while strapped to truck specially designed for that purpose!What follows along a pattern of Miller's four Mad Max movies is that in each movie, the world appears to be getting worse. In the first Mad Max, the world was devastated but still resembled one that we recognized. In Fury Road, the remnants of humanity have returned to their feral state, still able to drive cars and have religious rites, but closer in common sense to apes then to man.In the midst of this chaos, one of Joe's warriors, the one-armed Furiosa (Charleze Theron), goes rogue and steals one of Joe's War Rigs. What the rig is carrying is more than just gasoline and weapons. I won't spoil it, except to say that Mad Max: Fury Road isn't all boys with toys. As the movie moves into its second half, it really becomes a story of tough women fighting for their own survival.They exist amid a world in which every this is always moving. George Miller doesn't want you to catch your breath. He allows you two or three slow beats, but for most of it's running time, this is a movie that is always on the move. Essentially, it's a chase pictures, but there are so many crazy images filling the screen at all times that you have to see it twice to catch them all. Even better is that fact that his action scenes make sense. The chase scenes have an orientation so that we don't just feel that we're watching a lot of nonsensical editing.His palette is refreshing in that it's bright and colorful, forcing you to realize how many movies these days are grim and dark and hard to see (look at the trailers for Dawn of Justice and The Fantastic Four and you'll see what I mean). But Mad Max takes place mostly in broad daylight under blazing sun. We see everything, and there are bright colors, definitive colors. Every vehicle, every costume, every location and every character has their own texture and their own look.What a crazy ride this is! What a unique visionary is George Miller. He is a man who can create something as violent and bloodsoaked as Mad Max and then pull the reigns back for something as sweet and beatific as Babe. What he proves with Mad Max is that there are original worlds to be created in the movies. It is still possible to make a great action picture that moves and pops and sings and excites us. He had a plan and he executed it beautifully. Just like his trucks, he kept his eye on the road, and he didn't stop for anything.	2

c118be91-355d-4f75-9f34-3835100dcebf	  Amazing film, with the right amount of action and emotion. It's not your typical dystopian film based off of a cliche teenage novel. A fresh take on a post apocalyptic world. Theorn and Hardy worked so well together to create the perfect platonic bond. There is no forced romance, which is something that induces eye rolls when it is oddly placed in a film for "effect". Definitely one of my top ten favorite films. A definite winner.	2
40fa622d-3abd-467a-a5c5-789119c1d7c4	  This movie is precisely what a Mad Max film ought to be and a worthy successor to the franchise. You expect wild characters and outlandish vehicles in an explosive race across the desert and it delivers.What's even more impressive is the amount of back story and plot that is laid out at the start just by showing the way the people live. It's a barbaric survival-focused existence, but it tells everything you need to know.Dramatic visuals and intricately created vehicles lend a rich background to the movie and Charlize Theron's prosthetic is perfectly executed. Great work here. It's brutal and violent and dirty and covered in grease and sweat. There's fire and drums and fights on top of speeding trucks. If that's what you're looking for, you will not be disappointed.	2
2e732ce2-6640-4967-ac42-8e1360d03730	  omg. One of the worst movies I've ever sat through. No Plot. No character relationship. Not even a tie to the old Mad Max movies. Terrible. Just terrible. Don't watch it. Pathetic attempt at entertainment.	0

06155133-5cd4-4ce1-8763-5588dd0f1de7	  What a spectacle. From the first frame to the last, the movie is relentless in providing outworldly surprises. Gruesome yet gorgeous. Gory and still glorious. Warriors on fast bikes that are grannies. War armies led by a rock guitarist. Acrobats on bending long poles as the ultimate weapon in the fast car chase. Mystifying and mythical. As contrasting in every scene as in the main story where Maddeningly macho Max is second fiddle in all the bravado to the far better Furiosa.	2
06bbb5bc-21e1-4dd7-93e8-8c17e7d49329	  The best movie of the summer. Non-stop action,great practical effects and outstanding performance by Charlize Theron. Hard to believe it's been made by 70 years old director.	2
8d72085f-cda4-4660-8915-0322af22e69c	  Good movie, but not as memorable as the original. But George Miller is smart and is getting positive publicity by getting a well-known feminist to give her stamp of approval. Of course shared with the world so everyone knows... Anyway, I appreciate the practical effects, but the little bit of CGI that was used was VERY jarring because they were pretty poorly done and stuck out like a sore thumb from the practical effects they did... That and the fact that it was basically just a car chase movie, are the only complaints about it. Otherwise good movie. Charlize Theron definitely outshined the character the movie was named after.	1

2f9b59d7-db8f-4b33-8b6f-7b5e129d18ca	  I really enjoyed this movie. A fun, crazy, weird, wild ride just as I had hoped. I think the character Mad Max could have used a few moments where he does the extremely cool & wow maneuver, seems like everyone has more of those moments than him. I liked that the women(wives) that were being rescued weren't just damsels in distress, but that they got down and dirty and helped. Really cool movie.	2

09f1057c-0bb2-4852-8d6d-e088a6566aae	  Entertaining but overrated.Set in a post-apocalyptic future, an evil ruler, Immortal Joe, keeps his subjects under tight rule. Then one of his most trusted lieutenants, Imperator Furiosa, sets out to escape his regime, taking with her all his wives. Along the way she meets Max Rockatansky...Directed by George Miller, who directed the original Mel Gibson-starring Mad Max in 1979, plus both its sequels, Mad Max: Fury Road is two hours of non-stop action. The plot is rather basic, and there's very little substance to it, but the action is frenetic and constant. However, while this makes it entertaining, it does feel monotonous after a while. There's only so far you can go with an "all style, no substance" approach.Ultimately reasonably interesting, but vastly overrated.	2

6aebe81e-95e4-4e1b-bc87-e85267964329	  Spectacular! This may be one of the best sci-fi action adventure films I've seen in some time. It has a great cast, amazing production design and make-up effects and a great story line that's very well directed by George Miller. Even if you haven't seen the other Mad Max films, you can follow along with this one just fine. It's great high energy, high octane entertainment.	2
369c155e-091f-4e41-88e0-266868fa80f2	  Excellent nonstop, heavy, and fast paced action, but pretty much lacking in all other areas. Basically a group of people drive away from danger while being chased and then realize that they can now be safer back where they drove away from, so they turn around. A circle chase that is very entertaining, but will not make you think at all; it might actually make you dumber. A top notch action movie nonetheless.	2

c3fbce59-2773-4af1-aef6-25a7cc1a67ae	  Mad Max: Fury Road is an explosive action-adventure that has character and terrific emotional and visual storytelling. The production design is excellent, the cinematography excellent, and the cast does very well. The action is a clear staple with some impressive special effects and stunt choreography. Is it perfect? Probably not, but I also don't believe in perfection. I can pick at things here and there like a lot of movies, and while I'll let time tell what the legacy of this film will be, I'll safely say this is a bright spot that proves that great films can still come out of the big movie machine in this day and age, and need not any original ideas either. Fury Road is a very simple post-apocalypse adventure that is light on story, but excels because of great aesthetic filmmaking and retaining a character to it that sets the film apart from the overload of bland, similar big budget products that dominate a lot of theatres. Fury Road will certainly grab everyone's attention and wake us up to what movies can strive to be... it already has.	2

f23972e2-6900-4d38-9164-800343ab391b	  Is there any way for the reviewers of this movie to re-watch it and then review it again? I'm guessing after a second viewing, they will see how bad this movie is. The "dialogue" is the worst I've ever witnessed in a major production. The story; sorry, there is no story. And when will the studios realize Tom Hardy has no charisma?? Would have preferred to have Charlize Theron's character be Max instead; maybe changer her name to Maxine. Then towards the end, when he thinks Theron's character might not make it, Hardy finally says, "Max, my name is Max." Who cares at that point?? Wow, I still can't believe how bad this movie was and how it's getting such positive reviews.	0

2a48ae69-a688-4ae3-a230-ed3876705103	  Some loved it. Some hated it. I draw my opinion right down the middle. Some elements such as the attention to detail across wonderful panoramas are great. Most of the characters make efforts to make the unusual landscape believable but the main antagonist and a few others draw the the viewer away from a sense of realism into most of a comic book chase caper.	1
07dd1adc-923c-45bf-817c-bce0dd94a8f7	  A very entertaining, edge of your seat, thrill ride of a movie. In this one, it's not Max who is the hero, but the character played by Charlize Theron. I missed it at the theaters, my loss, but the DVD arrived last week from Amazon and I watched it over Labor Day. A very well done movie.	2

d7eefb6f-24a3-48cc-a9b8-47e8888f1a2f	  Saw it in theatre a few weeks ago. When I heard that another Mad Max film was being made (prior to seeing any trailers, or previews) I was disgusted at the concept that there was no way that current day hollywood level production companies could possibly produce anything but garbage regarding this film. I was wrong, dead wrong. This film is a fantastic experience, that deserves to live as long and well remembered as any of the films before it do, in my opinion. Nicholas Hoult played a real character, I was glad to see him come out of his "pretty boy" shell, in my opinion. I hope to see more from him...now that I have seen this film, lol. Honestly, I loved upwards of 90% of this film. There were a few not so well paced scenes, but other than that, it was a well polished, beautifully shot, and masterfully created piece, by my reckoning.	2
cdfd1b1b-de3a-4792-ba36-4dd6657ac0cc	  The visuals and action are top notch, but the story just wasn't there. Even the old Mad Max films had more character development than this. It's worth watching, but I doubt you'll ever want/need to watch it again.	0
90cf7b9b-cab5-4321-8156-fc64c35d9bb2	  Just to say it, I've never been a big "Mad Max" fan. I enjoy the movies for what they are, but I'm not a cult fan. I DID really get a kick out the action sequences in this film. Definitely a fun, seriously action-packed movie.	2

c3b8e984-acb0-4a8a-807a-c8fed76a3e77	  It's visuals are speechless inducing and straight-on eyegasmic. It's production design is stellar, and it's narrative (while subtle) shines thanks to some excellent acting (with Charlize Theron's Furiosa stealing the show). Every aspect of the film excels, helping George Miller's intense, sadistic and intense 2 hour long chase through the Wasteland earn a place as one of the most stunning action movies of the century. What a Lovely Film indeed.	2
e54e5860-5dff-4651-a5b1-3655925ed329	  Classic George Miller directing with a solid story and well sussed out characters, but it really should have been called Furiosa: Fury Road.	2
cf014e2d-854b-4539-bd8d-376c65866bb2	  An artistic and stylized action movie. Perhaps it is more appropriate to say that this a violent love-poem dedicated to the entire action-film genre. This movie had seriously awesome cinematography and seriously awesome action choreography. The story was simple, but yet enjoyable. Tom Hardy played his brooding macho character with a lot of subtly. Charlize Theron, on the other hand, played her unforgettable character with bold heroic strength and beauty. This movie may not be for everyone, but it was definitely good.	2
40d81c83-1127-4428-a7cf-86eb84a8abdd	  Very action packed....would see this movie again. I did think that Theron took the show and Hardy played a very wimpy Road Warrior. Mel Gibson was much better...	2

06aefef7-33ae-485f-8d1a-b6a017299fa4	  This was a movie that literally kept me on the edge of my seat, and I could not have asked for more. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about with this movie, and I must say, it truly did lead up to the hype. Tom Hardy is spectacular, as ever, and Charlize Theron brings to life a character I never would have thought she'd portray so well. Hugh Keays-Byrne portrays a great antagonist, and the supporting cast of Nicholas Hoult as Nux and the other girls definitely bring a spark into the film. Overall, 10/10. :)	2
86e3b9ad-f38f-4cda-976e-784a2b043352	  2 hours of chasing action scenes. Great imaginery, stunt work and scenography but bothers the fact of seeing two long hours of chasing a apparently vulnerabale truck and trying to stop it	0
72a25693-bb62-442c-8e2f-f49238ccade1	  After all the riotous marketing featuring the word "MASTERMIND", George Miller irrefutably proves himself worthy of the title. From start to finish, "Mad Max: Fury Road" is one long chase scene, and the pacing is brilliantly handled. There is no drag, and the story has been woven in a way that both the character development and plot play out fluidly alongside the action, which is a wholly remarkable feat. I hope Michael Bay's seen this picture because Miller pulls off a job that action directors of today NEED to take note of. What of the cast? Well, he's no Mel Gibson but Tom Hardy does pretty well as the titular hero - once again, thrown into a chaotic situation that requires mutual trust for the survival of himself and the innocents around him. Although, his accent still puzzles me... it was some sorta South African, English hybrid that had a tinge of Russian in there every now and then... truly weird stuff but, again, he does well in the role. The real highlight of the film though is Charlize Theron as Imperotar Furiousa. She plays what you could call a "true" powerful female-character. And that's NOT because she kicks ass in the movie or is intimidating to watch or because she stands up to oppressive men... no, it's all those things AND the fact that - underneath all the toughness - she possesses a very human amount of heartbreak and fear. These character "weaknesses" are of course channeled into her strengths, which makes indeed makes her a strong female-character. This is what needs to go into the composition of any "strong" female part. Strong female parts are NOT women who are just another Black Widowish, superheroic ass-kicker that doesn't need a man's help to "get the job done", but they are everything that is embodied in Theron's character. So thank you, George Miller, for getting that right. The guy's 70 and he's STILL taking young Hollywood writers and directors to school.	2
e47cca3d-3b2d-4dbe-9035-5308c9ea8f40	  This movie Brought back to life the story line of Mad Max. my wife and I were thrilled when we watched it in our house on Blu-Ray. they need to make more new mad Max Movies and keep it going for the fans.	2
222b73b4-6b9b-4a6b-ae2f-164f6b3ae592	  Really disappointed in this movie. The plot just jumps around and the entirety of the movie is just one big chase scene. Tom Hardy's dialogue for the entire film could fit on an index card. Charlize Theron's character isn't developed at all and then you're supposed to care about her. The ending left me asking "why?"	1
59b06c36-ab4c-4a5b-9557-43f46776069b	  This movie was so overrated. Watched this with a friend with the sound on the first time and I literally fell asleep.

I'll give it an "A" for grade "A" garbage!	0

Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are great actors but this movie did not showcase their real genuine talent. I do not understand how the director was able to release this film in theatre. As a movie lover I will not watch this movie ever again. Word of advice do yourself a favor do not ever watch this movie. This movie is a waste of time and money. Your welcome.	0
cb75eb5f-5ba7-4812-8e03-7c9c33a285f7	  Don't get mad with me to the max, but I was not enthralled at all with "Mad Max:Fury Road". George Miller's redux of his classic 80's Mad Max franchise was mostly about visual storytelling but there was no true connection with any of the characters, mostly the madman himself Max. If you are not familiar with this franchise, the film takes place in a dystopian future where eccentric characters set the pave to a divided society. Tom Hardy stars as Max, who is about to be killed in some type of mundane "chain to a speeding truck" kind of deal; when circumstances change, he now joins a group of female rebels led by Imperator Furiosa, profoundly played by Charlize Theron; but not to the caliber of Oscar nominated, don't get furioso with me, just my take. Tom Hardy, who is one of my favorite actors, turns out his worst performance of his career; he looked lost and stale throughout the picture. However, I am still in the Tom Tom Club as a Hardy fan; Hardy har har. Nicholas Hoult was sound as the desperate Nux. Director George Miller's direction was way over the top, and not much could be said of his limited screenplay. Hey, but I did not hate it all together. John Seale's brilliant cinematography got my seal of approval. "Mad Max: Fury Road" was a road for me that will be less traveled. *** Average	1

e68a2ee9-0697-43e8-b1d6-eb3298b0373b	  Basic: Mad Max: Fury Road, a part sequel, and a part reboot to the Mad Max trilogy. The story in this film starts off where Max (played by Tom Hardy) is being pursued by a group of War-boys, and very quickly enough, he gets captured. We see Max getting so many hallucinations; we see that the War-boys are taken over his clothes, his stuff, and now his blood.Then, we get another hero in the film, and she's a female action hero named Imperator Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron), who has taken Immortan Joe's (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne) five wives: Toast (played by Zoe Kravitz), The Splendid Angharad (played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Capable (played by Riley Keough), The Dag (played Abbey Lee), and Cheedo the Fragile (played by Courtney Eaton). Joe and his army are now going after her, and retrieve back the five wives. Then, later in the film, Max is team up with Furiosa, and the five wives to get far away from Immortan Joe, and searching for a new home, that has food, and water.What's the deal: Mad Max: Fury Road, what is there that I want to say about the film? I would say, pretty much, everything about it. I remember when I saw the comic-con trailer of Mad Max: Fury Road, I actually thought that looks cool, and I had this feeling like it might be a fun action-packed movie. But when the other trailers to Mad Max: Fury Road came out, this is where I started to feel a little bit down, and getting some mixed feelings about it. Not only because they're not as exhilarating as the comic-con trailer to Mad Max: Fury Road, but it's also because I started to feel like the film might be mixed on how the storytelling may somehow be empty. Suddenly, when the film was about to come out in theaters, or already came out in theaters, this is where I'm hearing so many great reviews about the film, and it literally made me going to the point of where I wanted to see this movie. It actually took me a while for me to see this movie, because there we're some other movies that I was checking out. Then, I remember watching Mad Max: Fury Road on the day, that was right before Jurassic World was about to come out in theaters. From the opening moment, of where we see some of the credits rolling, then we see Max being chase by the War-boys, and being capture by them, this is where I literally going to the edge of my seat. Not only to the opening scene of the film, but the entire movie from start to finish, yes. What happened was we been seeing that almost the entire film is set out in the desert, and then we been getting tons of action and, chase sequences. We see people are getting shot at with bullets and arrows. Cars are getting destroyed by big trucks. War-boys are throwing sticks to people's cars that can actually explode. Then, we also see this one character, whose call himself The Doof Warrior, and he's on top of a big truck, playing his flame throwing guitar, while the truck is driving. That's actually one of the most craziest and memorable moments I've ever seen from a film. Somehow, I just really like the way how this movie cranks itself up. Every single one of these action scenes is absolutely exhilarating, and there is just so much in it. It's like, the director; George Miller was thinking this through, by not only the plot, but also the action sequences. He was trying not to make it too long, but he was trying not to make it too short either. All he was trying to do was keeping everything in balance. It's like he thinks to himself on how that works, and how that doesn't. The action sequences goes on to one thing after another, and while the action is rolling along, and keeping everything fast-paced, we also see that the characters don't at all come across being stiffed, and the film switches to one character to another to see what's going on to them, or what's happening to them. That's what so great about it because you can totally feel the exhilaration coming right at you, when those things are presented in the film. The scenery looks beautiful, and the visuals are over-the-top in such an exciting way. I also notice that the film does run about 2 hours long, and there are some moments in the film that does come off slow, but believe me, I was never at all bored with anything in this movie.The one performance in this movie, that really acts like a real star in there and it's not Tom Hardy-I would admit that Tom Hardy is actually quite good. I've always like him, since the first time I saw in a movie, which that was Inception. In here, he does seem to be good, when he's in his game, but the one performance, which does so many things in there is Charlize Theron. I do see that she's been getting a few Razzie nominations, all because of that movie she was in last year, A Million Ways to Die in the West, but in here, I really enjoyed watching her, when she's playing this female action hero, Furiosa. I really like her performance as much as I really like Sigourney Weaver in Aliens. Her outfit or the style of her character looks amazing. She's brave, she's fearless, and she does a lot of driving, a lot of shooting, and other things that makes her a reason of why she's like a real star to this. Nicholas Hoult, on the other hand, steals the shows, when he's playing the character, Nux, and I also have this big connection to his character. In fact, I really do have a connection with all these characters in the film, even if I don't know much about them. As for the rest of the supporting cast, they all did a fine job. My full opinion: For all of its exhilarating action, and everything that the film delivers, Mad Max: Fury Road is an amazing, and yet, an insane ride. 9.6/10	2
5bbb5a67-270d-48fd-b90e-8ae721c29241	  At this point, there's probably nothing original I could write about MAD MAX FURY ROAD. Following a long gestation period and an insane level of hype that it most certainly lived up to, this long-awaited sequel/reboot was just the kind of fuel injection that the action blockbuster has been in need of for quite some time. It's a balls-to-the-wall action film that is brimming with subtext in a way that most dramas don't even come close to matching. What George Miller has done is bring cinema back to the basics of the story told through moving images, with dialogue/exposition brought to a minimum. In the absence of a lot of talking, which some will interpret as a lack of story/plot while others will simply be turned off, the characters are developed through their actions, what they wear, what they drive, etc. It's basically a production designer's heaven, as there are no superfluous details. Everything and everyone in this world has a purpose, but you have to be perceptive enough to catch it; it will also take multiple viewings to be able to truly absorb all of the little things because a lot of them pass by so quickly. In response to the ignoranamuses/ignorami(?) who belittle the film for its apparent feminist stance, a careful viewing of the film will put that to rest. Yes, the female characters are strong and have agency, but they are given equal status to the male characters. All you have to do is look at the patriarchal society led by Immortan Joe and the Many Mothers. In both power structures, the absence of the other has led them down a precarious path that is only rectified when they (Max and Furiosa) realize that they have to work together in order to survive. The basic message of the film is redemption is only possible through mutual respect and teamwork. Of course, there's all of the action. Seeing as the film is basically a two-hour chase, there are quite a few set-pieces which only get better as the film progresses. And what makes this even more glorious is that these were accomplished in a largely practical manner (with a couple notable exceptions). And because endless action would wear you out, there are a few brief moments of respite where the philosophical underpinnings of the film are made a little bit clearer. Taken as a whole, MAD MAX FURY ROAD is perhaps one of the most complete action films, and a perfectly good example of what Hitchcock termed "pure cinema" (and was also a term used by Miller in promotion for the film). My only complaint is that some of the dialogue is a little bit silly, and isn't helped by some occasionally stilted delivery. However, that's a minor quibble when considering how fully realized the film is. George Miller has come back with a vengeance and shown the imitators how its done, even besting (in my opinion) the high mark set by his original trilogy. Do yourself a favor and see this for yourself if you haven't already (or again, if you have).	2
e224c8f8-1a25-400c-ae2d-7ffdf6f4b3da	  Violently overrated. Boring as hell. Nihilistic claptrap. Big budget "lads on crazy vehicles" in the desert. Cliches galore. Plus oo, Charlize T. being badass. Shame she didn't have a script to be badass *in*. Craptastic waste of money in my opinion. I've hear better stories out of two ten year olds in a sleepover.	0
9d2acda3-6f57-40a7-9b57-23d8711517f5	  A little long, slow at times, but I was still entertained by it. The electric guitar player on the war vehicle was a nice touch, and I liked the humor of it. Mad Max was refreshing because it didn't have a Free Will, forgiveness, anti-government, anti-tax, anti-Muslim, anti-atheist threads running through it. The oppression of women theme was in step with today's problems.	1
a55cfe52-ff8f-42e4-aa96-a093412885fe	  I can see why some might consider this movie a little overrated especially since character development, story and max himself are little short in the movie BUT this may be ONE OF THE BEST ACTION MOVIES in past decade. There are so many crazy scenes that I will definitely be watching this movie many many times. A definite classic!	2

8a7c68a8-2950-4873-b679-47e728f8a821	  Watching as an on demand rental and it simply is not worth the price even there. No real plot, no real acting. Just a whole lot of things going boom, exploding, catching on fire, getting shot or stab. I suppose from a cinematographically point of view and special effects it could garner some Oscars, but I was basically bored out of my mind and quit half way and then came back to finish as an obligation but still bored.	0

8ea0abfb-83f3-46a6-b852-8bee8c4f3498	  Wanted to love this movie. I loved the old series, the first two more than the third but honestly I just don't see what people like about this movie. I found it to be rather boring, the plot to me kind of sucked. It just seems like the movies critics or people on this site seem to like I normally hate and the ones that do bad on here may not be great but aren't as bad as people make them out to be. This wasn't a horrible movie but I gave it what I gave it because the expectations were high and this was just barely worth the rental.	0
c3231a6a-64a0-470f-ab2f-19df7dbe559a	  For those of use who can understand a story without having it all handed to us, this movie is perfect. Miller doesn't hold our hands or feel the need to explain anything and that is a breath of fresh air in an industry where most directors think they have to give you an hour long back-story if you have a hope of understanding it. Miller throws you into the river and it is up to you to swim. When you come up again you find yourself in a beautifully put together movie that grabs your hand and yanks you by the arm down its path until the final minute. Leaving you with the sense that you have just sat through the greatest two hours in action movie history. And that is what Mad max is, it doesn't pretend to be anything else. It doesn't slap you across the face with politics or social issues and doesn't try to shove the directors ideals down your throat. It is pure action, unadorned and as naked as the wives. If you are looking for Max to deliver some deep monologue about his feelings, you might be disappointed. If you expect him to be Max. He is spot on.	2
a00b14ef-884b-4118-b9a6-6c7a402b9661	  Fun, imaginative movie. But I felt kind of bored near the end. Like I stopped caring a little bit about the endless car chases and who would kill whom. I didn't really like either of the main characters. They both had no personality, and as many people have already pointed out - plot and storytelling takes a backseat to action. I need to see it again, but for now I feel like the movie is overrated.	2
4b65f04b-ef46-46f7-9f9d-73a55bbe385b	  When you see 97% on the tomatoemeter than you're expecting a bit. Every previous Mad Max had at least some sort of plot. Not this one. They are just fleeing from the mean boss in order to save his wives. This one takes place on the road for 99% of the time. Sure it's still fun and interesting but you expect a whole lot more after it was hyped so immensely. The 3D is decent but as for the movie, it's only mediocre. Worth a Blu Ray? Yes. Because it makes a great Demo Disc. But mostly for that reason only.	2

IF YOU DID NOT SEE THE FIRST ONE, THIS IS FUN TO WATCH. IF YOU LIKE A DESERT TRUCK CHASE ON ONE ROAD IT IS ALL ACTION THERE.	1
7c2b346d-b118-4fe6-bd34-2ff7c5379734	  Always being interested in the credibility and complexity of a plot, but Mad Max: Road Fury made everyone see that simple... is sometimes made to be amazing. Though some of the sub-plots seem to be strained, they never lacked integrity and purity from the delivery of the actors. This was definitely Hoult's best performance and introduced him into the world of far more serious and complex characters. The epic music combined with the unbelievable imagery pursued feverishly by the ravenous plot made me wish to stay and live in those moments eternally and for life. An excitement that could only be ensured in a far fetched reality with truly human, truly heroic characters.	2
c76b17c5-209b-4c3d-9e80-ed1cd6ff6380	  One of the top 100 films I've ever seen. No needless romance, nor heavy emphasis on plot, just one big mashup of pure violent entertainment.	2
f13866d8-2c01-4292-958d-229e4d554926	  I always wondered about lone critics who disagreed with the general consensus. Did they not see the same movie the rest of us did? And yet for Mad Max: Fury Road, I find myself going against the grain. This was a good movie, but certainly not a great one. The Road Warrior was a great movie. At the risk of sounding heretic, the first half of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome might have been even better.What those movies had that Fury Road does not were two welcome qualities in an action movie, which are attitude and restraint. In regard to restraint, this movie was almost non-stop action. That sounds good on paper, but it tends to diminish the impact of action scenes as they pile up throughout the film, one after another. It's a bit like Indiana Jones riding off on a horse and stealing a truck from the Nazis. It's one of the best action scenes ever filmed, but part of why it's so great is because it's not 2 hours long. During parts of this film, I felt like I was watching a Cirque De Soleil performance. It was too much, too often. And though the movie had character development, it lacked attitude. As an example from Beyond Thunderdome, there's a scene where Gibson's Max has to relinquish his weapons. As he pulls more and more of them out from every nook and cranny, the collector of weapons has a look on his face that says, "I've seen it all, and even I know this is one bad man". It's an incredible scene that sets the tone for what Max has evolved into since The Road Warrior - and it didn't take 5000 extras to film or require a massive explosion. That's what I mean by "attitude". In Fury Road, Tom Hardy's Max never has a single moment of even that magnitude, much less a Thunderdome-esque scene where all eyes are on him. Instead, we get that for Charlize Theron's character. And while that might please some who are looking for more female heroines, I didn't pay to see "Tomb Raider". I paid to see Mad Max. In The Road Warrior, the villains knew who Max was by the end (though not by name). And the people he saved? They knew him as well, hence the haunting monologue at the end. But in Fury Road, it seems the only one who knew him by the end and was truly impacted by his presence along the way was Furiosa. Which brings up a natural question, "If the grand majority of the characters in the movie don't know or care who Max is by the end, then why should the audience?"	1
90cd1b15-037e-4dfb-851b-ae9ac59630cf	  This film is lost in its own little world, I love this fucking movie.We waited 30 damn years for this sequel, God it was worth it. These films aren't big on story or character development, but I think it's more the idea of the series. You have to get lost in these films like the other characters are. You'll understand why they have do the things they do in this terrible, post-apocalyptic world, and have a good time while you're at it.That being said, Mad Max: Fury Road is just as absurd, bizarre, unique, and... well... mad. Tom Hardy gives a funny and great performance as Max, he's a great addition to the series and a good replacement for Mel Gibson(who had a quick cameo). Charlize Theron is also cool, but I think Nicholas Hoult was far more interesting. He absolutely disappeared under the white makeup and surprised me of how much effort he was putting into this performance. I love seeing George Miller expand on his universe and really show us just how screwy the future could be if society truly would fall apart. The bigger budget makes this movie look and sound amazing, and somehow, it still contains the same feel as the first two Mad Max films("Beyond Thunderdome" kinda got bland).I look forward to future installments. Continue expanding this world, George Miller. Take all my money.	2
545072b2-58ef-4c2b-8e20-6c772b81659d	  Watched this movie on Dish, I did not go to see it in the theater because I was afraid of being disappointed. My disappointment was just delayed, remake turned Mad Max into pussy Max, and the whole thing came across as a victim mentality. I don't think the filmmaker was in touch with the nerve the original Fury Road touched and its a shame, if he would have got it, it could be the new cult movie instead its just a Starship Troopers 2 with no redeeming qualities other than the cute harem of gals.	0

2461fcd6-aff2-4f60-9e67-c3c04f53250b	  Road to NowhereThis movie was absolutely deplorable. Sure no sex or swearing but it paled in comparison to the original Road Warrior and Mad Max. Where was the dog and Gyro Man when you really needed them?The acting, if you can call it acting was limited to 10 word utterances. Hardy was god-awful with his Aussie type accent if you can call it that. In fact the accent changed towards the end of the flick. The only redeeming features where Charlize Theron and some of the action sequences. But while it was loaded with action so much of the film was speeded up to supposedly heighten the action which it did not. The plot was so thin as well. All in all a total waste of time of true Mad Max fans.	0
0be95dea-445d-4681-8276-5d4a941da8ca	  Even worse than the original. No character development. Couldn't care less about the characters. Couldn't understand the dialog for 20 min. of the movie. How this can be called 'Fresh" is beyond me. It's just another noisy shoot 'em up.	0
6460dbf5-cbac-42bf-9249-43486c4e99ad	  This movie was a surprise,a very welcome surprise!I never thought I would like an action movie that much,cause I never felt like an action movie made any sense at the end!But this was fantastic,this was a really amazing movie!I enjoyed every scene,I enjoyed every sequence and I was blown away by the way action and meaning can be combined in a very thought-provoking way.A movie about hope,and a movie that is hope to a cinema that produces films for visual pleasure and no passion at all.Charlize Theron blew me away,she did a fantastic job bringing to life the surviving and more heroic side of women!And of course Tom Hardy,was physically there without even having to talk that much and this is saying a lot!I really do start to respect him a lot as an actor.I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie!	2
2921581c-046b-43d1-91fe-506b94fd0e0b	  I hate starting my reviews straight to the point but I'm saying it, Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action movie I've seen in a long time. George Miller does an excellent job at bringing back the elements on what made The Road Warrior so great and pushes them up to the highest level. This film tells it's story through a visual style instead of hitting us with lines and lines of dialogue, and developing our characters not through exposition but instead through the actions our characters go through. Something that alway stands out to me is how beautiful this film is, there is one certain scene involving a sandstorm where I have to say it is one of the most beautiful moments I've seen in film. I loved Mad Max: Fury Road, the action is spectacular , it works with it's visual storytelling , and is a beautiful symphony of death, destruction and creativity.	2

43f9831a-4709-4496-b64c-5486794ee11d	  One of the best action packed thrillers I've seen in a LONG time. Despite the lack of description and intermittent plot holes, the story was anything but cliche, and the characters were out of this world. They constructed a surreal post apocalyptic future such that the societal structure and the tribal interactions seemed completely plausible which made the lore of the story that much easier to embrace. I'll watch this again and again	2
135deb3a-5f0f-4a7b-b917-44672db925fb	  George Miller ain't playin' no games because - MY GOD - was this a spectacle. I rarely rank something an instant classic, especially on a 5 star scale....well, this one was worth it.This is the very definition of what a Summer Blockbuster is supposed to be. Fight scenes? Check. Special Effects? Boat loads. Thrilling? Oh, hell yeah...I won't say that Tom Hardy makes you forget about Mel Gibson from 30 years ago, but he does a damn good enough job. Charlize Theron was definitely the soul of the film. But you're not watching this for great Oscar Award winning performances. This is just something to see and be completely entertained. It ain't for kids. It ain't for teens. This is just straight up grown folk entertainment.I loved it...#WitnessMe...	2

114dd66c-a8ce-40c3-93c3-34ccdd8cfc6c	  Why I didn't care for the Fury RoadI'm sure most of us have seen Mad Max Fury Road. The movie critics gave it great reviews, rotten tomatoes, and IMDB all show it having approximately a 98% approval rating and now the international film festivals all giving it awards and high accolades.These are all opinions and everyone is entitled to their opinions. There was just something missing when I watched this reintroduction of one of my childhood heroes. That despondent loner who was first on the search for vengeance for his life that was torn apart and then as a he wanders the dessert in a post apocalyptic Australia he finds himself an unlikely hero to people more desperate than himself. He always manages to win the fight against overwhelming odds.When watching the former Mad Max Trilogy I always felt a sense of isolation, and desperation. I felt I emotionally connected and could empathize with how lonely his world could be; His family and friends gone, food, gasoline, and water are so scarce they are priceless and coveted by all.Much of what had built that emotional connection for me in those movies were the cinematography, the sound track/audio work, and the pacing. It wasn't a rip roaring adventure chase scene throughout, it slowed at times and built a sense of suspense and offered time to know and understand key characters.In my opinion I felt at the opening of Fury Road we should have received a more thorough reintroduction to Max. Those of us who know him already, have not seen him in 30 years (certainly some have re-watched the films), others may have no clue who he is, also he has lived for a period of time wandering the post apocalyptic wasteland on his own since the last film. Show me how this has affected him. In the opening of Fury Road we get a brief voice over monologue as introduction and we see Max forced to eat a lizard as a means of sustenance. Then he is almost immediately captured by bandits from the Citadel.Even a brief montage of Max searching for something, fuel, food, civilization, show him on the outskirts of the Citadel contemplating if it is a safe place or hostile, give me a camera shot of a small section of road sand blowing over it as a hint of the world that use to be but is now forever lost, Max shaking an empty canteen thirsting for water, shaking empty gas cans. These small things could easily build an emotional connection to Max and make me feel a need to root for him as I then have a better sense of what it would be like in this desperate situation. Then we find ourselves at the Citadel... Lots of dirty skinny people here, it must be a crappy place to live but better than wandering the dessert alone. I really don't know how bad these people's lives may be but they get really excited when that rare and coveted resource called water is released...Wait is water not such a rare resource or are these people just idiots, because when the water is released they catch about 1 cups worth in their random pots and pans then splash around in what is left on the ground. Is this a utopia of plenty filled with a population of morons?Then their leader Imperator Joe the one who controls the water tells them to not become addicted to the water. Everyone needs water, it's not an addiction it's a necessity Joe. Just bad dialogue...Joe is a God like figure to this community we later find out because he controls the water and it is pumped up from the ground and only he can command it to be released. So obviously this clan is beholden to him. Also there is plenty of water he is just holding back to maintain his hold on the communityHe does have a very ominous mask and costume so I honestly like him as a bad guy figure regardless of some of the less than stirring dialogue he is given.Then we meet Furious. She gets to drive the truck. Why? I don't know. Apparently she has proved herself in this male dominated militaristic society. I appreciate woman in a strong leadership roles but this society clearly doesn't seem to be heavily dominated by women. I would have appreciated Furiosa's character had I some idea of how she managed to become so entrusted that she gets to drive the truck that hauls their most precious resources fuel, water, and breast milk. That's right the Citadel is a lady milk dairy farm. It doesn't specifically say that but it is conveyed through brief shots of women in a milking room. Just a brief glimpse into her past, flashbacks something throughout the movie to show me what she overcame could really help elevate her character and make you cheer for her. Again it's all about creating an emotional empathy for a character for me.So Away she goes with her small contingent of security vehicles on her way to the Bullet Farm and Gas Town, I guess to trade milk for supplies... ROAD TRIP!!We are driving, we are driving, whoa wait what? she went the wrong way...WHY!?! Don't know. Joe's crew is watching, Uh oh she's gone rogue. Why? Uh oh Joe is mad apparently Furiosa stole his lady friends or prized breeders as Joe calls them. You know pet names and all. So cute.Joe sends out the call to chase down Furiosa and get his ladies back. Rally the WAR BOYS!!Now we meet NUX, who I really didn't like in the beginning but now I will say he is the only character in the movie that was dynamic enough to make me care about him. NUX as a war boy has one purpose in life and that is to do as Joe commands and if he does an honorable job and pleases Joe he will enter the gates of Valhalla; which I can only assume is some form of heaven. As the movie progresses NUX goes from only wanting to please Joe to realizing he can do good for others and in doing so he would be more significant in this life than he ever was when he was just a war boy out to please Joe.Additional characters that I believe could have used better development are the Breeders and the Mothers or old ladies, I'm not sure what they were real called because by the time we meet them I was just wishing the movie would end.The breeders are taken to safety by Furiosa, or they were kidnapped by her because she thought they were abused and didn't want to be with Joe. I'm not sure if the Breeders wanted to leave or Furiosa convinced them they should leave because once they are being pursued by Joe they seem to want to return to him. A simple scene showing how these women suffered under Joe's captivity would have made me care much more about these women. Not that I want to see abuse or cruelty to women but an indication that they had suffered would build an emotional connection that you then want to help save them as well.The Breeders are the central component of the movie; we should be made to care if they escape.The old women seriously they just loosely tied a few things together like hey there is no green place turn around and go home. Honestly they could have driven there met no one and formulated a plan to go back.Now the guitar guy...I enjoyed the concept of the guitar guy jamming out as the war party moved along but I wanted him to actually play the music that you hear. Instead he plays a bar and then there is a score that takes over and includes none of his guitar work. I wanted him to be James Hatfield from Metallica melting my face with Fuel for fire...makes sense they need fuel, guitar guy is shooting fire. Also guitar guy is shooting fire but not using it to fight anyone, super wasteful!Here in a post apocalyptic world where fuel is scares and this idiot is just burning it up!!I don't feel a sense of scarce resource or desperation. The Breeders are wasting water when they get one of their miraculous escapes from a horde of fast moving vehicles. All the vehicles are supercharged gas guzzlers, NUX empties about 10 gallons of gas into his car in an attempt to kill himself and blow up the war wagon. Really if I was in charge and someone wasted that much gas there would be no Valhalla for them.I just didn't get the same desperate, these are hard times sense from this movie. I wanted to feel suspense, the whole time you just knew these guys were going to make it and Furiosa and Max would live but you knew NUX was going to be dead before the movie was over. Of course they had their close calls but never did you think "oh man this is the end for them".It was a great bit of Cirque Du Sole style chase scenes pieced together again and again but I really could have done with 45 min less chase scene and 45 min more character development.On top of all of this I'm a car guy and there were a number of ridiculous vehicle related items that were wrong or nearly impossible.Climbing around touching hot exhaust pipes, an 18 wheeler can escape motorcycles and supercharged cars, Nux drives with a flat tire at high speed (Max would have to stay in place for this to be somewhat possible but still incredibly unlikely, spitting a fuel mixture into the supercharger and getting boost, climbing around in an engine compartment fixing the engine while driving down the road and its not just a single engine it's a dual engine setup. This rig would lose so much power after losing 50% of its power it would be crawling along not out running all those other vehicles.Yes, Yes it's just a movie don't nitpick the silly details but really character development could have tied it all together in a Lovely package for me.Okay enough of the why I didn't like it. Honestly I just wanted more of an emotional connection to the characters.Positives There were lots of explosions It was well shot The action scenes were well choreographed Joe's costume was unique-ish (Post apocalyptic Darth Vader) Pro-Breast feeding	0
bd19a036-8b93-475a-ad97-8d3413f07472	  Something I learned the hard way: if you watch this movie without any prior knowledge about the franchise, you're going to be a little lost.

8e588232-26f5-4a47-98a3-9a389cbdf071	  Simply can't get over how much fun this movie is. Shot and directed to perfection, with breath-taking action and a killer score, Mad Max defies almost all tropes of modern Hollywood blockbusters. The film is incredibly smooth, and provides the rare opportunity to just sink in and forget about everything around you, which seems to be lacking from many other films.One thing I noticed and really appreciated is how colorful the movie is. Instead of a dark tone, Miller chose to color the movie with nothing but bright and vibrant shades. Even the night-time scenes are a very vibrant blue.It's quite mind-boggling to think that Miller, a 70-year old man, creating this master-class non-stop action thrill ride. The first twenty minutes are filled with more energy and passion than about any film that's come out this year. The only movie in recent memory that I'd say rivals this one in sheer intensity is Whiplash.	2
14affd2c-568e-4b8c-9b17-95865c5322b0	  I don't usually give into reviews when it comes to my interest for movies, but when a movie gets a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, I have to see it. Now I'm incredibly flustered and trying to figure out how to get my $5 back (ITunes rental). I've watched the Mad Max series before, but when you do a reboot/ sequel, you need at least some kind of introduction to the series. The movie depended on the mystery of each characters past and future, but failed to fulfill the suspense. I'm disappointed in the reviews here. The action was great, but the storyline sucked.	1

Continue expanding this world, George Miller. Take all my money.	2
129eb0ea-1771-4bca-93be-301964dfbe2b	  A flat out action-fest. A two hour car chase, or maybe more accurately tank/car/motocycle/semi/vehiclewithwheels chase. But a great one. Tom Hardy may get top billing, but Charlize Theron feels like the protagonist of the movie with Hardy's Max being a close second. Having never seen the original Mad Max films, I was not sure what to expect, but it played out pretty much how I expected from the trailers and clips I had seen. Take a movie that goes over the top on outrageous costumes, sets and action sequences, and then ramp that up to 11. That should be a pretty good idea of what to expect with this movie. For example, when we first meet the women that Max is trying to help free, they are removing chastity belts that literally have razor sharp teeth on them. There is a post-nuclear fallout mutant that plays a flame-shooting guitar nonstop in front of a giant wall of speakers attached to a war vehicle. Everytime they came up with a concept or idea, I feel like they said "That is great! But can we make it bigger, or crazier."Hardy's Max is a quiet hero, with a touch of insanity that never gets fully explored. Maybe that character trait is being saved for a sequel. I think he says a total of 40 words throughout the film. But it works. Theron is a hardened road warrior (wink wink) that is trying to balance out the horrors that were done to her. She does a great job with this and comes across as a strong determined leader.	2

c6e21605-359e-4bda-803b-7cb4fe2709ff	  Mad Max is a sequel (one could suppose) to the three films of the Mel Gibson era, although it is more of a reinvention of the Mad Max world (or perhaps reimagining is a better word). To this end Miller brings a creative hand that is sheer spectacle on a grand scale. A little digging reveals that this film was reportedly made over a period of 14 years, initially constructed as a single chase sequence. Although the final product provides some ingenious ways of narrowing our focus in on the characters (through colourful imagery and attention to the small details), the thrill of the chase is very much intact. As with the Mad Max motif, the setting is a post apocalyptic world where resources are slim. Max (the man of little words) finds himself enslaved in a majestic desert enclave where, along with the rest of the slaves, finds himself at the feet of a merciless leader who has been hoarding an underground water source for his own purposes. The film's plot, which is refreshingly simple against this backdrop, moves forward when (as a character suggests at one point) the people start to push back. This push back comes in the person of Furiousa (Theron), who creates a plan to free the wives who have been taken by the merciless leader for their ability to repopulate the new earth with perfect human offspring. Here the world of Furiousa and Max intersect. There is much to be said about the details themselves. It feels like every aspect has been meticulously handled with not just intentional oversight, but intimate and personal motivation. The cars themselves become each become a character, and you almost feel a hint of sadness when they meet their demise. They are a fusion of time periods and eras, an effort to sentimentalize a time that is long past perhaps. Some of the vehicles emerge with some familiarity (the spiked menaces and the long fuel truck), while others elicit some surprises in ingenuity (the acrobatic sequences with the long extending poles come to mind). The colour red is used for striking contrast in the desert setting, symbolizing the fine line between life and death (illuminating an epic sand storm as well). The colours merge with the characters themselves (the white attire of the retreating women also providing a striking contrast), with the underlying emotion and subtle sexual tensions that arise (which are wonderfully and tastefully explored with a degree of subtle modesty) colouring the movement of the film itself. At the heart of the film is the question of hope, which comes as both an idea and a character. The question that looms is one that Max assumes at one point in the film, suggesting that one needs to be careful about the idea of hope, for when hope fails your world fails with it. The idea of hope also becomes a question of the chase and the journey, a question of choices and direction. The film's concluding sequences, which I won't reveal here, becomes an intriguing commentary on these ideas, taking the layers off of the question of what happens when hope fails. The character of Nux (Hoult) is perhaps the most intriguing, especially in a discussion of the film's heart and soul. As we move from the spectacle to the chase, and from the chase to the person, Nux, a man who knows only one form of life (blood and war) gets swept into this journey of hope. His transformation reaches outwards to the nomadic purposes of Max (whose sole purpose is to survive) and to the community minded mission of Furiousa. Nux becomes a picture of the possibilities that hope can provide in such an immersive and merciless apocalyptic setting. Life is about more than living and dying. He becomes an embodiment of redemption, of new life, even for as crippled and hopeless as his body and circumstance appear to be. Set against such an epic back drop (which includes a massive vehicle to transport a blazing electric guitar and a riser of drums.), this idea becomes somewhat monumental. Mad Max is a reinvention that brings the series to a whole other level. It is spectacle and it is commentary. It is post apocalyptic and it is wonderfully retro. It moves with fury but it demands attention to detail. It is what a summer film should be.	2

20a281f4-16d4-4fa8-a6ec-639a8e67ec18	  This is an awesome film, original and radical , not showing Charlize Theron as a diva but rather a warrior, it has intense and bloody scenes and crude scenarios that immerse you into the movie and keep you entertained from start to finish.	2
ba631a60-d9dd-4b5e-bdf0-4f8308e398c7	  It is quite a good film, although not much happens in it, it's basically one long car chase sequence. Bit overated and not sure why it's even called Mad Max when Chalize Theron is the main character of the story and Max is simply along for the ride. So many Aussies cast in this film too that an American accent sounds a bit out of place.	1
864bb661-e5c0-49c5-8d84-6e5d0f25da87	  With minimal dialog and a simplistic plot the movie can be dismissed but with fantastic performances a great sense of pacing and some of the best live action sequences ever put to screen this movie is a visually arresting experience that never lets up and is easily highly recommended	2

265e43f8-f2ec-4c09-ad90-2035962d4496	  If you're into intense action and adventure, "Mad Max: Fury Road," is the movie for you. See it on the biggest screen in your house, and then crank up the Dolby-Surround Sound! To quote Charlize Theron, see calls her character one "Bad-Ass Bitch." I couldn't agree more as she disproves the old adage that women are the weaker sex. After two hours of this non-stop action, you will need either C.P.R. or two days at the beach. If you're a big fan of "Mad Max," spend the extra bucks on the five-disc "Mad Max Anthology A great Christmas gift.	2

52647914-d1ff-40b0-9c32-5a6da68ec824	  Mad Max: Fury Road is a milestone in the genre of action. It is exactly what i wanted from a Mad Max film, an action opera that is fun, exhilarating and suprisingly emotional at times. Mad Max also succeeds to create strong female characters which is rare in action films these days. Mad Max is a perfect film in my opinion and obviously deserves my perfect grade.	2
c04afa7e-863d-4dad-adf4-ccd2b200037f	  Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are excellent in this very original remake! One of the bets films I've seen this year...	2
923536ec-0ce4-444f-8dc1-0ca88fb985df	  Must admit that thanks to the original Mad Max (yes people, this is a remake...a new way to put it on cinema but is the same thing from the 70's); anyway, I admit once more that thanks to this story, classic video games like Twisted Metal & Borderlands came to existence (n other words, got born). Yeah, Borderlands has more story/dialogue if you think of it over Mad Max (Mad is more action than dialogue...something I don't like very much on movies since I love more to think than to sleep). Honestly, this movie works coz it's visually stunning and if you have played those games, you will love it even more OR if you grew up watching the original...nostalgia must be the correct choice. So yes, I recommend this film only for those reasons. The music score is not that bad neither the make up but editing has it's flaws (to much speed on scenes that could work with the correct slow-neutral touch?). Enjoy. - August 29, 2015 review (kinda late).	2
06b2db9a-b3d6-4082-9f01-befa3f6d2bf0	  It is amazing how a film can be gripping even when the story is not known. We do not know where they 've come from, we do not know where they are going. All I know is I cannot stop watching. It is a 2 hour long big awesome car chase filled with bombs, catapults, bullets. and lets not forget that crazy guy with the guitar.If you compare it with the Mel Gibson Mad Max, you will find a major difference. It is in English! we can actually understand what words they are saying. That does not make the sentences any more of nonsense but still a major improvement.	2

78c31978-0fc0-43c6-bb56-63bfc27aa032	  As it stands right now, Fury Road is the best movie of 2015, and the best action film in at least 15 years. It's equal parts "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Terminator 2". It succeeds on every level, and you haven't seen anything quite like it.	2
bb2e283d-5240-4490-a9d5-2ca08132ece1	  Phenomenal. Beats the original trilogy easily.Charlize Theron gives an oscar worthy performance.	2
d68fbeb4-b0ef-42f3-b0f1-c34f968f9c5c	  Hugely enjoyable film in my opinion that is fast paced, looks incredible and boasts a flame throwing double necked guitar. Admittedly it doesn't have a complex plot, it won't change the way you live your life or make you question yourself in a spiritual way but this is very much in keeping the previous Mad Max films. Just like in Mad Max 2 and 3 the world is in a post-apocalyptic state of anarchy. Human beings struggle for basic things like food, water and clothes it seems but do possess some damn funky automobiles and other associated gizmos that would make the average petrolhead very excited indeed. Very early on Max and his iconic car with the spinney turbo thing coming out of the bonnet gets captured by a group of Chelsea football hooligans. Nothing very mad about Max here as puts up about as much of a fight as you would expect if Michael Jackson wrestled Mr T, lame. To summarise some people decide to pop out for some groceries in a huge truck and since the desert lacks road signs they subsequently get lost. A scouting party is sent to find then and direct them to the nearest Kwikimart but they find that a group of young, under nourished girls have stowed away on the truck. Their Dad\Uncle\Boyfriend (he is all of these at once) is very upset about this, puts on his Darth Vader costume and goes to find them himself. Then a big chase happens followed by a very brief lull, then another big chase with some explosions and just in case you felt that there wasn't enough chases there are some more and that's about it.Tom Hardy basically just grunts a lot but fortunately not in an incoherent Bane type way. But ill allow this as Max is supposed to be mean and moody and this he does successfully. But let's face it, this is really Charlize Therons film. She does her best pseudo Robocop\Annie Lennox impression and drives a truck. Everyone else's role is just to look good and this is achieved in the main. You would think that a 2 hour chase would wear thin very quickly (Terminator 3 anyone?) but Fury Road manages to avoid this. Maybe it's because it's so well choreographed and just looks so damn great in a Neil Armstrong magnificent desolation kind of way. I would also pay big money for some the more popular music acts around these days to employ the use of the flame throwing guitar live on set. This would obviously mean the donning of a flameproof suit anywhere near the vicinity but the upside is that we wouldn't be able to hear the Beibers and One Directions of this world. Win.	2

366d0d30-483f-41ea-80ca-dc0f194c96b1	  The awesome weirdness of this world and great use of practical effects make this one a definite watch at the cinemas. Immortan Joe and his strange children make for unique villains in a movie that's plot pretty much boils down to an extended car chase due to someone taking something from the bad guy. The main criticism from myself and the mates I went to see it with was that it does become a little repetitive as the movie goes on.	2
c3925db4-ba07-47f0-92d3-1de3eacb0890	  NOW THATS HOW YOU DO IT! Oh my god! Not only do I think Mad Max: Fury Road is the best film in the franchise, but I believe it's one of the greatest action movies ever made. George Miller, the man behind all the other films, not only brings the franchise back to life but it steps everything up. The visuals are amazing, the action is top notch and it has shown us that the mastermind himself has still got it! If people think this movie is overrated, I can see where their coming from. Fury Road, for some people, does seem to just be a two-hour action sequence. However I did find a lot more to this movie than that. One of the things about the Mad Max movies is that they were not very dialogue-driven but rather told mainly through visual storytelling, and that continues here. Plus there is a story told through this two hour sequence and the action and chases actually play an important part. It's a road action-escort mission film, so the action plays a major part in the story, which is why having it focus a lot on the action and thrills doesn't really bother me so much.	2
8cac789c-0ff4-4bf9-a6b7-3edb495231c0	  After a surprise premier at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Mad Max: Fury Road is poised to melt audience's faces off this weekend. Supposedly picking up things where the 1985 film Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome left off, George Miller's new installment in the franchise sees the titular character (this time played by Tom Hardy) facing off against more carnage, blood, guns, cars, and chaos. Max has just pissed off a local warlord/cult leader named Immortan Joe, and he is out for revenge. His escape through the Australian outback sees him cross paths with Furiosa, a dangerous and unpredictable rogue leader with her own agenda. The two form a makeshift team of sorts, and the pair must to to rely on each other in order to outwit Immortan Joe's ever growing pursuit.Essentially, this all boils down to one hell of a chase movie, filled to the brim with hyper-masculinized batshit crazy antics. Miller directs the action sequences flawlessly with a kinetic, constantly-moving energy, which adds a mesmerizing layer of visceral appeal to the whole thing. Fury Road is pure spectacle and looks great - even in 3D, where objects fly in and out of the frame without feeling too gimmicky or distracting. The level and precision of detail that went into this film is almost as crazy as the stunts; various tattoos, weapons, clothing, vehicles, makeup, etc. are all incredibly well-crafted and give the film a unique feel of time and place. Oscar nom for Best Production Design anyone?Despite the film's desire to be constantly churning on a violent machismo overdrive, Fury Road feels perplexingly feminist at times. Charlize Theron's portrayal of Furiosa easily makes her the coolest character in the film, and her determination to be both wickedly badass but still sensitive when needed overshadows Hardy's quiet and one-dimensional performance as Max. And then there is a scene where an all-women militia take out a human trafficking gang. Girl power for the win.Fury Road, like many other films of its genre, suffers a bit from lack of characterization, dialogue, and undervalued performances. The most we ever hear from Max is during the opening voice-over, where he sprawls on giving the necessary exposition to explain that this is a post-apocalyptic film where survival is valued and ethics and law are not. I wish we could have seen more of an explanation for his backstory, or more interactions with him and Furiosa - just something more to show that Max is indeed a person and not some lifeless prop.Despite it's few setbacks, Fury Road keeps the narrative tight and compelling, which compliments the unstoppable fluidity of the action. It's a rich and immersive film, sure to impress those who can stomach it's brutality, and a rare treat to see something so adrenaline-packed without compromising on story.Leaving me feeling like a child at the amusement park, Fury Road no doubt sets the bar high for what a summer action flick can and should aspire to.	2
14aa2858-7cc3-45c7-8057-145f2f7a6a32	  This movie is perfect. It has so much more than tons of fantastic action. There are actual character arcs! No shaky cam! Practical stunts and effects! The only people who say this movie is short on plot are the same people who have problems paying attention in movies. Or, perhaps, they are used to amateurish backstory-dialog-dumps that have unfortunately become the norm. Characters only say things to each other that actually make sense, not like in Christopher Nolan movies where they bizarrely tell each other things they already know for the benefit of the viewer which they must know is there because otherwise there is no reason for them to be saying what they are saying. You need to get absorbed in the movie and PAY FUCKING ATTENTION YOU STUPID TWATS! All the plot is there, all the exquisite detail of the world is there, just get absorbed in the movie and look at it from the point of view of a person dropped in the world. There are enough dialog cues to tell you everything you need to know, but apparently everyone wants their dialog the same way Mac from Sunny wants it. I can't even comprehend anyone not liking this movie, it is perfect.	2
44b9141c-5ec1-4fae-8108-7fc83c8e64ab	  George Miller is a visionary; this film careens about bursting with Miller's signature voice and characterized by the visceral cloud of post-apocalyptic hysteria that makes it impossible and contemptuous to draw comparisons. It's truly in its own league.	2
85eab6ee-f877-4a89-b808-2930cc0b2fa9	  I saw this movie. Charlize Theron is a wonderful actress. She does a great job in this movie but I still do not understand why people like this movie. I love weird and strange but this movie is strangely weird. I wasn't impressed.	0

efafbc06-696b-4d6c-8c2b-29dd8bec7d3c	  Tom Hardy steps aside in what is clearly Charlize Theron�s momentum. And boy, does she deliver!! There is a reason for all the hype, indeed: Fury Road is a non-stop roller coaster ride, which consists of 3 major action scenes scattered in 2 relentless hours of film. However, I don�t believe this movie deserves ALL the hype it�s been getting: its ending feels rushed, and so does Immortan Joe�s demise: it seems as random as any of the thousands of thugs' - or warboys, if you may - deaths we witness during the film. I believe this movie should be remembered for what it clearly serves: brilliantly orchestrated action sequences, together with the strong, memorable character that is Imperator Furiosa.	2
222b6d23-f30e-45b4-9f61-5b07834c6247	  Mad Max Fury Road is a non stop action thrill ride that barely pauses, and never disappoints. I would feel remiss if I did not mention that if you're a person who dislikes the wacky and weird this is not for you. The characters are all very interesting and well developed, the action sequences are amazing, the pacing is almost non stop, and the villain is almost like a combination between Darth Vader and a possessed Santa Claus. While the film may not be quite as good as Road warrior, it comes very close which is an accomplishment in its own right. In essence Mad Max Fury Road is a great time at the theaters, one that I suggest you see in theaters, because it's such a great experience.	2

61961fec-a585-4332-9537-4009b394e564	  George Miller has crafted the greatest action film of all time. 'Fury Road' is an exhilarating, adrenaline-rushing piece of cinema that never loses focus of its characters amidst the stunning chaos that unfolds before our eyes. The performances are solid, the cinematography is exquisite, the action is breathtaking, and I can't wait to see what Miller comes up with in future installments.	2
ad2e4e6a-74f4-4a34-b266-78d3917c8a1c	  This is an incredible journey, The visual is great, the cast is amazing, the story is good and they all work together in unison with a massive production to create such master-piece... nothing was expected every turn was a surprise and the ending is awesome!!! George Miller as a director did a great job with the action sequence the chase with its dynamic, jumps and explosion that nothing was out of its place, and After this I will trust him to bring a decent Man of Steel :p Tom Hardy is always awesome! though he didn't talk much :) can't wait to see him in Splinter Cell and in 100 Bullets :) Charlize Theron, the real star of this movie just incredible :) I'll give it a 9/10	2
ade6ae7f-b0da-4513-a9f9-bc5f31abb71c	  95% bizarre vehicle chases, crashes and mutilations. 5% scantly clad women. Almost zero plot. Bring your earplugs. I gave it the extra star for impressive CGI.	0
cf302180-85a0-4dee-a01b-829fc4bcdcfe	  Are people just extremely delusional about this movie? Yes, the road carnage was wonderful to watch BUT that's all there was!! No compelling story, minimalist dialogue. In other words, this movie is a visual experience only and yet it rates to the top 15 of all time??? I loved the first two Mad Max movies. The third was so-so.	0

8ddc10e9-f699-4e28-82e3-9668791338a1	  Mad Max: Fury Road is quite impressive; I would go so far as to call it close to a miracle. I almost never see, rather than review, movies in this genre, as its not my thing. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Mad Max was pretty good, and it paid homage to its Gibson-esque prequels. The film works on almost every level: as a comic book movie, as an action flick, as a character study, and much more. Also, it has beautiful cinematography and performances to burn; some of the CGI was almost as good as in the 2009 movie "Avatar", I dare to say. It was a really well done movie overall, that will satisfy almost any viewer, and I highly recommend the experience.	2
36326291-732c-485f-a79d-977b6e771289	  Mad Max Fury gives us a stunning and at the same time blizzard dystopia world along with some crazy action. We have some cool war rigs/vehicles, while the movie is an entertainer, it's weak on the story and characterization. Tom Hardy is no Mel Gibson, the charisma is missing.	1
acfbe267-599e-4acc-b758-d900ca952492	  You wouldn't fall asleep during this movie if you haven't slept for weeks.Easily one of the best action movies of the new millenium and the best Mad Max movie.	2

f78de2b3-191d-41ef-9cd0-634ccba50c0d	  extremely disappointing installment. Non of the actors made me believe in them. I saw them make the journey and I was viewing from a far. If I want to connect to Max's story I am better of dusting off the first three. It is, however, visual entertainment and for that it is great fun for a movie night, but not a worthy successor. I do not understand that the titular character is playing second fiddle to Ms. Theron's character. I almost feels that Mad Max was added to justify the Mad Max elements (post apocalyptic landscape, tribal societies and outrageous vehicle) and to boost box office sales. The script seems to be written not to tell Max's story, he's just along for the ride. The one moment MAx had an opportunity to take central stage and which might have made it a Mad Max film, was cut on the editing floor I assume. It was the nightly action, where Max returns with blood on his face and the viewer does not even get a glimpse of what our boy did. Just Charlize's words "it is not his blood".	0
54b66076-bee5-4117-b4ca-5e4ec3761efa	  This film gets us on LSD and ecstasy together,. The real experience of this movie one can get only in theaters and who got the chance to, can't help the feeling what the f.........Charlize even without one hand is more beautiful then brides, and TomHardy...uuuu Tom Hardy is real Mad Max, he is so real that I can't. Even remember Mel Gibson in this role. Everything is so weird but so connected in one violent disturbing image of post-apocalyptic world that we cannot stop the feeling and wonder what If really one tiny hand of beans could make our day in the future, I certainly did. Great movie for action lovers!	2
fd7855fa-43ed-4f9d-8171-1d5f6ef68ec0	  A bold vision fully realized in its stark color palates, dramatic soundtrack and absurdist costume and prop design. Action sequences can be a bit confused at times and the plot is very straightforward... but you can't argue this film doesn't deliver what it promises.	2

ca0c0bbc-5979-4d02-b964-120db78021b4	  I wanted to like it but it this film was just appalling, in fact it was utter drivel. 98% of the Rotten Tomatoes critics were obviously under the influence if they liked this film. I applaud the other 2%. In fact I'd say this film was exactly the same as the 1995 flop Waterworld except this time they switched from the sea to the desert. Waterworld was actually a far better film compared to this tripe. Anybody who fancies the film I can sum it up in one line "nutters drive from one place kill each other along the way and do the same when they drive back". Virtually no dialogue, no character development....nothing. Crap!!!!	0
406cf56c-fb79-4a36-8fee-a3a4f2b2bc98	  The definitive art of making kick ass concept art a reality, and doing it in style. Can't believe some people would insult this by watching screen copies, Go watch the 1080p or go home.	2

64551e95-b31b-48a7-a403-d5331b0afd60	  It's an ok movie. Not sure why it has a 98 %, maybe nostalgia factor took over there. It's a bit odd. The entire movie is kind of an extended chase scene.	2
9b80bf71-1882-44b6-8565-7787107d00da	  I saw it and compared to the originals I was very disappointed,It had good action scenes and great special effects. However there were many plot holes and the plot in general was pretty terrible. I was very disappointed by this movie especially after all of the praise it got.	0
38d9c31e-40a9-4e5c-b0d1-ef2579552ba4	  i really enjoyed this far more than I imagined as I am not always keen on remakes but this is superb!!!! The action an filming is stunning and beautiful despite the storyline and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of the cut and shut job ( pardon the parody) of the ending. It was too short, jumped from scene to scene making no real sense and lacked the conviction of the rest of the film a real shame but definitely worth a watch	2
eb829171-7289-4ed8-8e86-3d9debf33325	  Bone chilling music, adrenaline rush, heavy action and a simple plot makes the 4th entry in the series the best of all.	2

7e8874ef-a0e8-4f07-aebd-4b7ff240fe54	  What makes Mad Max Fury Road so great, is that it sticks to the basics. It puts its emphasis on great action and great performances. The plot and the villain may be a little dry at times but its hard to care when you are having this much fun.	2
973da137-601d-47a1-8b3b-256dc517bf14	  This movie is the most dumb and idiotic movie I've ever seen. It is created almost entirely out of car rides, with minimal and incredibly cheesy emotion and plot. The acting is terrible and the screenplay is even worse.	0
8e521bd9-aa48-4f56-a868-86b2d9bde676	  The movie can be simplified to a car chase. Simple and yet perfect in any way.	2
955e99ae-56fd-4a56-96dc-22adc62890ce	  With the blend of practical and CGI effects, beautiful cinematography and jaw dropping action, Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best movies of 2015.	2
0d8272ca-c16b-4e47-9bd0-3aedbfe60c3a	  Best movie of the year by miles (no pun intended). Emotional, thrilling, and amazing to withhold.	2
809b9622-e438-4274-9a4a-669c5c6f8b80	  30 years after the release of 'Thunderdome' Mad Max is finally back. The lone wolf, the single warrior, the loner, the lone soldier, the outcast, the outsider, the man with no name...errr...named Max. The hype has been stratospheric for this one, I have gone into this expecting truly mind blowing things, the greatest action movie ever made? lets see, I will be brutally honest in every aspect.So the bottom line, this is virtually based around one sequence from 'Mad Max 2' and made into an entire movie. We all know which sequence, the one with that bloody great gas tanker covered in gun turrets and spikes. That sequence was epic on so many levels, a truly award winning vision of distopian science fiction...where all the goodies get killed, awesome. Now, in this tale Max has been captured by the War boys who are all led by Immortan Joe. Your standard gang of barbaric lunatics, only this time not kitted out in S&M gear, no this time they are all painted up in a tribal sort of way. Long story short, Max has gotta reluctantly help out Charlize Theron's character of Furiosa (with the help of Nicholas Hoult's ill War Boy character, Nux) in saving some damsels in distress from Joe whilst trying to reach some fabled lush green lands. This of course equals a whole load of vehicle chases across the outback which basically never stop.The first sequence we see is Max's classic and gorgeous black pursuit special (the now famous 1973 Ford XB Falcon GT) getting trashed, wait what??!! I heard about this before hand and I have to say I don't like it one bit, I wanted to see that fucking car in action once again, damn it Miller! Not quite sure how Max's super fast special manages to get wiped out by the collection of clown cars chasing him but never mind, it bloody happened didn't it, ugh!So one of the first things we see as the real story kicks in is Immortan Joe's citadel which appears to built into a fecking massive cliff. How the hell did they manage to do that? there's like some sprawling catacombs in this rock by the looks of it, I wouldn't of thought anyone had any time in between killing each other and building ridiculous killer automobiles. This is actually one aspect that didn't sit well with me, this whole idea felt way too grand and over the top for a Mad Max movie, it looked like something from the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy...only with cars instead of orcs. Then if I really wanted to be picky I would ask how everyone is so muscular in this dead post-apocalyptic world, meh don't question it. Its here we start to see the strange freakish array of characters that inhabit this new Earth, gotta say I loved what I saw here for the most part. Miller has always been good at creating these bizarre characters for this franchise and he nails it again here.Most of the bad guys are just big rippling baldies covered in white paint for some reason (the War Boys), not much background given but they look intimidating for sure. Other citadel dwellers and bad guys come in various shapes and sizes such as the creepy looking Corpus Colossus, a physically disabled child of Joe with exceptional intelligence (a real person with a real disability). Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones), a huge muscular mammoth of a man, dim-witted and another son of Joe. The Bullet Farmer who is some ugly aging bloke in a suit of bullets and...is a farmer?, hence is name. The People Eater is a big fat bald guy (everyone is bald in the distopian future) who I guess eats people? Again hence is name and the reason he's so fat, he also looks to have lost his nose because he wears some kind of metal plate there. The Doof Warrior who is some crazy blind bloke that rides a war rig (the Doof Wagon) into battle strapped to some huge speakers and playing a fire spouting guitar. This guy seems to have become the new Boba Fett of the movie world but he doesn't actually do anything, in fact I fail to see the point of him or the drummers other than simply to look cool. Admittedly he does look cool, certainly unique with his mothers face for a mask (oh yes), but basically pointless.Lastly we have Immortan Joe who is easily the most effective looking character I've seen in years. His mask appears to be some kind of breathing apparatus that is attached to some kind of bellows around his neck. The mask is slightly reminiscent of an old WWII pilots oxygen mask but with a terrifying line of big teeth like a skeleton. Not too sure about his ending though, was his mask like...attached to has face and skull? He also seems to wear some kind of transparent body armour with medals and whatnot attached, obviously he suffers from some kind of affliction or disease. Visually this guy looks fucking amazing, the makeup really tops it off with his pale ghostly complexion and silver balding, widows peak hair line. All in all the selection of characters gave off a very 'Dune-esque' (1984) vibe in my opinion.The action is virtually constant here, its the trademark of the movie (and franchise), non-stop. The main bulk of the action centres around Max and co trying to escape on the tanker under a barrage of gunfire and explosions. Now yeah, we've seen this before in 'Mad Max 2' but this has been ramped up to maximum overdrive, its insane! There are vehicles being torn up and flipped all over, metal mechanical shrapnel shattering all over the desert, bodies are flying everywhere, War Boys are leaping around on pole vault type things hurling explosives, gunfire, stabbings, fisticuffs...all happening on and off various extreme vehicle creations. It all looks completely real (because all the stunts were real), its highly impressive and shows great achievement in both eruptive action and practical effects. On top of that the location work, scenery shots, panoramas and the crisp, bold colour palette really look nothing short of gorgeous, it almost looks too good for this type of movie. Gives you faith in movies again it really does.That's not to say the action saves it completely, in my view. Amongst all this grade A action you do have to wonder how Max, Joe and others manage to survive some of the horrific fender benders they get into. The good guys battle their way away from the citadel, all that way, only to come back again and do it all again? wut?! The canyon sequence stuck out as a very daft cheesy notion. This biker gang that hides out there, living in and around the canyon walls, which they ride about on...with motorbikes? bit risky isn't it. Also, where did they all get their matching costumes? When the good guys come back through the canyon, do they go a different way? didn't it get blocked off. And it does all seem nuts that all this happens purely because Joe wants his girls back. He unleashes his entire armada and risks everything just for some ass? can't you find more girls in your citadel? Oh and in the end the citadel bad guys just let Max and co into their city and take over? huh? he just killed your leader.The greatest action flick ever? hmmm not too sure about that, its certainly up there but I still find myself preferring the gritty cult classic 'Mad Max 2' with Gibson. I think Hardy does a reasonable job but he is no Mad Max if you ask me. One thing I hated actually was the deliberate lack of dialog from Max, it worked well in the older films (MM2) simply because there was less to explain, 'MM2' was like a bloody 80's videogame it was so straight forward. Here there are things that could use background information plus the amount of times Max gets into a situation (mainly at the start) where I really wanted him to just speak! say something!! Explain your situation to Furiosa then she might not try to kill you...ugh! I found that actually frustrating and it didn't need to be like that.Still, the fact that the goodies went back on themselves towards the end really made me groan frankly. Its like Miller didn't know how to end it so he just made them go back and run the same gauntlet all over again, easy option for more of the same. I won't lie and say I didn't like it, but I won't lie and say I thought it was a stunning movie, the action is monumental at first but after the initial hardcore, automobile, carnage sequence, things felt a little tamer. The initial visual shock and awe that hit my eyeballs, making them swell, started to ease off. So awe-inspiring visuals all round and some great characters...visually at least. Is this a good flick? yes, yes is it, its a very engaging solid action movie, buts lets not get too carried away. Its really a one trick pony if you're honest about it, big gas tanker with goodies fights off hordes of baddies, rinse, wash and repeat until credits. The only real difference is its Furiosa's story, and to a degree, Nux too, unfortunately Max is just along for the ride in his 30 year old reboot.	2

5fe9dd67-fdc8-48fa-827e-83862644fcd3	  Inside Out is the typical Pixar formula of laughs, heart, adventure, and dazzling visuals, though not as memorable as The Incredibles or Up.	2
8ea2128a-b56f-4394-aee4-335d97abc95a	  After a series of middling disappointments, Pixar returns to glory with the animative "Inside Out". Loaded with imagination, color and crackling with emotion, "Inside Out" is quite magical.The story of the going-ons inside a young girl's head prove to be an amazing device on how to convey that all emotions are important in achieving true fulfillment in life. While at the surface it looks like a children's tale, "Inside Out" strikes that perfect Pixar balance of fun for both adults and kids.The voice performances are superb with Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith as standouts. Colorful and delightful - one of Pixar's best offerings in years.	2
8b0b5fc9-e602-49cf-bcd5-dcc935ea384a	  Pixar returns to form with the delightful 'Inside Out'. Following 11 year old Riley and her emotions (Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness) this film explores the psychology of a child in a unique and gratifying way, with simple yet effective messages that will warm the heart of any child or adult. For me the message was quite beautiful that a memory doesn't have one emotion attached to it- it has a plethora of emotions, showcasing how unique and complex we are as individuals. It also tells us that we are allowed to feel joyful or sad etc, and that we shouldn't feel bad for feeling anything that we do because it is human to feel. Without spoiling anything there are a few scenes in the movie that may leave you with a tear in your eye. Pixar effectively gives emotions feelings in this brilliant animated movie.4.5/5	2
d35054c5-7f9c-427d-a2ff-fd5734edf5ec	  Inside Out shows us how each member of a family works through five emotions. That sound simple, but the movie is quite engrossing, and as we are brand new grandparents, it felt very relevant.	2
1194d0c6-d9f1-4fa0-a1d9-5df07a7e8374	  When I first saw the pics for this movie I thought it was about little living emojis/emoticons, it does look like that doesn't it? Nope, instead its actually about little living creatures inside your head that represent emotions. When I say living creatures I'm not so sure that's even correct, they are more like representations of the mind or emotions, each one a little physical embodiment of each emotion. Its not an overly original concept lets be totally honest, I know I've seen this type of thing before in cartoons many times, and in pretty similar fashion, but again lets be honest, there's only a few ways you can do this.So the plot revolves around a little girl as she is born, and at the same time her little emotions are born within her head (I assume). We follow little Riley as she grows up with her parents and experiences all of life's wonder and beauty, but of course, all of the little negative bits too. At the same time we see everything from inside little Riley's head from the perspective of her emotions and how they each deal with individual situations. Naturally each emotion deals with different things such as sadness, anger, joy etc...they each specialise in their emotion of course. Alas, many years later aged 11, one day goes tits up when Riley attends her first day at school and loses control, she begins to cry because she is home sick, this causes a permanent negative memory which Joy (the happy emotion) tries to get rid of. In a series of bizarre accidents Joy and Sadness get ejected from the control room (the brain) and end up lose within Riley's head. Without Joy in Riley's mind (and life) keeping control, the duo now have to get back into Riley's brain/mind before she becomes depressed forever, seemingly.Right so the emotions, a generic bunch truth be told, Anger, Joy, Sadness, Disgust and Fear. Anger is a little red fellow that isn't a million miles away from a satanic looking creation, he also emits fire when in a rage. He is probably the second best emotion going for obvious reason really, one of the funniest emotions. Joy is the main protagonist and is a happy-go-lucky shiny female character that is rather vomit inducing. Sadness is probably the best emotion if you ask me, he looks kinda plain yet random in design, but his permanent, nervous, hyper paranoid persona is clearly the main laugh out loud machine. Disgust is easily the weakest of the bunch with not much to do or say frankly. She is modelled on young teenage valley girls which is a good notion, but highly annoying (check her glittery appearance). Lastly we have Sadness who is a stereotypically short, plump, glasses wearing female character that kinda reminds you of the nerdy high school girl, the librarians assistant type. She mopes around being all glum and useless, again, kinda annoying and makes you wonder why no one ever kills her.Overall the emotions are a reasonably fun little group but nothing overly hilarious, personally I found the other background characters much more interesting. The best of these has to be Bing Bong who was Riley's old childhood imaginary friend, but long forgotten. This guy is a combination of Riley's favourite things from that young age, his body is made of candy floss and various animal parts...plus he cries candy. His sidekick is an old child's tow wagon with rocket boosters that fire a rainbow coloured discharge, this was Riley's old toy back in the day which she would play and imagine could fly like a space rocket. This guy gives us some of the best laughs throughout the main adventure through Riley's mind, but he also gives us some of the most emotional. I don't think I can deny that I almost cried when he meets his end. Hands up who's with me here...yeah, I thought so. The various other colourful, bizarre, weird and wonderful little mind creatures we meet along the way are all really well designed and voiced acted, like I said, overall I think the majority were actually more engaging than the main characters. I really didn't like the designs for the main emotions, they just seemed way too simplistic and generic.I also have to say I didn't like or understand the other emotional representatives in other peoples minds, they didn't really make sense. Hear me out, Riley's mind emotions don't look anything like her, they are just visual representations of the emotion. Now when we go to Riley's dad (who has a tash), his mind emotions also have little moustaches, Riley's mum has emotions that look like her with the glasses and hair. Then in the end credits we see more mind emotions for other people, all of them look like the people they inhabit. One guy who works as a clown even has mind emotions that look like clowns, eh?? why would his mind emotions look like clowns when that's just his day job? So I guess the question is, why does Riley have random looking emotions when everyone else has emotions that look like them? Yeah I know this is a kids flick and I'm [b]really[/b] looking too far into this, but things like that kinda bug me cause it doesn't really add up. The animal ones really seemed far fetched as the emotions just run wild inside the animals head, so I guess that would work? who knows.The visuals are of course stunning, really slick, but did you expect anything less? really? I'm not trying to take anything away from the visuals but these days its really no big deal anymore is it, if a movie looks less than stunning then its something to talk about. I did like the imagination on display though, some really great ideas fleshed out, not all great, I would have done some things differently, but still good. I really liked the abyss of lost memories or memory dump, nice touch. The individual floating personality islands were neat, like family island or friendship island, that house memories of those certain aspects in Riley's life. I liked how they fell apart when affected by Riley's emotional state being rocked badly. I also liked the train of thought which was of course...a train. Overall the ideas and some visuals reminded me of an old animated movie called 'The Phantom Tollbooth', which also delved into such things as individual human traits being fleshed out, alongside things like words and numbers.Its a strong emotional ride that's for sure, no puns intended. The kids will love the visuals and the wacky characters, whilst the adults will enjoy the trip down memory lane for the...errmm, the childhood memory aspect of it all. I'm sure many people will be able to relate to what's going on, first day of school and crying, snow days, moving etc...its all there, the full gamut of human anguish and joy. The way they have thought out how things like memories, long term memories, forgotten memories, special memories etc...all work is very clever, typically adults make everything into a bureaucratic headache, but it works well. But like I said already I didn't really feel the main emotions, which was a problem, they weren't overly funny but slightly annoying. I mean come on, Sadness creates all the problems, everything is her fault! and she kept on touching everything and fucking it up!! arrgghhh!! Still I can't deny this was an excellent little rollercoaster that had me on the edge of my seat wondering how they would ever save the day.	2
059cc23c-fbab-4d12-85a1-92c3cf9671d7	  One of Pixar's best films, Inside Out is an emotional roller coaster with wonderful characters and a unique premise that lends itself to laughs, heartache, and joy. After several decent, but unspectacular sequels and original films, it is nice to know that Pixar still has their magic. Absolutely top shelf in terms of Pixar's filmography, Inside Out is a must watch for anyone.	2
d95f1561-6828-44a0-a6a8-f0b314eb6949	  'Sadness' gives depth to life. Pun intended.	2
6b012f0b-8633-4c88-883a-0ac33830839b	  So freakin' lovely, as expected from a Disney Pixar joint. We see how children naturally evolve from their compartmentalized basic emotions to composite secondary and tertiary emotions. Even I didn't understand Joy's fanatic tenacity for much of the movie, but the overarching message about how putting a happy face on all the time can take its toll is quite kathartic and accurate. There are some random, goofy tangents throughout the journey, but Bing Bong's sacrifice is so sad and moving.*Mild spoiler: So does that mean children's comprehension of Sadness becomes Reason later on in life?	2
032b5a9a-9b13-40db-b428-6d2f9024a402	  Pixar always hits the mark when combining entertainment, intelligence, inventiveness and a lot of heart, and it is an endless pleasure to see them create a whole fascinating universe with a stunning production design for this exciting journey into the corners of someone's mind.	2
871dad5a-6171-437c-a9b7-b3790c7fc696	  An inventive animation tackling childhood and the move into adulthood but the storyline failed to engage completely with the funny bits being overused in the trailers.	1
a3d24577-4ca4-4c3c-b983-3c0da6a99eba	  Pixar is known to be a master at playing the heart strings with their animated ventures, I think it's exceedingly clever of them to tackle the very core of their films; emotion.Inside Out is boldly creative to say the least, the whole lore/world built up by the story is interesting enough on its own. The adventure on top is just icing on the cake. I'm just somewhat underwhelmed by the lack of exploration with the other three core "emotion" members (anger, fear and disgust) Like Sadness I think they're a lot more interesting as perceptively "negative" emotions. Instead Joy gets an unprecedented amount of focus that I just don't care for.Inside Out is a great "journey" adventure, but a missed opportunity to simplify and explore the complexities of its own cast.	2

e3b1b30c-37a7-4f8f-968c-e677e45f6ff6	  'Inside Out' is all unique inventiveness and good voice acting and wonderful animation and tugging at the heart strings. At this point, we should expect nothing less from Pixar.	2
b9451ac0-3857-41ba-ac4f-32df05146739	  This is a very rare case of a films idea being greater than the movie, but the movie still being pretty good. Pixar really targets the adults in this picture, but includes some funny moments for children and some really clever moments for everyone. Some parts of this movie are complex, probably too much so for its own good because it does get out of hand at some points, but that is better than being too simple. This film may be overshadowed and under appreciated since it came out on the heels of Frozen and The Lego Movie, and while I consider those 2 to be better films, that is not to take away from how enjoyable this one is.	2
ea34e49e-86af-4b3e-9907-92d2415ead47	  Pixar again and this time covering interesting territory, the space between your ears, seen through the eyes of a preteen forced to endure moving to a new city, leaving all that she knows behind. Hardly worthy of a film, you might think, but in the capable hands of Pixar, worthy insight into that indefinable nuance, that which makes us tick. One cool decision is that Fear and Anger, while present, are given diminutive roles compared to Sadness and even Disgust. Overall, at the end of the work, there is that largest of compliments any film can hope to gain: one wishes that it could go on and on.	2
10071df9-52ff-4606-8ae1-9e55d4fef993	  Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen play with emotions in Inside Out.Spanning a somewhat brief 95 minutes, the film's intriguing story concept goes full circle in the head of a little girl. While lacking depth in a few places, the plot details are amusing and insightful, creating a character friendly adventure all around.The visuals never seem to hit it out of the park, although the character designs are colorful and unique allowing for easy recognition throughout the picture.There isn't anything to argue about when it comes to the voice-work; it gets it done all around. Amy Poehler is a delight as Joy with Phyllis Smith pulling off a Sadness.Inside Out may not expand enough from time to time, but ultimately it delivers nicely.	2

148d982d-a0b0-471b-a329-a8d1a01f2f24	  It feels immeasurably satisfying to finally have the Pixar we all fell in love with back and running. There's been a sharp decline in the company's quality since 2010's Toy Story 3. Did we really need a sequel to Cars and a prequel to Monster's Inc.? It started to look like Pixar was steering away from the kind of bold and brilliant storytelling that had earned its audience trust. With Inside Out, Pixar tackles the intricacies not of the secret world of toys, bugs, monsters, or sea life, but of the human brain itself and our embattled emotions, finding new ways to wow us once again and remind us just how magical the right combination of story and storyteller can be. Inside Out is a luminescent piece of filmmaking, brimming with intelligence, imagination, and powerfully moving while also being deeply relatable and entertaining. In looking inward, Pixar has found the path out of their recent rut, and Inside Out is a shining example of their ingenuity. Inside 11-year-old Riley is a complex world. Five primary emotions help oversee her day-to-day functions; they're the caretakers of Riley. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) is the effervescent leader of the bunch, along with Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), and Anger (Lewis Black). These five are entrusted with Riley's well being and her memories. Riley's core memories, the moments that make up who she is, help to form personality islands: honesty, hockey, goofball, and family. Riley and her family have recently moved from Minnesota to San Francisco, and Riley's having a hard time adjusting. Her parents don't know what's happened to the daughter they knew. Sadness seems to be "tainting" Riley's memories, and Joy tries her best to keep Riley happy at all times. Joy and Sadness get accidentally sucked away wrestling over Riley's core memories. They're sent to the outer reaches where the aisles of long-term memories are vast. The two emotions have to work together to get back to headquarters before the remaining emotions convince Riley to run away from home. Even just reading that again, it's easy to see how complicated this movie can be with its world building and internal logic, and yet under the guidance of director Pete Doctor (Up) and his writers, the movie is at no point confusing. Pixar once again does an amazing job of guiding you through a new world and its various parts, all while expanding and complicating this environment while staying true to its internal logic and keeping an audience properly oriented. I can't imagine many screenwriters would be able to tell this story while still being as clearly understood. The simplicity of the story, the ease to follow along, the natural development and connection of the storylines and characters coming together, is the greatest credit one can offer. It's ostensibly a buddy adventure film like many Pixar tales, as the unlikely team of Joy and Sadness having to find their way back to headquarters and learning important life lessons along the way. It's also a smart way to explore the various other elements at work in Riley's brain. It's not just an interesting descent but each new station further opens up Riley as a character. Her subconscious (and fear of clowns), her dream theater projections, her working abstract concepts, all tie back together in satisfying ways. Though the greatest side character is unquestionably Riley's former imaginary friend, Bing Bong (voiced by Richard Kind). He's wandering around her memories, and at first you have your suspicions, but then you realize, like the other characters, that he just wants what's best for Riley. Coming to terms with the fact that Riley has moved on, and his time, while cherished, is now left behind, is a complete character arc, and that's for a comic side character. Oh, and if you're like me, Bing Bong's conclusion just wrecked your tear ducts. You know you've watched an impactful film when even thinking back on moments starts the process of tears welling in your eyes. It's somewhat strange to think about characters as ephemeral as emotions and imaginary friends and the like, but they really work on two levels: the emotions themselves are exaggerated figures with distinct points of view but they also better inform the whole of Riley. There's a depth there that gets even more impressive the more you analyze the creative process. What's also impressive is the vial message of the movie, which is that growing up is hard and that being sad is okay. Seriously, the journey of Joy is to accept that being sad isn't necessarily an emotion to minimize but a vital part of being human and an essential process. Much of the conflict that drives Riley is her avoidance of being sad, her postponement of accepting her real feelings and accepting that San Francisco is not going to be like her old home. It's also a realization that to be a fully functioning person, you have to own the sadness in life. When Riley eventually unburdens herself of all her troubles and fears, and the tears flow, that's when the healing can begin, and that's when her parents swarm in for the group hug, and even now my eyes are starting to water. Damn you, Pixar. Don't be mistaken by my words thus far, Inside Out is also a wonderfully funny and inventive comedy. The sense of discovery with the movie is alive and well, and each new revelation of Riley's inner mind adds to the fun. The jokes are consistently paced. The vocal cast is expertly chosen and each emotion gets some good jokes. There's a terrific running gag about a catchy jingle that the memory workers just enjoy kicking back and forth for their own impish amusement. The film dives into other minds other than Riley's, including both parents trying to communicate during a family dinner meant to soothe their daughter. It doesn't lean too heavily on tired gender stereotypes when it comes to the differing thought processes of men and women, which is a relief. During the end credits, we zoom into the mind of a schoolteacher, a bus driver, and a dog and a cat, and it's an enjoyable way to leave the theater and gather yourself emotionally. The greatest comic asset is Joy, particularly as voiced by Poehler. As fans of TV's Parks and Recreation can attest, Poehler can make insufferable optimism endearing, tap toeing around what should be annoying and instead finding stronger comic rhythms. If you're looking for the closest thing to an antagonist, it's Joy who got the whole mess started and yet we don't ever really side against her. Part of that is because she's not doing what she does as some weird power play but because she wants what, she thinks, is best for Riley. The other part is because Poehler is such a skilled vocal performer. If I had to find some point to quibble, the world isn't as beautifully realized in a visual sense as other Pixar classics. I think this was a deliberate decision to ground what is such an unusual environment into something a little more familiar and less flashy. I also don't think that Disgust seems as well articulated as a necessary emotion. She's well played by Kaling but her application seems lacking in comparison to the other four main emotions. It's remarkable that the summer is still young and already we have two instant classics in theaters; first Mad Max: Fury Road and now Pixar's Inside Out. I'm still riding high from my screening, but I'd feel safe to call this a top-three Pixar film. I wouldn't even begrudge those who cite it as their best. Far more than a big screen version of the 90s comedy Herman's Head (anybody remember this one?), this is an exceptional animated film that will appeal to all ages but, I suspect, hit adults even harder than their little ones. It's a wonderfully poignant film about the struggles of growing up, of holding onto your past definitions of yourself, of accepting the full barrage of emotions, including the necessity of sadness. It's relatable in many aspects and this further compounds its power. It's dazzling with its creativity, it left me cackling with laughter (a superb Chinatown reference almost had me fall out of my chair), and it left me weeping at various points. Inside Out is a return to form. This is the Pixar we remember.Nate's Grade: A	2
0d67c724-6414-41c9-8306-70113f24bc55	  While the trailers didn't manage (or maybe didn't even try, because they left me entirely indifferent) to grasp the entire concept of the latest Pixar adventure, the movie needs mere seconds to sell the audience on its premise: Emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust) are working hard in their headquarters inside our heads. Dreams are made in a film studio nearby. Imagination is a wild amusement park. Our character traits and interests are like islands that have to be maintained. The train of thought runs through it all. Our memories are marbles in the color of the emotion we connect with them.This concept is as simple as it is brilliant and beautifully solved here. The design of this entire world is absolutely gorgeous and makes perfect sense in the film's own logic. It wouldn't be Pixar if they didn't manage to create an exciting and deeply moving adventure around this concept.A smart, heart-warming and funny film that may be a little too weird and abstract for the youngest kids. But adults may even get even more from this in exchange. Lovely!	2

7d8632b8-fd77-4b5b-8031-b44f3b9f0849	  I've always been bit fan of Pixar films. I grew up with Andy in Toy Story (literally we graduated the same year) and there have been some fantastic movies in the interim, but none quite like Inside Out. On an emotional level this movie hits a home run. Whether you are a kid or an adult this movie really hits home on the human experience, namely our emotions and what we are actually feeling and what makes us ourselves. Not that it's an hour and a half of constant crying or anything; it is also a funny movie, really funny. I think this is impart to the wonderful voice casting. As far as the story line goes it is pretty classic problem, climax, solution, but it's classic because it works. It's well written and keeps moving without rushing. On a different note, I wish I had some background in psychology because I'm very curious to know exactly how accurate their anthropology is. Don't get me wrong, it seems accurate...but I would have to say that it wasn't clear what the role of free will and intellect played along with the emotions. That being said the main character is only an 11 year old so the emotions will be a much bigger player than an adult (we hope). Nonetheless, it's not a documentary, but an incredibly fun, entertaining, and tear jerking movie. For me it goes down as a classic!	2
bc73d3ea-0816-42ad-a6ad-72d2d4bbdbdd	  This movie was nothing short of incredible. In a year of sequels, remakes and adaptations, this film shines as an amazing original film with a satisfying blend of fun and sad scenes. The sad scenes were very sad and at times overpowered the films lighter scenes. The scenes that weren't sad were lots of fun. I loved seeing the emotions controlling Riley, and the scenes that showed Joy and Sadness traveling through different places in her brain. After viewing it in theaters, I was in awe.	2

6f422b42-1787-4ff2-a131-2c70385fee18	  Inside Out feels like the culmination of Pixar's now 20 year feature animation career. It illustrates quite literally the value of embracing all of one's emotions, especially sadness, to live a fulfilling life. From what I have observed, that seems to be a central message in most of Lasseter and Co.'s stories. I really can't say enough about this film. The casting, acting, art direction, character design, dialogue, pacing, score, EVERYTHING is just dynamite. The final gag sequence is enough to make it a classic alone.	2
0ced528e-8802-4813-a2bf-38cdbaceddd7	  Inside Out is one of Pixar's best movies to date. Inside Out has so much originality and heart to it, that is almost impossible for me to believe that this movie did not get a Best Picture nomination. The animation is gorgeous, the characters are terrific, it's hilarious, and it will make you cry for sure. Arguably the best animated movie of the decade so far.	2

85ef5efd-03e7-44d8-837c-1271782ac685	  I waited... I waited... I waited.. I waited..Almost 2 months of waiting for this movie to come out in Indonesia. In the other side of the world, this movie was already out. I began to lose hope.BUT THEN IT FINALLY CAME OUT!This is the best animation movie of the year. I'm sure it will win an Oscar - if not, two Oscars. The concept of the story and the world-building were very good. So good, you just have to love it only from seeing the trailer. Especially the cast, the entire cast are comedians. They are so great - because comedians make the best from their mouth. The tear-jerking moment was not cheap. When you hear the scoring, oh - how relaxing it was.Pixar gave me an adversary for my expectation mind. They really feed its hunger. The hunger for good movies.The verdict:My only complaint is the time for this movie to come out in Indonesia, other than that, I could tell you, you wouldn't waste your money on something THIS good.	2
e411425f-2923-40fa-908f-aa6c9db0301e	  Well, that was a brave move by Pixar.While, initially, the premise of the film may seem a little like the old Beano cartoon 'The Numskulls', and while the trailer for the film seemed to present it mostly as a comedy (to whit: the family dinner scene), this is far more than it first appears, even going so far as to give it's teenage lead acute depression.That lead is Riley, who is lead by the voices in her head - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness - who help her through everyday life. However, when her family move from the mid-west to San Fransisco Riley suddenly finds her life thrown into disarray, with Joy and Sadness (through a set of circumstances that I'm not going to go into here) find themselves out of 'Headquarters' (the control room from which everything is run) and have to (somehow) find their way back. Along the way, Joy (and the audience) discover that Sadness is just as important an emotion ...	2

This movie is a true testament to Pixar's amazing story-telling... definitely shed a few tears during this movie!	2
b9e13480-8e30-4765-a034-42a0eaa16627	  Disney Pixar's latest classic "Inside Out" stars Joy and Sadness as your main emotions you'll be feeling when watching the film, alongside with Fear in a form of worry in a minor role of your emotions throughout this wonderful, inventive experience.Twenty years ago, Pixar made themselves well-known by creating the first ever computer animated film in the animated genre of film, "Toy Story". From then on, Pixar has shared various wonderful stories in different areas and sizes, but their grandness was constant throughout. Their best originality belongs to "Brave" while their best film belongs to "Toy Story 3". Now it didn't seem that "Toy Story 3" would be dethroned when it has that much heart on growth, while "Brave" however shows a possibility that it might get dethroned sometime eventually, even if it consists a heartwarming side while being a great fantasy flick. But now, those two films have gotten dethroned by Pixar's latest fun masterpiece "Inside Out"."Inside Out" explores an imaginative/creative, thought-provoking concept of our emotions inside of our heads that takes care of us on how we express ourselves and think. The film centers on an 11-year-old girl named Riley, who's going through what any kid would go through: leaving your hometown and old friends behind because one of your parents got a better job at a faraway city. To Riley's parents, she's a happy girl who's a bundle of joy to them. As she adjusts to her new life at a new place while trying to make new friends, as it's a usual routine for a kid to experience, her emotions are there to take care of her.According to the film, there are five basic emotions: joy, sadness, fear, anger and disgust. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) makes sure that Riley's happy, positive, spirited and having fun, and optimistic if possible. Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith) brings the tears and sadness out of Riley's eyes, but she hasn't discover her purpose like the other emotions have their purposes in Riley's life. Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) keeps Riley safe from anything that'll cause harm or would hurt her, physically or mentally (i.e. nightmares). Anger (voiced by Lewis Black) makes sure that Riley's life is fair in a way that she'll be in modes of disapproving and being argumentive or just simply negative without positivity. And finally Disgust (voiced by Mindy Kaling) keeps Riley from anything that'll "poisoned" her physically or mentally, or simply just providing judgement and common sense.The way things work is that the five physical forms of Riley's emotions controls her mind (Joy's the captain in Riley), and whatever actions they make, it becomes a memory orb (and Joy's done most of the memories). Furthermore, whatever memory that builds Riley's personality, it becomes a core memory and creates an island that holds that personality from the memory. That's where the complicating action comes in when Sadness touched one of them, and the Joy-ful memory becomes a sad one. As Joy's trying to fix whiny Sadness's mistake, it leads to a mishap of the core memories on the loose and were sucked to where long-term memories are located, with both Joy and Sadness sucked along as well. While Joy and Sadness are on the reflective, explorative journey back to their headquarters, it was now up to Fear, Anger and Disgust to help Riley, which led into not-so-good consequences sense Joy isn't around to put a smile on Riley's face.It's not really a near-tearjerker sad like the ending of "Toy Story 3" and the duration of Ghibli's latest "When Marnie was There", but it's truly sad. It would genuinely garner tears from different viewers who'll watch this and would shed some tears or one. The emotional level from the perspective Riley's life is like a coming-of-age at a young age adjusting her new life in the city. Also, speaking of coming-of-age, you'll feeling worry for Riley as what she's going through, outside of her and inside of her, during Joy's absence (which is why Fear has the minor role of the "Inside Out" viewing experience).But besides those two emotions, the obvious reason why Joy is the main star of both the film and the experience is enjoying what the film has to offer: fun comic and a great, typical, cute heartwarming emotion. Joy's spirit seen in the film was both made perfectly by Amy Poehler's performance, while expressed with gorgeous animation that covers the whole film as Pixar's best job well done since "Toy Story 3". The film also builds up to a powerful meaning after some reflections and explorations through more creative ideas under the concept.There's no doubt that this film would win Best Animated Feature, despite the upcoming releases of "The Peanuts Movie", which ought to be great as well, and Pixar's second treat "The Good Dinosaur", which was postponed from last year. It's also the top contender of Best Original Screenplay since out of all the films that were and not yet released this year, I really don't see any of them, or their stories, that would top the five emotions' adventure within a little girl. It could also be nominated for Best Original Score since it'd signified the older magic of Pixar seen in the older classics."Inside Out" is a definite must-see as it provides something thought-provoking that'll keep you thinking about it even though it was imaginative with high creativity that stayed faithful to both the emotions and the mind's process topic of psychology. Director Pete Doctor, who've done "Monsters, Inc." and another emotional tale "Up", done a thorough research to make the concept logically work without a missing gap, which makes this his best work by the look of the end result. The end result of this most recent instant animated classic is great like this year's combo of "Big Hero 6" and "How to Train Your Dragon 2", and it's one of the rarest of all films to be flawless.There's no reason to not like this - or miss this when it's irresistible and lovable - like there's no reason to not have Joy in your life.

eb7d952a-d994-4324-a14c-d95e14c9f590	  This movie is so good because of how relatable it is. This may be my new favorite animated film, though the How to Train Your Dragon soundtrack still has a firm grip on my heart.Edit: After consideration, I've decided that this IS my favorite animated film... but not really. My head tells me this is better, but my heart still loves How to Train Your Dragon. So, I'm only going to admit that this film is the best technically... but How to Train Your Dragon is my all-time favorite.	2

9709d148-6399-4a50-bd14-cf4fb80738ad	  If you have daughters - even sons - but especially daughters - you HAVE to see this movie. Pixar never ceases to amaze me with regards to how they can constantly step up the research and writing game. The reason their movies are so damned good and that all ages can appreciate them is simply - the multi-dimensional writing. This movie broke down the complexities of emotional development - especially around adolescence. For me, this could not have come at a more perfect time given the ages of my daughters. if you have young daughters, it will prepare you - if you have older daughters, it will help explain some things.	2

5861e64e-bf1e-4737-a331-f5c1001a2269	  93/100 - Inside Out is not quite the timeless classic that I feel Up, The Incredibles, the Toy Story films, and Wall-E are, but it does show us that the cross-generational Pixar we know and love is back. The voice casting is superb, and the animation is golden as always, but its premise sets it apart. I can't think of a film that has examined the human mind in such a unique yet strangely accurate way. I'm not sure how much of it will be grasped by kids, but the more seasoned viewers will have a blast.	2

1cf05e9b-a94a-4ccd-bf5a-668d983807a8	  I don't think I've ever been this excited to see an animated film. Maybe since it's a Pixar film and that it was in the hands of Pete Docter, who did Up and Monsters, Inc. which I thought were absolutely wonderful. I love films that take on a subject matter about growing up and how it focuses on the mental development of a child. And for Pixar to take on that subject matter, I got even more excited. Words cannot describe how much I adore Inside Out. There are so many things to talk about this film it's hard where to even start. Probably why I love the film so much is that it covers virtually everything I wanted to be done with this concept. I wanted to see how Riley lived her life as a child, how her emotions control the situations in her life, how she interacts with her friends and family, and see how she lets out her emotions. The film covers all of those things and it is executed perfectly.I know that the idea of people controlling the inside of your head has been done many times before. But taking that idea and putting it in a whole new interesting direction by incorporating it in a story about a young girl growing up is what makes this film original, which is what we love to see from Pixar. The amount of creativity and imagination the film has is unbelievable and how they utilize it with the story is absolutely ingenious. It also makes for some really funny jokes. The thing about the film is that, comparing it to other Pixar films, they aren't throwing that many jokes at you. But when they do, it is some of Pixar's funniest. The jokes are so incredibly clever, so well put together, a lot are actually very subtle, and they made me laugh so hard. There's too much creativity involved in the film for me to go into. Michael Giacchino's score has become one of my favorites from him. His soundtrack is very reminiscent of the mind, there's a lot of variety, and it carries the whole film. The film is also incredibly colorful. It has a really vibrant color scheme that makes the film's atmosphere feel very lush. I don't think I've seen a film have this much color. I really love the contrast of the amount of color between the mind and the real world, making it easier to differentiate between them. I also love how the colors in the real world became more bland when they move to San Francisco to be used as a metaphor of how the color has been sucked out of Riley's life. The characters are all so adorable and very relatable. It could've been so easy to make the emotion characters one-dimensional since they're supposedly meant to express only one emotion. But they give them more fleshed out personalities and interesting arcs that helps us connect with them more while also making them more identifiable. Some people may find it weird that they can somehow express more than one emotion, but it's never said that they're unable to do so. The emotion characters portray their particular emotion so well, and they had me very entertained the whole time. Credit must be given to the perfect, and I mean PERFECT, cast! Let alone Lewis Black as the voice of Anger! You couldn't have picked better actors to play these roles. The animation on the emotions is extremely well done. It adds even more character to them and also makes their personalities as well as the setting of the mind even more identifiable. The character arc on Joy makes her especially relatable. She starts out selfish, takes control of everything, and thinks that being happy all the time will straighten everything out, which we can easily think the same thing. But she eventually becomes aware that Sadness is very important, and that acknowledging sad moments will make you feel and appreciate the joyful moments even more, like how we will find that awareness later in life. But my favorite character in the film is actually Riley. I think she is one of the best kid characters of all time. They really made her feel like a real person. She's just your normal everyday girl who's growing up. She goes through the same hardships that everyone else goes through in that period of adolescence, so we can easily relate to her based on what she does and how she feels.Since it is a film about emotions, the most important aspect of the film is that it should have a lot of emotional depth. They really accomplished that aspect. This film has some of the most emotional moments in any Pixar film, or maybe in any film! Maybe I'm exaggerating a little, but there were some scenes that really got me. (SPOILER ALERT) There's the scene where Joy learns the importance of Sadness. We see Joy remembering all the forgotten happy memories and she shows how much she loves Riley and her being happy. When she says "I just wanted Riley to be happy" and then just breaks down crying, you understand why Joy had a somewhat harsh attitude towards Sadness because Joy really cares about Riley like she was her own daughter and she never wanted her to feel sad. The way they utilize the moral about the importance of Sadness is absolutely brilliant! And it's mostly done with just a visual representation. It is such a meaningful message for children nowadays because they need that acknowledgement in order to survive. Being happy all the time isn't always the solution to the hardships of growing up and that it's okay to be sad sometimes. I have to admit, that scene managed to get me a little teary-eyed. But believe me, I usually never cry in movies. Then there's the scene that pretty much everyone cried at was the selfless sacrifice of Riley's imaginary friend, Bing Bong. The disappearance of Bing Bong is a perfect metaphor of having to let go of something that was a big part of your childhood, which is necessary for us to keep us mentally healthy. I wasn't quite as devastated as everyone else was, but I was still genuinely moved. And then there's the scene where Riley tearfully admits to her parents how much she misses her old home. Again, I have to admit, this scene legitimately made me cry. Throughout the course of the film, we have related to Riley and we've grown to really care about her. She hasn't been showing how she really feels about her new life and the stress of the situation is effecting her mental stability. When she eventually had to confess she couldn't help but let her feelings out, which makes us relate to her and feel for her even more. The tears streaming down her face, her sniffling, and her breaking voice as she remembers her old life makes for an extremely affecting scene. I felt for Riley so much at this point that I just wanted to give her a hug. Her parents acknowledge that this a really sad moment for Riley and they needed to console her, and she cries into her parents arms. Then Sadness and Joy take control of Riley together, and we see Riley smiling again through her tears creating a new amalgamated and bittersweet core memory. Such a sweet, touching, and meaningful scene. They executed that scene so incredibly well.Honestly, the only nitpick I have with the film is that I wanted to see even more of how the mind works. There are so many opportunities you can do with this concept that I think it could've been explored a little more. But that's a really small nitpick, they can't cover everything. It's still very impressive how much they've covered. I really want to see Pixar make a franchise with this because there are just so many more ideas and opportunities. Like in the Toy Story franchise where we see Andy growing up, I can see them make an Inside Out franchise where we see Riley growing up. The ending kind of indicates a potential sequel, and if they do make one I'm all for it. I want to see more! I wanted to review this film in depth because I want to explain why this film means so much to me. Watching it, I feel like I'm bettered as a person. It came out at a perfect time for me. I was under a lot of stress at the time, and the film taught me that this is a normal part of life and it's best to just deal with it. You're allowed to let your emotions out when you need to. Inside Out has become not only my favorite film of the year, not only my favorite Pixar film, I've considered it as being one of my top ten favorite films of all time! With the exception of Fantasia, it has become my all time favorite animated film. That's how much I love it. That's how much it affected me. This movie will always hold a place in my heart.	2

64867039-3d72-43fd-82ef-d77fd1b39d80	  Pixar has given non-human things human-like traits and emotions ever since 'Toy Story.' Where do they go from here? They give human traits and emotions... traits and emotions. And they pull it off wonderfully. The jokes are snappy and witty, the characters are spot-on, and you completely care about the human characters in which the emotions are taking place. Pixar took anthropomorphizing to a whole 'nother level. This is one of the best of the year.	2
f9bc2ced-6019-4720-b739-c1acb138b87d	  I don't think an animated movie has made me cry and laugh so much as Inside Out. Joy and Sadness took me on Riley's extremely relatable journey; I saw myself in her emotions, which is a triumph of animation. Gorgeous visuals, brilliant voice acting, heart-wrenching catharsis, hilarious moments, and best of all: a profound message . . . Joy cannot exist without Sadness, and we must reflect on our downfalls in order to pick ourselves back up again.I will remember this movie as the psychological, emotional rollercoaster (without being clich�) that revived my love for the powers of animation.	2

I will agree with every molecule of my being that this is a great film, but i cannot agree that it deserves a spot in the top 100.

5532faac-a788-405c-8bde-8d6ed9451ab8	  Spoilers Ahead. Don't Read until you see the film. Celebrating 20 incredible years of CGI motion pictures, PIXAR has blown us away. Inside Out is a hilariously inventive, intelligent, emotionally moving masterpiece, a profound, masterfully crafted landmark that's perfect in every level. Directed by mastermind Pete Doctor, director of Monsters.Inc and Up, Inside Out exceeds his previous films, and probably cooking up the most bizarre, yet most gorgeous Pixar film yet. This new classic will certainly attract moviegoers of old and young, and the glorious amount of pure brilliance and attention to detail is all but too much to discover in just one viewing, because it's a rare film that will age brilliantly with time, as the whole experience improves the more viewings you give.Premise/Setting: The premise is no less of absolute genius, even from PIXAR. The world of Inside Out takes place in the mind of a young girl, where she is powered by 5 emotions who must guide her to the discoveries of life.  If told by other studios, they would just settle to just her emotions. But PIXAR takes the premise and goes an almighty step beyond, and instead creates an entire world inside her mind. Every day, the girl's head receives orbs, each orb is her memories, where they will go to long-term memory. However, the most important memories go straight to the core memories, and each core memory would power an island, each island that would power the girl's personality. The girl's mind would feature various locations, that would power and create her dreams, thoughts, and imaginations. World-building in this film is absolutely brilliant, taking a step beyond from other ideas. 10/10Story/Script: In the vibrant life in Minnesota, Riley, 11 years old, is enjoying a wonderful life, with wonderful parents, great friends, and a winning hockey team. Riley is power by 5 emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. However, Riley and her parents are moving to San Francisco, shocking the emotions, who must do their best to guide her to her new life the best way they can. However, one day, her core memories were removed, and Joy and Sadness get sucked out of headquarters, and now the two must get back to headquarters and fix Riley, before it's too late, all without a villain or antagonist. From the the minds of the glorious Monsters.Inc, and Up, PIXAR proudly presents a story that every other studio would dare, leaving its rivals in the dust.  In a world, full of unnecessary sequels, adaptations, and remakes, we finally get an original story that is completely void of clich�s, villains, and explosions, and instead relying on sharp wit, vibrant characters, and most importantly heart. The film is genuinely and unbelievably creative, taking the simple but effective story, to their advantage. PIXAR goes one step beyond, delivering a hilariously moving experience, but one that is emotionally driven, gorgeously animated, and masterfully written. If it were done by a different studios, instead of going for their gut, would go for the easy route, and underwhelm the gorgeous idea, with a cheap story, forced cruelty, lame jokes, dated trendy slangs, and pop music that so many non-PIXAR films strive for. Instead, PIXAR gives it all, taking risks and inspiring people to strive for excellence, and is treated like an adult film, with dark tones, sharp wit, dry humor, and sophisticated writing. Inside Out builds upon what tools it has, and wows us like all their other films. The most impressive element of the film is the world building. We have headquarters, were our emotions live and work. We don't just remain entirely on headquarters, but outside is entirely different new world. We have a labyrinth where all long-term memories travel. Train of Thought, were all of Riley's thoughts are transferred to headquarters. Imagination Land were all of Riley's imaginations are created. Dream Productions, a Hollywood-like locations where dreams are created. And the Abyss, a dark pit where all unwanted memories crumble, die off, and are forgotten. These world's are so gorgeous and imaginative, it makes you want to go inside someone's head and explore. The film always remember the audience and on what they want. One of the film's strengths is it's comedy. Like other PIXAR films, they have written comedy of many kinds, they will strike the minds of anyone. You'll be laughing your ass off, by what they have made, and it's just as impressive as the story itself. However, what truly moved me most is it's human touch. PIXAR has once again takes us to the next level, making us cry buckets, and change the way we think of our mind.  PIXAR films since the early years have always been constructed with a great story, ones that are fun and enjoyable. But PIXAR goes one step beyond. If you look at every PIXAR film to the core story, they are not simple: their stories are universally adult topics. If you put them all together, PIXAR films are a continuing series of books; each and every PIXAR film representing a topic of all but one universal theme: The Human Condition. In this film, there are numerous topics such as learning to let go of what you left behind and moving on, but most importantly: learning how to embrace Sadness. So often, people try to avoid being sad, but have so often forget that sadness at one point, will be one of, if not the most important emotion of their life. It's a message so profound, so deep, but mostly so complex that you will never see a DreamWorks, or even a Disney film embrace such a message or concept. A concept very difficult to market and so risky, that other studios would never explore. But that's whats makes PIXAR groundbreaking, because they take risks in exploring deep, universal concepts in the most profound, entertaining, and highest quality possible. As fun and exciting as it is, Inside Out is brave enough to deliver something that is not only profound, but will wreck you with sequences and themes, that are incredibly dark, and emotionally heartbreaking. It is a story of emotions who must discover the dark and gritty realities of leaving behind what you love and starting fresh. We get to see Riley go through an identity crisis, as her emotions are struggling to keep her functioning properly, and from her on then, and we learn that it's okay to be sad, because in the end, we are all energies of life that need emotions, because it whats makes us human. It is even more impressive that, in the end, there is no villain. There is no bad guy or antagonist that tries to stop Riley or her emotions. It's just a simple story about vibrant emotions interacting with their new life, and that is more entertaining and intriguing than big robots who want to destroy the world, the plot that so many blockbuster films use nowadays, but thankfully this film doesn't use.  In the end, the film's inventive story, masterfully crafted script, and emotionally moving heart, rivals the best live-action films in the last 20 years, all in just 94 minutes. 10/10Animation/Visual Effects: What's a PIXAR film without groundbreaking animation. With PIXAR's industry-standard technology, an astonishing $175 million budget, and the world's greatest animators, Inside Out incorporates some of the most gorgeous animation in history. Everything is done with top-quality detail, with photorealistic textures, blending with stylistic designs and settings. The use, style and tones of animation are exhibited brilliantly in this film. First we have 2 worlds: The Human World, and Riley's mind. Both worlds contrast each other beautifully, and looking like two completely different but gorgeous films.  First lets talk about the Human World. The Human World is a very interesting topic. First we have 2 primary settings. We have Minnesota: portraying itself as heaven with bright colors, and a happy undertones. However, Riley and her family move to San Francisco. San Francisco is supposed to portray hell, with the isolating undertones, extremely dull colors, and a dark and gritty look; a massive and polar opposite contrast to Big Hero 6's San Fransokyo.  However, the main highlight of the animation and the film is the world inside Riley's mind. This part of the film shows the true potential of the true ambitions and creativity PIXAR is capable of making. The world is filled with bright colors, abstract art style, and pure imagination, that only Pixar can deliver.  The character designs are a true work of art. The emotions perfectly match the look of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery, as they perfectly exaggerate the character animation with Looney Tunes-style comedy, perfecting the use of squash and stretch. It uses abstract character designs that homages the Looney Tunes, but also use sophisticated, and realistic movements to balance the overall feel, because the film remembers to treat it like an ambitious work of animation, and not a dumbed down cartoon. Every emotion is also shaped to represent a certain figure. Joy represents a star; Sadness represents a tear drop; Anger represents a fire brick; Disgust represents a piece of broccoli; and Fear represents a brain nerve. Everything in the films looks gorgeous, proofing that PIXAR delivers the best animation in the world that will blow you away, but you will have to watch and see for yourself. 10/10Characters/Casting: PIXAR can't have a film without any lovable characters. Inside Riley's mind lie our film's main stars. Inside her mind lies Joy, played by Amy Poehler. Sadness, played by Phyllis Smith. Anger, played by Lewis Black. Disgust played by Mindy Kaling, and Fear, played by Bill Hader. One of the most fascinating elements of these characters are the portrayal and concept of these characters. They aren't one dimensional or simplistic. It's actually unbelievably surprising by how complex and genuine they are. If you really get to the core of the characters, each emotion is made up of multiple emotions, In fact, the film's original story consist up to 27 simple emotions, but somehow were all condensed to 5 core emotions. And instead of being simple figures, they are all created as moving shapes of energy with bubbly textured skin. And they are all hilarious as s%^t. Casting was perfectly chosen. Instead of finding celebrities by popularity, PIXAR has chosen stellar actors that perfectly match the tone, which is what an actor is suppose to do. They are all naturals. Amy Poehler's happy goody persona works perfectly with Joy. Phyllis Smith's has truly brought us the sadness in Sadness. Lewis Black has brought Anger to life, who's performance is stellar. Mindy Kaling has brought Disgust and nailed the emotion. Bill Hader is a natural as Fear, delivering one of his best roles yet. The casting is nailed. However what made these characters human is their relations with each other. Living in a young girl's mind, you always wonder, what do they look like? How do they act? What do they think? And how do they interact with each other. It's what make this film a classic. These characters all interact with each other, and solve their problems together, and the act like what emotions they are, and they all serve one main goal: guide Riley to her new life.  What makes PIXAR film's classics is their abilities to take bizarre characters, and make them real, and let the audience understand these characters. These emotions are all so relatable. And they are unbelievably human, because we all know what it's like to feel what they're feeling. We know how Joy feels when she get excited. Anger knows how we can feel when we don't get what we want. Disgust knows when something is good or bad like us. Fear wants to protect Riley, and gets scared when he sees something scary, and we all know what's it's like when we get scared. Sadness cries, and always thinks about the memories that are sad, because it's okay to be sad when we need to. Each emotion represents a certain element of our personality and how we feel, because in the end, these characters are real. We do get happy. We get sad. We get angry. We get scared. And we get grossed out. These characters represent each emotion we feel, and they're in all in our heads. In fact, these characters are more human and believable than most live actors in many other films, and that is saying a lot. Although, there is a special character so profound and lovable, you will have to watch the film to meet him. 10/10 Inside Out is a profound, hilarious, inventive, ambitious, and emotionally fueled piece of storytelling that proves the PIXAR is practically the greatest studio of all time that repeatedly churns out masterfully crafted classics, that will define not just your childhood, but your life in general. Inside Out is a perfect example of how animation is not a kiddie genre, but a crucial art form that can be just as profound and incredible as live-action.  Bravo PIXAR, for bringing us the best film of the summer. Here's praying The Good Dinosaur is just as terrific as this film. 10/10.	2

843d54f6-d536-425d-a90c-b0338239e6b2	  It's hard to be a kid. It's hard to be an adult as well. But when things go wrong for adults, they can use logic and assessment and other analytical tools they've learned and possibly sharpened over the years to gauge what went wrong and why and how it can be avoided next time. When things go wrong for a child, things have just gone wrong. It's cruel and unfair and seems to serve no purpose beyond making their lives miserable for that moment in time. Luckily, kids are pros at bouncing back. I've seen my own children get madder or sadder than they've ever been and thirty seconds later, they're laughing and playing and the trauma is forgotten. Not so with adults. With adults, when something we perceive as traumatic happens to us, for many of us, it sticks. It's hard to shake and takes little to bring it bubbling to the surface again. If Inside Out was a movie about the voices in my head, it would be a much, much different movie than the one Pixar has made here. I don't sense that there's as much harmony in my head as there is in the head of Inside Out's Riley. But that's one of the film's many strengths. It stars a normal girl. An everygirl, if you will. She's not gorgeous, or rich. She's not the daughter of a diplomat or a superhero. She doesn't have superpowers herself, and her favourite thing to do is play hockey. Not exactly a rare breed up here in Canada. What makes Riley special is what she's made of. It's what's inside that count. And what's inside Riley are five emotions that determine how every day will go. The goal of the five emotions seems to be to create good memories. That's the goal for Joy anyway. And keeping Anger, Fear, Disgust, and especially Sadness at bay is a full time job. As Riley starts to grow up and things start to change, like moving to a new city and having to start everything over again (boy, do I know what that's like), some of her emotions, Sadness in particular, are finding themselves compelled to complicate Riley's joyful manner. When Joy and Sadness are sucked from Mind Control into Long Term Memory, they have to try to find their way back to Riley before she loses all her Personality Islands and becomes a bitter shell of nothingness. Pixar has always been fantastic at making their films ageless. For adults, there are deep thoughts and ideas in this movie, things that will make you think and feel. Certainly laugh, maybe cry. And it presents the most complex area of human physiology (the brain), in an educational, imaginative way that is easy to understand. But if you bring your three year old to the film, they will have just as good a time as you. Because the film is also a colourful, exciting, action packed ride about things we all go through as early as our earliest memories are formed. Another masterstroke of Inside Out is in its casting. It may seem obvious once you've seen the movie, but whoever first thought to hire Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Mindy Kaling, Bill Hader and Lewis Black, as Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger, respectively, was a genius. Think about it. Think about what emotion each of these actors reminds you of and then try to imagine anyone else voicing those characters in the film. It might be the best casting of the year. At the end of the day though, Pixar's greatest achievement with this movie, for me anyway, is helping me to realize a very important thing about the emotions which guide us in our day to day. Which is that every emotion we feel, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Disgust, are there for a reason. They're all important and they all have a purpose and a function and they all work together to make us who we are. Sometimes you need to be sad before you can be happy. Sometimes you need to be afraid before you can safe. Or angry, or disgusted. There's nothing wrong with being any of those things at certain times. After all, how will you know you've had a good day if you've never had a bad one? Now if only I could get those other emotions to suck themselves out of my Mind Control and get lost in Long Term Memory. You hear that Judgement, Envy, Anxiety and Low Self Worth? Nobody likes you! Get lost!Verdict: Inside Out is the full package. A movie about emotions that will put your own through the ringer. It's big, it's bright, it's fast paced and fun and deep in a way most animated films are not. One of the best films of the year and one of the best Pixar films ever.	2
ec30d456-7128-4063-be57-ece778d02a3f	  When you ask me what's my favourite Pixar movie is like choosing your favourite child, you just can't do it. But Inside Out just might in the top spot, it no only a fresh, not original but spectacularely clever animation movie, it might not be the funniest or the most visually impressive but the animation is gorgeous and what it does is so powerfull, and moving, that you can't help but find your inner child and treasure it for movies such as these. Inside Out follows the five emotion of girl named Riley, and how they direct her to cope with changes in her life, and how could i forget about the outstanding voice acting from the leads, special notion to Lewis Black as Anger there couldn't be a more perfect casting. Adventurous, funny, and unsurprisingly "emotional". Pixar you did it again.	2
ac13ef8e-4548-49ed-be6a-ec9108393f80	  I see why people like it. I just found it to be incredibly boring.	1
d5acbf1c-425b-4e40-93dc-ee3e886affa8	  'Inside Out' is brilliant. It's Pixar's triumphant comeback with a clever, profound, complex and moving story anyone can enjoy.	2
948a65c8-5bfd-49e8-9e6f-49798052c3bc	  I almost don't know what to say. I was told this is in the front-running to really be Pixar's greatest yet; of course I was slightly dubious.But I'm still awestruck. Inside Out is absolutely incredible - pacing, tone, story, characters (both human and emotional), message... The only thing I have to kind of complain about is the visual representation of the abstract parts of the way a brain works leaving like a couple stones unturned (but it's not enough to affect my overall opinion of the film). It really delivered.I just loved it so much! The story is set up so quickly in an easy way to comprehend, so the inner workings of Riley's (the girl human main character) mind make sense as layers of new aspects of thinking kind of mix into the way the story progresses. I think the shining triumph, and this is Pixar's strength in all their films, is that the film is such a stripped down concept of a person growing up and coming to grips with their feelings that it applies to every person. Adults see themselves in Riley's parents (and probably in Riley as well) and younger kids obviously are coming to terms with many of the same things we see Riley deal with throughout the film - so the concept really lends itself to being related to from almost all points of view.The voice cast is stellar - Amy Poehler leads the charge like a champ and the casting is so extraordinarily appropriate and fitting that you don't question it ever while watching. A really well thought-out group to bring base emotions to life.The lead-in short, Lava, also put me in a really emotional state before Inside Out began so it served as a really great primer for the emotional paces the feature presentation teed off with. A great short on its own as well!I honestly can't put my enjoyment into words, Inside Out really is at least Top 3 in Pixar's catalog to date. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh through your tears from crying - the film really hits every base. Such a great return to form, really can't wait for The Good Dinosaur now, knowing what great development brought Inside Out to life.Get your butt to that theater! Take everyone with you! Inside Out deserves your attention!	2
417e3d44-10f0-49bb-a369-1407995d1b29	  It was a very good but there were many other chosies which joy and saddeness could have do to get back to headquarters like sending the orbs with the cleaning people	1
4a63332f-0d79-4634-a53f-9eddc1b3d5f9	  Pixar has done excellent job with the balanced representation of each emotion with their importance in life. Director justified movie context on how a child's emotions drive her to make her ultimate personality. Also all the human psychology key factors are considered thoroughly.	2

6e3ce1de-69a1-4fae-a242-2266955dbc57	  Can't believe I haven't written a review on this yet. This little piece of gem is one of Pixar's best yet. I was given the chance to attend Ronnie del Carmen's talk about Inside Out (too bad Pete Docter wasn't there!) and I could really see the tremendous passion and effort (and pixie dust) it took to create this one of a kind and one of the most imaginative movies I've ever seen. When I was young, I also thought that there were different personalities inhabiting inside my mind but I never envisioned the intricate "laws" the mind had unlike the Pixar team. The casting was perfect, the storyline was close to flawless (okay maybe not all but you never noticed the minor flaws like how Broccoli was the only culprit vegetable but never mind...) and it had a lot of heart. This was actually more of a movie for adults in the sense Toy Story 3 was also targeted more at adults as well. I just reallly loved it. It's definitely a movie that I'll never get tired of watching. So kudos Pixar team, what a great cinematic artwork you've given us.	2
0566d10a-79c7-4960-9d6f-3920c6df5755	  Amy Poehler is an absolute darl and gives this movie a lovely homelike feeling. Very interesting concept and suitable for the entire family, even the parents wouldnt be disappointed.	2
c487f565-ea90-4131-bb3c-90802659d528	  I haven't cried like this in a movie probably ever.	2
638cf59e-f5b2-4a1a-aea8-6508991f88fd	  Ironically one of Pixar's least emotionally-exploitative films, because it actually lets the emotion come naturally from what's going on, rather than getting so-called "depth" from trying to force the viewer to feel like crap (see: opening minutes of Up, for which the entire rather mediocre movie was lauded far too much; or the driving premise of the decent, albeit highly-overrated, Toy Story 3). It's not perfect by any means - it works better on paper than in actual execution in some ways, but it was enjoyable, and darker than one might expect.	2
4e834a4d-582f-4298-9e3a-0bb4381ca7fe	  Its a bit over rated, the plot doesn't really make any sense. They make everyone so unlikable besides Joy. I really hate watching movies where everyone is so dislikable. Riley is annoying and she makes decisions out of happiness and sadness even though Joy and Sadness aren't with her. I know it seems like a nit pick but if you're making a movie about emotions I expect each emotion to show their respective properties. Its better than The Good Dinosaur at least.	1
bd1f1036-7b48-4e14-88d7-936050c70ec3	  This movie may not be the next Toy Story, but it's still one heck of an adventure for the whole family. I'm just surprised none of the other emotions felt sorry for Sadness.	2
02c6a8df-89df-478e-9a92-7e8ff522ecf7	  A very clever and intriguing idea for a story. I wasn't entirely sold on the delivery. But the message was powerful and beautifully expressed!	2
57dbb682-20d5-46b4-9c87-1e90bc005e7a	  With Inside Out Pixar takes a rather old concept and reimagines it in a wonderful and exciting new way. The story follows an 11-year old girl named Riley as she adjusts to a recent move from Minnesota to San Francisco; and helping her are her core emotions Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear, but when an accident ejects Joy and Sadness from the control center of Riley's mind she starts to suffer an emotional breakdown. The voice casting is really well-done, particularly Amy Poehler as Joy and Lewis Black as Anger. And the animation is amazing; with extraordinarily creative designs for how the mind is structured and visualized. Another Pixar triumph, Inside Out is a fun and entertaining family film that has a surprisingly touching message.	2
17092f72-5cdb-4c89-a449-c041a8ea0843	  I enjoyed this. As with many Pixar films, it took me a little while to accept the concept, but I was laughing in some parts and sniffling away at others. Based on that, it makes sense that they would pick Sadness as one of the most significant emotions.	2
824118c0-1e1a-4dda-b843-e107ec6f1ad8	  Pixar is back, and this return could not be better, because that good old magic of his films that picked us up in his many classics, that magic came back and at full strength I would say. Everything about this film is genial more'll try to explain to you the contents of this masterpiece. The main thing to say is that this is the most creative idea that Pixar ever had and also the most well executed. What they did was create a whole universe about how our mind works, all through a 11 year old girl named Riley and their primary emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust. Riley is headed by Joy, then her life has always been very happy, until one day she and her family move because his father got a new job. There are many changes and adaptations that this girl has to go, and then her emotions do not know how they will keep it normal as before, there comes a very serious accident, and Joy and Sadness end up accidentally leaving the control booth, where they operate her mind, and they will have to return quickly to save the consciousness of Riley. First of all this emotion and even Riley themselves are extraordinary characters, and all are dubbed with extreme talent all over the voice cast that includes Amy Poehler, Lewis Black, Phyllis Smith, Mindy Kalling and Bill Hader, all very well in their performances. But the highlight of the film is the script, it is not only intelligent but also well written and full of great ideas, why we forget something we do not want or why horrible songs stick in your head are all things so complex explained as simply and efficiently as possible. Of course do not forget that as animation of Pixar, the film has a very relevant message to our society about dealing with depression, and it also moves a lot, so much that in the most exciting or saddest moments, you will get enough heartbroken or even crying, in my case I cried like hell right, there is a scene in particular that left me totally touched, and if you do not at least get emotional, you have no heart, there are times when I did not cry in a movie, it really was a lot of emotions for a movie alone. Technically the film is all that is expected of it, after all this studio is synonymous with quality in this matter, so the visuals are gorgeous, especially in the use of colors representing every moment of the film, for example in happy times everything is strongly colored, already in sad moments to darker shades. The characters are visually beautiful and visual concept of the scenery is stunning, everything seems very real even the appearance being somewhat cartoonish within the Riley mind. The soundtrack is delightful, another victory for Michael Giacchino now shown in other films like the latest "Jurassic World" or "Up", which won the Oscar. It is pleasant to hear, has incredible melodies and further helps the film's time to thrill the viewer. As for the 3D movie he's cute as any animation you have, but if you want to dismiss him no problem. Of all the films I saw in 2015, Inside Out is not only one of the best, but was also one of the few where I had high expectations, and they were not only overcome, I saw a film that does not expect to be so striking and profound for me, I felt so much seeing him that is a feeling that I will never forget. For these and other reasons I'm not afraid to say that Inside Out is the best movie of all Pixar, surpassing even the great classics of them and taking shape as one of the best animations of all time. An instant classic that I plan to revisit again and again at home, and already consider the winner of best animated 2015 Oscar and maybe even more than that. Do not miss the opportunity to see it!	2
3131d63e-0483-42c7-8b69-e04b27472dc4	  Pixar is still making great animation films and Inside Out is for both adults and kids and is amazing.	2
afbfa353-7756-487d-9f51-d1c31aa37e14	  One of Pixar's best, an extremely well written, funny and brilliantly voice acted story about growing up that might end up moving adults more than kids.	2
13d50a22-4d65-46f5-9bfa-93df4a0a1653	  For me Inside Out was Film of the Year material. A gloriously in depth film which really strikes a very strong and emotional tone. This film was perhaps the most aimed at "the parents" of any pixar film, touching upon that very real feeling of loss that we get as we grow older; but also the opportunities that we gain as we leave childhood. As we watch both riley and her emotions attempt to deal with the trauma that is moving home for a young person we take that emotional journey with her. Inside Out, doing what pixar seems best at nowadays, actually achieved the most sobbing i have ever witnessed in a cinema capturing the emotion of "sadness" bang on the head.Not seen it yet? Do. Just be sure to have tissues on hand.	2
e0dfa692-54ac-4069-86f3-a3caf6ba9c2c	  Great movie, although a bit more from the other emotions would have been cool. Made me cry, though, and has a great message.	2
a4c9d26d-d5bd-4cf7-9f14-8aa6106f852e	  Truly interesting, funny, heartwarming, and finely created. Nothing less of what you could expect from Pixar.	2
f6052e74-aadf-4eb2-a6ee-335cbc19e55c	  Inside Out is easily Pixar's best film since Toy Story 3 and that is definitely a relief to see since their other more recent films have been rather weak. It's clever concept and emotional story make it easily one of the best animated films I've seen in more recent years. Overall Score: 10/10	2
8d8cae4c-100f-4233-abb9-361b4886bcab	  I can't imagine any child enjoying this movie. Honestly, I don't even know if I enjoyed it or I just empathized with it. It's a movie about pure emotion, so it's hard not to get emotional watching it. In that sense, it's the most manipulative Pixar movie ever made; it doesn't feel like it's trying to make you miserable or anything, it's just using the most obvious shortcuts to making you like it. That said, it's enjoyable because it's so relatable- I just kind of wish they had done it a less obvious way. I feel like everything I got out of this movie, I've gotten stronger out of other movies that weren't so overt.	2
e408e7a3-eb81-4a9a-b3ac-9eee18382bca	  This movie is genuinely intelligent, another Masterpice from pixar, and above all make me cry	2
14c02d4a-f2b6-4cb0-97d4-8df31d3dc59e	  Awesome entertainment. VERY smart, fresh and fun. Brilliant story and screenplay. Could be a real Oscar Best Picture nominee (not just animated films.) One of the smartest Pixar films ever, maybe equal to Toy Story. A+	2
ec761b3e-1f73-4043-b93a-89bebe17cefe	  Brilliant, Inventive movie creates a new way to look at, and try to read ;), human emotions.	2
d0b7b66d-fc3d-42da-8ceb-a2d1388a1ebe	  Damn, Pixar, do you ever make a bad movie? Cars & Cars 2, I guess...but wow. Inside Out is such a beautiful movie. Visually, it's gorgeous & the story is honest and original. The voicework is great by all, especially Phylllis Smith as Sadness. There are so many laughs and touching & emotional moments. One of the best movies of 2015.	2
7d5b4b64-8149-4a6e-8f59-d726c6f6c436	  The movie was trite and predictable in my opinion. I'm also bothered that the portrayals of anger and depression were male in the girl's head. The implication is that those emotions in girls are driven by men. About the only thing I enjoyed was the visuals.	1
9f14c04c-74c7-47a8-ab05-d762c754c33a	  Great story and lots of fun for all ages.	2
1c373b3c-0a97-4207-942e-fefbf94339ad	  Finally, a quality film from Pixar since the past few years. Frankly speaking, Frozen and Big Hero 6 are simply overrated!!!	2
8bb4b915-96d1-4ab2-92b8-86ff46701c47	  Beautifully animated, emotional, funny and extremely clever; Inside Out is one of the best animated movies I've seen in a long time.	2
09cf74b9-7dc6-4741-894d-df913d8c3b2e	  Inside Out is nakedly out to make you cry, but resists being cheap at achieving this goal. As a movie about growing up, it'd be easy to throw in a dead pet here, a lost grandma there, and get the tears flowing. But instead, Inside Out digs a bit deeper, and tells a story about the simple losses of growing up, with a perfectly acceptable moral of "its okay to be sad sometimes". The characters don't pop in quite the same way that some of the Pixar classics have, which stops it from really entering the top tier of Pixar, but it clearly belongs in their company.	2
00aa6fbd-93d4-4f00-8b79-6d11a6681b99	  Emotional, Humorous, Engaging showing an interesting perspective of adolescence. The best animation of 2015	2

2165fc86-7381-4b81-a3d1-431abd0b95b7	  Given the raves about this film, I feel like I must have missed something. Certainly, after Wall-E, I was expecting this to be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, I came away unimpressed. The concept was clever enough but the story felt small and rather tedious.	1
dfffa58a-db7a-4955-9ed2-25010c62a108	  not one of Pixar's best in my opinion.	1
81967f9a-8f56-4ac4-b662-0aa7dfe7cbaf	  The worst Pixar movie I've seen. Its a very depressing movie.	0
09d238e6-8c83-4d36-8c7f-970e247b12ba	  Somehow I missed the excitement of "real" storytelling in the form of clever animation that for many in our industry elevate clever trifles like Inside Out into a top-ten list. Puleeze. There is a concept here, which needs a movie to beat it to death. Nice voice performances, heartwarming story, occasional chuckle. But this is not greatness, not for me anyway.	1
e6f867bf-dfd8-49b8-a0a0-64828307c942	  Inside Out is another lame movie that will be one of the most hated movies of all time. It lacks a plot. It is cheesy.	0
86353895-9cf0-4c47-8e6c-7f52a5dd29a6	  For me the ratings for this Animation-movie are a bit over the top! All i see is a very simple story , but the Emotions make it very complicated to follow , certunly when some balls with emotions rolling away and....ah screw dem balls and buttoms !	1
e3677f97-5ef2-4b76-a06b-3d5b304ab312	  Entertaining. Another gold hit for Pixar which will run and run.	1

d1c5c20f-9038-4a79-85ef-01880275e8e4	  Its a good movie, but it definitely dont deserve 98%	0
574caf2a-3659-42c2-9cfb-7b8eebdddca8	  This movie had far too many flaws. Disney gets an A for trying but a D for execution. For one they established that the emotions are supposed to generally act like the emotions they are. Obviously they are going to feel other things as they are personified but when you establish in the concept in the beginning you need to follow through. In other people's head the emotions act the same and don't show off their actual emotion. Such as the mom's saddness acts more like reasoning and logic than sad. Then the whole build up to the movie is Joy realizing that "oh my god we need sadness." that's played down since a lot of tv shows tell kids the lesson of "it's okay to be sad." and "other emotions are okay to be felt." There was too much build up for just these lessons to actually make it a compelling movie. Maybe these can be excused to a certain degree since it is a childrens movie. But the one thing I can not excuse is the absolute lack of humor in the movie. I like kids movies despite being 19 mostly because they tend to be funny this movie has the worst humor ever. I have never sat through a kids movie with such a straight face, but it was so easy since there was basically nothing funny about this movie I figured if anything anger would make me laugh since Lewis Black is hilarious but he was just so bland. The funniest part was at th every end with the boy she meets and his emotions screaming "girl!" This movie gets far too much praise and honestly I think it's because Disney is written on the front.	0
6c5ac973-c90a-4978-88ab-03d5f09d6ae8	  Pixar presents its next film Inside Out. The movie explores the idea of creatures in your head that control your emotions. Joy (Amy Poehler) naturally wants everything to be happy and feels that the other emotions with her (Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness) get in her way. An incident however causes them to be removed from the control headquarters and they must find their way back through the maze that is the mind to be sure that their host Riley does not continue life without Joy and Sadness. As the two try and return, the other emotions do their best to control the situation at hand. Only through viewing other emotions and memories do they begin to realize that together they form the best team to make Riley a better person. Inside Out is clever at parts, and has some good moments, but for the most part the emotions in my head found this movie to be too short and not as imaginative or interesting as some of its predecessors.	1
5183808f-7cae-409c-852c-54bc370edd43	  Very disappointing. The characters were annoying and unimaginative. The plot was dull.	0
3f13b57a-6548-4e9e-9ef6-9929d6f224fa	  Top marks for originality. Conceptually brilliant. But I found it too melancholic and the subtle messages too disturbing for my liking. I didn't enjoy the film at all, in fact I found it irritating. I may be the only one not raving about it, but I think there is cause for concern as to how Inside Out undermines the mind of a person. Firstly, it was a look into the mind of an 11 year old, as if she had no control over any of her emotions, and it was her emotions having control over her, pressing buttons as if she were a robot. It comes across as if we are are at the mercy of our emotions, and we start to doubt ourselves. Second, the animation was suggestive of stereotyping of the emotions. For example, the melancholic "Sad" character, was drawn as fat, bespectacled, short, blue and turtlenecked, while Joy, the happy character, was lithe, tall, slim and pretty. This animated film is packed with subtle messages which are detrimental to children's perception of themselves. It shames body types. It shames emotions. It shames the self. Inside Out is neither smart nor emotional. It is dangerous for children and young people.	1
f787adf1-1448-48a7-9d34-6c6d35204339	  Do not watch this film if you are expecting something funny. It is one overly long emotional journey into the mind of a 12 year old girl, not what I would consider entertainment. It was mostly SAD. I want my hours back.	0
30b7ac92-eb99-4456-832a-aa432173f163	  This will provoke outrage. But yeah, 2.5 stars.	1
0046743d-4afe-4063-831a-0d40be3e091f	  The visuals were great, the lesson is on point, but the plot is disappointing, dry and frustrating. Disney and Pixar could've gone in a different direction, but went for the same old dead horse beating.	1
9fcca286-90c7-4cc9-b7a4-dee08265a017	  My least favorite Pixar movie... I've never wanted to sleep more during a movie as this was drawn out with maybe 1 or 2 decent moments	0
6cdb2a4a-6840-48d2-a0ba-d9b6efbe8b85	  another steaming pile of politically correct crap to make sure the men and women continue to "work" and go in and out of the vagina to make more babies to send to more boring schools. but then again how can you retire and be in a diaper unless you've made enough speeches and paid enough taxes first? since I am above it all I officially declare myself God. the only one higher than me is the sun	0

0a06cf53-96cf-493f-8478-08afc48ebe24	  The concept and presentation are inventive and fun but the story is ultimately quite shallow. It's a fairly enjoyable entry for Pixar but it doesn't feel like it reached its full potential. Unfortunately the humour is lacking and even the emotional impact isn't as great as one might hope. But ignoring these minor irks, I found myself entertained by Inside Out's whimsy and charm.	1
e581b061-9cfb-4c50-987f-009a2cc6856a	  This movie was really funny and very creative too, and lots of scenes made me laugh and cry, but the story was the same concept Pixar movies did before WALL-E and to me it just made me left disappointed about it.	1

c92874c4-faa2-4a03-96c8-bdcc44b4d7cb	  An infuratingly flawed piece of animated cinema that is universally liked. With an idea that is perhaps the best in the Pixar canon, it is a shame that things don't add up or are not thought through properly. It is also a shame that I would have prefered a movie of Riley and her troubles moving to a new home, as that is the most subtle thing about the whole movie. This movie is loud and clunky and it amazes me how well it is has managed to sway people. This particular story has so many things wrong with the engineering of its narrative construction that to dissect it all would ruin anybody from watching it on a first viewing. Let's just say that the five main characters do not evolve (or at least not as many as you'd want) in any pleasing way and three of them do not become more than their stock character. Everything that happens inside Riley is bombastic and theres a character ripe for a twister or a villain but the creators of this film are too short sighted to see it. The animation and character design and Riley's company are all that I liked about this. The very end credits are amusing too but surely they were done with that when they released Finding Nemo.	0
1e997662-c8f4-4966-956a-4b0eecefb801	  I had such high hopes for this movie... As it was, the concept was really cool, but the plot was severely lacking. The effort it took to establish the "world" made it so that what was actually going on in the real story was super boring. Also, I'm not sure that the main character should have been 11 years old. This should have been a movie aimed at younger children who are just figuring out what emotions are. My 2-year-old repeatedly said to me, "This is boring. I want to watch something else!" Sadly, I had to agree.	1

b42ca75f-2fb2-4382-b519-fb6f2bd248c6	  What a disappointing film.As the film follows the theme of proving the importance of sadness in developing a rounded personality, it puts some of the characters into some very dark places and prolonged periods of stress that will upset many of the children who go to see it. This should not have been rated as a "U". I know it could easily upset my own daughter and this DVD will be hitting the charity shop first.From an adult point of view, it has it's funny moments (virtually all of which are available FOC in the online trailers). Buying the film and sitting through the whole 91 minutes provides very few additional laughs.The story itself it mostly fairly dull, with very little in the way of a finale, while it was almost impossible to relate to, or even care about, the main characters in the film.A very rare dud from Pixar.	0
0b943837-f5f1-4736-ad62-59d2262f14c5	  Here's this movie in a nutshell: A young girl gets sad and upset cuz she and her parents had to move to San Francisco. And then she decides San Francisco isn't all that bad.That's it. That's the movie. And the story is told thru some cute characters who represent the girl's different emotions (Sadness, Joy, etc.) Sometimes I wonder if I watched a different version of the movie than the rest of those who stumble over themselves to heap praise on it. That's certainly the case here. Sometimes animated feature films are written to appeal to 8 year olds, and other times they are written to appeal to a wider audience, including adults. In this case it was written solely for 8 year olds. She attends a new school and has to stand in front of the class and tell them about herself. So, you guessed it, Fear takes over as she stands up, then Joy tries to overcome and get her excited to talk to the class, then she sees the kids staring and gets fearful, and so on. That's the movie. You watch the emotion characters inside her brain dealing with events in her life as she moves to a new city. Now I suppose if you really enjoy the cute little emotion characters then the movie is okay. But otherwise there's nothing here. No story, no tension, no really funny moments. And the characters are the definition of predictable. Geez, let me see...what will "Sadness" say? Hmmm...I could only stand 1/2 hour and ended it. Terrible. UPDATE: I forced myself to watch the entire thing. Yeah, it sucked. Joy and Sadness spend most of the movie trying to get back to "headquarters", and in the end Riley decides San Francisco isn't all that bad. Yeah, this sucked.	0
eef27d30-d552-4d13-b5e0-ec1aead2320c	  Awful movie. Boring. Not a comedy. It's mostly sadness. The only emotion it provoked was a desire to throw the "sadness" character over the edge into the lost memory abyss.	0

I would imagine most kids will find this film a sleeper, as in they're going to nod off, or worse for a parent, they're going to get restless. An ending does not a movie make.	1

I just wasn't as engaged with this movie as I have been with other Pixar ventures. The animation is fabulous, though, and my kids seemed to really enjoy this movie.

f8455e87-4de7-42a1-bed5-8bb613fd7baa	  I can see why this movie has gotten a lot of good reviews, but I wouldn't put it up high on a pedestal like some people have. The 'emotions' make for interesting characters, which is the main reason this movie was amusing(good voice casting too). Still, it's not without its flaws. I left with more questions than anything and I felt like a lot of this made things up along as it went just to continue the plot, but it is a kids movie I suppose. Entertaining and no annoying singing(save for that gum commercial jingle, but it was used in a funny way so no bad marks for that).	1
bfdfbb3f-35d4-44b3-9d45-7a540072311b	  The movie is not the emotional gut-punch or the technical marvel I was told it to be. It seems to get too much praise for being a downbeat, mature story only translated into an animated movie for kids, though it can and should be enjoyed by people of all ages. I suppose my disappointment stems from the fact that the powers that be that created the emotional system inside everyone's head created a stupidly flawed world that not only puts the emotions (and thus the person) in danger, but also hopes to circumvent any logic gaps that might occur, granted though that this little world inside people's head is made from scratch, but set up for failure from the start.	1
9718bc0b-310a-4e86-922d-cdd3427f5306	  i enjoyed the ideas and i enjoyed the concept but i couldn't get into the plot. the character's emotions run away with her because she moved one time when she was a child? someone whose mother died and had to move from foster home to foster home takes absolutely no pity on someone who merely had to move to a different place. as well as running away simply because of that. boo hoo! you have a loving family and you go off on your shit. so privileged and i didn't appreciate it. the concept is great but the plot of the little girl certainly makes this movie scream #firstworldproblems because nobody who has actually had real struggles in their life would feel that bad for the child. now, in my defense considering it seems like i'm bashing this fictional little girl, i do understand that she was upset for moving, but if you want someone to feel for the character, something besides the insult of moving would do the trick.	1
d0d9f42f-4bed-47b9-9567-3508ff0b3ace	  It was ok at best. The animation was fantastic although the human characters look a little wonky depending on their facial expressions. The movies main errors come from the relationship between the emotion characters and their human host. Cheesy dialogue is present everywhere due to the fact that the emotions just kind of react to whatever their host does whenever they are in the "Control room" the brain. So in other words, there is a whole lot of "Wow!" and "Oooooooohhh" reactions from the emotions the whole time, which does get annoying. There are also too many plot conveniences and plot holes, but you can youtube those if you want to hear about them. Is this movies concept original? No, but well executed for the most part. All in all, it is much better than "Frozen" and worth a watch to formulate your own opinion.	1

0b709d2d-c5eb-4a01-a3fe-aee185149ee4	  All the praise made me think this would surely be another Disney Pixar classic enjoyed by both children and adults. Personally I don't see great appeal here for older viewers. Using personification of key emotions such as joy and sadness to provide commentary on a young girl's childhood is a strong concept but it eventually becomes mind numbing to mature eyes when the script, characters, humour and design are all heavily geared towards kids.	0
c2b52ac6-709d-41a9-83e0-dc802989f83b	  Severely overrated, it's a good movie, but way too blatant in its attempts at forcing tears out of the viewer. Not to mention that the whole premise is entirely unoriginal. Too many sappy and cringe-worthy moments. I think the only reason people are rating this movie so highly is because we're all so desperate to see Pixar make a comeback, but I'm sorry, this is not it.	1

It doesn't quite go far enough though, and the storyline is perhaps at risk of confusing younger audiences. I can't see it going down as a classic.	0

Some forseeable action happenes, sometimes the pace gets way too slow.

All in all, the movie is a nice cartoon for young and all but I would rather recommend to watch it on dvd than in a cinema.	1

927a1747-fe94-4e31-8dae-f2ef99cee6bc	  Well that was disappointing. My high expectations for this movie were kicked in the crotch. It lacked substance, like it was missing vital organs. Sure it was cute, but not as cute as I had hoped. It was funny at times. But parts were really Disney cliche and generic, plus I had to ignore the character issues and plot holes. I like human psychology (not that this movie was clever, but its simplicity I guess was for the child audience), but this was meh. Too bad, cuz I really wanted to love it. I wanted to feel, to cry, but I was let down. 6.5/10	1

452c01e7-2d65-42ff-a959-6e5af4ff18d8	  A brilliant idea that shines for the first few minutes and gradually dies out for the rest of the film due to the lack of animation creativity and deep script, hmmm, this sounds familiar to me. Ah yes, "Up" - a profoundly creative and emotional ... short film of first-ten-minutes coupled with an utterly boring full length animation that follows. They might share the same director, right? Bingo! Indeed "Inside Out" has a very good premise - the simplification of human's feelings and thinkings into some distinctive factors, but its execution is somehow boring, full of clich�s, repetitive scripts, few emotional moments that were dwarfed by the same monotonous set-pieces like "Monsters, Inc." (which was directed by, obviously, the same director). A human mind is always something fascinating, but its depiction here in "Inside Out" is disappointing with not much creativity put into its vast boring emptiness of a landscape. Basically the film has no "villain", but the poorly-developed characters themselves are already villains to the audience - why does Joy (should have been "Optimism") always lead instead of Sadness (should have been "Pessimism"), given the psychological fact that sadness is, in most case, the most memorable feelings in our memory? Why does Disgust need to be here, given another psychological fact that it is way less important in our mind than, let's say, imagination, creativity, or especially desire? And why in the world do emotions prevail reasons in controlling our everyday life? The simplification of the mind is acceptable if it brings out a clear, coherent, and fascinating "inside out" portrait of our mind, our emotions. But if such simplification only induces misunderstanding and incoherence, than it is simply a failed effort. I understand that the journey of Joy, Sadness et al. is only an euphemistic depiction of the changes in the mind of a coming-of-age girl in new situation, but her emotional journey is disappointingly uneventful and thus could not bring any weight to her "inside journey". Still, the film is very OK as an entertaining piece, but its lack of creativity and caring execution is unforgivable. It will be very sad if this film wins another Oscar for Peter Docter, such winning only gives way for more unimaginative animations and a poorer taste by the audience.	1

b11bcff6-4cdc-4c0a-881a-333bf2549b35	  I'm yet to see a Pixar film that I haven't enjoyed, and Inside Out continued that tradition. My hopes may have been a little too high heading into this one, as even though it was a good film, it definitely fell short of some of their previous classics. I foolishly expected it to go a little bit darker into Riley's emotional state, but it still touched on some themes that are important for kids (and adults) to see and understand.	1

a9ac5150-e3d5-478d-9888-2cc912530ce7	  Very disappointing compared to Pixars other work, or even other big animation studios like Dreamworks' recent films. This film just takes one of the first rules or filmmaking (Show, Dont Tell) and slaps it right in the face. There's so much exposition spat at you that within the first 10 or 15 minutes, you can form the entire plot, character arcs and twists straight away. The design here is lacking the immagination or other Pixar movies and is nowhere near the level of eye-candy we've some to expect from animated features. The story felt forced, and I found it difficult to give a damn about any of the characters, the main two are downright boring/irritating/unlikeable. Side characters are great though, making it tolerable, and were animated really well, but the film lacked substance and heart of other Pixar films. There were a few gags in here that made me laugh, but mostly I was rolling my eyes in frustration at plot-holes and those horrible "golf-clap" moments. Definitely one you can buy on DVD and play for you 5-year-olds on a loop to keep them busy with purdy colours, but far from films that anyone of teenage and up would enjoy (Like pretty much all of their other films) Hard to beleive this comes from the guy who made Monsters Inc. and Up,	1

e8f29882-4779-401b-ba79-eb5dfbe67a13	  I actually saw this movie several weeks ago. I just haven't been able to come up with a lot of in depth things to say about it; at least not enthusiastically. This seems to happen to me a couple of times a year. A highly anticipated movie starts generating a lot of buzz with critical acclaim and with great word of mouth which gets me pumped to see it. I then see it; I like it, but don't love it. Skyfall, Captain America 2, Lego Movie, and now Inside Out.I've never been a die-hard Pixar fan. I do really like most of their stuff, but they've clearly seen better days. It seems since Toy Story 3, Pixar has been in a slump. We got a sequel nobody wanted (Cars 2), a prequel nobody wanted (Monsters University), and a creatively bankrupt bait n' switch (Brave). Don't get me wrong, Inside Out is a good solid movie that has a lot going for it and it is a step in the right direction for Pixar.Inside Out's premise is very intriguing. A young girl named Riley whose emotions are manifested within her mind as real characters: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. These characters collectively represent Riley as a person as they each play a role in her life and upbringing. As she gets older and goes through life-changing situations, her emotions become conflicted and at odds with each other. This is easily the deepest, most complex movie Pixar has ever conceived. Although not at all an ORIGINAL concept, it is still very creative and thought provoking. Everything going on in the mind is visually represented here. Core memories, the Train of Thought, memory dumps and many many others. It's very clear really smart people worked on this story and they go straight for the jugular on its emotional impact. This is a movie everybody can relate to and I will admit, I got a bit teary-eyed toward the end during a final moment between Riley and her parents.So why aren't I over the moon about this movie? It's very creative, beautifully animated, and is universally relatable. For me, Inside Out is so deep, so mature, so... emotional that it often forgets to have fun. Oh, there are fun moments, but they are completely drowned out by the heaviness of Riley's increasingly chaotic inner thoughts. I can't remember the last time I've seen so much crying in a movie. It just wasn't very pleasant to watch at times because the movie rarely ever takes a break to lighten up the mood which can make it seem dull at times. When I watch a Pixar film, I expect to be entertained as well as emotionally moved and Inside Out just didn't do enough entertaining for me to fully love it.Inside Out is a respectable step in the right direction for Pixar, but I still don't think they're fully "back" yet. I did enjoy it and I'm sure most others will too.	1

df4f1188-6a65-42ac-bff4-1b6770e14e35	  Riley, 11, a girl with an astonishingly limited range of emotions (joy, fear, sadness and anger) has to endure the terrible hardship of relocating to San Francisco from Minnesota and loses her shit. And then (of course) finds it again - by rehabilitating sadness because sometimes, Sadness Can Be Good. Sentimental skit, no that's not a typo, based on the premise that Joy, and her handmaiden happiness, constitute the fundamental human condition. This is of course a truth we hold to be self-evident, and therefore cannot be disproved - like by actual evidence. Best moment comes at the end (no, not for that reason) when the conceit that humans are driven by four simple emotions operating a console that becomes upgraded as we grow up (i.e, the apps get cleverer but the operator doesn't), is extended to other characters, including (best of all) a street cat (no, not that sort, an actual cat).	1

But, for me, the journey of Joy and Sadness was much too long, and a bit boring. I started eagerly hoping we'd "get back to headquarters" - maybe even more than the characters were! Still, it's a fun, family movie and the end, with all the peeks into various brains, was great!p.s. - The short film before, "Lava", was so wonderful! Flat out wonderful!	1
aec3c7f9-1355-4653-84a4-4ebbea77bc17	  So... You want to watch Inside Out? Let me answer that question for you - no you don't. Think of it as a culmination of all the worst films you've already watched with a sprinkling of your worst fears. I'm talking clowns for all you party virgins out there. I don't think I could possibly put into words how terrible this film is. I spent about half of the film with my fist in my mouth trying to prevent myself from either screaming at the screen or just laughing tears of despair and frustration. Sadness (an extremely sad, depressed emotion living in the pits of Riley's brain) is probably the most unfortunate character one could ever have the misfortune to turn their nose up to. Think of her as the offspring of the annoying little kid from UP who everyone seems to pity because of his lack of a brain or any form of common sense and Jack Frost from Rise of the Guardians - or, even better, the disastrous result of a cruel sexual experiment between Justin Bieber and Susan Boyle. And that's putting it lightly.I can only begin to imagine the sheer temptation to throw her over the edge and into that pit of forgotten memories. How Joy managed to refrain from doing so I cannot comprehend.I would like to end this review by saying NO. Just NO. This film is one big disappointment and left me feeling, quite frankly, like a deflated walrus.Do not put yourself through an hour and 40 minutes of this. It's not worth the �7.70 you spent on it.	0
0001cc5c-6d99-4532-9a62-1e417964e87e	  Well only one word came out of this movie for me. Mental Health. Well two. hahaah. I found the movie very heartwarming. The plot very confusing, but basically all over the place. I said to a staff member who has seen the movie, whom I know well, that you'd have to have a very good mental health ie not depressed etc., etc., You'd have to be very mentally strong. A girl Riley(Dias) moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. However her emotions are played upon. Emotions being Joy(Poehler), Sadness(Smith), Fear(Hader) Disgust(Kaling) and Anger(Black). Sadness keeps interfering with the Memories and the Core memories. And hence Joy and Sadness somehow get out of teh HQ, so they meet up with Bing Bong(Kind) and have many an adventures. So overall, not the best movie from PIxar. However I can sense a sequiel thou. So lets hope that'll be better. hahah	1
4632be0a-f43c-44d6-923d-914da58fdc46	  I didn't think that this movie lived up to the 98 percent score and critical acclaim that it got. While it was a fun and fresh story by Disney, it wasn't Frozen, Toy Story or one of the other Disney heavyweights. A definite renter especially for those with children, but I'd temper expectations a bit.	1
a583158f-7db4-42b2-9fa4-5fa12d10abf9	  I admire Martin Luther King, very much. I have watched many such films, movies and made for television, and, this is the most disappointing, boring take on telling his tale that I have ever encountered. However, I read, in an article, that Oprah Winfrey starred in this movie and she was not in it, when it was rented from Red Box. And, the thing that I saw was so boring that there is no way 86 percent of anyone would like it, ever. So, that does make me wonder what they saw versus what was released in other places. That sort of shenanigans happens, you know?	0
03054495-cada-43a1-96cc-e929005da769	  I'm giving Selma a bad review for one reason. It's blatantly and unapologetically historically inaccurate. This is a Hollywood trend that seems to be hitting biopics and period pieces really hard, and that is if there is something about a true story you don't like just change it to make your movie better.The movie falsely portrays President Lyndon B. Johnson as an enemy of MLK, going as far as using the FBI to discredit him. In reality this couldn't be farther from the truth. Selma was LBJ's idea, he considered the Voting Rights Act his greatest legislative achievement, he viewed King as an essential partner in getting it enacted, and he didn't use the FBI to disparage him. Did they really need to create lies in order to tell MLK's story? No, it's already good enough in full truth.	0
e0f5f8f6-98ef-46ad-ac34-6456fc8d8fbb	  I was not impressed with Selma overall. I honestly expected a bit more from the film and instead ended up watching every other Martin Luther King movie ever.Now this movie does have a few things going for itAn amazing soundtrack- One that really goes with the impact of the story A few deep and emotionally gripping scenes. Yes there really powerful in many ways.However we have seen these emotional scenes before and for a Oscar caliber movie it didn't bring anything new in the way 12 Years a Slave did. it kinda just felt like the Oscars wanted a 'black lead' film to be in the running so they said....Selma.. there happy.But I am not happy and really don't think this is a Oscar caliber film at all.I never got into the actor playing MLK. David Oyelwow just didn't capture me. I also think Ava needs more time to become a better director and don't get some first time writer in the chair as well, because it did not go all that great as far the story was concerned.There are just other movies that do Martin more justice-Our friend, Martin - Bringing King to ChinaThis film also had many chances to go deeper and darker with Martin Luther King, but instead it runs away and tries to play it all safe.Overall there is some good here, and if this is your kids first look at Martin Luther King then hey let him watch it, but I have seen too many Martin Luther King documentaries and movies and this just doesn't do it for me.	0
051751de-86ca-4df6-b902-4bf1d0d4dd36	  Good movie although I had the feeling at the end that it really missed something. Anyway outstanding work from Davdi Oyelowo and Carmen Ejogo too!!	1

e12eeb83-7316-41cb-bc76-7150b2eb5a8d	  Very good film with strong performances, and perhaps it should be beyond criticism considering its historical importance, but Selma doesn't rise to the level of greatness that it perhaps deserves, nor manages to surprise, but keeps strictly within conventional boundaries.	1

f1148301-1d5b-4d0f-9476-708690e10265	  I enjoy how the movie portrays conservatives as racist, yet every racist player or politician in the movie was a democrat.	1
e3baff1e-e8b2-4dd1-b4ae-019de7ea11e1	  This drama is interesting from an historical perspective. It contains good solid performances with few surprises. But I wasn't able to connect emotionally and found Oyelowo to be uninspiring, except for when he was giving a speech. AAN	1
5e250ae9-a0d0-4e0e-a0cd-f9bc54950639	  A powerful subject that resonates strongly with the present. However, it is far from being the cinematographic masterpiece that I was expecting, given the reviews. It is a textbook biopic. Not that there is anything wrong with that.	1
06c0d1e2-511e-4a1d-bf7b-5704cd4b4c1d	  People were upset at the 2015 Oscars that this movie didn't get recognition in certain categories, making it seem as if the Academy was discriminating. I disagree with this disappointment as I didn't see greatness in this movie.Selma was a slow movie for me, but it had a lot of allusions and historical figures to make for a good movie for history buffs. The movie had an aura of significance throughout, but it wasn't necessarily intriguing to me. The film's focus is on a short segment of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life, specifically the march from Selma to Montgomery (I believe) to protest the suppression of African Americans' right to vote.The film was only mediocre. Firstly, I did not think David Oyelowo played a good MLK Jr. Secondly the film seemed to rush through interactions with historical figures instead of keeping them on for the ride. When they show Malcolm X in the film he is pronounced dead only a few scenes later. J. Edgar Hoover shows up once in the film even though he is mentioned on a few occasions.Nothing stood out for me regarding the overall aesthetic of the film which is why I call Selma mediocre at best. Everything seemed pretty typical - the direction, the cinematography, the editing had a slow pace to it, the acting - all fairly typical. With a boring movie I really don't have much to say, and this film bored me, but it was historically significant and still relevant to recent African American issues such as the riots in Ferguson.	1

93fd6480-7ccf-4382-9119-e87096060d5d	  What a disappointment. Facts ignored, history rewritten, and truths ignored. Much of this played like a Lifetime movie. This definitely did not deserve a best picture nomination.	1

3821d966-d6b9-4ffa-8f94-8ceb0fda1e9c	  Boring, makes things up. Democrats are cheering a movie where they show how black people have overcome the oppression of Democrats. The movie portrayed MLK as an opportunist, and not a great man. I was hoping this would have done a better job of portraying MLK, but it failed.	0

0fd0516c-5543-4418-a9be-309db106e21e	  I feel that people are in love with the true story of this movie more than the movie itself. Its story is a true one and the true story is indeed a fantastic story. However it does not translate well into a film. I think that because of the sociopolitcal themes covered in this movie, that people are rating it higher that what it should be. I was hoping for something truly touching, sad thing is one already knows how it ends. I feel that a full documentary of Dr. King would have been better than a story of one town and its political push as Dr. King did much more than what is shown here. It has just been a current trend for the academy in recent years to reward movies with "racial" themes. I think this movie is overrated and I feel dead asleep for like 20 or 30 minutes. When I awoke I heard at least two other people somewhere behind me snoring.	0

f4ba8027-4ec6-4c98-bada-dac8aaa27fd1	  An adequate though uninspired depiction of the momentous events in Selma, Alabama in 1965. All films, even historical films, deserve some license to enhance the narrative. Ava DuVernay and Paul Webb have an odd relationship with the actual events in Selma and it detracts from the natural drama. Notwithstanding the wholesale misrepresentation of LBJ, the film also toys with the timeline of the actual events. The fact that LBJ had publicly announced his intent to pass the Voting Rights Act before the actual march on Montgomery, or that a federal judge had also ordered Alabama to end it's literary tests before the march aren't depicted even remotely accurately in the film. I'm bewildered as to why J. Edgar Hoover, whose intense animus for MLK led him to constantly torment Dr. King, is soft peddled as a mere loyal servant of the president. The reality is that Hoover was Kings primary foe and LBJ was very much a partner and ally in 1965 (they later fell out over MLK's anti-Vietnam stance). It was unnecessary and odd to transfer Hoovers enmity to LBJ. The cast is fine. David Oyelowo is a talented actor but, not for a second do I feel like I'm watching Dr. King. The film was hamstrung by the fact that Dreamworks owns the rights to Kings actual speeches and they had to be paraphrased/re-created in Selma. Oyelowo doesn't have Kings voice or cadence. Paul Webb has, frankly, done a poor job trying to replace the eloquence of Dr. Kings original words. MLK was famous primarily for his oratory. His speeches and delivery were transformative and without the powerful words and delivery, we are left with a very thin facsimile. The film hardly compares to the great Jeffrey Wrights masterful portrayal of a younger MLK in Clark Johnson's fantastic TV movie "Boycott". Wright captured MLK with a mesmerizing performance and Johnson did a far better job humanizing the real life hero's of the civil rights movement. Where "Selma" fails "Boycott" soars. I'm still waiting for someone to do justice to Dr. King on the big screen, until then check out "Boycott". Sadly "Selma" was adequate at best.	0
69a4976a-1b8a-42c3-8e3e-93698e05d49d	  I hate that I was so bored. This movie is about one of the greatest men in history, for Pete's sake! I hope this doesn't make me a terrible person...	0
f6b228d6-3e50-407a-8cec-fdb21b393a42	  The movie acts as if every black person during the movie's time setting was a well educated person. It also acted as if 99% of the white people in the movie were racist bigots who wanted to murder all the blacks. Neither of these were true. While it did a good job at portraying what had happened back in those times, it also gave an innacurate portrayal of the time's people as well.	1
314a319b-1013-4bdf-89d3-220bf71f0025	  I understand why DuVernay wasn't nominated for a Best Director Oscar after watching this. This was a good movie, neither bad nor great though, it had a strong cast with good performances, but it was done in a fairly dull and uninteresting way; lacking much passion, tension, or really much feeling albeit some short emotional moments here and there. A little better quality than a TV movie bio. Dr. King's story is a great one though and the actors did their parts well, but overall this was just an okay film.	1
18aaccc1-1f93-45a7-b0cd-27d1e7269a6e	  Brutal. Strong. Beautifully portrayed.	1
00f74533-22c6-4c0e-832c-4cd2d56c84f0	  A few scenes sprinkled in there to raise your blood to the boiling point followed by a too many with some back room mumblings of no real import. Many may not be willing to call a film dull when it has such a historical figure... I'm not one of them.	0
9ccf1930-8b07-4374-a5ec-fe58b6266c73	  Outstanding performances considering they were not allowed to use the real speeches of Martin Luther King. They absolutely pulled it off. Great historic tribute.	0
51618a0f-4a11-4cec-85df-741e614f9a16	  Well made, pretty much what you'd expect after watching the trailer. Racist white people are a bit too cartoony (even though maybe not far from reality). Brings nothing new to the table but the performances and direction make it very engaging.	1

b0e1e492-b5e3-409f-9412-bef74ba05964	  This movie was incredibly boring, especially given the ample source material. It was competently thrown together, with some pretty good performances. It certainly didn't live up to the extreme hype. I fell asleep on two different occasions trying to watch it, but made it through the third try. Not very good. Not bad enough to be good. meh.	0
d0bf6423-ee1e-4fe4-afa5-2e9863965835	  This movie blew hard! I can't believe it got such a praise. A two hour historic race card just wasn't my forte, I suppose. The fact that I'm not black and wasn't around during this time has nothing to do with why I found this movie so boring. It was a good story, but a really boring film. If you haven't seen it, wait until it's an "ABC World Premiere".	0
0c88bc56-0331-4274-be70-f6e59d7eb4bc	  All along I was thinking out loud- "F*ck the white people"Uneven, sometimes boring movie gets better and better towards the end. You will feel sad for the black people.	1
50a1a855-fb03-4755-93b9-69a650efc988	  It was a good movie. But not powerful enough. It was really slow, violence and too long... David Oyelowo was really Martin Luther King Jr. His performance was great and he needed to get Oscar nomination. But I was thinking like this, history of Martin Luther King Jr. was great. But his movie was not really great. I was really tired to watch it... Co-Executive Produced by Brad Pitt. Oscar winner for best song.	1
58f09a29-6355-4c84-9d2b-706411cf5528	  I kept wondering how much of the drama was fiction and how much was real. It's a good movie, but I wonder about it's historical accuracy.	1

30112cee-e554-4703-8b7a-a8df4d3c44fa	  Great performances, but there's nothing in this film that hasn't already been documented a million times before. Now, I know it's history and can't and shouldn't be changed, but I don't want that. I just would have liked to see something, some aspect of filmmaking, that made it stand out from every other MLK movie I've seen.	1

fdefe9f7-8d2d-4070-803d-9733746851b9	  Excellent lead acting, but the film doesn't have too much else going for it. It's choppy, the supporting performances leave much to be desired. The actor portraying LBJ is just hammy.	0

b64514d9-73c2-4950-87ea-11db23dda1f6	  There are some good things about Selma: Oyelowo's incredible performance combined with superb writing from Paul Webb make for a convincing portrayal of King, and the browny-red colour palette reflects the nature of racism. But the rest of the film is rather ordinary.	1
ad394a1b-c373-404a-8ec1-5c01217e052f	  David Oyelowo does a fantastic job, although the director's vision feels a bit muddled and the screenplay is a bit spotty. Outdoor photography is a standout but the interior shots are poorly lit and really took me out of the moment. Quibbles aside it's a decent movie.	1

5e11cd80-dc4d-41e9-a0a1-9aa1b62b79cd	  I didn't see any of the Oscar nominated films this year except Selma. I thought Selma had its moments but just wasn't a great film and had lots of problems -- poorly-written dialogue, a confusing crux, a lack of oratory, the best actors playing small parts, constricted camera shots, too much about the Kings' domestic conflict, too much about LBJ (he could have appeared just once or twice). It maybe attempts to be restrained but comes across as constricted and lacking the full range of affect and emotional depth. It doesn't even come close to a film like Spike Lee's 4 Little Girls, which was nominated in the past. Another film that comes to mind is Malcolm X, which is an excellent and masterful portrayal of a charismatic figure. The fact that King's family didn't endorse this film speaks volumes.	0
fa9808d9-589c-4877-b05e-eb05400554de	  Considering the subject matter, the film couldn't have been less inspiring. The film drags through its constant cliches without ever a moment of intensity of originality.	0

7dc0dce5-ea0b-4518-bcf4-f1600aee3b2e	  Oyelowo is great, no question, I just have a dislike towards movies dealing with specifically oppressed people as opposed to just oppressed in general. There were a handful of powerful scenes though that did resonate so if you dont have that same sensitivity, its worth watching.	1
00b675c4-cfe8-4029-ad3e-1c75bff79e50	  "Kinda of inspiring but still over rated".	1
d5828c7a-718d-4cdf-bce9-9095b35631ad	  If the civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 was half as drawn out and painstaking as "Selma", the movie that tells us about this moment in history, then it was certainly an epic test of endurance. I wanted so badly to like this movie because it is so well made, and perfectly acted, and it tries so hard to be honest and righteous, but it is so damned slow and plodding that I felt myself almost willing Luther King to triumph in his endeavours just so the film could end. The best parts of the movie are undoubtedly the magnificent speeches delivered by King which are now legend but if I wanted to hear these I would prefer listening to the actual recordings no matter how well David Oyelowo performs them. Only 3 out of 5 I'm afraid to say.	1
da62ee20-4671-4ccb-a537-67ed94d196a4	  I've said this many times about biopics based on significant historical figures... sometimes, a feature-length movie isn't enough to do their true-life character justice. Maybe producers should consider an HBO mini-series perhaps. Of course, having said that, there are exceptions to this. "Selma" serves as a great snapshot of the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr, but I'd have been keen to see a whole series highlighting more than just one part of the man's story. Oyelowo definitely delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.	1
f6b17e1c-80ad-430e-8690-3dacf2efc881	  If the Wikipedia website is right about M luther king then this movie is historically incorrect despite the fact it tries to pretend to give an eye to eye picture.Too long, too slow, certain scenes are just minutes of boring slow talk about peoples memories.Still it was good enough to be worth seeing but was pushing that limit very close to be too boring.	1
a082cc44-80c0-444f-8d92-04182d44d1ce	  *Ryan Shakes his head* Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. *And continues shaking it* Can I make a recommendation for your Oprah BookClub 2.0 March read? Yes? Ok I would suggest reading: Too Much Oprah: Oprah's Global Domination Overkill Who's it written by? Me. Yes yes yes, I knew that Selma was produced by two other production companies aside from Oprah's Harpo (jesus. even typing "Oprah" and "Harpo" in the same sentence exudes pretentiousness). But before watching Selma I mentally crossed my fingers and every other crossable body part hoping that Oprah wouldn't show her face in a movie she produced ( a la The Butler) Alas when she shows up in the second scene as one of the first shown black women trying to vote, that magical Make-A-Wish Foundation hope was obliterated. Thank Oprah-Almighty she only appears in like 4 other "Oh look it's Oprah again" scenes during Selma's 2 hr running time. My bigger issue surrounding Selma is related to the high-profiled or highly-celebritized people attached to film. Oprah; Tom Wilkinson (who actually did a decent job of playing President Lyndon B Johnson ), Giovanni Ribisi, Cuba Gooding Jr., Tim Roth, Martin Sheen and (pardon me why I ask the multiracial Gods of this universe WHY? For the love of WHY?) Common. Yes Common and John Legend do a powerful, get-off-that-pew-and-clap-your-heart-out synthesized performance of Glory (the film's only chance for an Oscar I feel). Played as the film closes, it backdrops Selma's final and most successful segment: the inclusion of real life, black and white news reals and camera shots of the actual march of Selma. But Common as an actor? Believable? Comm-on! No!! David Oyelowo does a valiant job at capturing the prestige yet keen fighting persistence of Martin Lurther King, Jr. Even if at times the ego in his portrayal feels somewhat inflated. There was one shocking moment where I gasped: the explosion of the church that kills the four girls. However after its initial quivering effect, it became one of many gratuitous stand alone scenes that was integrated into Selma as an incongruous scene purposely trying to sway the audience's feelings, perceptions and impressions to the film's subject material. Or at least that's how I felt by the finish of the film; a bit emotionally manipulated by director Ava DuVernay (first Hollywood wide release directorial debut) Even though it wasn't a "bad" movie, Selma was not a revolutionary movie I would put on any "best of" lists. Selma - along with American Sniper - feel like Patriotic historical pats-on-the-back flicks that got recognition not truly for it's material but for how they were produced and showcased. I would have more graciously enjoyed and appreciated watching a documentary on Martin Lurther King Jr's life rather than sitting through an all-star glamorized, Hollywood red-carpet engagement of it.	1
3013d55a-1cd1-4ed7-8675-817535c744a8	  It was good movie. I wouldn't go as far as to say it was a great movie, though.	1
7a4a58b2-2833-4371-a18b-eb3f98fc1a17	  Felt too many punches were pulled - esp. in MLK's relationship w/his wife - and the despicable bigot George Wallace should've been the main antagonist instead of splitting it with the flip-floppy LBJ.	1
46251eea-cfb9-4f38-862f-0198ab4c2632	  Exactly what we need. Another film from Hollywood about how America is still so racist. No thanks.	0
d60516a1-5a70-4952-a3c1-f4134de62a8f	  David Oyelowo is just amazing as King but th overall script is rather dry & a drag at points. Director Ava does bring history to life with great characterisation & meticulous precision to the events of that time.	1
bb56244b-8b25-4f04-8bc5-c44724b3e7fe	  It seems like a subject too serious for the factual and historical inaccuracies that dominate the film.	0
89db3990-6ed4-43f4-8c8f-21a08ec6a000	  A powerful movie in some ways, but in other ways it was powerfully slow. Weird directing and editing choices, but very well acted by a strong cast. But I do agree with the lack of acting Oscar nominations; they were good, but the other performances I've seen were just better.	1
8e759db3-ce4a-41f9-a5f8-4422f05fba96	  The film's high praise I fear is due to its reverential subject matter. David Oyelowo is quite good, but the characters never come alive. The film just sort of meanders to King's inevitable victory. Its depiction of LBJ is wildly inaccurate; its depiction of George Wallace fails to show why he opposed desegregation (it was a way to get votes). So he becomes simply a fool and a boogeyman, which dilutes his true evil. Not a terrible film, but many critics think they have to praise it or else look "racist" even if everything tells them this is a rather unremarkable movie.	1

Unfortunately there's not much room for the kind of characterization that would augment what is sure to become the presentation of the civil rights struggle in the south most relied upon by high school history teachers to show their students what it was like.	1

94001bb2-25e8-40a5-966e-c87b81b58bfe	  the first Selma bridge scene was superbly executed...but maybe i'm just getting desensitized to race-specific biopics that the Academy keeps rubbing in my face because this certainly was not bad by any means, but nothing to write home about either	1
7e1c73d0-1c40-4fa5-a2ea-453a3cfa2253	  Is a movie great just because the subject matter is important for all of us to see? To me not necessarily, and case in point the movie Selma. There are parts of this movie that are top notch. First off the acting is very good. David Oyelowo nails his performance of Dr. Martin Luther King, and much of the supporting cast is very good. I think Tom Wilkinson is at his best at President Johnson. So why only 3 stars you ask? The movie at times seem like they are stringing together many of King's top speeches, and his entire message and body of work into a small period of his life. While this movie is about his time in Selma, and planning the march from Selma to Montgomery, it feels like the filmmakers are trying to cram in as much history behind his entire civil rights movement as they can. I liked this movie, didn't love it. Oyelowo very well might when the Oscar for Best Actor as his work is excellent here. I just wish the writing and story movement were as excellent as his acting. It is a movie I believe we can all learn from and see.	1
20c86a97-7165-42eb-870f-1a1c14927fd0	  Let's start with the positives. I had heard from a local rag newspaper (The Boise Weekly) that Oyelowo's performance didn't match the vocal tone and pitch of MLK. Not sure what that means or how someone born after his death would gauge that but it isn't true. Oyelowo does not give a Best Actor performance but he delivers better then anyone else in Hollywood currently. I loved the speeches and I really can't think of anyone else who had both the look and attitude to pull of this role. The emotion of the movie is powerful. Selma really captures the horribly racist attitude of Alabama and the tangible ways in which that was expressed. I liked the supporting cast as well, with the exception of LBJ, who I will get to in a moment. Pretty good soundtrack, although I could imagine a more moving score. On the African-American side, relatively accurate portrayal historically as well. There was a nod to the affair rumors that surrounded King but the movie didn't make the mistake of giving rumors to much screentime or importance. But Selma is far from perfect and in fact, really takes a dive in the face of historical scrutiny. I am quite familiar with the LBJ presidency and Johnson's attitude towards the events of his time. Although his personal feelings may never be known, Johnson's public persona was strongly in support of King's movement, with the president going so far as to publicly bully Congress in order to see results. Portraying Johnson as a weak, indecisive and paranoid leader who stood in the grey in regards to racism is a leap that takes this movie from history to fiction. It would have been completely acceptable to portray Johnson as having to wrestle with some of these actions but the creators of Selma take one of the icons of the Democrat Party, African-Americans and the Civil Rights Movement and turn him into a weakling. To top it off, the movie blatantly ignores the fact that Johnson had the final march escorted by 2,000 soldiers, a move that stands as one of the most blatant government acts against racism since the Civil War. I would really like to say that the movie moves past this mistake, but it doesn't. Unlike other historical blunder movies (Fury being my top choice), Selma simply cannot overcome the weight of its mistakes. And the biggest question in my mind is the why. Johnson was never on the fence. He never did anything publicly to earn the ire of liberals, especially not with the 20/20 vision we have today. To attack him, of all people (Governor Wallace, the KKK and the town leaders are all people who could have been successfully deconstructed without an issue) seems counterproductive, especially in the current context and I think that this is a good indication of DuVernay's future as a director. On top of all of this, the LBJ character wasn't even a great choice and the final scenes of the movie seem to be an about face, as LBJ does what he did historically, in direct opposition to what an hour and half of film just told us. In truth, I think that movies like 12 Years A Slave and even Django Unchained do a better job of pushing for modern day civil rights reform. Selma was a mistake and is a failure to honor all of the dimensions of the story of that march.	1

02481195-c9c9-4cf5-9a99-44169437bbdc	  Superb acting. Major problem is that it rewrites history. While I am not a political liberal, the treatment of LBJ's character is 80% untrue. Those too young to remember will take this story line as fact. Too bad. LBJ was probably the greatest supporter of civil rights in out time.	0

06059f99-5a73-47ff-88a8-4998acf65b37	  It is obvious that the person who wrote this movie did not live during this time. POTUS Kennedy could not get civil rights legislation through congress. Much like the Tea Party today, the Dixiecrats of that time (legislators from the south) could block any legislation they chose not matter who was in control of congress. It was POTUS Johnson, as a Dixiecrat who was able to Jawbone then to pass civil rights legislation. He was the enemy he was portrayed in the movie. Not Worth the price of admission, if fact I left early.	1
015a14cc-2715-4962-b8d9-18fa310dc438	  The courageous and tremendous story of the significant and victorious march from Selma to Montgomery during the civil rights movement should have translated easily into an uplifting and remarkable film, but instead drags along with monotone, perfunctory performances. The one exception is Carmen Ejogo's portrayl of Coretta Scott King who captures more intensity and emotional impact in her powerful and soulful performance than the entirety of the film.Bottom line, this is a history lesson we should all know and remember, but you might find it more spiritedly told in an elementary school classroom. The story is a great one, the film not so much.	0
4d471564-b3a6-43f6-8b55-74a20824ff58	  Just for the record, LBJ never opposed voting rights, nor suggested the Voting Rights Act be postponed. In fact, he had already proposed it by the time King accepted his Noble. You can look it up. Just for the record.	1
77460cea-fc7d-4c38-8fa6-8f10b9c02ee7	  Another way over hyped flick. Nothing we didn't know already and you just went with the flow. It was like watching film you had seen already and throughout I just wanted to see Alan Parker's 'Mississippi Burning'. In saying that it is enjoyable and worth watching alone for the performances of Tim Roth as George Wallace, Tom Wilkinson as President Johnson and David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King, Jnr.	1
3aa6e266-f42d-430c-8f77-1ca975c7b17f	  I almost didn't like this one, just based on the fact that the dialogue here is mostly pretty boring to sit through. It does have some pretty inspiring things to say in this event of history and the performances here are all top notch. But as for being one of the top films of the year and something I one would want to sit through again, I would say no. This is the type that was made for history classes in school and not something to be marveled as a masterpiece of film itself as most critics would say. The soundtrack, I believe is what saved this movie and David Oyelowo's portrayal mostly. For those interested in the full story of what happened at Selma, I would recommend this to, otherwise it's more of a rental than anything.	1
ce37582a-7354-40fd-b5e0-c791f13b25bc	  SELMA is a movie about process, about the gruntwork and strategy and planning and procedure of staging a civil rights campaign, about how change is enacted through through careful swaying of public opinion and deliberate framing of a compelling narrative on TV screens and in newspapers around the country. In a similar way to Spielberg-Kushner's LINCOLN, it's thrilling to see a movie that gets at the practical political mechanics behind an easily romanticized revolution. But, for a movie about strategy and power dynamics to work, it needs, more than anything, the couple of things that hurts SELMA above all.The first of those is subtext. This is a movie almost entirely made up of people standing in rooms explaining what they are going to do. It's historical drama Christopher Nolan-style. It's a problem in the writing and it's a problem in the direction--nowhere is there an inventive variation on the dramatic dynamic to make things interesting. Contrast this with a film like LINCOLN, which is all about how people lie and cheat and make deals and barter and trade and wheel and deal. These are obviously two very different films about two very different sets of characters in two very different sets of circumstances, but it's that lack of subtext, that lack of dramatic layering that keeps the whole thing playing on one level. And, seemingly opposed to this, but actually tied directly to it is the second point...A driving sense of clarity. Clarity in the drama. Clarity in the objectives (both macro and micro) and in the tactics. In the obstacles. In the sense of cause and effect. In each character's particular motivations and where and why and how they clash in any given moment. Clarity in the timeline. Clarity in even something as basic and seemingly irrelevant as screen geography (I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie that crosses the line so frequently or so carelessly, and the lack of establishing shots in almost any scene only adds to the confusion--especially when much of the film plays out in a series of pretty nondescript rooms and curiously-framed, and coldly desaturated medium close-ups). When SELMA has this clarity, it is exciting and engaging--some of the conversations between Dr. King and President Johnson are among the highlights of the film precisely because the negotiation is so thoroughly grounded in such clearly articulated stakes (probably not coincidentally, this subplot is drawing some heat for taking some dramatic license with the events). The finale, aided by some actual documentary footage, is rousing and moving in the way it should be. But there are long stretches that do little to advance the story in actual story terms, content instead to reiterate the same dramatic beats without providing any further context or elaboration. The movie's ambitions are admirable, but it's never as smart as its subject matter, and the result is some often deflated drama. Still, this story is important, and continues to be discouragingly relevant in all kinds of ways. It's a story we need to hear, but I wish it was better told.	1
1539bf82-6ccd-4587-9614-e91cf8734054	  The first time a 99% movie on RT has let me down. It's pure sap: slow motion beatings, constant emotional monologues, with the whole made-for-TV inspirational aesthetic thing going on. Plus Oyelowo doesn't seem charismatic enough for the role. Someone needs to make a real MLK movie.	1
0d68c2cf-8201-41ab-88ed-ef9a067a14a3	  Oyelowo was very good in the lead role and the supporting cast did a good job. The movie overall was a good history lesson, however - it was very slow at times. Some of the more biopic drama with King's family just went on too long. People talking slowly and softly in dark rooms with dramatic lighting gets old after a while, just like it did in Million Dollar Baby.	1
0f6b9845-b761-41d8-af26-009080cc50ac	  Overrated and overhyped, Selma is a made for TV movie that has been given far more credit than it has earned. The real problem is that it is a well-acted slideshow of history, rather than a cohesive story. Monologues are the name of the game here and while I do enjoy a good monologue or two of self-awareness, here it just got annoying as it was hard to relate to characters who most of the time speak in monologues rather than as people.American History X did a much better job of exploring the themes of racism and hate while still maintaining a genuine (and very tragic) character story.	1
6449550e-8dac-4c45-9a34-fc7f20e78d12	  David Oyelowo gives an amazing performance as Dr King, but overall, Selma is a pretty average movie. Not bad, but not great.	1
a9071661-7722-4eea-aaef-be9ef78959cc	  This may step on a lot of toes, but I was not crazy about Selma. Granted, this is a movie that should have been made long ago, and coincided perfectly with the turmoil created by the police shootings; I was not impressed. The first half of the movie discussed the politics and legal wrangling involved in the march. I felt that Martin and Coretta's characters were underdeveloped, and needed more fleshing out. How did Martin's absence affect the children? Why did Coretta put up with the cheating? Okay, but not worth buzz.	1
7d17edf3-04b1-400b-b3fe-1a458527303c	  Oscars got it right...not a good movie. How can you have murder, politics, and racism seem so mundane? And rap music???? common, shameful. Not an exciting movie, not gripping, very underwhelming. Pacing bad, cinematography bad. No fire in the actors...Oprah was the best part of the movie, and the end where they tell you what happened to the characters.Watch "Malcom X" instead. Million times better and more information and better performances.	1
c7fd47c5-888c-4515-8117-75dc857d35fe	  Hum... Sometimes you read a true story and it is so moving you just can't imagine a movie doing it justice. Well, Clint Eastwood on American Sniper delivers brilliantly and Spike Lee on Malcolm X killed it. Why did the people who wanted to bring Selma to the big screen not call upon Spike Lee? What in the world where they thinking? I seriously thought this was another Angelina Jolie directed movie because it had the same look and feel as the butcher job that was done on another powerful story like Unbroken. I say redo, but please give the directing of these great stories to people that truly have a vision and skill to do the stories justice. Kinda mad cuz I love Martin Luther King.	0

39642213-8424-403a-958b-f2eacfb70d27	  "Selma" pieces together several scenes of monumental moments in American black civil rights history. The performances are no more than adequate and the characters are left undeveloped, leaving a disjointed film that's trying too hard to emulate a Best Picture instead of innovating enough to be one. The story itself, however, is so moving that it's almost impossible to not feel its emotional power.	1
7589b10c-ddf8-4d96-9e4b-21afb4249ee3	  I really wanted to like Selma, but it just missed the mark for me. For starters, very few of the characters were formally introduced, so their story or names for that matter weren't well known until the end of the movie when they flashed their names with a bio. Also, the police report-style text that came after some scenes really didn't seem to have much of a purpose or fit in with what was going on in the movie, and it wasn't ever explained why it was shown. Besides that, the movie was very slow-moving with a lot of awkward silence that just added to its longevity. Overall, Selma just didn't do justice to its important subject matter and it felt unfinished. It just needed a little more clarity and cohesion to be a good movie.	1
89cd97d5-abc9-4412-b2fa-9718a0775b2d	  I didn't love Selma though it was far from bad. The acting is fantastic, the story is very interesting, upsetting,and heartbreaking, and the look of the film is very well done (especially in the scenes regarding the bridge crossings). MLK's public speeches are generally quite powerful, but when it comes to the private meetings his words start to feel contradictory, wishy washy, and some ideas don't seem fully realized. These talks even start to feel stale at parts. And while it is a part of the film, MLK's family interaction is underdeveloped.And while the history behind Selma is important for every American to know about I just didn't think this film was all that great.And boy, do you really hate LBJ while watching this film. Well, until the scene with his sudden, random, uncharacteristic change of heart.	1
031a3715-eaf6-4bc5-863c-e157c4d051e0	  pedantic and over-long.clumsy. the main characters stutter-stepped their way through the picture. no flow, and no energy.the best scene was Johnson and Wallace's meeting.	1
c4ea8945-2c67-4d15-b8bc-5b9f0a664c89	  A solid MLK biopic driven by the performance of David Oyelowo. Though it's not until the very end that the gravity of the drama finally climaxes.	1
91534c0e-f680-4f0c-a985-64d00f360870	  It depresses me how many lies this movie tells and how poorly white people are portrayed. This movie is blatantly racist It rewrites history and casts any one other than black in a poor light. The people who made this should be ashamed.	0

dd4576de-eec3-4536-ab41-4ab483e0815c	  The movie just wasn't that good. I've been to Selma a dozen times...I've crossed the Bridge with students numerous times. Every time I go to the Bridge Crossing Jubilee (first weekend in March) I feel like I belong, this is where American democracy was born. Selma, Alabama is pivotal in American History. I love movies; good movies.. Maybe its because I've seen Eyes on the Prize a hundred times...but "Selma the movie" didn't move me the way I thought it might. It didn't have the depth that I wanted it to have. I didn't think it was a great movie; great material but an average movie. And that doesn't even include the LBJ controversy, which I don't really know enough about to have an informed opinion. I do believe the movie has brought awareness to a significant and fascinating story that many have no knowledge of... and that in itself is good. But a great motion picture it is not.	1

71d4e6dd-3d20-4080-8de6-6f68ccb74ec9	  It's all about the way things look. One can make something look a certain way and the masses will believe it because they don't want to take the time to view the truth. I don't want to discredit the man Martin Luther King Jr. for he is a man of greatness. Yet he was not perfect; he did make mistakes. However, this film shows him as a man of no fault. Ava DuVernay skips over the darker parts of his life in order to show MLK as a man with a clean slate. All this does is create a fiction. To present every caucasian in this film as evil does nothing but show ignorance. To be honest the message was clear from the beginning. If you don't know it yet just listen to the lyrics of Common's track during the credits. Destroying the truth is injustice in itself.	1
b8f927d7-5867-44bb-aa51-4a568785b6b1	  Boring, flat, slow, and with really no emotion which I feel is amazing considering the subject matter. I'm really blown away of the high percentage of people enjoying the movie. Do they feel guilty to not like it?	0
79cc9fe5-0f8a-4a12-b14a-ba5119f83866	  I'm not afraid to say I gave up on this film about half way through. Wilkinson and Roth aside the performances were dull, especially the lead who is one note and a far cry from the real MLK. But the writing is what kills this film, a string of screenwriting cliches and awful dialogue.	0
2c9b66cc-eb62-435b-81ec-c0be85aa13f4	  A languorous look at Dr. King's life and legacy, encapsulated in the events leading up to the march from Selma to Montgomery. There are highlights: David Oyelowo's performance in the lead role, and Stephan James' turn as civil rights icon John Lewis were both moving. Carmen Ejogo also infuses Coretta Scott King with a quiet dignity. But the pace is slow and the call to peaceful resistance feels passive, despite dialogue telling you that just the opposite is true. The message of the film is unassailable, but the vessel - the film itself -- is imperfect.	1
9234c1a3-e6d6-4c83-83b4-69303d673e29	  Moving film that often falls short in the telling of such a historic event. Good, but far from great.	1
bc4ef6c5-275a-4afd-a069-c1d1c0097dcd	  A good film but a bit underwhelming. The actor chosen to play Dr. King sure resembles him but has the charisma of cardboard nor does he even remotely sound like him. Was there no African-American actors available to play MLK, they had to choose a Brit? They also made the mistake of choosing a director with such little big screen experience. Her last directing experience was an episode of Scandal and it showed. This film lacked the pacing and storytelling it takes for a 2 hour film. The supporting cast was superb which also made the role of MLK seem even smaller in comparison. Good film, but missed the point to expand further on fight for voting rights in Selma.	1
de672cd5-c19a-4f4c-9f51-26391b5fd1ff	  There's been a lot of talk about the Oscar snubs for Selma. It only got a 'Best Picture' and a 'Best Song' nomination but failed to get nominated in any other category.Now I won't deny that there's a 'soft' kind of racism at play here, combined with an unfortunate release date and a bad Oscar campaign. But did 'Selma' really deserve to be nominated in other categories? Well, let's see.First of all: Selma is a hard watch. It doesn't shy away from showing you the awful truth. I often flinched and felt my stomach turn in disgust while watching the atrocities on screen. So far so good - but in between those poignant moments the movie struggles to hold your attention. And yes, that is largely due to a screenplay that's never more than just 'ok'.Another Oscar snub was for Ava Duvernay, the director, a black female. She would've been the first black female to be nominated for a 'Best Director' statue. But to be quite frank: visually the movie is no '12 Years a Slave'. It's decently directed but nothing ever pops the way it should and again the small moments are never noteworthy.Is 'Selma' an important film? Yes. Why? Because Oscars are political. Period. Therefore it is important for a film with this message to be included in the race. Does it deserve to win or did it deserve to get nominated in other categories? No. Because in spite of its important and powerful message, the film as a whole doesn't have the qualities of an Oscar winner. It's a good film but it fails to be as great as its real life subject.	1
9c44b92f-3ce2-488d-afd3-eb16385f20b9	  Another movie about Martin Luther King and his struggle. Nothing stood out about this movie compared to every other movie ever made about the movement or his life. "Mississippi Burning" was a much better movie, and it didn't get the ratings this one did. This was more like watching a documentary than anything.	1
086f6c0b-e291-4f15-a137-42f1ca5f6e5e	  I wanted to see more organizing of the protests and training of the protesters. I also wanted to get to know the organizers and participants better as people. It's not that I didn't like the glimpses into King's personal life and struggles, but it took away focus from what is presumably the focus of the film: the behind-the-scenes of those protests, and peaceful protests in general. The actors were good, especially King. I wish also that they had used less slow motion. It made the scenes seem more movie-like as opposed to realistic and visceral.	1
dd5ebcd1-3b26-443e-b3bf-080176229f36	  Oyelowo gives an impressive showcase performance as MLK. Despite some occasionally nice artistic flourishes and a modern, pop beat, most of the rest of the movie seems small. Almost all key non-black characters in the gov't. are also negatively portrayed making the film too literally black vs white . The actual story was strong enough on its own and should have been left to stand unaltered.	1

6e34115c-51b5-4d8c-bf16-912738317509	  Selma thrives and flourishes thanks to a star making performance from David Oyelowo, terrific authentic production design and shockingly realistic scenes of police brutality. However, it pains me to say that due to bad pacing and a stretched run time - I felt myself struggle to reach the end of the march. Tim Roth, Wendell Pierce and Tom Wilkinson give impressive supporting turns that keep the film afloat and I was also impressed by the candid take on MLK Jr.'s private life regarding his affairs that has often been swept under the rug regarding his cinematic manifestations. Other problems arise as producer, Oprah, feels she has to act in the film and pops up sporadically as a glorified extra which makes for distracting viewing. Some odd music cues, stale direction and uncertainty to the story it wants to tell; Selma is the most mediocre of the Best Picture nominees this year at the Academy Awards. Nevertheless, if you are not well versed in the history of the civil rights movement, this film could be a nice eye-opener to the plight and struggle of African Americans during the 60's	1

f91634c0-a259-4503-828f-94a341b67769	  Although Selma is worth seeing for its historical perspective, I found that the directing was weak. While trying to squeeze out every last drop of emotive acting from David Oyelowo, Director Ava DuVernays failed. I found my self losing interest in scenes before their conclusion: like watching a movie in slow motion. I thoroughly enjoyed the performance of Carmen Ejogo who portrayed a very lifelike Coretta King.	1

dfad7f31-25e3-4684-a8f9-ae5ae6fe2af7	  3 out of 5 stars. An earnest and noble portrait of Dr. King, with a terrific performance by David Oyelowo, but the film has technical errors that keep it from being as great as it wants to be. As with many other biopics of people this year, specifically Stephen Hawking in "Theory of Everything," and Alan Turing in "The Imitation Game," "Selma" also wants to not offend anyone with its selective biographical memory. All three films seem to deify their subjects, which keeps them from seeming human, ignoring flaws or unlikeable character traits, which could mar the films' intent. "Selma" is well written, selecting a 2 month period in King's life, instead of trying to incorporate all his accomplishments, which would need an 8 hour canvas at least. While the film is interesting and well acted, it's unwavering tone of "historic importance" sometimes drags and is less entertainment than historic document that wants to be a school staple for future generations to examine as good for them. King's infidelity is only hinted at for example, in an otherwise hermetically sealed portrait of harmonious marriage. What is more troublesome is the cinematography and editing, which continually jump "the line," and seem low budget, almost amateurish. It's unfortunate, because so much of the film is really well done, especially the acting. "Selma" is as polemical by omission as "American Sniper," but the technical work is far less accomplished.	1
aca44e4e-3284-4576-ba68-19fb23b8742d	  Predicted winner if 10 MILLION Oscars, because it's about a BLACK man giving a BLACK speech to BLACK people about BLACK people. No surprise that all the 'critics' are giving it top ratings, to cover their sorry politically-correct butts. BONUS: watch for white people to be portrayed as 2-dimensional cardboard cutout bad guys, while the Anointed One (no, not Obama this time) swoops in on his flaming chariot to saaaaave the oppressed from the clutches of eeeeevil crackers.	0
9ee3ad1a-ea1a-4171-ba4e-938e12d5005d	  LOL, What a load of chit. 99% critic rating? Really, 99%. This is why the media any ANY media outlet cannot be trusted. You can't get 99% agreement by critics for even the best movies, but let that movie be about black civil rights, or gay rights, and suddenly 99%.BS. 99% of the people could give a crap less about black civil rights history or gay civil rights history.	0

5637854e-ba78-4c39-aecd-87fae0257b9a	  It was an enightening movie to see. It brought tears in the scenes of brutality upon fellow human beings. Dr. Kings speeches were well done. But where it fell short for me was the scenes of LBJ (partial truths?) and some of Corretta King and her husbands interactions. I am sure she was far more passionate and likely less tearful than depicted. Had there been dates added of the key meetings with snippets from Correta's memories, it would have seemed more factual in total. It left me thinking it was a little disjointed and wondering what really happened behind the scenes. What parts are made up? I do believe the awfulness of it all ,as depicted on the bridge, and the wonderful moving speeches. The view of Dr. King was impressive and timely for the times we are living in. But while it is a very good movie, ultimately I felt it missed out on being outstanding because I am left with too many questions as to what really happened behind the scenes.	1

c42bc186-9fd9-4385-b17a-1114deb5ffd7	  I thought David Oyelowo did a good job playing Martin Luther King, Jr. He nailed that accent. The film overall is average. It's a boring story. There is nothing exciting about this movie.	1

954d0411-f340-4830-ae20-232c216d167f	  Preachy, historically inaccurate, over-dramatized and slooooow... however there was good acting by the two leads. I found the direction to be uneven and some characters stories not brought out enough. This movie could have been much better. There was more to tell. The movie did a very good job of making it feel like I was seeing the 1960's south. I went through the south as a kid and the sets were very well done. I like seeing historic films and pointing out the inaccuracies. The biggest one here is the treatment of President Johnson who was made into a racist. To big of an inaccuracy to forgive for me.	0

254c820e-8f84-40cd-bd8c-2f1361fd59a1	  After all the great reviews I was expecting a moving tale of the march from Selma to Montgomery. That is not what I got. The movie started out well...actually a masterful piece of insight and direction for the first scene. After that it went down hill. The actors playing Johnson and Wallace were ill suited for the role. The actor playing Dr. Martin Luther King, JR lacked the charisma of Dr. King. I remember Dr. King's speeches...I watched the events unfold. This movie did not do justice to either. It would have been better if the story would have been told from the point of view of a participant instead of the leader. And it would have been a hell of a lot better if Oprah Winfrey hadn't hogged scenes, bringing nothing to the story.	0
91117bec-f88a-4ee8-82e8-cae700ae1ade	  Massively overrated, but the kind of movie you feel like a racist if you don't like. Starts with a halt at the Nobel awards, recovers intermittently. Excellent performances all around. Distracting little mistakes like modern buildings and modern blacked-out billboards. Good enough but definitely not great.	1
dbe94368-8ef4-482a-85ce-8bb2c9583b8b	  There were parts of the movie that were emotionally gripping and the story needs to be told BUT there was at least a half hour that dragged on and on , making the audience restless. At times it was like watching paint dry....and for that reason it is very difficult to recommend seeing the movie.	0
d703de78-f3d8-4faf-8275-dbef8f86466e	  Probably the most overrated movie of 2014 in my opinion. The film can definitely be powerful at times and David Oyelowo is great as King but this movie just shows us what we already know and in an extremely dry fashion.	1

bb3189a8-7810-4ab4-a1f3-08ba9fb188ff	  Okay, this one's worthy of a few more sentences than normal. Yes, Oyelowo's performance as King shines through, even if it occasionally descends into the realm of caricature, but the screenplay undoes him at every term, unable to decide whether or not to focus on King the man or the events at Selma proper. It settles instead for a bizarre mixture of overwrought family drama, gratuitous violence, and ham-fisted political commentary, and none of it works at all. Though it has a handful of profoundly affecting moments, the vast majority of the film feels like it was written with a pen that somebody accidentally dropped into a sugar bowl. Characters constantly pander to the audience, speaking as if they know the future and generally behaving like the pawns of a writer more interested in scoring political points than writing believable dialogue. All-in-all, the film is the very definition of Oscar-bait: a safe, broadly-drawn drama that reveals exactly as much as a reading of the SCLC's Wikipedia page would, provided it was set to a stirring score.	1
5a676198-53ae-40ee-ada9-f396638e2d28	  Selma is a very good film about an historical episode that had huge consequences for the change and evolutions of laws in the 60's for African American people. wonderfully shot and acted, this film is a case study of the fight led by Dr. King and his followers to gain the right to vote like any other citizens. It's a smart film, with strong dialogues and a message of hope, pride and dignity crucial for times. The fight our ancestors drove to eradicate segregation and racism is still much needed today and once in a while a film such as Selma comes to remind us that a lot has been done but more, so much more need to be done to end the racial hatred still unfortunately present in our modern society.	1

d7501dea-3732-481b-a896-8f84be172a88	  NOT as REAL and INTERESTING as the real MLK. Go watch a documentary AND just like in general THE REAL PERSON IS 100X more powerful than ANY actor could portray AND you'll learn something. This is a WATERED DOWN MARTIN LUTHER KING and the worst part is they don't really capture the spirit of the era. Doubt me? Well tell me how many times you see this movie as I DOUBT you will see it more than once. AND in that case it IS NOT a great movie as great movies you see again and again and again. A case in point is the GREAT movie GANDHI that does capture the spirit of his era AND you learn something. AND the actor, Ben Kingsley captures Gandhi himself.	0
76adaadd-03ab-4562-8b6a-ee594115f2de	  The story can't help but be affecting - especially this year - but the film is barely a cut above "Movie-of-the-Week." Some scenes are effective, but it's wildly uneven, the script's a mess, and the performances are not nearly as good as guilt-ridden critics are saying. No doubt it will score beaucoup awards.	1
4507b671-e028-4176-a62d-147f65d6267a	  While it was a well intentioned effort at examining the dynamics and strong personalities behind the march to Selma and the subsequent signing of the Voting Rights Act, there were several intriguing threads that were glanced at, then left unexamined. Malcolm X's influence on Dr. King's movement was mentioned then left out of the conversation thereafter, as well as the first tentative displays of respect between the marchers and the State police when Dr. King refused to continue his second march after the troopers withdrew were ignored in the film. Understandably, when issues are so vast, the filmmakers have to decide what's relevant to the picture they are making and what is extraneous, but those two factors I felt left me feeling I was not given the whole story and I left the cinema unsatisfied.	1
86bd0e5b-14c2-4586-9489-cfbe9bbb2ce2	  The actors playing King and Johnson are perversely miscast, bsrly no resemblance either visually or vocally to their real life counterparts. The pace is glacial, the drama inert. It takes a lot of effort to turn one of the most dramatic moments in history into something this dull. Still, the story itself is so important, it still manages to hold the attention.	1
b5fc1b35-9945-4bf8-8a63-e2970d143ad5	  Really, really boring political/civil right film. Maybe the film is good (98% Rotten Tomatoes must be something), but to me this is nothing more than a tedious portrait of Martin Luther King, who was played by a passionate guy but without the necessary charisma of a born leader. Really, not my type of film, at all.	1
8a3be391-81d5-4ba3-ac39-274660b7802c	  Main characters are well acted and fleshed out. Everyone else is a cardboard caricature. I blame this on the monochromatic and overly simplistic script that gives us the story with almost no shades of gray.	1

9ab0163b-540a-412d-a1c6-ecfc2776978e	  Rey, a young smuggler, is thrust into a battle between the First Order and the resistance when she teams up with a storm trooper who suffered a crisis of conscience.The new entry into the Star Wars universe is profoundly derivative, essentially an updated retelling of A New Hope, and while ignoring the backstory about the First Order largely mutes the events of Return of the Jedi, the new characters are interesting enough that J.J. Abrams has successfully made me excited about the new installments, rather than cringing, as I did after The Phantom Menace. It's a fun, popcorn film, returning to its roots, and this isn't all bad, even if it fails to advance the scope of the original films.I especially like Daisy Ridley as Rey. Ridley gives Star Wars a feminist character, one whose hand should never be held and whose life isn't dependent on others, but the film doesn't allow Ridley to explore enough of the character because it withholds so much information in the name of suspense.Also, Star Wars as a series is based on the struggle between good and evil. In the original trilogy, we accepted the empire as evil and the rebellion as good - the bad guys had red light sabers and the good guys had green or blue light sabers. In the second trilogy, George Lucas bungled a political plot, which by necessity forced the film to explore intricacies of good and evil and descent into evil. Obviously that failed. In order to deal with the rise of the First Order, we needed a political plot, but yet the film disavowed itself of this responsibility, and as a result, the film's antagonists are hollow and the series doesn't hold together as a narrative whole. Star Wars has to get better at politics, not just for the sake of Episode VIII but for the continuity of the series as a whole.Overall, I liked this newest film if only because it manages to return the franchise to the rails; now if only Episode VIII can get the train moving again.	1
1ebb53e0-719c-492f-9f70-d1a468c69cf2	  I thought this is so over-hyped. I didn't feel that this was a new unique film. There was too much recreation and fan service of the the original film(s) and felt more like a nostalgia film rather than a new film. I wasn't impressed with Kylo Ren. I expected more out of the action sequences. I didn't feel I cared too much for the new characters. There was one emotional scene but other than that I didn't feel this film brought any new exciting things to the table.	1
65bcb5de-61fe-424e-bc7a-35ffba28b6ed	  I will never trust anymore Rottentomatoes for grading this movie 90%.... fuckers	0

329da4c4-52a0-4bf4-9ad6-ca5dd3e1b7fa	  Great for Hardcore Starwars fan's out there I'm sure. But I'm not a diehard fan so 3.5/5 for me. With a big budget, start director and all the resources possible, it still bugs me with the poor choices made by so many characters in the plot and how much this movies tries to play homage to Episode IV. Else it would easily have been a 4 to 4.5 in my books. Thank you Lucas for setting the bar so so low with the prequels.	1
d99365b5-21b2-4ba1-819d-bd307c406df0	  Possibly the worst star wars due to the infinitely recycled plot points, extensive plot holes, sappy music, a quarter of the movie with two characters staring at each other as the music swells, characters as tropes, and this ren girl being magically better at the force than one of the strongest dark force users in the universe without any training who can also fight without any training and who doesn't kill the main baddie because of a magical chasm that appears between the two just in time. Oh, and there's another death star that gets blown up again. Basically, just watch the original 3 again and you basically just watched this lazy cookie cutter movie. The only reason it isn't 0 stars is because it had great visual artists.	0
6f7fbb82-8d33-472d-8a09-5e26b4b03360	  Bad script. Story is a mixture of episode 4-6. Very bad casting (Kyle Reno is joke) and acting. Last scene with Luke Skywalker is like from bad 80s movies. CGI is not too impresive. I was very disapointed and not sure wha the hell happened bty JJA. I guess evil Mickey Mouse from Disney screwed the thing.	0

7bec9430-6f4d-4a9b-9e7d-481101b0dfa3	  Movie was at some points a rip off of "A New Hope" from the original trilogy. Made the plot line boring and predictable. I don't see how anyone who has watched the first movies could possibly rate this anything more than a one star. Not even close to being worth the ticket price in theater, or the price it is going to go for when it's new. The only redeeming factor for this movie was the visual effects were better than the second trilogy Lucas directed as well as SOME of the acting was at least bearable. All in all, for the amount of force fed Star Wars hype from ads, and the huge amount of commercial items all over the place, this movie is one to wait for to show up in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart.	0
1e38eb65-517a-4a69-aa39-89de3144b230	  JJ Abrams proves a very good action director that can channel heart and great chase sequences with large explosions, I find him far more palatable than Michael Bay. That being said, this is nothing more than a strict cash in for the hearts of and minds of those who still love the original three but loathe the others. It's fun and mindless drivel but it's all been done before. There is nothing special to this other than the hope that it offers at the end that the following movie will be better than this. It's a great story but the telling of it is getting to be tired trash for Hollywood blockbuster sci fi action movies.	1

771aca16-e6b1-42b8-9cf7-5e4a010f3f95	  Sorry to say, I found the movie to be a bit lacking. Still a good movie, but in my opinion it was barely better than Jedi (thanks to the stupid Ewoks) and not as good as Sith (fight scenes were the tie breaker for Sith). That puts it #4 on my list of all Star Wars Movies.There are a lot of small issues such as how adept new users can be with, well everything. However of these minor issues, the biggest issue was with the light saber. Apparently training isn't necessary. With that said, instead of listing the remainder of my minor issues item by item, I'm just going to touch on my two biggest irreconcilable issues. First and biggest of my issues is that in their attempt to go back to the "winning formula," they "borrowed" too much from previous movies. There's good familiarity that makes you feel warm and fuzzy. Then there's been there done that, got the t-shirt familiarity that makes your commitment to the franchise feel insulted. If you've seen all the movies, you know what I'm talking about.**SPOILER ALERT**Second major issue was how easy a storm trooper could just break away from the First Order during his very first battle after being taken as a child, brainwashed, and reprogrammed. Some would argue that scene somehow humanizes the Stormtroopers. OK let's go with that. So you are asking the audience to then believe that this human character, who drank the kool-aid his whole life, but had an epiphany after seeing one of his brothers in arms killed, then had no problem killing so many of them moving forward? #nofriendsgrowingup. Beyond that, the rebels just welcomed him in without question or suspicion? #nospiesinspace.Sorry JJ Abrams, I am disappointed. It's sad that I could be disappointed in a good movie. But you had a great franchise, and a great track record, so yeah, a good movie is a disappointment. You did such a masterful job with the revisioning of the Star Trek franchise that maybe I was expecting too much. I will submit that I'm as much of a Star Wars fan as I am a Star Trek fan so there is no bias here. My litmus test is simply that if I'm not ready to leave the theater and immediately get back in line for a movie from the biggest franchise in history, you have failed sir.	1

I do not feel like explaining because I have already released my anger in the youtube comment sections, but most of the major things have been discussed by people already; except one thing:Luke's lightsaber was lost along with his hand and thrown out the garbage chute into the clouds of Bespin... so it just magically teleported to the creepy old ladY?	0

53b37260-c9bf-4f44-b0e7-0d1994e4b479	  If I were to summarize this movie in one word, it would be "fatigued". What few effects there were lacked professionalism, modernization, and any sort of epic feel.There were only a handful of characters, way too many close ups. The movie felt confining, claustrophobic, and narrow. It was very slow paced, and failed to keep my attention. Moments were so slow I thought it was for comic relief, when it was actually being serious. The acting was forced and awkward. I think I saw Harrison Ford's pain in his eyes at how bad Leia's acting was. The plot was weak, with a sudden "New Order" evil appearing. Somehow they already secured a planet sized superweapon, aimed at a solar system conveniently next to where the heroes were staying and with the first firing of the weapon just so happened to destroy every other planet filled with people except they one they were staying. Episode III was much better. I have no plans on seeing Episode VIII or IV, and if I by chance do, it certainly won't be in theaters. I had set my expectations much higher for Disney. This movie was terrible. 1 out of 10. I want my money back.	0
4e1b9956-300c-4b83-b118-ac14e85d9a60	  Well I did not have a very good time watching this movie. SPOILERS!And by the way, JJ Abrams is one of my main influences and a wonderfully talented filmmaker and man. So I'm not just a cynical idiot. This is just my opinion.The fever had hit me by this point and I had just re-watched all of the original unaltered Star Wars films from 1977-1983. So I was primed. I saw it with family and everyone was stoked to return to one of our favorite universes. SO what happened? This movie fell on its face, it limped, it crawled, it tried in vain to recapture the magic and the awe. This was 95% failed remake and 5% spectacle. Other then some small throwbacks and homages, plus some epic battle sequences, nothing in the film excited me, impressed me, inspired me, or elicited any emotion that could be categorized under "positive." Mostly I was feeling disappointment and disbelief. The appropriate adjectives for the movie are "safe" "stale" "unimaginative" and "predictable." The convenience of the scenes, the ease of the struggles, the pathetic backstory and undelivered promise of a saga continued instead of repackaged. So many plot holes, illogical concepts and uninspired backstory. Even individual lines felt on the nose. Abrams keeps a pace that is too fast, too fast in that he just wants to get it over with rather than let the weight of the moment consume the audience.How I appreciate the pace of the originals. The characters, the vision of such a good vs. evil story. Luke, Vader, Obi-wan, Yoda, the Emperor, Han, Leia, Chewie, OHHHH so good!!Kylo Ren is trying to be Vader. Fail. Rey is trying to be Luke and Han. Fail. Finn is trying to be - something. Fail. By the way, although I liked Finn, his turn from a stromtrooper is unrealistic and unmotivated in any universe. Rey pretty much is perfect at everything and being left behind by her family was executed poorly though it's a great backstory - except it's been done before. I did like her self-sacrifice towards BB-8.Snoke is - come on. A CGI projection of a deep evil that came from???Kylo Ren kills every other Jedi apprentice, forces Luke into a depression and exile and yet is beaten by Rey who uses a lightsaber for the FIRST time! He doesn't even look like Han. The coolest story is lost in the decades since Return of the Jedi and reduced to flashbacks.Han dies in one of the most predictable scenes in history, plus Harrison wanted out! I didn't even care about his death and I blame that blasphemy on the movie forcing me to know what will happen before it does. R2 wakes up conveniently when the battle is over to reveal the map. Rey finds Luke in 60 seconds. BB-8 is no R2. 3PO adds nothing. Leia and Han have a weird and lazy history. The Empire pretty much wasn't beaten, bigger death star, more planets destroyed, have to destroy the energy shield, I could go on. The General even gave a speech that was part Nazi part why was it in there? This film could have been so much better and different but AT LEAST different.I feel for Abrams because I think Disney enforced a rapid timeline and the script that maybe began as something great was red-inked until it was safe enough to release.This is a return to the Star Wars universe but it offers me nothing I haven't already seen and loved. I didn't like anything that was happening and I will defend any criticism I have. If you enjoyed it, more power to you. Keep enjoying it and DO NOT wake up to the critiques that will surely come with time. I pray Episode 8 is awesome!	0
394df347-9639-4cda-95b6-0624677b4403	  A complete disregard for not only the brilliantly made expanded universe of numerous writers, but also of a vastly more intricate, logical and believable universe then this failure to the entire star war universe.

3823c424-0e27-4757-85dd-ab00f013592f	  The film opens with a vast Star Destroyer looming across the screen. A comical droid with information vital to the resistance, running away from the occupants of this Star Destroyer, is dropped onto a desert planet where someone who doesn't know they are a Jedi finds it.The jedi wannabe (who is unsure as to where and who their parents are) and companion escape the planet in the Milenium Falcon, pursued by the bad guys in a sequence involving a zany alien bar complete with musicians. Han Solo, Wookie and male lead go to rescue the female lead from a vast planet sized weapon/spacestation.Bad guy in black with a mask betrays male lead and kills him after demonstrating that he can kill folk without even touching them.Armed with inside information on said vast space station the rebels send their X wings to exploit the weapons one weakness and blow the thing up. Which they do on the second attempt.Jedi Wannabe goes off in search of someone to teach them Jedish.Is it just me or did they make Episode IV all over again almost scene for scene (But in a slightly diferent order. No doubt in the hope no-one would notice). This reached a truly farcical climax when one of the rebel generals felt he had to explain that it really wasn't a Death Star. Why? Solely because it was much much bigger.Virtually the only points of difference are that the Darth Vader character seems to be played by Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and the Emporer character by Gollums grandad.Lazy, cowardly writing with no cliff hanger ending.At least Mark Hammil learned his lines.	0
84396d31-1e44-45ce-82d9-abd9759589a8	  Maybe, I have become a cinema snob, or after having partaken in over 5,000 movies, I find the latest episode of Star Wars to be bland. It conjures nostalgia for beloved characters from our younger days, but tries to sell the same story, with better special effects and fresh faces. The acting, cinematography, screenplay, etc are all top notch, but the movie doesn't wow all Star Wars fans, as you may have thought reading the reviews. The plot is somewhat predictable, and the climax reminds you of the original Star Wars. At best, this is a re-make of the original with a few minor plot twists.While George Lucas would be licking his lips with the expected billion dollar payoff, I do hope he does not succumb to bland for his next edition. Incidentally the villian in that movie is slated to be Benicio Del Toro - that is formidible. Worth a watch, but not worth a second visit to 3D or IMAX 3D.	0
8dc7eddb-e9a9-4b00-b886-7d348fa228ba	  You know its bad when light sabers don't instantly cut through anything they hit. They might as well be fighting with wooden swords. Then there is the whiny, Darth Vader, picture a long haired Ross from friends. It is not the worst movie ever but I certainly don't understand the hype. I noticed the guy in front of me fell asleep. I don't blame him I was just waiting for this snooze fest to end. Either have a realistic gripping story or dump the over the top immersion killing humor. You cannot have both. Furthermore why would 2 people who have never used a light saber do so well against a master....	1

5c487beb-f828-445c-88f9-b67db16d6cf0	  Not a good movie. The plot makes no sense. The story is the same as Episode IV. It's badly written, very badly written. Big disappointment.	0
42e34b6a-655f-4ced-a6dc-a4f048aa8121	  Very poor, offering nothing new from the original series, dialogue was excruciating at times, acting merely average. Just skip this and watch the prequels instead.	0
7596b3a6-d7d6-45a4-b5b4-be7414333999	  A good Star Wars flick that kept the characters and some of the Lore from the books intact with the new story. You could definitely see the Disney touch with the writing. Overall a cool epic flick that clearly had a ton of money thrown into it and a ton of money profit from it. It was great to see the older actors come back for the story and to reprise their roles.	1

c0db1ea2-e2f5-4726-9e81-d9a1b7071dc1	  It was just OK. It was more of a re-hash of the other movies rather than something all new. I didn't think the special effects were as good as they were in the original Star Wars movie. Maybe because this one was filmed in 3D and they developed the special effects to look best in 3D.	1
ed0cc471-f298-483b-a202-c2b8130889ba	  I think Disney and JJ focused far too intently on bringing Star Wars towards a modern audience and "rebooting" the franchise, largely ignoring what they should have done which is provide a standalone story with the components of a good Star Wars movie. Too much of it was rushed, so much so that most of the film's major plot points (including the Starkiller Base battle) was pretty anti-climactic. In fact everything about it seemed rushed, making it appear like they tried to squeeze everything about what's to come in the newly rebooted series into one "preview movie". Force Awakens was essentially: "Look who we're killing off, look who we're keeping, this desert-dwelling loner girl who already knows how to use the Force is going to be the next super-awesome jedi, and there's this Nazi-like group who scraped up what was left of the Empire. By the way, you won't ever see the fruits of the Rebel Alliance's labor in reforming the Empire into the New Republic. These new guys' sphere of death is so awesome it destroyed EVERY major New Republic population center in ONE shot." Short version: They really need to follow this movie with more than two films; it's just too much of a two-hour long trailer rather than an actual movie.	0

d66b072c-8fa2-4c74-9026-fd46904d8cc6	  I am sorry but I hated this movie. The plot was a twisted mess. The pace at times put me to sleep. The special effects were nothing special. And the Princess and Hans were so old looking it freaked me out. Give me the old Jedi Knights that were in training for years. These new female type pick it up overnight and beat the darkside like a drum. Which reminds me Hux needs a bigger helmet and a kick in the teeth for crying.	1
2719d62c-805b-4875-b07c-820e9de1e33a	  The special effects are amazing, characters are poorly developed: lack of depth. I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more if it wasn't for all the spoilers I heard from about 30 years ago; its a copy and past of the first Star Wars. Emo Vader makes no sense and is annoying. Watch it on dvd.	0
f2245151-dd7d-4dcb-9a6d-9d0f3719a804	  The latest return of the most iconic space fantasy franchise was anticipated with mixed feelings. Star Wars had returned once before with awful results when George Lucas, the director of the original beloved trilogy of adventure flicks, resurrected his greatest money maker in 1999. That trilogy of prequels has often been called a series of commercials meant to boost toy sales.After this cinematic disaster, the franchise was kept off the silver screen, until Lucas decided to gather his winnings and sell the exclusive SW license to none other than Disney Pictures. The most critical viewers foresaw more toy commercial material, but Disney seemed to know they had something to proof. J.J. Abrams, the guy who managed to resurrect cerebral Star Trek as a goofy slapstick extravaganza in 2009 was assigned to do- financially, at least- the same trick with Star Wars.He succeeded. Not only did "The Force Awakens" make unimaginable amounts of money, it isn't an awful film by any means. It's about the safest bet Abrams could have made, but he managed to concoct a reasonably entertaining piece of harmless entertainment even under overwhelming pressure from a passionate fan base.The approach here is extremely retro. Everything from lighting to framing to sound design is pure late seventies, making "The Force Awakens" feel quite like "A New Hope" all over again. The same is true for the script as well. Abrams was criticized heavily for using too many familiar elements in "Star Trek: Into Darkness," but here he basically remixes "A New Hope" right down to structural detail. The clear nostalgia-over-anything -mentality might have made this film a sort of non-movie, but all the channeling is done with care and precision.Then the problems. Hollywood spectacle scripts are plagued by incongruences and conflicting details, which is more of a crime when the story as a whole doesn't set out to do anything on any deeper level, as seems to be the case here. The second act has some easy emotional moments but kind of falls apart into a sequence of aimless action sequences in familiar Abrams- and, yes, Star Wars- fashion. But the beginning and the ending entertain well enough for me to forgive the lazy writing midway through. Also, the dialogue is okay, which is the clearest improvement to all the previous installments.Another resurrection of the "A New Hope" approach is the decision to use relatively unknown stars in leading roles. All of them do well enough if not excellent. I hope there will be some involved character building in the future, because so far the new characters don't have that much meat around the bones yet. The supporting characters known from previous films still steal the show just because of their history.We begin the saga with Finn (John Boyega), a soldier of the Empire who decides to switch sides as he witnesses military atrocities in the field. There's bound to be some internal conflict here in the future, but not much is seen yet. Boyega doesn't have much to work with as it stands, and that shows a bit.The major hero this time is a more kick-ass version of Luke Skywalker, Rey (Daisy Ridley) who gets caught up in the conflict between the rebels and the Empire and happens to have a natural mastery of The Force bordering on the Deus ex machina. I'm hoping for more nuances here as well- Rey is even more of a Mary Sue than Luke was, and that's too much. Ridley spends a bit too much screen time simply looking astonished, but she fares well in the end. There's a physicality to her that suits the two-dimensional action hero Rey still is.The most tragic character failure is the antagonist. Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver. He is very difficult to take seriously. His arch has mirrored that of Anakin Skywalker, and there is way too much gothic emo angst and hair products involved in the character design on every level. His scenes came across more parodic than nostalgic.At times, the parody feel is also present because of the music. John Williams returns with a score that nicely plays into the retro feel, but at times the melodramatic strings just make a scene feel like a spoof. The melodies aren't horribly memorable either.In hindsight, the original Star Wars trilogy seems to thematically announce and reflect the Reagan era. Militaristic bravado, religious war romanticism and na�ve hero myths abound. In 2016 the very same ideology persists in the franchise, but it presents itself as less influential as it just blends in with all the nostalgia. Abrams inserted a same sort of hard values -romanticism into his first star Trek film and it was painfully ill-fitting inside a franchise known for its soft values and logical non-romanticism. Now he gets to do what he wants in a franchise where it all fits, and seems to make the assumed fanboy enthusiasm work in the movie's favor. Now that he's won approval for a remix, he has the opportunity to take risks and take a worshipped mythos further. I hope he will.There are some Daesh similes here to make it all a bit more current, though. And overall the conflict between the Empire and the rebels is presented more as a holy war. The original trilogy- in its time of libertarianism and Reaganomics- presented the Empire vaguely as a communist state, but it is more clearly a church here. The war among the stars might be less about ideology than about scripture.	1

0e513a53-c629-4478-b832-b7c0d90596e3	  I thought this movie was a colossal fail. While arguably slightly better than its modern day predecessors, its at times glacial pace, often unsubstantiated plot progression, and absurd 'deus ex machina' moments destroyed its unlimited potential. Without getting too much into spoilers, the idea that (a) character(s) in the movie were able to (without training) defeat obviously far more practiced baddies struck me as inane. I understand it was an awakening of the 'force', but there is absolutely no premise to support anyone exercising advanced abilities without training whatsoever. Especially when considering the demonstrably powerful opponent's skills. This along with the film's glossed over and at times completely unexplained plot progression, delivers a film rife with forced tributes to Lucas lore and sporadic, incomplete character development that ultimately begs the question: What exactly just happened?I'll obligingly see the second hopefully more finessed sequel in hopes that it at least somewhat makes good on its promise to elevate the quality of the franchise. Disney purchasing the rights to Star Wars should have provided a clear step forward from the modern Lucas generation tragedies. Unfortunately it was at best, mildly better than its antecedents, and at most partially delivered upon its massive prerelease hype.	1
66ce7e84-198b-4e56-adf7-5704bd142ff3	  This film is profoundly OK. Among critics and fans alike, it seems to be benefiting from a hefty dose of low expectations brought on by the prequels. Half the scenes were lifted straight from A New Hope, the story-line was painfully simplistic, and the main "bad guy," Kylo Ren, is disappointing (he went from intimidating to weak and laughable way too fast). There are some notable bright spots here. The new characters (Finn, Rey, Poe) are good although their dialogue relies a bit too much on cheesy comic relief (so, you're telling me that a guy who was born and bred as a storm trooper from such a young age that he doesn't even have a name--only a number--somehow talks like a wisecracking fanboy on Reddit. Come on!)	1
c8c93251-2925-4137-a1ed-4c018567ff3e	  Pretty Meh. Badly written, uninspired. 2 stars for entertaining me as long as I didn't think about the lazy writing.	0
50077973-8752-4bf8-a705-ed90e7752d8d	  No....just no. I already saw this movie once and it was better the first time. Before Abrams got his hands on it.	0
47a29dae-2d0e-4b95-b7f5-1ddd6c9341a3	  It's okay. No better or worse than the prequels. More of a lateral move. Better cinematography, worse story. Almost no story. This exists as the set up for more movies and borrows heavily from ANH and KotOR for copious filler that has nothing to do with the plot of this film. The actual plot here constitutes no more than ten minutes of screen time. Only a heroic set of performances from the cast elevate this film into something worth watching. Disappointing but not bad.	1

6f0c313c-b49a-41b2-845f-23f0518210af	  Decent. Lacking character development like all of the previous films. The series really needs to move to TV and have multiple seasons. We aren't introduced to characters, religions, planets, all of the wonderful little things that make up Star Wars and unfortunately, the movies don't give the real story any justice. I find that at the end of the movies, there's no emotional investment to any of the characters really...other than the ones we've seen in older movies. By the end of this one, I could care less if Kylo Ren was dead, because Rey embarrassed him with her Force skills -- which she randomly learned in the movie.Really disappointed.	0
fa8bfa06-dd3c-4d27-afd8-b693dd02ad1c	  So much violence, with one-dimensional stereotype characters and dialogue a middle school student could have written. Who's the target audience, adolescents aspiring to become school shooters?	0
4e47aa31-baa5-473a-a244-e976a9d3c1ee	  I agree with the Golden Globe and the Oscar committees that this movie does NOT deserve a major award. It just is not an exception movie - the acting is unimpressive, the story is unimpressive, it is hardly original and talk about predictable - if you couldn't figure out Kylo Ren is a Darth Vader descendant from the preview you are brain dead. Take out all the eye candy special effects there is hardly anything to this movie other than an introduction to the next sequel. It is a dumb movie that is candy for the immature masses. Very disappointing.	0
9e49177c-3b76-449c-98a0-6751b2f3cc46	  This would probably be a two star movie if I hadn't gone in with such high expectations after reading the near universal praise. I just can't believe the praise being put on this film. The writing was just awful. It just lacked any cohesion. Absolutely nonsensical. It seemed like a Michael Bay movie. That being said there were some good things. Many scenes used special effects like the original films which were clearly more realistic than the prequels. However there were still scenes of pure CGI that had almost no realism. Especially bad -and pointless- was the scene on the falcon with the escaped creatures. Just awful. Death planet - awful. Bad guys - far too weak. Good guys/women - far too strong. The writer clearly has no idea that you actually have to take the time to train to be good at something. A huge change from the originals that focused on teaching and training. The senseless action scenes just ruined it for me. I did like the idea of a stormtrooper becoming good but it could have been done with more realism. I thought this was pretty bad. I hate to say it because I wanted it to be good. I'm not sure there is much potential for the next two given how weak the bad guys are in this movie. I'm just glad Michael Bay and/or JJ Abrams is not directing.	0
efcd38b7-cb7b-4728-9c66-e7094561958b	  Laughable that this movie has a 93% on this website, sad actually. For all of the flack the prequel trilogy gets they did something right. That was originality, something severely lacking from this movie.Some random thoughts of the movie- Takes place on three planets, Tattooine rip off, Hoth rip off and an endor/naboo rip off.-Technology somehow hasn't progressed in the 30+ years since the OT.-Finn is almost useless, think of him of a less obvious jar jar binks with a slight love story attached to him to make him feel more important to the story.- Poe flat character clearly good at piloting, absent from practically everything with no explanation.-BB8: R2D2 clone although its good to see a different droid in the limelight - Rey is living on a desert planet and seems rather unhappy. (where have we seen this before) somehow can do everything and practically nothing wrong, never has there been a character in Starwars that has been so invincible.- Kylo Ren is probably the most interesting of all the new characters in the movie. Blatantly based off of Anakin but with good reason. Id have to say the best part of this movie is this character i cannot wait to see more of him.- Harrison Ford does his best performance in a long time. A lot of heavy breathing into the microphone though- Any interactions between Leia and Han Solo are cringe worthy and completely detract from the movie. After the first time it happened i found myself wishing for them not to encounter each other for the rest of the film.-Obvious death star clone-Rey: Super pilot and mechanic extraordinaire (ill give that to her she spent her life inside of machines) but knows the millennium falcon better than solo? Ridiculous. Wasn't sure if Jedi were real. 25 minutes later she reads Kylos mind and then uses Jedi mind tricks (which shes never seen anybody do) on a storm trooper. She does this and also defeats Kylo Ren in a duel with absolutely no training whatsoever. Luke trained hard and could barely lift a lightsaber out of the snow 10 feet away from him. Rey accidentally gets the same light saber out of the snow from 20 yards away while at the same time over powering Kylo to get it, again having no idea what shes doing. It took Luke 3 movies of training and he still lost to Darth Vader, she needs none to defeat the master of the knights of ren. I don't want to say it but shes sort of a "Mary Sue" I hope in the next film theres some sort of struggle she goes through. I am happy Star Wars finally has a female lead, this just isn't how it should have been handled.- Maz sort of cheapens the Jedi council from the prequels. She talks and says wise things as Yoda did and thus cheapens Yoda and the rest of the Jedis.- Where does Maz get the light saber? It fell into the abyss in Cloud City. "A story for another time" is all she says about it. Sounds like lazy plot writing. - why is captain phasma on the poster she does nothing the entire movie- get ready for close ups 50% of the movie is character face shots.The movie is not all bad though and if you're not a fan of Star Wars/ havent seen the other movies id recommend it. If you have any prior knowledge to the series particularly the original trilogy that odds are you understand the gripes i have with this film. I've seen this movie now half a dozen times, i continue to leave the theater with the feeling that JJ Abrams just wanted to make a safe "reboot." If you disagree and love the movie i'm glad, at the end of the day opinions are just that.	0
90d92f9a-c4c2-4699-a772-c780d9be8459	  horrendous movie,its a rehash of ep 4, with nothing added. I am a star wars geek so to see that blatant ignorance and complete contradiction to star wars lore is one of the greatest problem to real star wars fanatics. The story in of itself makes no sense that characters have no real character to them. Fin simply acts a buffoon with off one liners and ray as a mary sue able to do everything	0
8cf5f478-48b6-4cd3-9f0c-e0c9f7c95724	  The movie has embarrassing moments (mostly with the former stars reprising old roles), but overall it is pretty good. It would be much better if it were 25 minutes shorter.	1

d7bd8fcd-3378-4e3c-9c53-8c6d1ba4201d	  One of the weakest Star Wars films as far as storyline goes. First of all, it is too similar to "A New Hope" and doesn't thrive on much except nostalgia and special effects. With that being said, I will say it is a good action flick, but don't go into this movie thinking you are going to get a lot out of it.	1
07b92c28-058c-40fa-99e0-741f373e3d08	  Predictable unoriginal plot, terrible romance between Han and Leia, ridiculous concept that the COMPLETELY untrained hero/heroine defeat a seasoned Dark Jedi, Luke shows up for 30 sec at the end and says nothing?!?!? Granted, the characters 'Daisy and Finn' were played pretty decently, but I mean, it's not 1990 or 2000... why is it still edgy or groundbreaking that the leads are a woman and a black dude? Like I said, they were the only parts I found decent (and the Rebel Pilot), but what do you think this is, the South in the 1950's? Oh, and if the Rebels won and are now in control... why are they still 'Rebels?' and why is the First order not known as the Rebels? Obviously they had to try and fill some gaps, but how in the hell did Luke lose his nephew to the dark side? And to who? And what?... killing your father is no big deal, but the nephew thing... gotta go into hiding and not face this problem. And how could they think Finn was a Rebel with all his fear and lack of hope towards the First Order? Disney did it though, marketed the heck out of this thing to no end where everyone HAD to see it since they liked the ones before this. Just download this if you haven't seen it, I'm usually against that, but the media hype should be seen as false advertising. Good special effects though. (but that's obvious)	0
52af963c-eb48-4daf-b675-31c31debf1d9	  I found the characters less approachable than the original. Save one. When a CGI barkeep can out act Carrie, you know there is a problem. Rey...was just bland and annoying. She was bossy, rude and inconsistent. I liked Finn and Poe, the only emotional high points of the film besides Harrison Ford.	1
59c4711e-bb92-472d-8785-45af4d4b2611	  Upon reflection, I have a hard time saying this Star Wars is as good as any of the first trilogy, or much different for that matter. I think the initial excitement of seeing the first Star Wars film in 10 years and the original cast being in the film fueled my initial reaction(s).	1
5f38d211-dcf6-45ed-af5e-000c2552f0e4	  A lazy and unoriginal rerun of the original trilogy but without the character development (or even basic plot development) that made us actually care about what happens. I had low expectations, but The Force Awakens still managed to disappoint.	0
6b4bdf35-f314-4afe-8038-f154be25ac4c	  Even though it's a quality movie, it plays its cards very safe and isn't perticularly inspired. If you wanted something new out of Star Wars, you won't find it in The Force Awakens.	1
0ba81cca-e0d3-40c6-a7d8-fa91afa52939	  A film that only superficially captures the feeling of the originals, but is let down by it's lack of originality, it's predictability and it's poorly written new characters. Motivations are to be presumed as they're never explained and it's hard to feel any threat or attachment to any of the new cast because they're all blank slates, void of personality or individuality. Performances from all actors, Harrison Ford aside, feel hammy, twee and sometimes at odds with the brief backstories we have of these characters. The rehashed plot quickly becomes tiring, as apposed to the nostalgic romp they had aimed for. The positives mainly come from the exceptional design teams, cinematography and score.	1
a3aa41fc-0016-4915-b642-57441a828c88	  really lower your expectations on this one. Not great visually, intellectually, or great writing. It's more like a reunion special where within 10 minutes you know how the movie is going to end and within 15, you're wondering why should I even care for these characters?maybe the 2nd movie will give more background to the new characters, but this is an example of how George Lucas knows that if he puts "Star Wars" on anything, there will be those who will just eat it up without really thinking why.	0

1ad1697d-2372-4dc7-bc1a-6014424210b9	  Imagine a world where space travel is a way of life, hyperspace is standard in every ship, jedi mind tricks, you can move objects just by thinking. Imagine the infinite possibilities of writing a story in this world.Instead, the writers chose to recycle episode 4 and 5. The same old story, even though they have infinite material at their disposal. Just playing for the popular vote, making a previously successful formula under a new label, benefiting from the sentiments of the fans to make few quick bucks. So many opportunities of writing a good story lost. The many directions a story could have gone. Even the obvious plots of intrigue and suspense remained unexplored (For instance, why does R2D2 magically comes back to life, for no reason? why not let Rey have a key left to her which brings the droid back to life??) There were certainly some high points though. Han Solo character was portrayed masterfully. It was fun to see the millennium falcon again. Generally speaking an entertaining but a very safe movie. Unfortunately, I expected a bit more.	0
2b5d913c-961c-42c7-a9bd-0aeabf414702	  absolutely no character development, and virtually no fantasy element... Star Wars is a sci-fantasy. There were very few aliens and almost no use of the force. The characters are 1 dimensional and everything that happens is excessively implausible.	0
39fb35ba-3dca-430b-93ac-ec6858219cf4	  Force Awakens, Looks in Mirror, Goes Back to Bed Again. Seriously.So, I purposefullly did not read anything before seeing this movie. Which is probably why I am so dumbfoundedly disappointed that it was a damn remake of the original. Let's break it down a little:- Disaffected youth in out of the way locale stumbles over rebellion. - Boy meets girl. - Girl kidnapped by Establishment to their planet-sized weapon base. (Again. Seriously?)- Father / Son duel over void. (Again. Seriously??)- Rebels rally and fly in to exploit weakness and blow up mega-weapon just before it can blow up planets. (Again. Seriously???)Come on.Out of a universe of possibilities, we get this slavish rehash? I think they even reused the loading graphic for the big weapon powering up.	1
4dce6010-0ffd-49c5-b47a-0c1cab25cfa8	  Sorry, this new Star Wars episode is horrible, neither credible nor interesting. A sanitation worker can just pick up a light saber and battle a Vader-in-training character? Really? Where's Yoda when you need him most? I guess this generation has no patience for such character development, but it really detracted from the Star Wars magic of the force and all that. Instead you get a bunch of over-eager actors who escape one danger after another. Nothing compels the story along. No good vs. evil here.	0
cd84ee69-0f10-4ba8-9d3c-617261217525	  I had more problems with it than I anticipated, but taken as simple entertainment it was okay. The effects were decent and it felt like in a galaxy far far away enough. What got me was how it was kind of too slow and too fast at the same time. Reams of exposition thrown into dialog that had a LOT of staring in between, instant plot as vehicle coincidences that seemed super fake, instant force mastery based on nothing, and a villain you might as well call Darth Emo. You can get any number of spoilers somewhere else, I'm not doing that, but a lot of things certainly don't add up. It's almost like a paint-by-number in it's simplistic setup for the next one which hopefully will be better.	1

40461f30-f55e-4fa3-8c8c-540b5b9b17a8	  I must have been in a different time warp than others who saw this movie. I was really disappointed. I am a Star Wars Fan and they could have saved us all a lot of trouble, and them a lot of money, if they had introduced Rae and said: She would be a big star, she I did her level best to drag this thing into the real movie category.Mav is wonderful sorry we wasted the rest of the movie around her and then blew her up. That character needs another movie. Harrison would get his stride about half way through and then -- well we all know what happened to him!The dark side son would be a no chin whimpering imitation of a Star wars character - who thought he was a good idea? He took the helmet off and I almost left the theater. And Princes Leya??? Did she get paid to show up? Was that really her or some fans look alike Gramma who filed in? She looked fine somebody just stole her ability to even remotly act. The person sitting next to me actually said out loud "Are you serious?" after a few lines from her.Rea and Han Solo cannot hold a movie Iike that alone and the drone, while cute, was just not enough.Just another note here. I know you have to suspend disbelief for movies like this and it is part of the fun - BUT neither a young storm trooper nor a really young untrained girl can take up a light saber and go against an adversary who has trained for it most of his life. Some alternative talent that got them through this might have been appropriate. At least have them run and the bad guy gets his foot caught so he cannot move around giving them some inkling of a chance. Or Rea's awaking Jedi power slowed him up and makes him drop the light saber??? We are of course ignoring that DarkSon would have just removed the saber from their hand with his mind but I am good with that not happening so we can have the fight.I know - the movie made billions and people loved it and who am I to talk like this? I am part of the paying public that has seen every episode and enjoyed them with my kids and my grandkids - that's who. All in all pretty weak.  There were moments I loved but all in all I an really glad I waited and saw it at a BIG discount, and that I didnt't pay extra for 3 d.	1
9ff5897a-ac45-4e48-b70e-35ce08a205c1	  if you saw the first star wars this is the same movie 40 years later . Dont waste your money wait for it to come out on TV for free.	0

fab4ad1e-df5c-4372-a34f-d81571a9ff4e	  Disappointed !!! In my opinion a waste of time and money. Nothing new and makes no sense. A lot of special effects but the story was shredded in pieces and some of the acting sucked. A real shame, one star is too much. Thank God I saw it in IMAX 3D .Giv	0
707f8982-31ec-44a8-a55d-92481fe494db	  Movie was terrible. Aside from a few cool action sequences, I fought sleep most of the way through. I want my money back.	0
30ffd2fd-4eb6-4be7-81db-d805f5ab3a6a	  I found some time to see this flick and hoped to find out if they got this franchise back on track as one of the most innovative and creative science fiction epics ever. But I was sorely disappointed to see so many great things (you've heard it all by now) developing during the first 40 minutes and then brought to ruins when the old cast enters from the original sequel entered, followed by a rapidly thinning plot and a befuddling conclusion whereby yet another death star is destroyed by the equivalent of a couple of Chinese firecrackers. Seriously, a moon or planet turned into a weapon of unimaginable power, capable of destroying entire worlds had its shield brought down so easily? What? You'd think the "Evil Empire" could think of a better way to protect their assets from the pesky rebels after two previous death stars are brought down by similar methods. Blah. And what about Princess Leia's weird appearance? I found myself wondering about Carrie Fischer's personal life right in the middle of the movie. I understand a StormTrooper could suddenly develop a need to defect, but the way it was done made me think that thousands of others would eventually do the same. So much is missing from this movie. Rottentomatoes critics gave it a 93% rating and this is surprising. What was J.J. Abrams and his Co. thinking? Perhaps they were trying to appease too many different fan groups. This movie had the makings of a great turnaround story, but it fell flat on its face. The true winners are the moviemakers, toymakers and the entire Disney franchise as they cash in on this clunker. The good news is the original cast work and cgi of the first 40 minutes could bode well for a fantastic second film next year. Even so, I will temper my expectations for the next one.	1

162bc2a4-8cda-4305-89cd-558c13d14ed9	  I fell asleep the first time I went and decided to try and watch it again. This movie was boring with not enough action, horrible acting and bad ending. This ranks as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Hollywood and consumers have lowered their expectations of what a good movie should be. Knowing the fact that it will break box-office records makes me wonder what the heck is going on in the entertainment industry. People buying tickets in advance and lining up just because its Star Wars is just plain stupid.	0
785baada-a733-44f1-947b-be1ac3650218	  If you're a star wars fan... skip this one. If you're a person who claims to be a star wars fan but has only actually seen the movies(an not all of them, just the primary trilogies), then you'll love it. If you go in there expecting a great movie full of Jedi and Sith, and epic battles, you will be disappointed, unless you find a light saber wielding prince Caspian with daddy issues to be ominous and threatening. The whole thing is literally a copy of episode 4, with very little variation on that plot, except that R2 did it better, and C3PO was a far better companion to our protagonist than a fumbling bumbling failed storm trooper with a moral dilemma. Heil Disney I guess... Thanks for ruining my favorite thing in the world... Jar Jar was way better than all of this, and that's really saying something.	0
4a99a28c-2cec-4724-824f-618f8173a30f	  This movie missed the mark on so many levels and completely copied episode 4. I was so disappointed in this movie as any true Star Wars fan would be.	0
f62b1eba-6472-496c-b001-a4cf342eae33	  The new Star Wars was plagiarism of its own anthology, specifically 4,5, and 6. (the good ones) Han became Obi one, Luke became Yoda, they had to travel to a planet to remove a shield and something like the Death Star was destroyed. There was not an ounce of originality present, it was if the writers sat down and watched 4,5 and 6 and took note of key plot developments. The force feed PC propaganda chocked me with each spoon full. The CG characters were unbelievable cartoon characters, the short orange creature was on a level of Ja Ja Binks, severely annoying (the muppets worked dammit!) and the new Emperor did not strike fear like the old. And last of my gripes is the new Darth Vader, (I forget the forgettable characters name and do not care to look it up) the new Darth Vader is a sissy! A punk! Keep that dam helmet on that geek!! Harrison Ford should be happy he's rid of the franchise, Chewy may be the only reason I watch the next one.	0
22012167-62a3-42d0-8b83-c35fc2719b8c	  Bringing familiar faces from Star Wars past, was the best part of 'The Force Awakens'. Though I am a big fan of J.J. Abrams the joint effort script (J.J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan, Michael Arndtwas) was not up to the Lucas/Star Wars standard viewers expect . The movie lacked flow and continuity as it jumped from scene to scene. So far everyone I know, who watched Awakens, came away with the same basic impression...a poor remake!	0
32c7b37d-e531-4554-8a4d-4b3c18183960	  Yuch. This movies was a canned production of previous Star Wars movies with absolutely no creative outburst at all. Ladies and gentleman prepare yourself for the replacement of the planet crushing death star, it's a really really big death star. Seriously thats what Star Wars did. Awful. Had so much potential and yet this was the focus of the movie. Unbelievable.	0
8e7a1639-5b4d-43b5-b927-f26cd0687d96	  After watching Star Trek Into Darkness and Star Trek (2009 Film) I was expecting more from the film than what actually came out. Though it included some impressive effects, I found The Force Awakens was basically a rehashing of Episode IV without a clear plot. Apart from the money, there was no real meaning to creating a seventh episode to the series since it was perfectly fine the way it was. Some scenes in the movie had already been repeated several times before.	1
aeaa6a6d-9c4e-4727-ac43-817c618a33dd	  Very poor remake of a New Hope with a desperately bad Faux Vader bad guy.	0
4863756f-1823-49b6-9dca-7447b6f7ade8	  The original trilogy had much more depth and pathos, Disney turned this into a a jokey, simplistically and flatly action packed feminist propaganda. The success was sheerly dictated by the fan fueled hype and nostalgia.	1
35fd2eee-df86-4d51-bfe0-3d0338b84e43	  Its a competent story, with enough fan service for the 'true' fan. Heavily telegraphed though. And definitely a march device. (How many different storm trooper armours?)	1
f3afb0c9-afa9-4260-91d4-bf3a549308d8	  A hollow quotation of "A New Hope." Desert Planet? Check!Droid that has all-secret plans to a super-weapon? Check! Death Star? Nope, because it is a BIGGER DEATH STAR. Get it? This unimaginative trite also is a blatant ripoff of the Jedi Academy Books.	1
54914b50-53e3-4403-96b0-ecba70273774	  I feel like Tommy Wiseau was in the writers room telling JJ Abrams how to write the script. What a sh*t sandwich. Please, if you love Star Wars, don't see this movie!	0
8bc3c841-3d5d-4d4c-a011-141f5b54eb6c	  Better than the prequels (Unless they remake it with Darth Jar Jar), but not a good as the originals.Star Wars The Force Awakens was kinda predictable, even though they rhyme with each other there was some room for surprises (like Yoda vs. Dooku, I remember people gasping when Yoda came in and started fighting). Even though it's been years I remember being entertained more by the prequels, than with the Force Awakens.It was predictable and the fast pace didn't allow me to soak it in. I've seen more entertaining movies than this.People will probably be surprised at this, but I just wasn't impressed. It was still a good movie, but I didn't feel like a kid again. I mean, I liked Avatar better.Now it could have been my expectations were high, and the hype was a bit high with this movie...but seriously this is Star Wars.Now, they could have used this movie to set the stage for the rest of the series. I do feel the next installments will be better. But as the first entry, I just didn't feel it.	1
0ff80905-3ea2-4c70-bedf-8f4a23c386d3	  It is easy to assume that Lucas sold the franchise to the Xerox Corporation - because the new film is nothing more than a weak photocopy of the 1977 classic and its 1980 follow-up.	0
b972c67b-5b03-458e-95e5-e2dce93b84f0	  if there was a lower score than this I would give it, but this by far the worst of the Star wars movies. While the Prequels were no joy at least they made an attempt to be original, this movie does not. the humor is campy, the plot would be down right plagiarism if Disney didn't already own it. This should have been advertised as a reboot instead of a sequel. The best thing about the film was Harrison ford and they killed him off, Fin is the second best thing but he wasn't enough to save this film.	0

The main villain is a fucking stupid teenage brat, who was saved by a stroke of fucking luck. Our secondary character was a retired toilet janitor.... and those are just a few points... Can't wait for Mr. Plinkett's review of this movie... -Thanks for reading.... idiots....	0
6d0a90e9-293b-4db2-8981-4f3efbe0889d	  Don't believe the hype, don't believe the raving fanboys and by no means believe the blatantly lying, Disney-bought critics. This is a storyless and soulless, stinking POS. Quoting youtuber Senju: "it feels like a slighly surreal and very expensive fan film". It also feels like a sligthly too long (2hrs worth) movie trailer made by hipsters who think that having the old, "genuine" special effects is more important than having a story. 3/10. 1 for the genre, 1 for Harrison Ford and 1 for Chewie.	0
69dc67ba-a218-4117-85af-c1f8d15efb3d	  by far the worst in the epic star wars franchise. The characters were weak and the plot was hardly developed. What a shame. George Lucas spent a lifetime building Star Wars only to see Disney destroy it in one swoop.	0

Sadly, though, I felt I was watching a remake of the A New Hope (the first star wars film released). I honestly did not believe my father (85) when he said it had virtually the same overall plot, just with some slightly different details - I apologize to my father for not believing him. We are real Sci Fi fans and were very disappointed.	0

025599eb-0ea2-40c0-ac64-393402fe27ce	  Well, when the film was over I had very mixed feelings. To describe it in short - I enjoyed watching this movie despite considering it a pretty bad product; fun with a guilt if you know what I mean :-)Scenario was no more than a digest of chunks and pieces from previous movies, deja vu was the prevalent feeling for entire movie. Cast was questionable at times, and performances far from plausible (leaning towards bad). Nevertheless, it was fun to watch despite all its flaws, probably just a nostalgic kind of joy :-)	1
dc1e6e61-a214-4a92-97e9-c6b6140ec9ae	  This movie is a complete rehash of A New Hope - Episode IV.1) Another Death Star... just bigger? Why do this? 3 of the 7 movies have a deathstar in them. AND WHY DOES IT HAVE THE SAME WEAK SPOT.2) Droid carrying sensitive information. R2D2 wakes up at a later time because of plot device. Now with BB8 (I like the design) makes R2D2 obsolete and useless btw.3) Jakku is the same planet as Tattoinne. Why do you mimic everything from the old trilogy???4) Mimic's the classic bar scene but just make it worse?5) Bad guy Kylo Ren was super cool.... until he took off his helmet. From then on he was a whiny Adrian Brody but with a bigger nose. Temper tantrums then loses to a Storm trooper?? Good movies need a worthy adversary, everyone knows that.The writers of this movie need to be thrown in movie writing jail for copying other Star Wars movies. This is the laziest excuse for a movie I've ever seen. Cool cinematic's, but it's very forgettable. I have no idea how this movie has such a high rating on this website and it makes me question its integrity.	0
e1d7b314-fe06-4aa2-b5fc-742120d16181	  Held off on this for long enough, as saw it the day it was released so if you haven't seen it by now you are not a real fan. I didn't mind it, it reboots the franchise, but that's all it felt like, a retelling of the same story. Should have been called Stars Wars A New Hope (Again). Also galactic empire stop wasting resources on gigantic bases. Doesn't seem to be working out. Really hope the next installment isn't some kind of rehash of Empire strikes back and it takes us somewhere else	1
9e0be7bf-790d-41bf-9341-2bb8a45c9f6d	  Grading on a curve compared to last efforts, of course this is 10 stars. However, what's the point in grading on a curve? Should be called Nostalgia Wars. Ripoff of 1977 all over again with some good action scenes. Would never see it again and feel ok about it.	1
a7d4a111-282a-48aa-9a27-1a755defbc3f	  This was a sad showing for Star Wars. It's a pretty film but it panders to prequel haters, has a horrible plot and ruins the legacy of the original trilogy characters. Very Disappointing.	0

Real Bad new characters, the movie suffers from a hangover of the previous characters , and yet does a pretty bad job much like Indian Jones 4. Sketchy characters, hardly anything exciting or fearful, really nothing new except for its the old Coke in a New Bottle with new faces and names and yet none of them impressive as the original storyline.I found it boring....Wheres the innovation.	0

2f4c72f6-16b7-46d4-8bb2-2181bde21143	  **SPOILERS**To begin, I am a fan of the original series. Big time. I grew up with those movies. Great story telling with purpose. I was hesitant to see TFA, but went in with a clear opinion. I mean it couldn't have been worse than the recent prequels, could it? Well, the first 20 minutes had some promise, the actors were excellent, the effects were decent, but the rest of the movie? Simply put, when I left, the theatre I was angry and ranted on the way to the car(waited til I was outside - away from people). The movie lacked soul.I'm just going to rant in paragraph points...Another Death Star - guess the rebels didn't bother to keep tabs on the Empire, they just keep building them. Oh yes, and like the other DS this one could be blown up with X-wings, even easier this time. High five everyone, we did the same thing we've seen in the other movies.Rebels - somehow they went from freeing the Galaxy to hiding on a planet again, while, somehow everyone let the Empire build itself back up to the army it was before.Han Solo and Chewie - though nice to see, why are they smuggling again? Han had a child with Leia, so clearly they had a life for a while. When Han needed "a break", did Chewie just sit in a closet to wait for them to resume the life of smuggling they left all those years ago? Chewie never met anyone? Non-sense.Main Villian - somehow, he got his hands on Vaders burned helmet after Luke performed the funeral ritual decades before he was even born. So...who was able to find the Vader helmet in the ashes and why? Anyhoo, so the main villian is Han and Leia's child. Not surprised. The movie says he was under the tutoring of Luke (who was now a master Jedi), but like Vader was turned to the dark side. You mean to tell me, Luke couldn't sense this happening? AND even if he couldn't sense it, wouldn't he be extra paranoid given the history of his own father? Vader wanna be threw two tantrums in the movie, which looked ridiculous. The 2nd tantrum, he was beating up a room, and in the hallway some storm troopers (who were on patrol - to protect the building, you know like their job). Not knowing who or what was going on in the room ahead, one taps the other to walk away from...the noise. Made no sense. Makes me sick to talk about the rest, but here we go. So they show (Vader wanna be) stopping a laser blast with the force early in the movie, but later he has difficulty fighting Quinn and the girl. Neither of them were fighters (heck Quinn was the janitor). Instead of using the force to push them both off the cliff or crush them with some trees, they get away. Oh wait! Sorry Quinn gets stabbed in the spine with the sabre. But don't worry...it was only a light sabre, we see later, he's going to be fine. What else? Oh the (Vader wanna be) wears a respirator type mask (like Vader) most of the movie, but not for health reasons...maybe just for fun? Boring....character.....So later in the movie Han confronts his son on a skinny bridge with no railings, and (Vader wanna be) kills him. I saw Han fall of the bridge dead, Chewie screams, and I just sat in the theatre not giving a crap.C3PO - has a brief appearance, where for laughs I guess, he says to Han Solo. "You might not remember me because of my one red arm, and then reminds Han of who he is. I guess Han has a poor memory or something. Purely tossed in their for a laugh , as I heard some chuckling behind me. WTF?R2D2 - supposedly powered himself off for decades because Luke vanished. No comment...ridiculous.Map to Luke - The rebels find the pieces to complete the map to Luke, and for the morons, they show the maps coming together like puzzle pieces. I did not understand the straight yellow lines drawn on the space map. Is that how space travel works? Forget the girls name.... (lead character). I liked her charisma and acting, but the character itself was lame. She went from not knowing how to fly a ship to flying like an expert when some tie-fighters show up. She later finds Luke's old sabre in the basement of a saloon. Not sure what it was doing there, and don't care. Lame. Also, she keeps going on about getting back home to wait for her parents. I have news for her...THEY LEFT YOU WHEN YOU WERE A KID!! YOU ARE NOW A TEENAGER, THEY AREN"T COMING BACK!!!!End of movie - The girl (main character) arrives at the point on the map where Luke now resides. Instead of meeting her ship (because he should have known she was coming, Force or no Force (hard to miss a ship flying your way, when you live on an island). Nope, instead he's standing on a cliff, his back to the girl with a hooded cloak on. When she approaches him, he turns, almost surprised and then stares at the sabre she holds out to him for what seemed like 15 minutes, just her holding it and him staring at it. You mean, a Master Jedi could'nt have built another sabre in that time? Did it really mean that much to him? And....roll end credits....and begin my hot rage.I will not be seeing the other movies. This was a pure marketing machine, which sucked people in to see piece of garbage. When all was said and done, there was nothing new, no characters I cared for (go ahead, kill them all), no thrills, no new revelations, no new story arcs, no suspense. Yep, it was another rehash, almost a remake attempt. Sucked so bad. I'm sticking with the original three as the entire story. It was solid. Nuff said.	0
b4d4d079-37be-43fe-8787-997479de8b81	  Absolutely hated John Boyega's character, I think he would have been better suited for a comedy. Parts of it were good but the plot was weak and felt recycled.	0
054727d7-43c3-4550-b842-638ceb03aa1b	  Way to over top ,Rey is way to powerful. She can do things in 1 movie that took luke 2 and a half movies to do	1
d5679c93-e43c-4150-8cb4-60c27c4986d2	  Played too safely with an identical plot to A New Hope. The stakes were never clear and Kylo Ren was a very poor antagonist. I laughed out loud in the theater when that chasm opened up between Ren and Rey near the end like the writers couldn't think of a way to have Rey win (established that she can never lose in whatever she chooses to do) but have Ren survive for the next movie. It relies on the rest of the trilogy too much to adequately explain what's going on. I almost burst out laughing again with the weird helicopter 360 shot of Luke at the end since it felt like a giant middle finger for not including a single line from him.	0
4f480b35-26a2-45ab-af0b-0e7fb45f3c61	  I can't believe people liked this movie! It was such a re-hash of most earlier Star wars movies and explored NO new ground or ideas.....They end up fighting another dark star... and even have the same kind of approaches.I A much more interesting movie would have been Luke...coming into the movie....earlier on and fighting with Hans....Solo... introducing new such Star wars' recruits and passing the baton on to the younger generation.... And don't even get me started out Hans and Leia's relationship...that was sooooo boring...I kind of feel like we've got a situation here of the Emperor's invisible clothes.... syndrome....!So, disappointing...	0
f31451e5-29b0-4144-a1ff-c49a8b17b615	  This movie was very modern. But not really in the good sense. Too safe, no philosophy, no depth, just winks at audience and too contemporary deliver that will inevitable age poorly. Very long commercial for a sequel, not a complete movie in an of itself. Flabbergasted at the initial reviews.	0
228fdfe8-6e69-4031-a591-9ea7329419ef	  A re-run of the original movies. Utterly disappointing and story-less. In comparison to Lucas' previous works, Disney has failed miserably.	0
07f89f89-194e-431e-b658-b823caac6d65	  How many movie critics were paid off by Disney to get this to 93%? For a movie with so many plot holes, ridiculous coincidences, and lack of new material I no longer put any faith in Rotten Tomatoes.	0
29357039-8e60-48e0-8705-aea7bc91e9b0	  Technically beautiful, but story is a repeat of New Hope with a broken more humanized dark side villain. As usual Abrams skips backstory and assumes you can connect the dots and care about what is happening. Hans and Leia disappointing and uncomfortable. Still...a must see.	1

4e6ebb94-f761-4cde-9e9b-f934628de7b3	  The Force Jumps the SharkJJ Abrams is a great action director, but his new super mega hyped film is a crashing disappointment and is downright stupid throughout. So much praise has been heaped on this film, it is hard to take a shot at it, but here goes.No one can doubt that this film looks great, is wonderfully exciting and well paced, etc. But it suffers from two central problems. The first is that it is a crude re-make of the original story in nearly all of its major plot points. That is, a band of rebels have some vital information about a super weapon, and one of it's leaders hides it in a droid for safekeeping. Then a young person gets personally involved in the rebellion and is revealed to have secret powers they don't understand. That young person is helped by Hans Solo and Chewbacca and together, they confront the evil empire and destroy the super weapon. The difference is the young person is a young woman, rather than a young man. This is where my second criticism comes in.Rey, this episode's Luke, is a typical feminist trope ('a Mary Sue'. I believe they are called) who can do anything without struggle. Fix and fly the Millennium Falcon without any experience of being a pilot? No problem. Use the Force with no Jedi training? No Yoda carrying required. Wield a lightsaber to defeat a much larger man in black who has spent 25 years learning how to use the Force and fighting with a Lightsaber? Piece of cake. There is no struggle in this heroine, she can do anything without any explanation - and the audience buys it - because they have become used to 'Mary Sue' and swallow it all whole.Well, I don't. Luke had to train, Anakin had to train, Yoda had to train, Obi Wan had to train - all had to try and fail to become powerful. But Rey? Nothing at all. This undermines the film's credibility at its core - drama comes from struggle and conflict. There is action a plenty, and there is a character journey for Rey, but not one that requires anything other than being a woman doing all these amazing things without any explanation.While Lucas got himself mired in explanation, especially in the much derided prequel trilogy, Abrams doesn't give a damn for reasons why this is all happening. There is no context to his story - there is no Star Wars world, just events. dear viewer.Now of course, Episode VIII will reveal that Rey is Luke's daughter, that she is, of course, Jedi trained, that Kylo and her fought before, that the attempt to revive the Jedi Order by Luke failed disastrously when the cousins competed and Rey won. That is why Kylo turned to the dark side. Or some such nonsense. And defenders of this film will go 'See, it all made sense all along.' Afraid not.Star Wars made sense because it told the story of Anakin, his tragedy, his fall from greatness, his eventual redemption by his son. This is NOT in that classic hero story tragic structure. Rey is really a Disney vehicle - another Princess - I expect her clothes to be for sale in Disneyworld next year. Maybe in Episode VIII she will sing, and we'll have The Force Frozen. So George, you did sell your kids into slavery - Disney has turned Star Wars away from classic myth and into Pirates of the Caribbean. Or Beuaty and the Beast. You can tell it's wrong from the title - the Force cannot sleep and they awaken. The Force is eternal, and people use it if they can.Disney Star Wars - nah!	0
06c39f06-1bc4-4485-9d87-21ade90adeec	  its star wars as you would expect, simple story line a few over paid stars, bit of action and loads of effects. saddly it falls flat on what it should of been. star wars should wow us, leave us brethless and exited as we walk out the cinima. instead you walk out chatting about the weather and the only thing that really stands out is just how slow the fight sceens where.	1

359f7b3f-f62c-4742-8afd-9c6963814523	  Just a huge disappointment. Feels like a fan-fiction of the original series. The storyline is poor, with no suspence and very similar to Episode IV. The technical quality and presence of characters from the old series save it from disaster.	0

54c0e44b-9c6c-4bbc-a5e8-bd27f5ded83b	  I just do not understand the excitement around this movie. The female lead was excellent, but the rest of the acting ranged from pitiful to embarrassing. I cringed when Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher were on screen. In particular, Harrison Ford was atrocious. He phoned in his entire performance. Thank god they killed off Han so that we don't have to be punished with another appearance of Harrison. I really don't see any reason for their characters to have been brought back other than nostalgia. The story would have been better without them. Right, the story. Too many people apparently haven't seen the original Star Wars in a awhile because this was a regurgitation of it without any of the humor. Although, apparently Storm Troopers still can't shoot and masters of the powers of the dark side are still unable to use those years of mastery to defeat someone who doesn't even believe in, or know about the force. This was worse than the prequels.	0
d56913e5-614b-4c92-8660-95cb63daaaac	  Very disappointing. It adds nothing to the previous two trilogies. Too much nostalgia, terrible rhythm, superficial, predictable and repetitive. And not funny. Only the robots are cute.Admittedly, the acting was also poor in previous films, but sat least the story was exciting, and the prequel managed to deepen the characters.	0
a5cd56f8-a053-4080-9889-30700a47e45d	  Just pointing the obvious, this movie is a ripoff from Episode IV, it's not a new movie it's just something that JJ Abrams is trying to sell as the start of a new trilogy, the lack of originality slaps you in your face, it's a movie for millenials period, as a Star Wars fan I strongly disagree with the critic reviews, not quite sure if they got paid by Disney	0
0565957e-82e5-4a3d-9553-146c84231a76	  Old movies: A burst of creativity; Tatooine, Darth Vader, R2 D2's sounds, the Death Star, the Millenium Falcon design, Hoth, X-Wing-Fighters, Yoda, Rancor, the Force, and thousand other ideas.This one: Zero; another desert planet, another droid getting a secret message, another Darth Vader (and a ridiculous one!), the same Falcon, an alien that has glasses like Geri from Pixar, a *bigger* Death Star, ...To repeat; not a *single* new idea!	0

bddc7352-c30f-4d3b-86f6-e5420f8b9173	  A very bad copy of the original episode "A new hope" , with the difference that in this one you don't need to train yourself to become a jedi, you just pick up a light saber and that's it. In this movie there is no pathos no thrill, you watch it knowing exactly what's going to happen in the next ten minutes	0
d859c99f-5ce4-4b4c-a20e-dbf9028b5235	  This Star Wars was pretty weak. "SPOILER ALERT" There is very little originality: Good young Jedi person lives in the desert & likes to tinker with stuff, Bad guy runs around in a mask breathing deeply, Lost droid has the info to save the good guys, Death Star is now Death Planet, A father/son confrontation ends in tragedy with one of them falling to their death down a huge vertical space(Empire). I also have a problem with the fact that Rey can fly the Millennium Falcon when it has been sitting for 5 years(no maintenance) and she has no training on it. In the first movie Luke(Son of Vader) has to practice with the light saber and in this movie people just pick it up and miraculously know how to fight with it. I also felt the dialog was not as good as it should be and there were some pieces where the actors should have done more takes.	1
3c56663a-cae3-411c-8776-ef15439f1497	  Maybe I'm just old and jaded but this felt like somewhat of a retread to me. I don't dislike the new characters but I don't really love them either. Darth Vader made for a truly iconic villain but there are none of that caliber to be found here. In many ways, I think the less well regarded episodes I-III had more "zest" and intrigue and I'm a bit puzzled as to why this installment has become such a chart topper.	1
5e44df51-bebf-49d8-b46a-8b6bd37fc1bf	  Meh Way too much hype surrounding every aspect of this film. Even after a week, I'm still trying to process the film...Well, not really process it--just figure out why I still don't like it. I'd see it again if someone pays for my ticket.	1
ef6d1127-e2b5-46dc-8860-e4416c95746b	  I know it's not just me when I observe that the seventh episode of Star Wars felt flat, contrived and, frankly, not very interesting. "The Force Awakens" was, of course, nothing but a re-imagining of Episode 4, with basically the same motivation, same scenes, same dialogue, and same (identical) ending as "A New Hope"... but without the thrills. I never thought I'd say this, but even Harrison Ford (with his hefty $34 Million role as Han Solo) failed to inspire. Seriously, I DID NOT CARE about this cast of characters, including those of the original cast members. And THIS is the best that the golden boy J.J. Abrams can do? Fortunately, I take consolation in knowing that not one thin dime of my money went to Disney on this one.	1
140dbe16-1290-48c7-b470-735a2791cd12	  Pretty fun, just go to enjoy a good adventure movie and don't think to in depth about the plot or you will find issues. If you liked the originals you will like this one. You should at least see the originals for this to all make sense for you or this won't completely stand on its own. This is on par with a bond or mission impossible movie as far as quality but has a lot of nostalgia going for it.	1

e5c78108-ef84-4c69-881f-53b2deb47e8b	  It's a good movie set in an interesting universe, with just the right amount of special effects, and tight acting and directing. Everything is far superior to episodes I and II, but the storyline is not a creative one.	1
c874a7d6-c089-4e13-bc89-dbf5fcc7b15c	  Horrible movie. Star Wars used to be my favourite but now I don't even want to hear about it. Ruined the series for me and I'll heavily have to consider ever watching a Star Wars movie again.	0

49de6f68-858d-46cb-842c-b306a0fb0c3d	  I was very disappointed. It is Star Wars IV A New Hope all over again, however, applied with a coating of political correctness. I will not watch the future movies.	0
d0f98b5b-99d3-40a3-b774-d7c516c3ed0a	  I liked the new Star Wars but I wasn't wowed by it. Over-hyping this movie lead me to be a bit disappointed with it.	1

b4929790-13cd-46c6-9bf6-501707ee520f	  I love the original trilogy and I think this Star Wars sucked. I really couldnt enjoy myself because I was constantly thinking how obnoxiously similar it was to the first film without the soul and mystic of the New Hope. I can't believe I am agreeing with George Lucas. This was just a feel good nostalgic movie with no substance or feeling, a 2015 whitewash of the first beautiful film George directed.	0
be4e9896-13d2-4011-84b0-df49837fd898	  This is at best an average Star Wars film. JJ did not add anything new to the universe, he just copied the plot from episode 4. The characters are average, Finn is okay, Kylo Ren loses to an untrained "jedi", and Rey accomplishes everything she wants without any struggle. CLASSIC Disney movie. Its as if you are watching a Marvel remake.	0
3340955a-afc1-43d1-a71c-6111ebcf6a86	  Overrated over hyped worst star wars yet. There was better and more acting in Jar Jar binks than the whole of this movie. If you don't want to think too much and enjoy a 65 action% 15% acting 20% plot then this is for you. This is simply a remake in search for more money. Spoiler alert Nothing original except the new droid which is r2d2 hyped up. C3PO and R2D2 dont appear till near the end of the movie. Wannabe vader 2.0 wannabe emporer 2.0 etc etc nothing original	0
f6174633-1680-4158-b21c-09927d2d0eda	  well crafted, but completely lacking of ideas, the movie recycles original trilogy ideas and trademark without the necessary determination.

It was boring, it was used, it was all around a snooze. I believe there is maybe 2 lightsaber scenes lasting a total of about 10 minutes out of the entirety of the movie.

4f17df68-33a9-4e8f-b5ea-39e019dd1d97	  I walked in expecting to be decently satisfied and nostalgic, and I left incredibly disappointed and confused.Completely unremarkable and unquoteable, the movie barely and briefly succeeds in capturing what made the original trilogy great before completely ruining it with a plot full of holes, predictable moments, and questionable backstories with little explanation. I can say that it looks pretty, makes good use of the soundtrack, and shows Daisy Ridley to be a great actress (albeit, a seeming copycat of the other female protagonists of recent action movies. I can't say it's a terrible thing, just predictable).I am most disappointed in the performances of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, showing that their time away from the franchise ruined both their characters and chemistry together on screen (not to mention the poor dialogue choices they were given).Overall, I don't see what people love about this movie. If I closed my eyes to the title screen and forgot it was supposed to be Star Wars, I might have thought it just another lackluster action film. I don't believe it deserves the recognition it has received.	0
aa0be7e8-6017-47c4-8e5c-84b02d62bb30	  With the exception of Rey and Finn, this was everything I never wanted in a Star Wars film. Filmwise, its story is no where near as engaging as Revenge of the Sith and the visuals have nothing on The Phantom Menace. Minus half a star for being not particularly good fan fiction.	0
0cbd91d0-6e0c-40f0-a764-1f81d83cd226	  Better than the prequels; however, I felt like this was similar to watching the pilot episode of a television show. This movie seems to be the set-up for the upcoming sequels. It left me with a half-full feeling. A bit more "meat" could have been added to this intensely anticipated movie. Most disappointing was that the familiar characters were a little too self-aware that that were in the previous movies. Corny self-referential lines took me out of the Star Wars reality and more into a wink-wink nod-nod frame of mind. Overall, though, the movie was good. Not great. Good. Here's hoping that SW8 is a fuller movie.	1
db108f86-ab22-412a-9300-1c19c44835d1	  Was good fun to watch but coming away from it and thinking about it, I just can't get over how stupid some of it was.	1

8eb656b9-1998-4dc7-b94d-0ae467e26e04	  Unfortunately, I walked out of the film mostly underwhelmed. J.J. Abrams directs the new movie competently enough, but the story they've constructed is nothing more than a recycling of George Lucas' original story. For me, the biggest crime is how wholly unnecessary all of it ends up being.	1

AND how could Luke leave his family when he knows how much danger they could be in? On that note, how could Han do the same?Explain how Fin, a young stormtrooper janitor, could even last a second in a Saber battle with Ren?Neither Luke or Anakin excelled that fast.Finally, after waiting 32 years to see what happened to Luke Skywalker, they tell us that we need to wait two years to hear him utter a word?!?! Thats borderline cruelty in my opinion. All in all, epic failure	0

8edcfd88-3f5c-43ed-bf83-e0417f23ca2d	  JJ Abrams has made a movie that looks better the the green screen prequel, but lacks imagination and is full of more plot hole it could be an episode of LOST. Movies have one Job. Put it on the screen. This movies fails at that simple task. Ford being the biggest actor in the film shows he can do the job but his weight hurts the movie as Abrams gives Ford what he's wanted from the beginning. This acted is poorly used and a waste as the poorly case actor that plays Kylo Ren doesn't have the look to connect him to his parentage. His look has me questioning if his mother had a visit from a milkman while his father was out.  The last act which leaves more WTF feelings and questions also robs the very lame Villian his one goal. Be scary. Giving Rey a victory so easly in this movie franchise, was the biggest an most unforgivible mistake. It's robs Kylo Ren of any fear his character might have had before he took of his mask. This is the reason I feel so many don't like his character and feel he is an emo brat, then a super villian.  Over all the movie is a rental and will be remembered as the worst SW movie to date.	0
529e81c9-f954-4603-8c3f-4ebe55d50bed	  Force Awakens is kind of movie which makes you miss James Cameron. The visionary director who actually understands the need and desire of the audience. Force Awaken even lacks the philosophy offered by original movie. It's a product which is made with only one intention, 'Feed the hungry fans and cash the cow'.Starting with the story, it was like watching A New Hope's mesh up with Jurassic World. All elements of the Original movie were present. The Trio of young characters, the good turned bad antagonist and his relationship with the protagonist. Even the death star and some old stars were there. There absolutely is no real goal in the movie. We movie from securing the map to preparing the Jedi to destroying the death star. And story itself has holes big enough to swallow a galaxy which is far far away. It seems that in last 30 years only earth have progressed in technology and biological domain, the galaxy which was so advance 40 years ago, now seems be living the same. Like the original series, antagonists are not killed and neither the family of protagonist is revealed. I wonder if they have any idea about DNA and biology. Also it's not clear that how come antagonist know a lot of technology. From a 30 years old spaceship to a newly built death star. She knows the right circuits to pull out. Characters seemed to be very distant throughout the movie. There absolutely was no chemistry between Han Solo and Princess/General Lea. Who unexpectedly is never mentioned to be from Jedi family. Although after recent success of female protagonist oriented film series, they did pass the torch to a girl.Moving to visual effects and cinematography, perhaps the focus really was to add unnecessary and blunt action sequence. Much like prequels directed by George Lucas, colors were blurred and not so bright. There was no need to watch the movie in Imax or 3d, the worst a director can do to a 3d movie. J J Abrams really lacked a vision here. It is just like watching a 2d film.Acting is okie, Although I did not understand some of the wits. Daisy Ridley is great in her role. She wore the role over and is the best thing in movie crossover. Harrison Ford is good and easy in his role. Carrie Fisher is alright. She did not have much to do that explains more than enough make up even at crucial times. John Boyega and Oscar Isaac played split up of Han Solo's character with not much required jokes.One goes with high expectation but returns very disappointed.	0

cbe1b047-bb1e-46ef-a61a-2a1e2c83d75e	  No Star Wars feel at all, rather a generic dumb SF with some SW-elements thrown in. Absolutely not worthy of the SW name. Poorly written, badly directed and badly edited. Poor action choreography with way too fast cuts. Jarring camerawork (too close placing, unnecessary movement and "flashy angles") that breaks with the established visual style of the saga, and pulls the audience out of a galaxy far away. Inconsistencies, abandoned characters, unfocused storytelling, unimaginative settings, poor performances. In no logical way a sequel to ROTJ.	0
d1c43828-9a31-42b2-bd57-5fc9f4770955	  Horrible character development, completely implausible situations and a glaring lack of chemistry define this PC reboot of the original Star Wars. We have the Stormtrooper who inexplicably develops a conscience, but no explanation as to why we have Stormtroopers sans Empire. One of our heroes, Poe, is...wait, who is he? We're supposed to care about him...why? And, of course, we have our main hero, a girl who's a junk dealer/ scavenger. At the drop of a hat, she becomes an ace pilot, master mechanic and Bruce Lee Jedi all rolled into one. Then we have our villain, who delivers all the menace and malevolence of Leave it to Beaver's Eddie Haskell while wearing a mask for no reason. Throw in a giant Area 51 alien to replace the Emperor, the First Order to replace the Empire and the Resistance to replace the Rebellion and it's time to search for Luke Skywalker. You see, Luke ran away to hide after one of his Jedi pupils turned out to be a bad boy. In the end, we can only hope that our new hero, Rey, will inform Luke that all this Jedi training is unnecessary in the first place- after all, she had only to pick up a light saber in order to make Darth Maul look like Pee Wee Herman. In the end, this film's only redeeming quality is the opportunity to see Han Solo and Chewbacca on the big screen for the first time in over thirty years, and even this left something to be desired.	0

2cf0a6a0-9c61-43f6-8368-33fad03e365c	  What a complete and utter waste of time and money, and a total erasure of the excitement I had to revisit and enjoy even part of the magic from my childhood experience.Garbage story. Bad character development. A couple of absolutely horrible casting choices and stilted performances. Loaded with clich�s. Entirely derivative from A New Hope - except without any of the charm, mystery, and intrigue. I'm not going to waste time talking about droids with hidden information, hiding under Falcon floor plates, or Death Star channel runs and destruction. It's all far too apparent when you see the film.Want to care about the characters and their stories? Impossible. Even the ones you used to are less than shadows of what they were. Sorry, Harrison, I love you. But aside from a couple of cool moments, Han Solo - one of the most beloved characters of all time - was just completely BLAH. It's an unforgivable insult that this is the drivel that was given to you.Finn. Rey. Poe. Phasma. Ren. Why care about any of them? They are all ridiculously underdeveloped and utterly uninteresting. They are either too perfect (Rey), too pathetic (Finn), disappear and reappear inexplicably and in the most superficial way (Poe), or just not fleshed out whatsoever (Phasma, who really looked cool and could have been built up to something really bad ass - a new Boba Fett. But she was rendered completely insignificant and glossed-over).Kylo Ren. This is our new villain? Seriously? Could he have been any less interesting or weak? He turned out to be nothing more than a tempestuous, troubled teenager. There was no compelling setup or background for his battle with dark and light. He even beared no resemblance to his parents, Han and Leia. And if you want to build any interest over a character with a hidden face and intimidating appearance, you do not unmask him in the first film, let alone have it be that kind of anti-climactic reveal.General Hux. The worst casting of the entire film. The worst acting. And the Nazi reference was just gag-inducing.The movie was ridden with non-sensical stuff. Star Wars used to make sense. There was a sensible lore. Force users needed intense training, or they stood zero chance. How about some scavenger - unrealised force powers or not - able to fly a totally unknown ship with such efficacy and impossible skill? She resisted powerful force mind probes. She could out force-grab a light saber. Rey was all but victorious over a trained and 'powerful' Sith apprentice? Flinn - a SPACE JANITOR and rookie Storm Trooper - virtually holds his own against this trained Sith with a Jedi weapon he's never used before? Seriously?And the incongruencies abound. Ren can deflect point blank blaster shots behind his back, but can't detect and defend himself from a distant shot from a wookie who screams and reveals his position? We're supposed to be impressed or scared of this guy? He displays awesome initial powers, but ends up almost totally inept, and little more than a tantrum-throwing teenager?Han solo, one of the baddest and coolest good characters gets murdered over a touchy-feeling family moment and thrown into an abyss? What a fitting end. (rollseyes)There are so many negative things to say about this movie. And the only positives are a few moments of wonderful cinematography and VFX. Even the score was sub-par, which is a shocker from the greatest of all time. Almost everything about TFA was abysmal. Some of the tone was there. But this was light years from the Star Wars we knew and loved thirty-plus years ago.No wonder. No mystery. No lore. No build up. NO SIGNIFICANT, BELIEVABLE OR INTERESTING DRAMA. A complete failure to set up the most basic emotive themes like the first movies explored so successfully.By the time I was halfway through the movie, I was repeatedly throwing my hands in the air. This is a horrid re-entry for a franchise that was supposed to be resurrected and freed from the incapable clutches of a next-to-incompetent George Lucas.Well, we found out there are more incapable movie makers and IP owners. 4 billion dollars bought what we knew and loved, and the most bland product was funneled through the bowels of idiocy and incompetence. Yet it appears they are going to end up recouping it all and actually profiting. Such is the current state of modern cinema.Shameful.30 years we waited for this. I had so much hope this would be good with no Lucas. It would have been so hard for it to fall further from my expectations. I am absolutely gob smacked it's being received so well.Has the bar been set this low?	0
6eb85dae-a63e-4288-9ff9-60c03e5c91b4	  Terrible movie. I got no idea what are the good comments are about.If so please advice me on this.1. The Republic Planets got DESTROYED by a bigger more powerful weapon. And what were their reactions? Absolutely nothing. They didn't even know the Resistance were there helping to Stop them being shoot AGAIN! 2. What with this bad father hood crap? Darth Vader and Luke, Han Solo and his Son. And probably this new girl is Luke daughter. They all are not great father which causes all these things! A new scheme already please.3. Luke won the war, destroyed the empire best weapon and their Sith lord how come The resistance and the Republic are so damn weak this past 30 years?The dark side created a better weapon. And the good side still fight with junks? Didn't even have any bombs on their plane machines to destroy the weapon... All thanks to Han Solo self carries bombs!4. And what with this so easy stuff? Just go in there, capture a robot and you can Destroy the most important part of the weapon... The SHIELD. And just walk around undetected in an enemy base and you find everything you want!THIS IS WAY TOO TERRIBLE. A BIG LET DOWN!	0

bc4b904d-d6f1-4108-b68f-30c933bbc692	  Overhyped movie of this year. Basically a regurgitation of the first series of Star Wars. Complete with the heroine being just like her dad Luke living in the desert wanting nothing to do with the force. The Republic planets get destroyed again. Of course someone dies off the platform of the ship after their family member kills them. They have a new robot that has all the important info. Also they shoot to kill the death star again and the falcon js the ship of use. They have the scene of going into the weird creature bar all over again. Lots of cameos from the old crew still acting the same like hans solo owing ppl money. Action-packed, good acting, some humor, nice effects, but nothing new. The only surprise was that a girl was the heroine and that a storm trooper turned good. Yawn they played it too safe to the original franchise. I sincerely hope they up their game for the next one.	1
276e6183-cdbc-4e23-ae68-09672d1a0950	  This movie was basically a complete rip-off of the original Star Wars movies.1. Android carrying message of extreme importance is sought after.2. Rey is a ripoff of Luke in every way, they are both orphans they both live on a desert world, and both are super powerful with the force yet do not realize it. 3. Death Star is "Big Weapon" in this movie4. Admiral and Kylo Ren have the same relationship as the Admiral and Darth Vader. Both at odds with methodology of crushing the resistance. 5. A cast of characters convenes and determines that the "Big weapon" has ONE tiny exploitable weakness.6. Darth Vader and Kylo Ren looks pretty much identical. 7. The father/son bond between the arch-villain and hero.8. The emperor is only presented as a mysterious figure via hologram. Need I go on? This movie is such a ripoff of the original three that it's beyond comical. Another lazy sub par Star Wars movie. The ONLY difference is that the acting is pretty good in this movie. Credit JJ Abrams for this.What a rotten egg...	1
99efecec-467a-4999-8c6c-5b74d4cf6125	  (spoilers) A disappointing number of questionable scenes top off by the scene where a newbie force user defeats a trained force user in her first light saber duel. The better scenes were the death of Hans Solo and parts of the new bar scene. Notable characters were General Hux and SL Snoke. There are some interesting mysteries for the next episode. Who will carry the movie after the death of Hans Solo? Has Luke been training Jedi in his hideout? Is SL Snoke really Darth Plagus?The saddest part of the movie was the plot. Couldn't they think of something besides the good guys saving the rebellion at the last minute by blowing up a planet/solar system killing machine?Speaking of which, didn't any science advisor point out that when you start draining a sun in a solar system you immediately allow all the planets to fly out of their orbits killing the populations within hours if not minutes?These defects turn this sci-fi fantasy into a sci-fi farce.	0

6653d747-e767-4605-ae4c-a330b2cd119a	  Whilst changes to the saga were always going to happen, Star Wars feels like it's been shrunk down to planetary skirmishes.Although some plot items have been increased in size, the sense of scale that battles previously had has been lost, which is disappointing.When coupled to the hit and miss with the new characters, this feels like a film lacking the charm of either IV, V and VI or the updated wow factor which I, II and III had.	1
df938959-0790-4b37-ae54-28f3fa05fe67	  A big steaming pile of derivative garbage. This film does not stand on it's own two feet, relying heavily on nostalgia to prop up this un-original and labored plot. Screenwriter was the easiest job on this project by far, basically just changing the names on the storyline from the original (Episode IV). This was a pointless exercise in re-hashing, and its a shame the fanboys and fangirls seem to be giving it a free pass.	0
698c6d77-8e61-406f-8985-58341258db43	  Just saw the movie last night for the first time. I opted for the 3D version, and took the family. First, the good. Visuals and quality of the scenes was excellent, and Disney (and Abrams) experience at making films and worlds that are easy on the eye was apparent. Abrams also did a nice job with lighting and angles on most of the shots which accentuated the characters and definition of each scene. The 3D was mostly spectacular, with not too much and not too little, but just the right amount of depth (with a few in your face "coolness" moments) to make the extra $ worth it. Resolution and clarity was excellent, although with all 3D movies due to the technology, brightness of the scenes continues to suffer somewhat.However, beyond the big budget quality of the film, there was not much more to like. The story line was dull, there was little suspense, portions of the acting seemed amateurish (Fin in particular), and I felt like I was watching a copy of the original movies. There were at least 3 moments in the film where I was visibly shaking my head back and forth and rolling my eyes over the predictable and downright plagiarist nature of the film (I won't spoil it).If you are expecting a seat of your pants, action thriller with new creative elements, and storylines that make you care about the characters, this movie is not for you. If you want to be mildly entertained for a few hrs by good 3D and pretty scenes, you won't be disappointed.	1
2f48bb65-8eaf-46ca-9b51-2d2ee3f9408c	  A good action film but not a great Star Wars film. Enjoyable to watch but the idea that Kylo Ren could be defeated by either Rey or or Finn is ridiculous, and that Chewbacca could have shot him is also ludicrous. Kylo is the least intimidating evil-doer and only managed to kill his father in a cowardly Vader-killing-Kenobi style scene. The final scene with Luke Skywalker made me crack up...	1
3816616d-5a5b-485d-a90a-d02985633a08	  While the mass hysteria, expectations born 40 years ago and uber-hype surrounding Episode 7 may brainwash the millions of lemmings out there (and I realize I now risk incurring their wrath), the Force does not awaken, but rather slumbers through what is essentially a bloated remake of the beloved 1977 classic. A very good film for the new Star Wars generation without question, but for us old-school aficionados to which the original trilogy is cinematic scripture, it fails to deliver any lasting emotion, excitement or resonance. Another resistance, another Empire (now called The First Order), another Cantina, even a planet revamped and masquerading as a pseudo Death Star??? Seriously!?!?! I'm not being overly critical, really I'm not. I'm just being true to Lucas' original vision and trilogy and I know there must be other intelligent, genuine cinephiles out there in their 40s who agree with me and know exactly what I'm talking about. Make no mistake, this is not a terrible film. It's passable in every regard. But for those of us who remember the magic and majesty of the original trilogy, it's like having a sip of Coke from an open can that's been sitting on a counter for a month and has long lost its fizzle and taste.	1
4ef3fbbe-71f2-46d2-970e-ff42e59a5201	  Very disappointed. Same plot as original...blow up "death star" in basically the same way, same fighter battles, same light saber battles. Undeveloped relationship among protagonists, who fall for each other after one fight.	0

23ebeb9a-24ac-4dc4-9354-fdfaab55a7f6	  Great effects, sound, acting and have it fills of funny moments, too bad the story feels too much like the original movie from 1977. I understand that they went for the old time feel of the classic but the story seems more of a copy then a continuation of the franchise. I hope it will open up for the next 5 movies to be more innovative and creative.	1
b01ed4cf-d8d2-479c-9125-360686ef1596	  My O my. OK the rebel forces might be destroyed by a large weapon unless can shut down defenses to allow an attack to destroy it. Is this the first one or the third one or the 4th one...and the Jedis who can move stuff and kick ass....and can see the future sometimes....well..didn't/don't. I liked the movie for the same reason as most. I find it ironic that during the film the part that got the most cheers was the Millennium Falcon. Predictable Fun. JJ was true and loyal to the first three. I liked it and will probably see it again as it dribbles into the history of the universe. Was it bad...no....but if not a Star Wars Movie....the truth is I think most would say "it was Okay."	1

Fun for the old fans, comprehensible to those of us who are less experts and more just along for the ride. But the highest praise of all for an excellent female lead role!	1
bb256f62-2202-457a-9f1f-1217572e0841	  Its watchable but not as good as a Lucas film. The good bits: as a little walk down memory lane reminiscing of the old magic, the old crew (specifically Harrison Ford), Daisy Ridley, a lot of action. Daisy Ridley does one of the best jobs I've ever seen of portraying a powerful yet still feminine and human female role model.The bad bits: there's no heart or magic to this film (as there was in every Lucas film). Its just a rehash of old stuff with little character development or pause for atmosphere (something Lucas was great at). He made you feel. Feel part of the story. This is just a series of excitements occurring one after another. If Solo and Chewbacca were not in it, this would be nothing more than a so-so TV B-movie. Maybe this is what American teenagers want to pay to see. If thats the case, they're in for an exciting future because there's a promise of endless of these without Harrison Ford in them. A notable point of failure in the nostalgia - the Millennium Falcon, even having sat in a scrap yard and left rotting for decages, in this film worked better than it ever had.	1
78f484fb-b67d-4911-b66b-6aa89add3bd8	  After seeing it twice, I don't like it.First, the movie is a medley of sorts of the original trilogy (particularly ep. IV), only the plot is way more confusing. I keep reading additional content (like that Aftermath) and I still can't fully grasp what's the situation of the galaxy. It's a mess, and this should have been explained in the movie (having to dig information elsewhere is frustrating). Also, a new Death Star? Really?Second, the pacing is weird. The first half of the movie is somewhat stronger than the second. The ending feels like it doesn't fit and it doesn't feel much like Star Wars.Third, the villains are weak. You can't stop comparing Gen. "Mux" with Tarkin, "KillO'Ben" with Vader, and "Supreme Leader Snarf" with Palpatine - and they all fail to deliver (and it's not the actor's fault...). That Kylo Ren is the stupidest character since Jar Jar Binks. Nothing he says makes sense. "I'll finish what you started..." What did Vader start to begin with? Palpatine founded the Empire, Palpatine started hunting down the jedi, Palpatine started every war in both the classical and prequel trilogies... so what the heck is this kid talking about? Finally, having a loving father and mother, being son of two of the greatest heroes of the galaxy wasn't enough... Having the strongest force user as uncle and master is not enough... Somehow he bounded to Supreme Leader Snarf will and - then they repeat the plot again? At least we had 3 movies to try to understand Anakin's fall. By the way, nobody told this stupid kid that the grandfather he worships so much came back to the light before he died? Oh, but that's not enough. The stupid kid had to lose the lightsaber fight so we could grasp how dumb and weak he is. Kylo Ren is like "Cartman with Authoritah fell to the dark side" - but dumber.Forth, why wasn't the big imperial ships protecting the big bad base as well? Why that stupid name, "First Order"? Why captain Phasma lowered the shield (the price for such treason should be surely death or worse... oh, forget it). Why make lots of puppets and then make Maz Kanata CGI? The movie kept reminding me it was just a movie!Also, that dialogue between Han and Leia. So much of it was unnecessary... Which brings me to what I hated the most about the movie, and the main reason I'm giving it such a low score: it erases anything good and fulfilling we had at the end of Return of the Jedi. Every single one of the original heroes failed miserably in every aspects of their lives. Where is the reward for being good, just and do heroic deeds?So... Han failed as a husband, as a father, as a member of the resistance and overall as a man (a bitter one it seems)... same goes for Leia (oh, she is a general of a sidekick cell that's supported by the republic... great). Luke is the worse of them all: failed as a jedi master, failed as a protector of the galaxy, as uncle, as friend, as brother, as the owner of R2D2... the plot seemed to be around finding Luke, but the movie ends and he's done nothing and you get to wonder: why? Why do they need him? What do they need him for? The resistance certainly can handle any new Death Star that appears, and it seems the plumber trooper and junkyard girl can surely handle the stupid angry kid. All that, and R2D2 being in a coma because he's sad sounds so absurd... Didn't the little droid survived the killing of younglings by Anakin Skywalker? Didn't he watch the purge of the jedi and the founding of the Empire?Well, I guess that's it. I had to watch it 2 times to be sure I didn't like it, but the more I think about it, the worse it gets. I was going to keep it to myself, but after seeing how angry "the real fans" are getting at anyone that disagree with them, I felt I had to come and share with you, that also didn't like the movie, that you are not alone. I can only hope the next one will end up being so good it's going to redeem this one.	0

When he is angry he destroys the Console with his lightsaber instead of killing the messanger. There is not really any story behind it. just a combination of old topics. Nothing is really new. And the new Actors are terrible. This movie don't deserve a rating at all. That's more made for from the production straight into the video store. terrible	0

I've read most of the books that follow Ep.6. .I had heard that Disney did not want George Lucas involved (somewhat understandable after Ep.1), but they have obviously decided that they also could care less about long-time Star Wars fans & the existing Star Wars storyline. The one thing that Lucas did right is that he insured that the books, TV series, etc. were all consistent re: the long-term storyline. Disney obviously decided that this was no longer necessary & COMPLETELY changed what occurs in the future of the original characters. For example: in the books, Leia & Han have a really good marriage & have 3 children: twins Jacen & Jaina & younger son Anakin. Luke does not disappear, but instead marries & has a son Ben. Various things happen to all of them, but nothing like this movie. Han doesn't die in the books. The children & the names of the kids have been changed. (Han's son "Ben" does not even remotely look like he could be the son of Han & Leia btw.) The 3 main characters have dire things happen to them, but nothing like this movie. I own all of the previous dvd's. I own almost every Star Wars book made .(I read many books, but especially science fiction.) I HATED this movie. I will not buy this dvd, nor will I go to the movies to see the next 2 episodes or buy those dvd's. I'm not sure if I will ever go to a theater to see another Disney movie after what they've done with this movie. I resent the fact that they felt that long-term fans are irrelevant & could be disregarded in this way. Disney (& JJ Abrams) really screwed up the Star Wars franchise (IMO obviously) far worse than George Lucas ever did.PS- 2 dimensional characters & minimal plot didn't help the movie either.	0

Disney (& JJ Abrams) really screwed up the Star Wars franchise (IMO obviously) far worse than George Lucas ever did.PS- 2 dimensional characters & minimal plot didn't help the movie either.	0
800c9b93-88f3-492c-8cec-3bbe22f42a1f	  Good Remake. Well executed, not very good BUT... the end lacks a little script. Not sure if it was planned to have a REALLY bad last 5min.	1
d3becf5e-0258-4422-b42f-a9b9970986e0	  I have seen all Star Wars movies and unfortunately including this one.When J.J Abrams did a reboot of Star Trek, I was pleasantly surprised even as I was dismayed that Star Trek was turned into something it was not--a low brow action flick. But I also enjoyed the sequel--Star Trek: Into Darkness--with some reservation.Back to Star Wars: I did not like this movie and I did not understand what it's intent was. The story telling was poor, the acting was poor, the animation was poor , the use of 3D was poor and it did not have the largess of a typical Star Wars movie. It lacked polish through and through and it turned the force into a side joke. It might be fair to say that it destroyed Star Wars for any loyal fan. I am not sure of the impact it will have for younger viewers who have never seen Star Wars before this one.My expectations might have been too high, but the only person who has done Star Wars right so far has been George Lucas.I can suspect that the challenge of rebooting a franchise can be a daunting task. I am sure that the was work was hard and it is easy to be a critic, but this was a poorly done movie.	0
6185c986-c9c5-43d8-9a7d-fdad501f3b88	  The ideas in this screenplay must have come from a fear of failure rather than an opportunity to create a new fresh path that would add to the Star Wars franchise. They take the "Luke I am your Father" idea from "Empire" and transfer it to Harrison Ford this time. Then they take the Death Star idea and from the original Star Wars and just give it the ability to kill multiple planets at the same time. And the protagonists are not real. The Daisy Ridley character is an expert at everything! In the original Star Wars we hear that Luke is an excellent pilot but he must spend time training with Obi Wan to gain skills with the light sabre -- then when he fights its believable! Not Rey -- she's an expert pilot, mechanic, and an instantaneous expert at with the light sabre with no training at all -- she defeats the main antagonist who has ostensibly spent his life training with the light sabre for the dark side. When we go into a film like this we know of course it's not real -- and so its the job of the writers to draw us in by making the characters feel real human which means they all have certain strengths and weaknesses -- They really need to let George write theses stories as he's a very creative writer -- this is his baby and he knows where it needs to go.	0
841ede48-96c8-4c6f-a189-dccab43dd987	  This review is rated SPOILERIFIC by Fly Casual Podcast. Virgin eyes and ears have been warned.The Force Awakens is here! FINALLY! After a year and a half of all the news, rumors and outright wackiness (at least from the crew at Fly Casual Podcast), we have our first taste of the new age of Star Wars. JJ Abrams and Disney deliver on the most anticipated movie of the year in a BIG way. As I write, The Force Awakens has been crowned king of the domestic box office $770 Million in gross receipts and has broken a myriad of records. Worldwide, the film is currently at $1.5 Billion with the movie opening in China today. The movie is at 93% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. What's not to like about this movie?There are a million different angles you can take on this, so instead of me trying to rationalize each and show how smart I think I am for having such a broad view, I am just going to give you my background with Star Wars to set the stage for this review so you get the sense of where I am coming from. I am a forty-something who has seen all of the films in the theater, albeit A New Hope was at the 1979 re-release. I grew up in the 80's with my Kenner Star Wars toys and have been there since the beginning. I avidly partook in what was called the Star Wars Expanded Universe (EU) which is all the books, games, and extra-movie material that came out almost from day one. I am what you would call an uber-fan of Star Wars. Not only is The Empire Strikes Back my favorite of the movies, I think it is one of the greatest films of all time. I love John Williams's scores for the films. I love Ben Burt's sound production. When people think of how a laser bolt sounds, they are actually hearing Ben Burt hitting a ground wire on a telephone pole with a wrench and the resulting vibrations. I am deeply entrenched in this stuff to the point that I co-host a Star Wars podcast with other Uber nerds and debate this stuff. I appreciate George Lucas's vision, but I am not an apologist. The man has flaws and they were on full display in the prequels. But don't get me wrong; I don't hate the prequels. Like most people leading up to this movie I had fun debating what we would see with the Disney/JJ Abrams incarnation. Listeners of Fly Casual over the last year and a half know how deeply we delved into these discussions. It's been lots and lots of fun. BUT, would the movie live up to the hype?As regular listeners of the show know, I was "not available" on December 17 when the rest of the Fly Casual crew went to see the movie and recorded Episode 70 live immediately after the movie. Following is my addendum to that episode.I have now seen the movie 4 times. Believe it or not, I saw it 3 times in the first 24 hours! I didn't realize this until a friend pointed it out. The first was by myself the evening of the 17th. I couldn't see it with the guys, but made it happen later at the 11:15 showing at our local theater. This was by far, my least favorite of the four times due in part to my criticisms of the film, a bladder FULL of Diet Coke, and over 3 hours of run time when you include trailers! My second viewing was the next day with my business partner. We skipped out and saw the film at the same theater at the 11 AM showing. My criticisms remained, but my "under-control-bladder" situation helped immensely with increased enjoyment levels. Later the same evening, my kids begged me to take them, so what's a dad to do? I felt pretty much the same at this viewing that I did at the viewing earlier in the day, but we were in a different theater that had the volumes MUCH higher and at a far more enjoyable level for me.My final viewing was in IMAX 3D. Now, our local "IMAX" theaters aren't true 70mm, but I am not a fan of 3D to begin with and this viewing did little to change that. I am not sure that seeing the film in 70mm would have helped, BUT the sound was even better with the demonstrably superior sound system in the theater.So let's just get this out there now. I am not "gaga" over the film as most people are and the way that most of my cohorts on Fly Casual are. I don't dislike the film. It was good! It has some very strong points. But the movie is not the home run I had hoped for leading up to its release. So let's get into the nitty gritty.The GoodGoing into the film, EVERYONE was buzzing about the "practical effects" that JJ Abrams planned to employ in the film. For the most part, he did not disappoint. Many felt like one of the things that made the original trilogy great was Lucas's limitations with special effects that forced him to rely on landscapes and well-conceived camera angles to deliver his film. When the effects-heavy prequels rolled around, Lucas seemingly forgot what made the originals great and embraced what many feel were lifeless performances by his actors due to lack of directing and nothing but green-screen sets to play off while delivering their performances. Abrams seems to have found the right balance of special effects and live sets. The film certainly felt more grounded, even if some of the sets and landscapes were too reminiscent of past films. If it looks like Tatooine and sounds like Tatooine and smells like Tatooine then why are we on Jakku???? In my opinion, Daisy Ridley stole the show. The character Rey was the right amount of everything: vulnerable, strong, gorgeous, expressive, funny, and "Roberta Badass." Some are actually criticizing the character as being a "Mary Sue," but I am all about it. She is definitely the new Luke in the series and I am excited about having an intriguing female character like this being the new lead in Star Wars.Lupita Nyong'o's character, Maz Kanata, almost, stole the show from Rey... almost. By far she had my favorite line in the movie, "Where's my boyfriend? I love that Wookie." The character is a Yoda analogue; a character that has been around for a millennia and has seen it all. With lines like, "I have lived long enough to see the same eyes in different people. I see your eyes. I know your eyes" one would think that in order to portray such a deep character you would need a wizened sage of an actor. Well look no further than barely-30-something Nyong'o. Her performance was brilliant. Han Solo is one of those iconic characters you don't want to screw up. Everyone is thankful for Harrison Ford and his $23 million return to the role. Han and Chewie are definitely a highlight of the film. There were a few times that Ford showed his age (running away from rathtars) and one time that Abrams skated dangerously close to the absurd (no-look shooting). But he represented the old guard well going toe to toe with Ridley and Boyega. He brilliantly portrayed a still brash and reckless Han Solo who IS 30 years older AND wiser. He will be missed from the franchise. I don't want to say that John Boyega's character Finn was the "surprise" hit of the film, but it felt that way to me. By all accounts leading up to the film, he was a talented actor and was expected to be the next Luke Skywalker in the series. I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was because going in, our only real exposure to him was one or two lines in the trailers and a lot of desert sweating. A LOT of sweating. To my delight, I loved Finn's character, who, by the way, is closer to a Han Solo than a Luke Skywalker. Finn is a loner who wants to run away as far as he can from the First Order. He does this to the point that he is lying to EVERYONE around him about his true intentions. If not for his affinity for Rey, he would have been long gone, much like Han's affinity for Leia in the original trilogy and desire to have nothing to do with the Rebellion. He was certainly a heavy part of the comic relief. I am interested to see where this character goes. I think I know where just about everyone else is going. Finn is up in the air.Adam Driver's character Kylo Ren has received mixed reviews from the people with whom I have spoken. Most critics are saying that he is not "evil" enough to be the new trilogy's villain. He is whiny and out of control. To me, these are the things I LOVE about him. Here is a darkside Force user who is being tempted by the LIGHT! He is a Skywalker! I am actually glad that we have a villain that isn't a scarred-beyond-recognition-amputee! I want to know more about him. Why did he betray Luke and the Jedi? What happened during the rebellion? Why is he so obsessed with Vader? How does Snoke play into his betrayal. I also thought that despite having to set up this character very fast to get to the payoff of the Solo death scene, both he and Ford played it as well as it could be played. From the tear shedding by Ren that had us believing for a moment that he was going to go with his father to the final touch of Solo's hand on Ren's face. Kudos on the performance. I am a fan. The BadAnyone who knows me understands that Luke was my hero growing up. The day I heard we were getting Ep VII and that the original cast was back I started conjuring images in my mind of Luke's return to the silver screen and the badassery that must ensue. Fast forward to December 18. Saying I was a little disappointed would be an understatement. I get it. The movie turned into the quest for Luke. Rumors early on were suggesting a very limited role for Mark Hamill in the film. I was somewhat prepared, but I really didn't think we wouldn't even be getting a single line from Luke. Listeners of Fly Casual know about what we call the "Fan Boy Wet Dream." In said "dream" scenario our hope was more along the lines of Luke being found and participating in the final battle sequences. Instead we get a robed figure turning around and pulling down his hood. Que music. I am taking this as well as I can and hoping for previously mentioned badassery to commence in VIII AND IX. Don't let me down Rian!John Williams is THE MAN! He has written every major movie score throughout my youth, formative years, and adulthood. The man is a genius with scores like Star Wars, ET, Indiana Jones, Jaws, Harry Potter, and a million others. The man is also 83 years old. The score for this film felt like an 83 year old man wrote it. What I mean is that it is not very memorable, with the exception of classic trilogy themes, I really don't remember the soundtrack at all. Even though Attack of the Clones is my least favorite of the films, I still remember the Anakin/Padme love theme which was brilliant. The best I can say about the new score is that I remember hearing the Rey theme and remember liking it, but please don't ask me to hum it. This is more than a little disappointing. Part of the problem is that the sound track in general is mixed poorly in my opinion (see The Ugly below). It feels like JJ called up Williams, and in his head was like, "What?! Another one?" They paid him a bajillion dollars and he futzed his way through it. I will be frankly surprised if he returns for VIII at 85 years old. I think they should have thought more long term, ripped off the Band-Aid, and made the change now.I remember our very first cast of Fly Casual in the summer of 2014 and talking about Disney choosing JJ Abrams to direct. We saw JJ's involvement as a double edged sword. We all knew what he could do with "look and feel" through "Super 8" and the Star Trek reboots. But one of our earliest criticisms of him was that he tended to sacrifice story and originality for said "look and feel." The more the rumors and images poured in over the next year and a half. The more concerned we became. Unfortunately he did not prove us wrong. In many many ways, this film is almost a complete replica of A New Hope complete with desert dwellers, a young idealistic kid, a sage old man, a rogue, droid carrying secret data, a masked villain, and on and on and on. After seeing The Force Awakens, I am happy that JJ was involved, but I am somewhat relieved he won't be back for snow planets, metal walking tanks, and a city in the clouds called "Jackee" in Ep VIII. Can anyone explain who or what is the Republic? I thought there should be more exposition there. Now I do realize that the "Empire" was pretty vague at the time of A New Hope, but I think that was out of necessity at that time. I think they could have been clearer about the status of Coruscant and the New Republic. Captain Phasma: wait, what? Rathtars: Unnecessary. Didn't feel like Star Wars.The UglyAlluded to above, my biggest complaint with this film, by FAR, is the sound track. By "soundtrack," I don't mean the just the music. The music was only the tip of the ice berg. I mean the sound effects, the music, and the mix. Why they felt like they had to completely recreate the sound of laser bolts is beyond my comprehension. When they purchased Lucasfilm, they inherited Ben Burt's sound library complete with the most recognizable laser sound effects in existence. When someone describes a laser blast, I would argue that most people hear Ben Burt's version. Suddenly laser rifles sound like crappy 1970's sci-fi. I was stunned. Even light sabers were changed. HOW ON EARTH DO YOU SCREW UP LIGHT SABERS?! I'll even give them a pass on Kylo Ren's lightsaber since it is "unique." But Skywalker's light saber sounded more like a jet engine! Part of the reason none of the music was memorable to me is that I couldn't hear it most of the time. Foreign Correspondent Steve Potter in the UK shares many of my criticisms of the film. He has told me that he has purchased the musical score and after listening to it, isolated from the film, he actually likes it. If that is the case, if there really is good music to present, why the hell is it tucked so deep into the sound track? After my first viewing of the film, I was downright mad. Now part of that was because of previously said full bladder. But even after my second and third viewing, that criticism remained. I will admit that at my 4th viewing at the IMAX Theater, I was able to hear many of the classic and familiar sounds I missed in previous viewings, BUT I still had to concentrate to hear them. I felt like the soundtrack was REALLY rushed on this film... almost to the point that the film was unrecognizable and unenjoyable to me. Call me an uber-nerd if you want and you're probably right that most people don't care or recognize this as a problem, but I do. With JJ Abrams reputation for look and feel, this was an unexpected misstep in my opinion. As previously discussed, JJ's "return to the well" of A New Hope was a noticeable problem. The icing on the cake is Deathstar 3, aka Starkiller Base. This was an absolute eye roller to me. There HAD to be another way to bring the film to a climatic end. That was just damn poor writing, Mr. Kasdan. When the Resistance was in the war room and Poe pulled up the side-by-side of the Deathstar and Starkiler base, I thought I was going to lose it. JJ is getting a LOT of flack right now from Lucas and other critics for making a "nostalgia film." Had there not been a Deathstar 3, I would stand in defense of him. He honestly deserves all the criticism he gets for that one. This is a total lack of creativity in my opinion.My final criticism of the film will only be relatable to fans of the EU. Many of us waited eagerly to see if beloved EU characters Jacen & Jaina (Han and Leia's twin children) would make their big screen debut in The Force Awakens in the form of Kylo Ren and Rey. We knew there was at best a 50/50 chance these characters would transition over to the New Canon (or Disney's newly established Star Wars timeline which renders most of the prior EU irrelevant). But not only did they tell us that Jacen and Jaina will not exist, but they also flipped us the bird when they revealed Kylo Ren's birth name to be "Ben" Solo. You see, in the old EU, Luke's son's name was Ben. I know some in my circle of friends are patiently waiting and hoping for revelations/explanations or even other EU characters to end up in the movies. In my mind this is a clear sign that the EU will have no place in the new movies, and frankly, this disappoints me. I will still enjoy the films. I enjoyed this film. But it would have been nice to feel like the filmmakers threw the uber-fans a bone. The LowdownStar Wars films evolve over time with me. Right now, I can't give this film more than 3 out of 5 stars. Good movie. I really enjoyed it. My kids enjoyed it. The film will become part of my collection. But it just doesn't have the classic feel with me yet. I am not certain about the staying power. I will say that I am glad that there is mystery returning to the saga. With the prequels, you always knew where they were headed. That is an inherent problem with prequels. With these new sequels, anything is possible again and THAT is exciting!My Star Wars order of favorite movies:1. The Empire Strikes Back2. A New Hope3. Return of the Jedi4. The Force Awakens5. Revenge of the Sith6. The Phantom Menace7. Attack of the Clones	1
e7488283-0883-4a08-b292-c2d9433527d4	  I liked the movie. But it felt like episode of TV show rather than full feature, especially with all but "to be continued" after two hours of watching. I also had a feeling that I saw this movie before:Fool em' once - shame on the Sith Lord, fool twice twice - shame on rebels, fool them thrice - Star Wars: The Force Awakens!	1
db8b1a58-22f3-4966-b043-614c102c3df8	  Don't read if you haven't seen this movie. I was very disappointed to see that some of the cast members were recognizable stars from other shows/films. One of the best things about the series is the new faces. I don't want to see the stars from "Heroes" or "Girls" because it distracts from who they are meant to be in this film. Also, if you are going to cast the biological grown child of two characters, at least find someone who looks as though they MIGHT have come from them. Oh, and don't kill off the most popular character in the entire series! I won't be buying this movie.	1
9b1f93e2-c8d2-49df-8938-2b6114dff506	  Generally a decent movie, but if your looking for a film theory plot line, your going to be incredibly disappointed.	1
1f778bde-8365-4025-a83d-1a8ca351e69c	  It's as good as the other Star Wars movies. The excuse for a plot in this one is the same as the excuse for a plot in the original. The one good thing about this movie is that it's gotten JJ Abrams away from the Star Trek films, so maybe they'll have a plot again.	0

The creation of BB8. Save some money and re-watch A New Hope.	0
cd08bf83-7535-4c62-be54-f0fd2d7f355e	  Good acting, horrible plot. The lack of originality is massive, the screewriters and Abrams should be ashamed of the amount of plagiarism they put here. Copycat planets, copycat characters, copicat story. The movie is not a bad one, but with all the resources they had the results are embarassing.	1
339759ab-9a2d-47a8-a269-522c797cc9ef	  I wish I could give it less than half a star. Standalone, this movie would probably not be so bad. It would simply be another Disney movie. But it's not a standalone movie. and.. it was not supposed to be a Disney production.. (thank you Lucas.. hope you enjoy your millions). It's supposed to be a Star Wars sequel!After watching it opening night.. it was simply another disaster in a long line of disasters perpetrated by mega corporations on people's fond memories of films past. At least Jurassic World tried some to preserve the continuity of the original trilogy. Barring a few goofy missteps with raptors fighting alongside humans, it was a fairly entertaining remake. I had no hard feelings... but Star Wars is special.. It's our childhood. This movie made me appreciate the prequels! Have no desire to watch what happens next.. How can anyone want to see more? What's the "Empire Strikes Back" to this? The inept first order who only possessed one weapon requiring hours of charging and ignored buying some extra fleets of tie-fighters for good measure if they were swarmed? A goofy post-pubescent villain who evoked laughter rather than instill fear when he removed his mask. I was reminded of the time Dark Helmet in Space Balls removed his.. at least that movie was funny!How was the "force" the underdogs in this plot? Why go through the entire movie trying to find a lost Luke? Is he unreachable via the force? More importantly what's his role? We already have our Mary Sue to the rescue. She could very well have conjured a petronus charm and waved off all evil from the galaxy. I understand the need to provide a strong role model for 10 year old girls; movie seems to be targeted at the Frozen audience in that way..but seriously, even 10 year old girls know better and will hate this movie! Viewers are being misled. I am highly skeptical of the unusually large number of positive reviewers showered at this movie so close to release. It just rubs the cynical in me the wrong way. No way so many people liked it..anyone I run across who's watched it has mixed feelings or disliked it totally. But I guess studios have to create the hype for box-office ratings.I think this movie was riding on the success of the earlier movies. A true measure of success for this movie will be the second one.. which will have to stand on the shoulders of this disaster. Let's see how that goes. Will buy used dvd's for the next two to see what happens.. no way am I going to throw good money at this corporatized ideological nonsense. Maybe they hand it over to Michael Bay.. at least the action scenes would have some life.. cuz the rest of it is just one big black hole.	0

b8f0fd2a-2242-4dd7-9de6-ab318df93a9e	  I?m NOT a ?Star Wars? fan. Never have been, fortunately. But always loved watching action/science fiction movies. When I checked the internet, everywhere I saw that this movie had broken all Box Office records. Then I thought maybe, just maybe, this movie would be special . But it?s not, sadly.I found a lot of negatives than positives. Let me talk about the good part first. The special effects/graphics are amazing! And by ?special effects?, I also mean the beautiful landscapes on different planets, the action, the spaceships and the droids. (I loved BB8 in the movie). And now the negatives. The two things that I disliked the MOST are the story and the acting (by most of the actors).It?s difficult t prove my point without giving spoilers, but it is true that a LOT of the plot elements/ incidents are very similar/same to what has happened in the previous six movies. I was sincerely hoping that Lucas would take the story in brand new direction. But how wrong I was. Almost everything seemed like a repetition of what occurred in the earlier movies. I thought Lucas was very creative. But for some reasons, he decided not go for something original; he just presented the very same concept, that had worked many years back, again. Now about the acting. The veterans have done a great job. Ford (as Han Solo) was remarkable and Fisher (as Leia) was also nice but her role was quite less. Most of the newer/ younger cast were disappointing. John Boyega (as Finn) was irritating. Adam Driver (as Kylo Ren) failed to live up to his role. Ren is actually a very evil character but Driver just didn?t do much justice to the role. Daisy Ridley (as Rey) was very good but sadly her character itself was not sketched properly. What I mean is, Rey is actually a scavenger, surviving by herself on a hostile junkyard of a planet. Now such a person should be very tough and emotionless but she seemed to get emotionally attached to a lot of people. She seemed like a teenage fangirl when she says ?THE Han Solo!!?!!? and ?Luke Skywalker!!??!!!?. Overall, the film has failed to meet my expectations. I was expecting a lot from this film, in all the departments. The story was again a rehash of the previous movies. Most of the newcomer actors were not fit to play the roles they were assigned. After seeing this movie, it?s pretty easy to guess what?s going to happen in the sequel. I was never a ?Star Wars? fan and this movie has failed to change that.	1
3bf3aa0d-9a58-4611-a7b5-588cb158ee5e	  Great special effects, dull and samey plot with way too many cringeworthy references to the previous films and I thought some of the acting was poor. I actually nodded off twice...l love Star Wars but I was disappointed with this one :(	1
383d289f-1a6c-434b-b4b3-ea8ff792053b	  The first sequel in the new Star Wars sequel trilogy has been hyped up all year. Its been used to basically advertise everything, from trucks, to batteries, to oranges, etc. The movie was directed by J.J Abrams, though he was only brought in to direct The Force Awakens and not the other two in the sequel trilogy. The story, setting, and characters feel rehashed to a really big extent, It has good characters for the most part,and It feels like its rushed.  To begin with it has a really unoriginal plot. It basically mirrors A New Hope and the ending of The Empire Strikes Back. Most of its characters feels like rehashes like Rey being a copy and paste of Luke Skywalker. The settings feel exactly the same but with different names. Jakku is basically Tatoonie, its houses look the same, and the desert looks the same, just with a bunch of destroyed Rebel and Empire vehicles everywhere. The First Order's Starkiller Base is literally just a giant Death Star with a different name. It feels lazy altogether and could of used more creativity.  The Characters in the movie are hit or miss. Rey is too boring and dry. Kylo Ren is a Darth Vader fanatic who is childish, impatient and whiny. He throws a big temper tantrum when something doesn't go his way, which makes me hate him as a villain. Which is a good job to me.The character Finn in the movie was actually pretty good as he brought a new point of view as a defecting First Order storm trooper. A over hyped character named Captain Phasma appears for like 3 scenes and barely does anything, a total disappointment . Some of the actors from the original Star Wars trilogy comes back and they put on a pretty good performance. Most of the acting isn't bad but the acting that is, is down right terrible. Finally, the film feels rushed and made to only sell because of name not story. It seems extremely stale in the beginning and becomes exciting towards the end with tons of action. If they took more time it would go beyond of being a sub par movie. I would recommend seeing it, its a good OK movie for today's standards but nothing special. The original trilogy was special because it was made to be something different and was different from its time. The Force Awakens feels like it was trying to be too much like the original trilogy, but failed because of it.	1

18cf7de3-bc61-4674-b838-6df1ba3df778	  Semi spoiler review. Read at your own risk if you have not seen the movie and want to find out for yourself. Being an avid Star Wars fan I would have to say this movie was not anywhere up to par of where it should have been. Don't get me wrong it was a good movie but it could have been 100x better. The story is completely broken. Yes I know when star wars came out back in 1977 it was to also broken but at the same time George had the scripts made out to give the foundation for episodes 4, 5, and 6. I really commend Disney for bringing back Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and others that were part of the original saga but they screwed this up big time. I mean come on to me this looked like they took episodes 4 and 6 combined them together and added small pieces of the ending from episode 3 and called it a new movie. Come on if I wanted to see those movies again I would have just put them in my DVD player. The ending of episode 6 eliminates the Sith and the Imperial forces and in 7 all of a sudden you have a new Sith Lord with an apprentice. Where is the story at of where the Sith survived the destruction of the Death Star how they came to be. Then lets take the Death Star blow it up in size by 1000x (using a planet this time) and call it something completely different when in all actuality its still yet another Death Star. This is not original at all George Lucas did this twice. Terrible idea Disney. Then lets blow it up in almost the exact same way that it was blown up in Episode 6. While they are working on blowing it up lets take the way that episode 3 ends with Darth Vader getting his limbs chopped off left for dead and do almost the exact same thing to Kylo Ren except this time all we are going to do is put some cuts and slices on him from a lightsaber. Come on I have seen this already. Yes I know George Lucas was just a consultant on this movie but why have him as a consultant if every single idea that he gives you shoot down.I know I am probably being overly critical about this movie but I wanted to see something new something exciting and for me this movie did not do it all. Some of the graphics in my opinion were not George Lucas quality graphics. The lightsabers looked fake. To many edges and looked more like fire then a semi solide beam of light. And there are many more in the graphics that could have been much better.For this movie out of 5 stars I give a 2.5 and the only reason it gets this is because it did have some good action scenes. Even though the lightssabers looked fake to me the lightsaber battles were good. There was some suspense in the middle of the movie when the rebellion comes to help but after that the movie just falls off into the same old thing as before.I hope that when and if they release Episode 8 they do a much better job at telling the story and filling in the gaps that should have been put into this movie and make it 100x better in all aspects. The story, graphics, and even the battles.I wanted to see the Force Awakens not see hey heres the force it never left at all.	1

fff614ab-2591-4bf8-a405-06c1758516bf	  Story: D+Light Side Casting: B+Dark Side Casting: DVisuals: ASound Effects: AMusic/Score: CTHERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEWI read the gushing reviews, I heard from friends how amazeballs this movie was, and I went in with hope, hope that this would not fall prey to the failures of the prequels. This movie was better than the prequels, but there are still significant failings (although there is good here too)VISUALSVisually this movie is stunning, similar to JJ Abrams work in the Star Trek reboots. However, image isn't everything unfortunately, and the visuals can't make up for other failings (specifically storyline related)MUSIC/SCOREWhen I hear certain songs from the original, they conjure up images of specific characters, locations or entire scenes. There was a magic to the music of the originals and there is not one song that stuck with me from this film that will bring me back to it when I hear it.LIGHT SIDE CASTINGI felt that both Finn, Rey and BB8 were fantastic additions to the series and show promise. Poe fell a bit flat for me as did the CGI lady in the poor man's Cantina scene with the big glasses.DARK SIDE CASTINGMan, where do I begin? Kylo Ren, initially, is pretty cool, when he keeps his mask on. When he stops Poe's blaster bolt in midair AND holds it there, pretty damned impressive (even Darth could only swat away a bolt, never saw him stop one).But it's when the mask comes off that the character just loses all appeal. His visage doesn't inspire terror, fear or respect. He struts around like a temper-tantrum throwing man-child.Likewise, the General for the New Order was horribly cast as well, failing to inspire any confidence in his abilities to lead this galaxy-dominating armada. He, too, comes across as a temper-tantrum throwing man-child who is constantly tossing snarky remarks at Kylo Ren.Further destroying some of the immersion is that Kylo Ren looks nothing like Han and Leia's son, not one ounce.COMEDYThe comedy in this film, for me, was fantastic. A lot of hilarious moments that elicited outright laughter from the audience. JJ Abrams did this with the Star Trek reboots as well and succeeded I feel.STORYLINE AND PAYING HOMAGE TO THE ORIGINALSWhere this film really falters is that it tries too hard to pay homage to the originals. It pays so much homage, that it outright copies them, to the detriment of this film.The problem is that Abrams went too far in paying homage, which prevents this film from having it's own stand-out moments, its own ability to shine on its own merits.There is yet another super weapon, conveniently with a glaring weakness to exploit, this time it's just all bigger (the super weapon AND the weakness). And while the super weapon draining a sun to power itself was cool to see, the battle to stop it was a huge let-down. Sure, you get X-Wings and Tie Fighters, but that's it. Where are the massive capital ships, frigates and fleets to slug it out? We get none of that and this battle fails to pack any punch.Another major issue is the development of the two primary characters, Finn and Rey. Finn is just thrust upon us with little introduction, little reason to care about him or to even understand his decision to flee the New Order. We discover he was assigned to sanitation duty, yet we also see him participating in a ground assault and later he is able to outgun experienced tie fighter pilots in a ship he's unfamiliar with, doing a task (gunner) that one can only assume he is equally unfamiliar with. Later he almost holds his own in a lightsaber duel with an experienced Sith.Rey is too good. She's an orphaned scavenger who can fix things, fly things, shoot guns with perfect accuracy, duel with lightsabers and develops her force powers in about one minutes time and is then able to challenge a trained and experienced Sith in combat. Remember all the training that Luke had and he still struggled? Yeah, well we don't really get that here.Some would argue "oh, she's just a natural!" but I say poppycock! She's a natural at fixing things, shooting blasters, flying, lightsabers and the force? C'mon son!BB8 is a welcome addition to the franchise and has his own comedic moments and is certainly no Jar Jar.Han's death was painfully obvious and quite clich� in how it went down. Leia struggles to stand out like she did in the originals, Carry Fisher has been away from acting for too long methinks.Overall this film was a giant disappointment for me. Although there is some hope, perhaps a New Hope, on the horizon. With the director behind Looper at the helm of the next film, perhaps there is something that can be salvaged. I definitely feel that the new light side cast can help this trilogy shine, hopefully the dark side cast doesn't drag it down too much.	1

060fdbdf-e6fe-4efc-a8bc-bbcc4d6f9853	  In trying to recapture what made 'Star Wars' so special, director J.J. Abrams and new franchise owner Disney decided to introduce a bevy of young characters, along with some old fan favorites, over a plot that is -- for all intents and purposes -- the same as George Lucas' original film. Star Wars has always been mythic storytelling, and even the prequels featured elements mirroring the original films. But this entire approach struck me as lazy and trying to play it over-safe. To make matters worse, Abrams kind of already did this with his rebooted take on 'Star Trek' -- I expected more of him, frankly. To the filmmakers' credit however, the new cast shows a lot of promise; under the guidance of a director less willing to hang themselves up on nostalgia and take some chances, this could bode well for further installments of the new trilogy.	1

6554569d-156d-4e0d-80fc-7fd15908fd71	  Same rehash of original movie: fater against son, the bad guys have a super weapon which has to be destroyed.

4966274c-0070-4eae-8eb8-081dea7fd44c	  Not for adults.This movie had a lot more action than the original, and more simple humor for the kids. But there was no unexplained mystery, and that removed all the "mythic proportions" that of the saga that gave it so much appeal to the original fans. That which was not directly explained was hinted at SO many times, you would have to be mentally challenged to have missed it I don't have to see the next one ... I already know the "secret" they hinted (and hinted hinted at). Not a bad movie, but no great shakes.	1
d2409f54-c6bb-4a38-b364-5ccd98dcb1bf	  Very disapointing. Disney blew it, J.J. Abrams should stick with Star Trek..at least jar jar binks wasn't in it. You decide to use special affects to create that ridiculous Golem looking "Supreme Leader" when you should've used it on "General" Leia's face and her smokers voice. She looks like an old catchers mitt and sounds like Batman. Here's hoping for a better written and more thought out episode 8. Think, "what would George Lucas do?" Not, "how can we turn this masterpeice into a Disney movie?" #Lame	0

What was so good about this movie other than seeing the original characters back in action, BB-8 and other comic relief? The plot was nearly a carbon copy of Episode IV, except it was downright cartoonish in its silliness and the characters were even more one dimensional than in the prequels, albeit better actors but that's not saying much.. I wanted to love this movie so badly I was in denial until a few days after I saw it. Ask yourself if you are too..	0
78dc634e-6887-4791-983e-d8eed77d4ac1	  7 Things that Suck in this episode;1. Luke took two episodes to learn how to use the Lightsaber. Rey did it in 30 seconds.2. "Death Planet" attack plan was formulated like an elementary school recess. "Let's do the monkey bars next guys!!!", "Ya, Awesome!!!"3. Stormtrooper Vs Stormtrooper with a Lightsaber. C'MON... Really? Can I get a turn with it too?4. Han Solo and Princess Leia reunion. Weird and uncomfortable to watch. (Who wants to pay to see crazy Fisher act again anyway?)5. The whole movie's about a map? Is this a Goonies remake?6. New Sith Lord looks like an unused Lord of the Rings character. All this 80s tek and than you see this lame Gollum looking CG character. Is he supposed to be scary?7.First order has cool new ships. Rebells still have the same lame X-wing. (btw, nothing walks in this episode)	0
6adb7ac1-35de-4461-90f8-09c4fc8501b0	  An admission to start - I was never a Star Wars fan.But after seeing this latest mess I am utterly convinced that to think it is great cinema you simply need to have been touched by 'the force'........An illogical plot, bordering on the inane; simply awful acting - with even stars with a reasonable reputation, such as Harrison Ford, embarrassing themselves (though, perhaps death by light sabre is supposed to elicit a C grade death), and derivative in almost every way a movie can be.This is dross. Dross sprinkled with stardust, but dross nevertheless.	0

7c791be0-22b6-48cb-9cbd-f948bc641bde	  Awful movie. No new ideas were introduced in this film at all. The Force Awakens makes episodes one through 3 look like masterpieces. The characters are bland and have basically no depth. Mind you, I've watched this movie twice, and i found it even more enraging the second time through.	0
8955a6a5-575c-4e30-aa1e-fb7245f29202	  Really unimpressed with this film. It just is a recycled version of the first star wars film released in 1977. But much worse than that film. The characters are wooden. I did not buy the relationship between rey and finn nor the rey's ability to channel the force so immediately. Or the relationship between Han solo and Leia. Why not take more risk and make an interesting sequel to the other films? There is no way a film like this can lose money and yet they went the safe way.	0
9cdbce07-f3ed-466a-b9eb-8b0e86994cc0	  For me this movie was incredibly painful. There were constant flaws within the character's stories and within the overall plot itself. Everything felt forced and rushed along as JJ Abrams tired his best to smash in all the Easter eggs he could that would give old timers a sense of nostalgia and make them forget what a bad movie they're watching.My problem with (inappropriate) humor:  Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed humor in the previous films of Star Wars but this movie felt like a Marvel superhero film, with humor added in all the wrong situations. Star Wars films (the good movies) have a history of having darker tones until, despite all odds, the heroes barely manage to escape, where Marvel movies have gotten a reputation for lighthearted, funny movies without any real danger posing significant threat. Jokes are inserted at inappropriate times, ruining the gravity of grave situations for the heroes in The Force Awakens. The biggest example of this is when star-pilot Poe Dameron is captured and when face-to-face with the newly introduced Kylo Ren blabs out "So who talks first?" and other light hearted dialogue to get some cheap laughs out of the audience. Yes some people laughed, but at what cost to the mood? This ruins a potential scene for Kylo Ren to establish himself as fearsome and creates a scene for the audience to begin to associate danger with laughter, similar to Jar Jar Binks goofing around in the middle of a fire fight. My problem with the plot:Next we move on to the problem of the plot.... In that it is the same plot we have seen TWICE already. The resistance (the rebels) must defeat the First Order (empire) by blowing up the "weapon" (death star) by attacking an exposed portion with solo pilot aircraft which will lead to a system wide explosion rendering the battle station completely destroyed. Is this ringing any bells?My problem with "the weapon":The weapon is powered by SunnyD and the power of the sun. Despite the problems posed by bringing an entire sun into a planet and still having frozen snow on the surface, let alone any living thing not instantly being incinerated, it still takes the perfect amount of time for the rebels to win despite there being a perfect demonstration by blowing up the new republic government (a story I am left very curious about but I guess we'll never hear about it since they just get blown up). And what happens when the planet runs out of suns to use as fuel? Are there giant engines that will move it to the next sun, and can the First Order control the rotation of the planet or does gravity go all crazy when positioned to attack a new target. It must have some kind of rotation considering it is portrayed as being in orbit around some kind of sun. My problem with the character Finn: His entire role seems very forced for me. His affection for Rey is nearly immediate and he seems to be the only Stormtrooper that can aim in the entire franchise of Star Wars. He shows his prowess with a blaster during the raid of the new JJ Abrams' version of the Cantina. Killing soldiers left and right with his blaster, despite working sanitation and not firing his weapon once during his "first mission." His prowess with the lightsaber is thrown on the audience as well, defeating the Stormtrooper in close quarters combat and holding his own against the trained Kylo Ren. He is even able to use the TIE fighter's and Millennium Falcon's weapon systems with expertise, shooting down trained First Order pilots in while in both ships. My problem with the character Rey: Throughout the first portion of the movie we see her as alone, waiting for someone to come back to her, presumably her family, and only coming into contact with some other scavengers only to have a negative interaction with them. Despite this reclusive lifestyle she is able to understand what BB-8 is telling her, understand Chewbacca's language (Shriiwook), and seem to understand how the machinery in multiple ships work. My biggest problem with this character is possibly her actions. She was able to fly the Millennium Falcon flawlessly after around 15 seconds of trial and error, weaving through star destroyer wreckage and outmaneuvering the First Order's trained pilots. Also she seems to know the ship better than Han Solo himself as shown when she fixes the hyperdrive, while being portrayed as never having been in the Millennium Falcon before. Another thing, she is able to out-duel and use the force much better than the actually trained Kylo Ren. Even with training being so emphasized in the previous 6 movies she is able to defeat the feared Kylo Ren despite not even believing in the force until halfway through the movie.My problem with the character Kylo Ren: Being portrayed as the new Vader we see immediately that he is nowhere near as fearsome when instead of killing the messenger of a bad report he vents his anger out onto a control panel like a child throwing a tantrum. He finally loses all fearsome characteristics once he takes off his mask, showing that he is only a man, and a scared one at that, that bring back memories of pre-Vader Anakin Skywalker who whines his way through movies. The new Sith is shown as powerful with the force, stopping a laser blast and paralyzing two rebel fighters. But then when it is time to get information from Rey by using the force, which apparently can be used as some form of telepathy now, he is denied entry by Rey who is using the force for THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE! This does not show the power of Rey but merely the lack of power of Ren. Also when Kylo Ren kills his father, Han Solo, he leaves no room for redemption in his future. During the scene of Han's death the theme seems to fall upon Kylo Ren wanting redemption and to join the light side of the force, but after killing possibly the most loved character in the Star Wars universe he will find no love from the fans and if he is still alive by the end of the trilogy Disney will have needed to pull off a miracle if the fans are to accept Han's death going unavenged. My problem with the character Captain Phasma: Much like the rest of the First Order, Captain Phasma is initially portrayed as a character who will give the heroes a great deal of trouble. Eventually, during the short amount of screen time she got, she comes out looking like a wuss. She captured too easily and just agrees to the demands of the 4 rebels despite being on a base full of her loyal troops. Amazingly she agrees to turn off the most crucial aspect of the battle station's defenses. Without Captain Phasma, the rebels would have never succeeded. Her giving in so easily is surprising because she should know the risk that goes with her actions, she should have been a good soldier and made Solo, Rey, Chewy, and Finn kill her before she enables the rebels to destroy "the weapon" and possibly all of the First Order. My problem with Han Solo's death: I did not have a problem in the death of the character but rather in how it was handled. Han Solo is arguably the most loved character in the franchise and should be given a proper send off if he is to be killed off. I never got that from this movie. Han's death seems to be brushed aside for the sake of focusing more on Finn and Rey's story. There is never really screen time dedicated to dwell on the loss of everyone's favorite scoundrel. A quick look between Rey and Leia is all we get. One would think that there would be some ceremony for a hero of the rebellion but that just would not fit into the new jovial Star Wars. At least Qui-Gon got a funeral and he was only in one movie of the franchise but a fan-favorite completing his fourth movie barely gets 30 seconds of characters mourning for him. I was conflicted on what emotions JJ Abrams wanted me to feel exiting the movie. Of course I was still sad at the loss of Han and with no real closure or time to mourn him I stayed sad for the rest of the movie, meanwhile the tone shifted to one of hopefulness as Rey finds Luke (much easier than the movie made it seem it would be) and starts her training. Hopefulness and sadness are emotions that do not easily mix, though one could make the argument that I could feel sad for Han's death and hopeful that Rey will beat the Sith but she already did that. And since the rebels seem to have already beat the First Order I am left not knowing what to be hopeful for and feeling sad at the same time.My problem with the "epic duel": When it comes time to see the final duel at the end of the movie we have a matchup between the evil Kylo Ren against the two heroes, Rey and Finn. Kylo Ren is clearly hurt from a blaster as he took a blast from Chewbacca's crossbow but he demonstrates the ability to endure the pain and function regularly as he beats his wound repeatedly. What is expected is a complete massacre of a deserted soldier and a scavenger but what the audience gets is the opposite. Of course the good guys must win eventually but they do not need to win in the first movie of the newest trilogy. In both previous trilogies, successful or not, we see our hero attempt to face off against the villain and lose. This happened in the cases of Qui-Gon against Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace, Anakin and Obi-Wan against Count Dooku in Attack of the Clones, Yoda against Darth Sidious in Revenge of the Sith, and finally Luke Skywalker against Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back. These losses happened for a reason, to show that the hero is not yet ready to defeat the evil that opposes him/her. It gives added fear toward the main villain and shows how powerful he is. The idea of a Jedi training to gain skill has been stressed so much in the previous 6 movies the thought of even a novice Jedi defeating a Sith Lord would be absurd. But in Star Wars 7 we do not only see a scavenger beat a Sith, but we also see an ex-Stormtrooper hold his own against the "fury" of Kylo Ren. Having the new Darth Vader figure be beaten by a scavenger who has never wielded a lightsaber, never had any combat training against trained soldiers, and did not even believe in the force until halfway into the movie extremely belittles his ability to bring any concern to the audience over the danger of their hero. During the next movies we will possibly see Rey or another main character face off against Kylo Ren again. Now at the end of the movie we see Ren go to complete his training (I have no idea why he was in charge if his training was incomplete) but we also see Rey find Luke and begin her training. By Star Wars 8 both will have improved but one would think Rey would have improved exponentially due to her absolute lack of training during her entire life. We will have a face-off in later in the series that we have already seen, with no added tension because we there will not be much doubt about our hero due to Kylo Ren already being brutally defeated in Star Wars 7. Why are there still rebels?  It has been 20 years since the destruction of the empire and a new republic has been created. Usually when a rebel force overthrows a government they become the governing body and cease to be rebels, creating a capital and government to rule in. One would think that after the rebels create a new government that they would at least move their base to the planet where their new government is. So why do the rebels still exist in this movie? Also, why does this new republic allow the creation of a new death star? They must have clearly understood what was going on because it is hard to build or modify an entire planet without the ruling government finding out. And still nothing happens. No one remembered a few decades ago when an entire planet was destroyed and clearly no precautions have been enacted to stop this type of attack from happening again. But hey, everyone seems to love the lack of originality. At the end I was left searching for anything to like about this movie (I really wanted to like it), anything that would give me a decent overall feeling about the film, like the fight between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan with Dual of the Fates ringing in the background. But even the film score left me wanting something much better. Unless someone can convince me there is something to like about the movie besides less than 3 minutes of cool X-wing vs TIE-fighter action and a few Easter eggs, this movie will take its place as the 7th best in the franchise in my mind.	0
f2615c73-f1b0-4c16-bf82-d4b7275e7e26	  I will say this about the movie, it is entertaining. And when compared to some bad movies out there, this isn't necessarily a bad movie, overall it is very well done, the sound is great, the visuals, the effects, even the acting is good.However, when taken in the context of Star Wars, this just does not feel like a star wars movie, the pace is completely wrong, the characters are flat and basically rehashes of previous characters from the saga. There is just no sense of accomplishment anywhere, it is as if the plot just moves along, there is no sense of struggle for the heroes, everything just conveniently happens. I went in with fairly low expectations, so in some ways I was pleasantly surprised, but I left disappointed overall. It is better than the prequels, but not by much. This movie really is just Ep IV, V, and VI rolled into one, with a female Luke Skywalker.	0
5a8076d2-036f-4234-8247-aae1137f7240	  Besides watching Harrison Ford and some of the humour, this is much of a fans movie. Nothing really stand out, not in any of the action or fight scenes, the space ship, environment, or special effect. As for the story, it's pretty linear and it leaves A LOTS of "unanswered questions" which is pretty much a setup for the upcoming StarWars episode in 2017, another in 2018, and another one... until no one remember about the force....	0

4e1cbeaf-9e75-4468-b59a-e0650d69bd56	  I really looked forward to seeing this new Star Wars film. However all I got was a weak rehash of the 1977 Star wars. Sure the effects were better and the music was great but the story was too close to the same. I was never emotionally invested in the new characters like the original. I hope the next attempts will be more creative.	1

12ebe655-fffe-44cf-b046-2ec5d1c2b2bc	  There were some bright spots with the new characters and the new plot lines which you can look for online, however, there were too many ideas carried over, plagiarized, from the original trilogy.The movie relied too much on nostalgia and was a poor attempt at a reboot of a franchise and is nothing more than a transitional movie to steer you into the next movie.Stop me if you've heard any of these facts before. All of which are in this movie.rescue from a Star Destroyer prison on a .Guy gets tossed in the garbage chute.Droids crash on a planet pursued by dark jediThis isn't the droid you're looking for.X-wing fighter destroys the 3rd Death star.btw, there's another death star.Good jedi turns to the dark sideHis mother utters the words "I know there is still good in him, because I've felt it"Major character death at the hands of a dark jedi	0
a5e3622c-53c3-4e62-a4cd-f072d8ad0b0c	  Kind of dissappointing, a lot of hype surrounds this film but the body of the film seemed kinda just slapped together. Example: at one moment you're like yeah this bad guy is definitely tough next second nah just kidding.. Great visual effects but lacks depth.	1
143b930b-b0b1-4da8-ba8c-117f1a7f0fd3	  It's pretty entertaining, but I think it is because people are just really upset with Episode 1, 2, and 3. Because if you really paid attention, you'll realize this is actually a remake of Episode IV.	1
91c1ffc3-eee8-4d01-a473-600ab6ac8720	  JJ Abrams has gotten old, his tired movies are not good anymore. This was basically just a remake of the original movie if everyone got older and history together. my problem with this movie is the drama is just not good the plot lines are very thin, there is no depth there at all. I liked the original star wars IV but this left a horrible taste in my mouth. Unfortunately I may be done with the star wars series forever.	0
61226b72-9ecc-4559-9c69-ed836b4c9495	  It's been a few days since I seen the movie. In the time I decided to drop my score another half a star. While I did enjoy this film for the most part. Much more than the previous installments, Episodes 1, 2, and 3. There are huge glaring flaws to this movie that really hurt it's potential to be more enjoyable. Biggest being the huge lack of chemistry among the cast. I found myself wishing that both Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher were not in this film. They looked and felt absolutely uncomfortable whenever they had scenes together. While I found Rey to be a very likable character, someone I am truly interested in seeing where she goes in the future. I hope that future does not include the character of Finn. Boyega is another actor that didn't seem to have chemistry with the other actors, and that is not mentioning that this character was very poorly written. He was this movie's Jar Jar Binks, though not quiet as annoying, but getting there. Another peeve, too many references, hints and copying of Episode 4, there were moments when this felt as if it were a remake rather than continuation. We need more original ideas writers. As for Kylo Ren, the temper tantrums left me perplexed, really didn't add anything to the story, seemed like something that should have hit the cutting room floor in my opinion. My favorite things taken from this more were Rey (Daisy Ridley), BB8 ( had most of the successful humorous parts ), and the ending of the movie. Loved the ending, and left me very curious to see where the Skywalkers go in the next movie.	1
cb7447cf-3e28-4581-a0e1-3a76b738e694	  Horrible unoriginal movie, which solely builds on nostalgia for the original trilogy, while ironically taking a crap on all the accomplishments of our heroes in Episode VI. As soon as the hype dies down this movie will be recognized for the cinematic faecal matter it is.	0
5f50e863-f598-425f-b2a6-17d3dc1f897b	  Star Wars: The franchise rebooted is a very safe by the numbers movie that did not excite me at all and this is a movie which I had low expectations for to begin with. Now, I might get some flack for this but let me explain why.Minor SpoilersBasically, the movie is a new hope re-packaged. Nothing has changed in the galaxy, except the Empire is has become vestigial and the old cast of the original trilogy ended up being a bunch screw ups that managed to get everything back to the same condition as a new hope. It's like watching the new spiderman reboot. Guys, I really don't need to watch uncle Ben die for the second time. The acting: The original cast.It was okay, it was nice to see Harrison play Han again. He even manages to put a performance that is slightly better than his performance as Indy Jones. Though, as character arc, having old Han Solo in the same spot as New Hope Han is quite disheartening. Carrie Fisher Leia is also a tragic figure, she is relegated to the role of Mon Mothma as Ms. Exposition mixed in with disheartened mom who for having the rank of general does very little commanding, that shit is taken by Admiral Ackbar.Mark Hamill Luke is barely in the movie as sequel bait. The only ones that didn't show their age was C3PO and Chewbacca. R2-D2 had one tiny part to play as he was shown up by the volleyball robot.The villains:New Darth Vader/Kylo Ren: Is a laughable villain, they managed to resurrected all the cringe worthy moments of Anakin Skywalker, with an actor that cannot play a torn soul and whose actions are so inept that new emperor should have killed him.New Emperor/Supreme Leader: Again a mere shadow of the menace that was Emperor Palpatine. Also poor Andy Serkis will be cursed to play CGI motion capture model for the rest of his career. He also just there as sequel bait.Quota Stormtrooper/Phasma: Why did they feel the need to waste Brianne of Tarth on this. She is NPC with like two lines and no reason to be there plot wise. She isn't even like a super Stormtrooper. WTF. Even gets captured.New Tarkin/Hux: Surprisingly manages to halfway steal the show, though his whole purpose was to be a Hitler knockoff. Just missing the mustache.The heroes:Reverse Darth Vader/Finn: Is not too bad, though I wish the story was a little more developed. Would have been nice to see him in the Stormtrooper role for a little longer and fuller arc to heroNew Luke/Rey: Again not too bad, thankfully sparing me" I'm female hero so that means I'm a mega bitch" to very minor levels which is actually is joke in the movie. Kind of wooden and also lacking development.New Han sorta/Po: Is missing from about half of the movie and is relegated to hand wave plot motion device that is actually quite sad.Minor charactersNew Yoda/Maz: A full-fledged alien Ms. Exposition who sole purpose is to push New Luke to Old Luke.The effects: Were good, if the camera work didn't excite. Thankfully, someone told JJ to knock it off with the lens flairs. The soundtrack: Classic John Williams, though there wasn't any Imperial March or Duel of Fates to speak of, it's kind of sad really.Finally, I'm pretty sure this movie is going to get high marks from everybody else cuz politics and money yo but my from my humble opinion Hollywood managed to make another cash grab by resurrecting storyline Frankenstein's monster style yet again. Not that the movie is prequel bad, just nothing new to see and no new story to tell.	0
07d67515-ace5-4d6d-9167-350a905a4e5a	  Horrible, horrible movie. Filled with cliche moments, plot holes, some things didn't make any absolute sense, too many sudden moments where characters meet up , the main "heroine" is a feminist propaganda mary-sue ,this is a FAIL of desperately trying to copy something from old movies but he copied the ENTIRE PLOT... JJ should be banned from producing anything in the future, he tried to mask our eyes with fancy WOW moments and cgi but that is all.. who gave this guy right to be a producer ? the whole movie industry is going slowly down the drain because of this, it's been like that for the past decade... 93% ? I guess the reviewers here got their pockets filled up to give positive opinions. I am terribly scared for the future of movie industry.	0
5853bc03-1100-4509-8d27-48118305408a	  Most telling part of this movie: They forgot that C3PO has a silver leg. "Big Deal" you say. Well, yeah, so what? Just explain it away. He got a new one. He has a crazy Red Arm, anyway! So cool! Maybe he found a new, identical, C3PO droid leg. But wait a minute. We have to do that a lot in this movie. We have to make up our own plot explanations 20 or 30 times. OH, yeah.. that *could* have happened, whatever. A jawa trader just gave up a droid that's worth a fortune, sure, but he probably didn't know it was worth anything either. The bad guy took his mask off because some stupid smuggler pissed him off, sure. Princess Leia hugs Rey as if she's her long-lost daughter even though they've exchanged six words with each other. Poe and Fin are super duper best buddies even though right before they escaped, Poe pointed out that this guy is just a stormtrooper who wants to desert. But whatever, best friends now. We have to do that a lot, and it is annoying. Do all of the reviewers work for Disney? How does this have 8.5/10 rating?.There are two movies here. There's a really intriguing story about a girl who finds out that she has a deep, mysterious history that she never knew about, and rebel friends with a plan to bring freedom to a universe ruled by power and greed. And then there's a Hollywooded-out story where a bunch of characters that were almost really cool got left flat and the plot elements had to be resolved when the bad guy loses his super powers, the good guys suddenly gain unexplained super powers, and where the bad guy's base is really poorly defended and his minions easily beaten.I didn't hate it. Seriously. But it's hard not to hate the viral marketing (What's with those "No Spoilers!" memes ?? What is there to spoil? Are you afraid I'm going to tell my friends about the obvious plot holes?) This movie was sort of a cash grab. If it didn't have "Star Wars" all over it, it would be just another crappy Hollywood movie.The Plot Had Obvious ProblemsThe plot elements resolved themselves far too easily, and a lot of what happened did not make sense in the context of the Star Wars universe. One character's powers are "awakened" in the space of about twenty minutes - suddenly more powerful than other Jedi that have trained for years. The bad guy suddenly loses his powers for no reason. A janitor gives someone who is basically a kung-fu master a run for his money. The giant, quadzillion space-dollar space station has an obvious weakness and terrible network security, since its defenses can be deactivated by a random squad commander at a random, unguarded computer terminal. Wtf?There are dozens of moments that just don't make sense, which would have been *so easy* to just change slightly so the plot is a bit more intriguing. It all makes me think that the movie was named this just so they had a magical explanation for all of the ridiculously good luck that the heroes have.The Dialogue Fell Short -The lines seemed like they had been oversimplified to just a series of one-liners, which in most cases would make sense with just a bit more dialogue. The science and realism that could've easily been there, wasn't - it became clear that the writers don't respect the audience when they say "*the* sun" rather than "a star," or "this system's sun," or really, anything other than what they actually said, which sounded completely stupid. Another phrase I take issue with is "thermal oscillator." Semantically, that makes no sense. It would have been just as easy to say "thermal modulator." But, they didn't. And that upsets me.The plot is a bunch of recycled, generic Star Wars elements, yes. But, that said, it's hard to say what I would've been satisfied with. There is a lot that they could have messed up with this movie, or the next one.#1 Problem with the movie - The really cool, really intriguing bad guy takes off his mask. He apparently had gone through great pains to hide his face, and make the audience think he was awesome. In the first half of the movie, he's this awesome, violent masked character with a cool voice. In the second half of the movie, he's an insecure child whose force powers shut off by themselves for no reason. Ooh, I'm so scared.The point is, this movie could have been *so cool.* I think they should have gone with the plot that it's obvious they were trying to have. But somewhere along the lines, Hollywood happened to this movie and they decided to please the crowd by throwing all three of the previous episodes in a blender, and removing any really distinguishing plot elements from this film. Whatever. It was fun to watch, but nothing happened, and the real hero of the movie is a nameless X-ray pilot. On the surface, it looks really good, but I think that if you scratch the glass, this is a really generic Hollywood story with a bunch of Star Wars stickers on it.	1
8b680ca6-5ab2-40b3-95f8-24beb2d632e2	  horrible, reductive, ruins the original trilogy by turning beloved heroes into complete failures. if you are a fan don't watch it.	0
c5db0d02-1861-4450-a83b-5a7747374bc0	  Jar Jar Abrhams has finally proved what the hardcore Star Wars fans thought wasn't possible. He made a movie so bad it makes Episode 1 look good. The movie is essentially a reboot of Episode 4. From a bigger deathstar (which the movie points our for you incase you weren't sure) to the death of a mentor which causes the main character to cry despite having met him only a few scenes earlier. This movie was bogus. Incase that isn't enough we even get a whinney tantrum throwing sith to enjoy. The humor was so randomly thrown in the movie that I wasn;t sure if I'm supposed to laugh or just stare awkwardly at the screen. They tried to make the Empire funny which made the movie even worse since the empire is supposed to be forboading and dangerous while the Rebellion tends to lean to more humanly charecteristics. As for the Rebellion they added it to this movie, but its called the "Resistance". They even have a bunker ust like in Episode 4 even though they won 30 years earlier. Theres not explenation as to why the Resistance isn't the Republic or as to why the Republic isn't helping the Resistance or why theres even a Resistance anyways. As for the "New Order" there isn't much explenation as to why it's around or why the REpublic lets it do it's thing and build massive planet sized Death Stars. I could go on and on, but if you're a hardcore fan and haven't seen this movie yet..don't waste 10 bucks on a ticket. Instead sit at home and watch A New Hope. Its the same thing anyways.	0
59927c3c-6066-4c57-861a-0e1025c43631	  The new Star Wars (The Force Awakens) people over reacted with it saying how great it was but although the actors were amazing the plot wasn't. Even the directer from the first 3 movies even said he would have done it different. In the first book is shows you tat when Luke Skywalker found out he had the force he had to learn how to use a life saver, and the mind control like thing. Now I don't know if you noticed but the new character Rey as soon as she found out she had the force she completely knew how to use everything, from the mind control, to how to use a lifesaver.	1
7a10507d-3ea8-43cf-88a8-eab7f68f2e48	  The film was more about visuals and has some really dumb moments through out and J.J. Abrams penchant to make fan fiction films. The problem for me was that Rey character at times was poorly written. inconstant, and annoying character I have seen. She speaks lines I would expect a ten year old sidekick to say in awe or some star wars fan would spew in fan fiction . Yes my eyes were rolling like they were watching the Phantom Menace when Rey was suddenly starts piloting the Millennium Falcon (plot hole) at the beginning and then Han Solo's later entrance in another ship that finds them (plot hole). I can see why Rian Johnson is taking over the franchise for Episode 8. I hope Riany fixes the characters and this franchise that has been repeatably trashed by Lucas.	0
78dc681d-53f8-43c3-b4c7-4768e9be6d9d	  RETREAD, RETREAD, RETREAD. This is a compendium of prior star wars movies nothing new here at all. I've seen them all. Asked the kids,(high school and college) what they thought, "retread, retread, retread". For those of you die hard entrained Star Wars fans this will be manna but looking at it critically, nothing new. Bored. At least I won't have to watch Harrison Ford again in episode 8. I think I'll just watch that one on redbox.	1
72a057a8-b5f0-4da3-be67-24f85cd73c38	  It's a very nostalgic and fun movie. It was precisely what everyone expected with the story plot, that's it. It wasn't one of those films that will keep you on the edge of your seat, well for me.	0
1d32fa66-90f9-4d25-8144-37cd4ba842d6	  Noise is a poor substitute for plot or character development. Lots of retreaded views/sequences from the '77 original. Wait for Red Box.	0
bbbc68cb-92a8-4bed-ba7f-f19c893a7771	  I can't believe the Tomatometer score of 93% as of today. As someone who saw all the episodes of Star Wars, in the order that they were released I am shocked. I wouldn't give " The Force Awakens" even two stars, one and a half at best, poor scripting, poor directing, poor casting and poor acting by some of the leads. What more could you NOT want in a film series that is considered iconic by generations of viewers.	0
0d0e6613-a95e-4f46-baf6-46285c2c401f	  I thought Star Wars - The Force Awakens was terrible. They ruined the star wars franchise. Actors and acting was just atrocious. Story and plot was boring and not believable at all. I really don't like how it took Luke Skywalker three movies (including training by Yoda) before he could use/handle the force and defeat Darth Vader, but it takes this girl 14 seconds (with no training) to figure out and master all the nuances of the force and defeat the dark side/Kylo Ren. She went from scavenger/nobody to the ultimate jedi warrior in 14 seconds with no training. Just ridiculous and stupid. She is not believable as a hero/jedi saving the galaxy and Kylo Ren is not believable as the bad guy (new Darth Vader) - he's a wuss. I'm surprised they did not have him break down and cry and surrender to the girl. Terrible job as a villain. I won't bother going to see any more Star Wars movies now that Disney is doing them.	0
a3cfa3eb-6af3-41d7-b283-9117e48c08f3	  Great visuals (as you'd expect) and some fantastic action sequences but the film overall is let down by some horrible and frankly unforgivable plot holes that caused me to lower my rating considerably. Having said that I still enjoyed the film and would recommend others seeing it, just prepare to be disappointed if you are unable to suspend belief and can't just go with the flow and accept it for what it is.	1
90e1bf09-dead-4854-8746-83a04563d737	  Really just a rehash of the original episode with too much reliance on the original characters. Even the special effects were not all that impressive compared to the incredible "newness" of the special effects in the original. Good, but not great.	1
c1c69387-44f1-4f4e-8460-b2d34ca98d6d	  Power of the Mouse. This sodden remake of a 1977 is limpid at best. The acting is atrocious, the plot is thinner than a Paris model and the special effects are tepid. The only black guy character is, guess what, a garbage collector (disclosure- I'm an old white guy). This turkey is so bad than even Harrison Ford killed himself. Did I mention Princess Lameo?	0
c5639b77-dae1-4efe-8f95-cc90112cdca5	  It's a remake of the first movie (1977) mixed with nostalgia and a dash of twilight.I like the footage, but the story sucks.	1
0397c3f7-6ca7-416c-a9fc-072697c54daf	  As I was watching the movie, I enjoyed it. J.J. Abrams recaptures the tone, music, and effects of the original movie. Too bad it doesn't have an original bone in its body, except the Kylo Ren subplot. Hopefully the other two sequels have the balls to be more original.	1
d259f6e9-c816-407a-af89-efc7b0084dda	  Apparently the world was so desperate for a period piece romance, that they saw one without the name "Nicholas Sparks" attached and swooned. Two good performances by Ronan and Cohen and a decent ending can't erase a rushed relationship and standard narrative. No.... seriously. Every "big" event between Ellis and Tony left me saying "Already????" and the second half is even worse. Don't believe the hype.	1
75d22005-e7c7-4af8-afec-80253806bd26	  Saoirse (sur-sha) was good in this, but otherwise it was pretty a standard 50's immigrant period piece film. i really don't get why it's at a 98% rotten tomatoes score, why it's nominated for best picture, or why everyone is crying when it's over. *shrugs*	1
1f1e9f60-f846-4d08-acd9-4bb517aaa520	  A nice movie and story, however it moved so damn slow. Saoirse Ronan was super cute and did an awesome job, but I don't think she will win for best actress this year.	1

6c2b2e21-cd3b-4599-acc3-cc9dce8f98c6	  I like a good period piece, which I guess this was, but I cant buy that the woman whose character was defined by directness and honesty would string along her Irish suitor. And if Mrs. Kelly hadnt been a bitch to her, would she have still decided to fess up?	1

d6e6702e-48a3-4c37-a840-b70b7334873f	  The only redeeming quality of this movie was the performance of Ms. Ronan. The rest was an empty plot, a badly-written script, and no real character development. I had high expectations for this Oscar-nominated film, but was left feeling frustrated by the naivety and pointlessness of the movie. Save your two hours for something more interesting.	0
977ebf3c-cddc-4321-82d8-83cc5237e693	  So, somebody found out that Saoirse Ronan could imitate the accent of her family quite well and gave her a stage to show it off. This is a slushy love story where hardly anything worthy of a film happens. How this has recieved so many Oscar nominations, I'll never know. It really shouldn't win any.	0
add0c0b3-bda3-4e39-b450-4d111444a093	  I'm not sure what I thought this movie was going to be, but it wasn't that. Saoirse Ronan is a dream, but the movie is a snooze. I'm sure it's better than a Lifetime movie, but that's what it felt like to me.	1
3ccc9707-56d0-44e5-8db9-33092c400e78	  First and foremost, Ronan is very solid in her Oscar-nominated lead performance. However, the film as a whole felt underwhelming for me. It starts with the promising premise of this girl struggling to accept love, and dealing with the hardships of being homesick and the overall struggle for immigrants in the '50's. However, heading into the second and third acts, the film falls into a very routine, "I love him but I'm almost tempted by another lover" plot device and without anything new to add to that kind of story. The film also begins with a wonderful light and quirky tone, only again to be sucked into the cliches of this romance plot, but without giving you any stakes into caring if it'll all work out. Overall Brooklyn isn't a bad, but not an overwhelmingly special movie.	1
e988b788-7f3f-4f80-88cd-b446989091b6	  Not a fan of how she decides to go back to US. Being married, and spent so many time dating the "catch" back home just seems so fucking wrong. You can argue that she isn't sleeping around but it is still so fucked up. In China, we call girls like this green tea bitxx. So when her previous employer talked to her and "reminded" her of her marriage status, suddenly she decides to go back to US? The Fxxx? This can be handled a lot better. The rest of the film is beautiful in a lot of ways.	1
86316164-bb83-4d3d-935d-33ed0a3bca56	  Great acting and filming. Too bad the story line is so transparently contrived and predictable. It all boils down to a classic "chick-flick," though one of the very best productions ever of that unctuous genre. One telling reaction from theater audiences: While a few attempts at humor drew well earned laughs from everyone, most were yawners...yet evoked raucous -- and solely female -- laughter.	0
4ed1433d-2675-4e31-946a-41e99eb2bff2	  I don't understand how this could be considered an award winning movie. It was sweet, the costumes were good. But it was nothing exceptional.	0
33c9afa4-b728-44fe-b001-01fb330cc640	  Brooklyn's heart wrenching drama may feel too manipulative and depressing, but it's mostly redeemed by a talented cast and a large degree of thoughtfulness	1
923e74ae-6b18-4039-aa24-67dc31d4925c	  Seems this fits the trend of me not liking oscar nominated movies. There was no real conflict. Who meets and gets married like that?	0
24957fca-3141-47be-b89a-2c357b61103c	  Not bad until the last chapter were it all felt rushed. It had masterpiece potential but the story failed in the end leaving me emotionally untouched and not interested.	1
3a6c607a-aed9-442c-a557-0e4feb601ab9	  Boring.Facile acting and technical work don't make this trite and dull story better than what it is.The period setting is generally wasted as it barely engages it - nothing more than eye-candy for our culture's period-fetish. The character of Tony the Italian Plumber is so on the nose, he plays like a joke. So does his loud-mouthed little brother.Audiences eat this up because ultimately they're starved for films that depict a simple, positive story. That doesn't make this film good though. More a reflection of our deprived culture than anything else.	0
2b268f35-cb2a-4d58-ad63-98c93d626c28	  if you enjoy love stories on the Hallmark channel, you will like this film. The acting is well done. This is clearly not my style of movie and I cannot understand the oscar buzz on the film. Also the main character is meant to be "charming" but I found her to be a jerk.	1
9015f733-223f-4a4b-89a9-7d95bd642bf9	  This movie was awful; I don't understand the high rating. Synopsis: A super boring Irish girl moves to Brooklyn and marries a sweet Italian dude. Then her sister drops dead for absolutely no apparent reason, prompting her to go back to Ireland for a month, where she ignores her husband's letters, dates some rich Irish dude, and pretends she isn't married because ~she's conflicted~ and ~her heart is complicated~... But wait! Nevermind! Ireland sucks! So Boring goes back to Brooklyn to be with the husband she ignored for a month like nothing happened, and he's basically like, "Omg, I have no questions about any of this. Let's kiss in the street."I should have seen Star Wars for the third time.	0
94ed5abe-e1e5-47a8-917a-3dae5cdcd979	  Cute but not much else. I suppose it has some interesting and nice moments, about homesickness and finding your confidence, but I wasn't particularly compelled by anybody and I disliked how they tended to jump cut out of any large bits of dialogue. All in all, a very sweet and endearing movie but felt emotionally reserved to me. You never get a real sense of Tony so I didn't feel like she would have lost out. I'd say the lesson I learned was "don't marry the first guy you meet."	1
69a46664-efa2-48bf-8220-86b702ae89d2	  I just don't get it. This movie had good performances and gorgeous cinematography. It had a potentially good plot. But it was SO slow. I looked at my watch probably 20 times. The people i saw it with actually hated it. Just don't get the critics on this one. 98%? On such a poorly paced movie? If you're thinking about seeing this movie, wait till it comes out on DVD. Then at least you can pause the film and take a little nap while it slowly lulls you to sleep.	0
c530df00-b2ad-48fa-8444-4d70a2c4287c	  Lovely film. Acting was wonderful. Story was interesting. Storyline was good too. So whats the problem? In a nutshell . . .I don't see how Eliish (Ronan) lost her viginity to Cohen so quickly. It was a beautiful story up until that point. It was like jumping from 1950 straight into Tinder 2016. Is the author of the book a male?? Oh, maybe thats why. A man writing a book about a young Irish girl or any girl usually ends up losing her virginity right? And I thing her Italian boyfriend/husband could have been a better actor and taller. Ok, thats it in a nutshell. Too bad, it really could have been a delightful story without the trash.	1
4c472674-c57e-4b5a-aae5-e594f737a2d7	  A very "old-fashioned" movie. If it had been filmed in b&w it could have been mistaken for a 40's flick. It had a number of touching moments and a little surprise when she returns for a supposedly "short" visit back to the Emerald Isle But it took "forever" for something interesting to happen. Patience and revererence for great production values and fine acting are the keywords here.	1
2c79c16c-382a-4205-841b-6ea672cb0cf8	  Dull story, and misleading trailer. She is probably the luckiest immigrant ever and she is a bad person being married and still leading the other guy on. Only good is the pictures. Performance is okay. No idea why it got such good reviews. Maybe it is just me but I can't related to this movie as an immigrant myself.	0
6a3c41ce-108d-4bde-b1a5-78f503106c1a	  With all the big action movies sometimes a simple film done well can have just as big an impact, as any action movie, which is shown in the film "Brooklyn". If you want a story with ton's of action and drama this would not be in your selection but if you want a film that is poignant and even poetic at times "Brooklyn" might be your stop.	1
b3a86a95-6c7f-4f56-b114-08473bb91927	  Safely told tale of 1950s immigration and love. It's good, but pretty simple. Maybe that's OK, but it could have been much more.	1
87af40d5-425d-4576-b76b-96bcbd90856a	  Cliched romantic premise but solid old-fashioned melodrama.	1
8bc1544e-6af9-4da0-b80e-67262f4563a4	  I actually couldn't sit all the way through this movie. For the first hour I was in love with it, but when she returns to Ireland she totally went out of character, which lost me and just made me decide to get up and leave. I think I may've missed something. I thought she'd married her boyfriend before she went back to Ireland. I know I saw them in the waiting room at the courthouse, and the clerk came out and paged them, but I don't actually remember them getting married. Did I miss something and she actually backed out at the last minute? I know that she seemed to be 'all in' on the relationship, so backing out doesn't make sense. Alas no instant replay at the movies, and I'm not quite willing to buy another ticket to find out. In any event I thought she was already married by the time she went back to Ireland, in which case her behavior there seemed to be totally incongruous with the first hour of the movie. Assuming she was married, the fact that she didn't mention it to friends and family sort of turned the movie into an episode of Three's Company for me; rather mindless and stupid. I was so dazed and confused by the behavior, I decided I needed to get up and stretch my legs, which led to me just going ahead and leaving the theatre.I will give the film all its kudos for great cast and filming. And the first hour was a very interesting exploration of the nicer side of humanity. The old bat that runs the irish store where Eilis is working when the film opens reminded me of my own Irish grandmother who was just as bigoted, opinionated and nasty. That bell rang true.	1
cf641c69-1cf1-4383-b181-79bdde7212bb	  Brooklyn stands on even footing with Saoirse Ronan's impeccable performance. It's the kind of film that has everything in place from start to finish, so much so that its ending is predictable and its dilemma is barely large enough to pull too many heartstrings. Overall, its impact is not what it should be.	1
609fcbc8-312e-4b00-b1a9-86bc49391e56	  Romance with paid immigration and job training. Very PBSish. The third act conflict alone is worth a bowl of Lucky Charms soaked in chloroform.	0

3537678b-7d66-4e89-ac35-aaf1d94f5f79	  You know the reason why I saw this. If you don't, then figure it out. Anyway, this was a really good drama movie. Saoirse Ronan stars the main character who moves to Brooklyn to start a new life. She does a fantastic job in role. This wasn't here best movie but it wasn't the worst either. I was the youngest person in the theater when I went to see it. It's a good drama and I recommend it to seniors. This movie was very Irish so be ready for an Irish themed throughout the movie.	1
a0fd60de-5f61-4e6a-a025-161aa5b0e203	  Great performances from Ronan and Cohen, but feels too much like a movie skipping through the pages of a novel and ending up only telling the surface of the story.	1
73aa2065-2b8f-4ff5-a566-23b79fc903e9	  Colm Toibin is a great writer. Nick Hornby is not. I have enjoyed some of C.T.'s novels a great deal (In fact "The Heather Blazing" is a favourite of mine.) I like his genteel style in such work. The performances here are fine, or better than fine; it looks lovely: the colour palette, the costumes, the scenes and scenery all make for a fine backdrop. Where it fails, and it is a major failing, is that it says nothing of any real worth about the migrant experience. Eilis (Saoirise Ronan) is shipped off to NYC through the assistance of her thoughtful sister and a kindly priest. (In a good performance by Jim Broadbent as Father Flood.) Up until an easily predicted plot development the difficulties faced by our heroine are a bout of seasickness, the need for 30 seconds training in her new job as a shop assistant, and a touch of homesickness. While I'm happy to see women succeed, there would have been far more dirt under the fingernails of all of these women. Apart from the minor matter of losing her virginity, Eilis could indeed be the sainted mother of God. It all suffers from Nick Hornby blandness. Everything he touches turns to bland. My advice: stay away from his cooking and, more importantly, his "creative" projects. This is not meant to be an art house atmospheric enigma, nor is it, but it fails to involve solely because of a threadbare plot that avoids detailing the threadbare aspects of lives led by women who were, in reality, the working poor.	0

59d43059-668f-4d95-a64c-4d7e997a8fdc	  I don't see why this got high ratings at all. It is low class acting, and your mind does not have to think at all. It is a high school level movie. Wasted my money today. Go see In the Heart of the Sea instead of this crap.	0
76149369-a25b-47fe-95b2-0894a95967e0	  I made a rotten tomatoes account just to help good souls avoid this terrible piece of flotsam that washed up to NYC's harbors. If you took 50 lbs of marzipan, crammed it into a Hallmark card, and send it direct to DVD, you'd have something close to the cloying, piece of dried-up-make-up-foundation that this movie is. What in the heck is WRONG with people that you could actually like this thing?? It has NOTHING in it! NOTHING happens! Some fake, terrible deus ex machina plot-thing happens in the middle, and then just floats away, just as it came. SPOILER ALERTIrish girl falls in love with Italian boy. And........ nothing happens. We're talking middle-school movie day, the last week of school, that kind of movie. It's an insult to the hard work the Irish did when they came to NYC. It's an insult to the difficulties that immigrants faced. This is a time in our country when we need honest reflections into that time in our history. That's what art/music/film is for. THIS crap is an insult to our country, our history, the Irish, and the genre of cheesy films. My trust in Rotten Tomatoes is rocked, by the 98% ratings.	0
7f511406-a8ac-4d09-8041-ca716ba57b08	  It is undeniably well-executed, and Ronan's performance is excellent, but there isn't anything that really sets it apart. While it manages to mostly avoid romance cliches, the scenes that should be gut-punching remain fairly unaffecting. It does have its charm, and it is basically impossible to dislike, but it's fairly mundane and ordinary.	1
b97f9e63-d097-4730-a8cd-d6afd09815a5	  I have absolutely no idea why this film got 98% (8.6) in Rotten Tomatoes, not a single damn idea. This film is terribly predictable, characters and plots were terribly under-developed, and the message is terribly simple and naive (in short, the equally terrible trailer of this film already spoiled the WHOLE film, not a single surprise left). Even the much-praised role by Saoirse Ronan felt terribly short (in comparison with her sublime presence in "Atonement" almost ten years ago), nothing surprising, nothing breakthrough from the role. Of course, the film's optimism is much appreciated, especially in the context of a new USA where immigrants are no longer "liked" or a new Europe where immigrants are no longer "welcome". Thus, I absolutely do not hate this film. Its simplicity only wasted my time (yes, that is simplicity, not cinematic minimalism or any similar euphemism).	1
5df89439-c287-43e4-b6dd-e5a96d5eeea4	  To be fair, this is a properly made, decent piece.Those overwhelming credit, from the film itself to Saoirse Ronan's acting, sound rather exaggerating however.	1
1e232c10-028a-4547-8665-bbb80856a38f	  It was very slow and boring. Took me twice to finish watching it because I lost interest. Doesn't belong in the cinema, maybe lifetime.	0
349fbb20-6fde-4b4a-a6b0-2ac244dbc8bb	  Apparently the world was so desperate for a period piece romance, that they saw one without the name "Nicholas Sparks" attached and swooned. Two good performances by Ronan and Cohen and a decent ending can't erase a rushed relationship and standard narrative. No.... seriously. Every "big" event between Ellis and Tony left me saying "Already????" and the second half is even worse. Don't believe the hype.	1
9cf90a2d-e17a-46c9-9551-c31c488da2ef	  A very charming, old-fashioned melodrama with a glowing performance by Saoirse Ronan. I simply can't say what's so special about her performance but maybe it's the sense of a Hollywood Golden Age leading lady.	1
6f5472c5-5fb2-471d-937d-d39ddc76107c	  I really thought that I was going to enjoy this movie more than I actually did. I thought I was going to give it at least four stars, but sadly it only really lands on three stars for me. I loved the book that this movie is based on and I got emotional just by reading the movie's reviews, which made me think that I would be just as attached with the movie as I was with the book. Sadly I don't feel as optimistic towards this movie as everyone else seems to be feeling. I felt that the movie never really began and there were a lot of things that were left out in the beginning that needed to be there to fully comprehend the movie if you haven't already read the book. I have always said that I think Saoirse Ronan is the best actress of her generation and I don't think I'll ever change my mind on that one, this movie will probably result in Saoirse Ronan receiving her second Academy Award nomination, but I was still not as blown away by her performance as I was expecting. For me this movie was a bit too slow, it was difficult to get into it and there was never really anything that glued me to the screen. There were a few scenes that were missing that needed to be there and there were other scenes that were in the movie that didn't feel quite as important. Sometimes it felt like the scenes were jumping from scene to scene and I didn't always feel like it was telling a coherent story. All in all it wasn't a bad movie, it just could have been a lot better, and like most movies starring Saoirse Ronan she really did lift the movie to a higher level than what it would have been otherwise.	1
261f520a-2ae8-4dec-957c-603b5fd08983	  A very slow character study of an immigrant who travels from Ireland to America and her modest life and everyday experiences.	1
199a0f7f-ceeb-4573-85aa-f6e2af141640	  This has to rate as the most boring movie of the year. The old "boy-meets-girl" story unfolds like the slow boat from Ireland to Brooklyn. It's all predictable and Saoirse Ronan sleep walks through it with a wooden performance that adds to the soporific effect. Emory Cohen is the only sign of life in a vibrant supporting role as the nice Italian boy (and he does look a bit young for the part) who wins Ms. Ronan's heart, hastily marries her, loses her, and you can guess the sappy ending (yawn).	0
d296a632-afbe-4917-bcb4-676b808fbbee	  Its OK. Surprisingly has not much to do with Brooklyn since most of it takes place in Ireland. Just mediocre.	1
58b23389-992c-49f7-95bd-8555ecb9510f	  Kind of a hollow story of a girl split between New York and home. I was looking for more from this.	1
d38c6e70-90ac-40ec-9af8-072183fb8073	  This is not the 50''s Brooklyn I knew. It's a small love story that could have been set anywhere. Wish they'd used an Italian to play one. Where were Nathan's, Junior's, A&S and other landmarks?	0
eb5b8614-9dff-488b-a58d-f85a9300f1e6	  A slow and sensitive look at the immigrant experience. However it lost me half way through.SPOILER:I lost my ability to identify with our protagonist on her return to Ireland.Her failure to reveal her marital status caused unnecessary pain in others	1
229b6616-cbd5-48cc-a192-a6f5b792eea3	  A young Irish woman leaves her mom and sister behind and travels to America seeking a better life where she quickly gets over being homesick, finds a good job and falls in love with and marries the first person she dates; but when she returns to Ireland to comfort her mother after the tragic death of her sister, she is tempted with a job and new man, until she is confronted that she is married and so she returns home to her true love. The End. Seriously?	1
e0ef938a-039e-485b-9171-f157c5ecd56a	  This film had so much potential but, ultimately, I found it disappointing. The cast was excellent, the leading lady a great and charming actor, the cinematography gorgeous (if a bit dewy eyed and sentimental). But the plot was this film's downfall. I thought it was great until it became a melodramatic love triangle. A Hollywood film with beautiful young people and a love triangle; who would have thunk it? At that point it became predictable, not in the sense of knowing what choice the heroine would make but rather in the sense that I didn't care. Perhaps it's because we live in narcissistic times that none of the critics seemed to notice, let alone care, that this woman who was portrayed as so lovely, so sweet, so kind behaved in ways that belied that impression. She was not truthful with two men who were falling over themselves for her, leaving one to wonder if she would ever return and not thinking to tell the other she was married and then breaking it off the courageous way, by dropping a letter through the door. (I think the second guy was the lucky one.) She mistreated her mother when she left without even 24 hours notice. She mistreated a house-mate by finding a way to ditch her. Everything was all about her wants, her needs, her love of Ireland, her distaste for the narrow mindedness of small-town life. One might think no one else existed, really. Lesser characters were mere plot devices in a film that was all about just one character. I'm still giving it three stars because of the film's strengths. But it was nowhere near as good as it might have been with a more thoughtful, less cliched, script.	1
2da5a1af-a131-4087-b2ed-0965062a3abd	  I never fully connected with the characters, and while charmed was not awe-struck	1
7ad12504-1a2f-4195-9e30-270350b27d12	  3 out of 5 stars. Excellent performance by Saoirse Ronan, who has been impressive since 13 years old in "Atonement." A lot of great technical work in cinematography, costume and production design, make it a beautiful film to watch and enjoy.But, there are some problems. The casting is very uneven with some almost amateur acting in smaller roles. The music is heavy handed, underlining and cueing every emotion. The script seems very simple A to B to C with everything overly convenient in the plot. Nick Hornby is an excellent writer, so the adaptation of his novel may have simplified the book to the point of obvious progression. Whoever did the casting may have had political pressure because some of the actors are just bad, even though they look perfect, thanks to accurate hair, makeup & costuming.Ronan is assured a Best Actress nomination for her subtle and interesting work, which keeps you engaged the whole way. As a whole, the film is more entertaining than "Carol," which is set one year later in 1953, but feels hermetically sealed with overly careful tiptoeing around the lesbian romance. "Brooklyn" is also carefully made with getting the period details right, but feels much more alive and rousing than the somber "Carol." The lead actor, Emory Cohen, seems to have studied The Bowery Boys and doesn't seem authentic Italian Brooklyn, but his scenes with Ronan make you want the romance to win.From the overwhelming positive reviews (98% on RT), was expecting a better, not such mixed bag.	1
a6b2caf1-0c7c-4a2c-b1c7-14574f8e1af5	  I would watch Saoirse Ronan in just about anything, and she proves once again that she has true range and star quality.I was reluctant to see this movie previously because I had the impression that it would be depressing. However, without revealing any spoilers, I can say that it is in fact an uplifting and emotionally engaging story that many viewers would enjoy.The comic relief scenes also contribute balance and lightness, with charming appearances by Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent.	1
33bf1725-c54b-4581-aa47-1c2b960f69d2	  I'm not as impressed with Brooklyn as I had hoped to be. Despite the talented actors involved, the fact that the title of the film removes any doubt as to the outcome and the less than exceptional writing and directing leaves me indifferent. There is little to no character development for anyone involved in the story other than the lead and it seems as if the vast majority of the film is purely background and lead up to a conflict which is over almost before it began. Brooklyn is okay to watch on a lazy day when one has nothing else to do but there are several better options available at the theatre at this time.	1
ae10bd48-dfb2-45d9-90df-40249a1dde9d	  Trite, dull, poorly written and endless. Poor Irish girl leaves Ireland to seek her fortune, gets seaskick, gets department store job, meets Italian plumber, returns to Ireland for family emergency, tempted to stay but returns to Brooklyn. Art direction is great, costumes are dreadful, makeup is awful.	0
2dc41ff6-1105-413e-8216-658115852334	  it felt like every other coming of age movie I'd seen, but a nice sort of twist as the story came to a conclusion	1
bbcef7c5-9433-4423-b942-2b7ca559634f	  Beautiful production design and impeccable acting in this period piece that lacks an active protagonist. A couple of plot holes are patched up with heartstrings, but they're still gaping. Worth a watch, but don't expect too much meat on the bone.	1
68ebc26b-92f0-457a-b041-ce4b5987ee87	  Yes, this movie is just as boring as its poster suggests.	0
7b037f8d-7dc3-4668-aa34-0f739a1ae909	  This film does a good job of portraying someone split between two places. CDW	1
1b54d1d1-faab-4a60-87ee-1207fa3a658b	  This is frustrating, because the first two thirds of this film is actually quite good. A fairly touching, genuinely funny at times story of a young girl finding her own place in the world. Then she goes back to Ireland after a death in her family, and the movie lost me HARD by turning into a liar-revealed story and in doing so I lost any sympathy I had for the lead character. All that she had to say was ONE THING to ANY ONE of her friends and none of what follows happens. It honestly made me think she's a rather horrible person, either for even considering staying and abandoning what she had in Brooklyn, or for continuing to let people believe staying and all that implies was even possible. Yet through the framing I'm supposed to feel sympathetic to her? No, I don't: the old shopkeeper may be a miserable person, but I'm sorry she's in the right here. Ugh. Still, I cannot deny the first two thirds is actually very good, the cinematography is excellent, and the acting is good all around (although personally I think Ronan has gorgeous eyes but is a bit stiff at times - she needed to be more natural). As such, I don't hate this like I did "Boyhood" as its not boring like that was, but oh boy did this ever drop the ball with me.	1
443919f7-ab96-4fa1-be12-7fa136f8d401	  An Oscar-bait movie and one that your grandmother will surely eat up, I nevertheless connected with these characters and found it a beautiful depiction of the classical conflict of leaving home and finding your place in the world. Not a must-see film but works well within the predictable and conventional genre of period melodrama.	1

70cf3381-4939-45df-87b6-44d4f12d4c93	  I've never been to Boston, but I've always thought it a c**t of a city. Not just because of its sickening support of the terrorist murderers of the IRA, or its overly-sentimental dewy-eyed oirish heritage, but because its fans and adherents always seemed the sort of people who are long on arrogance and short on morality, and this film kind of sets the record straight. As one who was at a school loosely linked to similar scandals in the UK, it is important that a decent account is made of these disgusting clerics and their corrupt church. Spotlight is well-meaning and although almost marred by Ruffalo's insufferable scene-chewing performance, makes a decent fist of telling the story but with notable omissions in that we see few survivors and - apart from one jaw-dropping all-to-brief scene - no abusers. But although it rattles along, it doesn't climax and there's nothing here that comes close to All The President's Men, the benchmark by which such a movie has to be set.	1

0f263a1c-5df3-46d8-b641-09b31969756b	  Two stars solely for the subject matter of which I approve thoroughly - McCarthy's tone boils down to "if everyone in the Newsroom talks quickly it'll seem like things are more important" - I could tell an actor directed this. There was no conflict in the Newsroom everyone just agreed with each other which missed a trick I think - and mark ruffallo's performance was highly distracting he wasn't warm or engaging and I felt the other actors had to act around rather than with him, he seemed so engrossed in his character acting he couldn't truly interact with the others, who, by the way, all did a great job. I didn't like the way this film handled itself at all - it was like a bad TV show. McCarthy and Ruffallo ruined this for me, and as the director and an actor with the most screentime this was bad, everyone else did the best they could. I'm not giving this extra points just because of the subject matter which every other critic seems to want to do.	0
979f4972-83d8-4a81-9819-5be2d9e07c15	  I was raised very Catholic and no longer practice and do not consider myself such. I honestly do not see what everyone is raving about with this movie. I almost fell asleep during the first 30 minutes it is very slow moving! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the acting talent. Some of the limes are so badly written it's almost laughable. There is no chemistry between the actors. The cast is seriously lacking in diversity. This story has been told too many times and I was hoping that possibly the movie would add a different perspective to it. Instead it just beat the same add dead horse we have heard for years. Same old stuff just repackaged. I have no idea how this movie got a nomination for best directing when the majority of it takes place in one room!	0
412bb1ed-2ba7-40bc-8c5c-f7fb8453fe41	  Good but overrated. This was no "All The President"s Men." Simply not crackling and gripping as expected. All performances were excellent, led by Keaton, but Oscar worthy is debatable. All the unknown actors and bit roles very much out-shined the bigger performances. Oscar nod for Rachel McAdams for mostly taking notes on a pad is perplexing to say the least. Overall did not live up to the hype based on nominations. Direction was excellent and worthy of nod but could not create the tension it needed. It was easy to lose track of all the names and characters that are mentioned in rapid-fire fashion throughout. Most dissapointing was Liev Schreiber in a very under developed role.	1
899f057e-3997-4818-95b2-d88bd9225594	  Don't care for pedophiles or covering it up, but just too sad and preachy. Mark Ruffalo couldn't show an emotional range if you punched him in the balls during a blow job.	0
829e3afb-8a58-4b8a-9304-c2d1c7bdfdf4	  I guess each individual does have different tastes in movies. I just saw this one, it was pretty good, i can see why it's rated very high. It was well written, well directed, great acting, i actually was very impressed with Ruffalo's performance. I think if i was more into these kind of movies, i would of adore more, but still good movie.	1

5037feb4-1301-4f7f-830a-22c13abd9af8	  "Spotlight" Cast a Shadow on the Catholic ChurchWith an all-star cast and a compelling story, "Spotlight" delivers a blandly straightforward telling of the priest sex-abuse scandal and cover-up through the investigative story featured in the Boston Globe in the early 2000s. The city of Boston was torn apart by the scandal that had lasted for decades, and according the film, many people worked to shield the Church from the consequences of the scandal. Without the cover-up, the scandal would not have lasted so long. However well done and easy to follow the story was, it was predictable. Few revelations were made for me. Certainly, it is an important story to tell, and I am glad I saw the film. However, none of the characters lived up to the power of story itself and the actors adding little to its telling. This may be the case of too much story, too little screen time. The film attempted in a couple of cases to make the suffering of the survivors real, but it played like an episode of "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit" and not like a feature film. It was too small for such a lofty topic. In the film, they often mentioned that people died, but it seemed unreal. Examples of that were need to bring it home. The film covered too much time without making the connections for the audience. I really want to like this film more, but it fails as cinema in too many ways. It would have made a better Lifetime Channel Drama as it was written. ??Rating: Matinee"Spotlight" is good but not great. After a while, Mark Ruffalo's (playing lead reporter Mike Rezendez) pained expression wears thin. Does he have any other look? Not much in this film. Stanley Tucci puts in a good turn as a lawyer working with the survivors, but the rest of the cast is pedestrian. Perhaps it was the writing, but the film and characters didn't greatly impact me despite the best intentions of the filmmakers and the tragedy of the true story. Peace,Tex Shelters	1

2cae913d-1af8-4142-a4ec-28b1da71988b	  certainly entertaining enough. a good story. but i realy didnt have any emotional investment in the film. i understand that it had to focus on the investigation. that it was an ode to investigative journalism... that the story was really to big and it had to focus on the journalists and not and part of the story that could have easily been emotional. or could have had more of an emotional story arc. none of the performances were that great as none of them really had too much to do. noe one has anything challenging. liev schreiber was the only one of note. i though mark ruffalo had a couple very odd moments. its a whats for dinner movie.	1

886b406d-5734-4b68-8e0e-04afa49c0603	  The true story behind the film dwarfs it both in the moment and after - when its greatest impact is felt through a series of pointed, factual inserts about what the team's work ultimately laid bare. Ruffalo does memorable, if mannered, work, and the film is brisk and intellectually engaging. It's not, as some purport, a stellar achievement in film; but, rather, a serviceable, workmanlike documenting of a stellar achievement in journalism.	1

11b0836b-a61d-4d0a-b37d-263e976a705c	  Spotlight was a good movie. Not great, not memorable, but it kept my attention. It also reminded me of a movie released in 1975, Three Days of the Condor, which in spite of it's one similarity to this movie, was indeed Great. What did they have in common? In both cases they promulgated a big lie, by sanctifying the New York Times (or in this case, it's subsidiary, Boston Glob) and it's 'journalists' as constituting the last line of defense of our civil-liberties in this country. What it clearly demonstrated: if someone happens to be on the list of people that Liberals and Leftists despise, these so-called journalists will leave no stone unturned in their attempt to discredit, defame and if possible destroy that person professionally and personally. However, if you happen to be on their list of people who can do no wrong -- they will do whatever is necessary to prop up whatever lies, half-truths, or popular prejudices they can to prevent an inconvenient truth about that person from seeing the light of day. So, for those who prefer to think of this movie as pure fiction, taking place on a planet nowhere near our solar-system, I gave it 3-starts. !;)	1

d5cb26d9-2a60-4d11-9950-ae8071875f5b	  Did you know the Catholic Church has been complicit in thousands of sexual abuse scandals? If somehow that's news to you, then the movie might be riveting, but I can't help but feel the drama is supposed to come from the revelation of information that's been common knowledge for over a decade. I feel like a dunce any time a movie seems to get unanimous rave reviews while I remain unaffected, but I'm just not sure how this was supposed to be interesting. Despite what almost everyone says, the acting is not electrifying; it is, like everything else in this movie, simply competent and functional. (Rachel McAdams's delivery seems particularly forced.) The standout, however, is Liev Schreiber, who paradoxically generates the most interest and charisma through a character who essentially has no personality.But where was the drama in this movie? The Spotlight team makes a lot of phone calls, conducts a lot of interviews, and looks over a lot of documents. That's the movie. There's no arc. As it unspools, you find that the sexual abuse scandal is massive and involves more and more people, but again, we already knew that. There isn't any story telling to speak of, just procedural what-have-you to reach a foregone conclusion.So if your idea of a taught thriller consists of characters talking to other characters whose identity and/or importance isn't really described; or if you like seeing people read documents, the contents and importance of which aren't fully explained; or if you're in the mood to see characters tackle a big problem that honestly doesn't really affect their welfare and puts very little at stake...then for you, this may be Best Picture 2016.	1
da937a77-b129-469b-87aa-b75674a05ab6	  Story wise this is a great film and it leaves the audience completely overwhelmed by the extent of the abuse and cover-up.That being said, would it have killed the director and the producer to add some passion to the acting and some type of musical overture? The cheap and obvious attempts during the actual movie to be classified as a "thriller" were just flat out crap!	1
9a5f4b8c-bd89-4953-be11-34f71344fe41	  This movie is utterly ridiculous. To blame an entire religion, instead of indivual people for their actions is just another attempt from the far left to demonize religion. ZERO STARS.	0

cac689eb-9aa2-44db-bf19-bc5994956877	  The pedophile priest scandal was very bad. And sadly, so is this movie. Most critics love it. They're wrong. It was billed as a "thriller". It's not. No suspense at all. It views more like a cartoon take-down of the evil Catholic Church (insert cheers here). And the acting is solid wood: The big shot at high emotion is the "It's Time!" (to destroy Cardinal Law) speech by Ruffalo's character, and, as Oscar Wilde might have put it, you'd have to have a heart of stone not to laugh at the overwrought dramatics. And some niggling questions remain: Has there ever been an infantile priest like the one in this movie who confesses his crime to Rachel McAdam - on the doorstep in mere seconds! Is Rachel's character guilty of elder abuse when she shows her dear old grannie, a three-times-a-week church-goer, the shocking news about the scandal in her church? That little silent scene must be the most ludicrous polemical overkill in the history of movies. And why is Michael Keaton's character surprised that so many people call in claiming clerical abuse after the big story breaks? Isn't he supposed to be a hard-nosed journo?Oh, Oscar, Oscar! Sort it all out for us, please.	0
c5d00692-8160-4f4d-996c-71440fdaa482	  Preachy (no pun intended), forced, self-righteous, and yet another movie that demonizes religion. I'm not all that religious, and yet even I'm getting sick of this denigrating, Hollywood trend.There is some good acting to be had here, though. Michael Keaton, in particular, is enjoying a deserved renaissance. For the life of me, however, I do not understand the appeal of Mark Ruffalo. Besides just being generally annoying, I just don't find him to be a convincing actor.	0
eedb84df-a837-491b-9eb9-2b147982bc43	  It's slow but its horrors is tense and nerve-racking at times.

8b6751ff-9252-42e6-9a7d-e70f00804dc5	  A teenage woman has sex with her boyfriend and then discovers that a shape-shifting demon follows her; if it catches up, she dies.Here is what this film is trying to do: it's trying to send up the horror movie formula of if a female character has sex, she's sure to die. It's trying to be an homage to (or satire of) John Carpenter's original Halloween film.Here is what the film actually accomplishes: it annoys the living shit out of me. The follow shots and heavy-handed music do nothing to add suspense. Rather, they're almost comic in their over-drawn melodrama. And let's talk a while about this demon. What about hand stuff? Does the demon only get transferred with procreative sex? What if she doesn't come? What about lesbian sex? And why is the demon sometimes one shape but other times another? Why is it only occasionally naked? Why did the demon kill everyone else, but when it catches up to our heroine, it only plays with her hair? Why does it have so much trouble with doorknobs but is capable of flying or climbing on a roof, standing there with Osama bin Laden's beard over its dick? I know the film doesn't want to answer these questions, but they're so obvious.Overall, what's being hailed as "one of the greatest American horror films in years" is a dumb piece of shit.	0
c38fa9dd-8362-48e9-89a3-4cb523a6f231	  Incredibly disturbing, It Follows is a creepy and atmospheric low-budget indie horror film. An allegory about STDs (in part), the story follows a young girl who, after having sex with her boyfriend, is stalked by a mysterious shapeshifting creature that can only be seen by those who've had sex with an infected person, and it can only be escaped from (for a time) by passing on the infection to another person through sex. Maika Monroe gives a strong performance that's nuanced and really shows her struggle to come to grips with her situation. However, the director makes some odd choices in creating a setting, as it comes off as a strange alternative reality with a mixture of futuristic and retro fashions and technologies (which is quite distracting). Additionally, the creature effects are rather grotesque; with the creature often appearing mangled and in various stages of nudity. A problematic film, It Follows delivers some effective scares, but the who and the what are so vague that the story ends up being rather unsatisfying.	0

03536088-6e70-47fe-a4f3-c9cd94a90f75	  THE RING GETS CHLAMYDIA - My Review of IT FOLLOWS (3 Stars)Often pretentious, overly metaphorical, and uneven in pace, IT FOLLOWS is still writer/director David Robert Mitchell's praiseworthy attempt to inject a little originality into the often stale horror genre. Whereas THE RING was built on the premise that a mysterious videotape would bring death to its viewers, IT FOLLOWS promises being haunted by a shape-shifting specter unless you have sex with someone to transfer the target over to them. Think of it as the consequences of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection, but with more horrific symptoms. As allegories go, it's rich with potential, and Mitchell clearly strives to make the most out of it. He works hard with cinematographer Mike Gioulakis to achieve an endlessly fluid shooting style rife with striking, unusual framing. One unfortgettable shot of blood in a swimming pool is almost worth the price of admission alone. Add a heavy 80s-style synth score, a strange, timeless, quasi-70s/80s production design that mixes cell phones with rabbit ear televisions, old rusty cars, a zonked-out, naturalistic acting style exhibited by its young cast, and the strangest clamshell cameo Kindle device that has never existed, and you're entering John Carpenter Land by way of Terrence Malick. The Malick reference gets its due in not only the unforced, elliptical way our characters converse but in choices Mitchell makes, such as concentrating on a shot of our heroine's hand grazing grass and flowers during a particularly quiet moment right before something awful occurs.The film opens strong, with a twirling 360 degree shot of a young girl racing out of her home dressed in bra, panties and high heels. She's being chased by something unseen and before you know it, she meets an unexpectedly grisly fate. From here, we meet our heroine, Jay (Maika Monroe), who looks like the the product of a fourgy between Kelly Clarkson, Kat Dennings, Reese Witherspoon and Chloe Sevigny, as she wades in her backyard, above ground pool. This is one laid back teen. She's so laconic, she can't even be bothered to shoo an ant crawling across her arm. It's suburban Detroit and Jay's life consists of being observed by her horny pre-teen neighbors, drinking with her friends and family, and dating an easygoing guy. It's at this date where things go seriously and irrevocably wrong. I won't spoil the plot much further, but the aftermath of some backseat sex isn't anywhere close to what Jay imagined. In most horror films, you pay for having sex. Here, sex is the only way out. IT FOLLOWS really turns up the creep factor after this initial sexual encounter, with a shocking cut to the next scene. It seems to be Mitchell's terror equivalent to finding out your partner just intentionally infected you with an STI. With Jay dumped back home looking like a rape victim, those closest to her rally by her side to help her escape her fate. In an almost silent performance, Monroe must convey fear and a certain guilt for the rest of the film. There are a few good scares of the "jump out of your seat when somebody goes 'Boo!' variety" and a few haunting scenes where she's being stalked. The framing of the shots truly helps these sequences flourish as you're made to look around constantly to discover the predator. Knowing the threat could be coming from anywhere is part of this movie's simmering tension. Additionally, like a diagnosis of syphilis, our main character has a tough time disclosing what's happening to her. Unfortunately, there's not much else to the film. Our leads run and run and run, stopping sometimes to have sex until they come up with a plan to conquer this "thing". Although visually stunning, that big sequence doesn't make a lot of sense, and it feels like the rules changed slightly to justify what happens. Ultimately, it feels like the film is a little light on incident and lacks a satisfying resolution, ending up feeling like a light campfire story instead of a big, hearty meal. More haunting than scary and more metaphor than fleshed-out storytelling, IT FOLLOWS is an admiral homage. Rich Vreeland's score is an acquired taste. It booms in almost every frame in a way that reminded me of Christopher Nolan's DARK KNIGHT and is highly evocative of the score from HALLOWEEN. It feels intentional and will either feel like a propulsive addition to the storytelling (my feeling) or annoy the hell out of you. Same goes with the odd, can't-place-it time in which the story is set. For me, it kept me engaged in the film, with its vague, hazy memories of a time where we would have to talk with each other instead of texting. Others will find it to be a pretentious conceit. Fair enough, but love it or hate it, IT FOLLOWS has a lot on its mind and Mitchell clearly wants to establish a new, methodical voice in film storytelling.	1
e7bf4e52-e482-491a-b5cb-4ab1126846b3	  I am not sure what all the hype was about for this horror movie. The critics on Rotten Tomato gave it 96% fresh and 66% of the audience liked it. I am definitely more in line with the audience. Spoilers AheadI kept hearing that it was so intense, and that you'd be scanning everyone in the background to see who is after the victim. Um, no. It was completely obvious who was after the intended victim. Most of the time the scene was so bare of other people, there was no other choice as to who it would be. The main character's acting just checked out after she told her friends that something was following her, and when they finally believed her. Jay looked comatose, constantly lying against her friend, or even just straight up sleeping. I would think she would be way more hyped up, on constant alert, and afraid of going to sleep. More like a Nightmare on Elm Street vibe.You needed to have sex to pass it onto the next person, so the creature would be after them instead of you. What if she were to have sex with three different guys at the same time? (Yes, one in each opening.) Would it pass on to all three of them? It might make me a slut, but I would try it, just on the off chance it worked. The creature having to kill three people before it got back to me is way better odds than just one person.And the end scene in the pool where the creature is throwing electrical items at Jay. Okay, I suppose I can go with each item coming unplugged from an electrical source before it hit the water. But some of them were on really long extension cords. Every single one the creature threw was on a short cord??The other thing with the pool, they are in the most run down part of Detroit and every building near by is super run down or vacant/vandalized. But here you have this gorgeous brick building in perfect condition. Even better it has running electricity and a huge, well maintained swimming pool. No. Just No.And what was up with Jay's friends (Annie?) giving a monologue about not being able to go past Eight Mile when she was a kid because that's where the suburbs ended and the bad part of town began. Since the writer is from Michigan, this was his nod to his home state, but it served no purpose to the plot, and in fact just stood out as super odd.This is such a minor thing, but Jay's cast. The first time she's just walking around her pool with the cast on. That's super fun. At least be on a raft floating around. And then later on she's in actual bodies of water. Even if it's a fiberglass one, you are not to get it wet. I know a stupid, picky thing, but just one more thing to add to the list of annoyances.And where the hell were all the parents in this movie. I know it's a typical horror movie, and the parents need to be elsewhere for the teens to get into trouble. But every other adult was home. A woman unpacking her groceries, lots of people doing yard work, etc.What I took away from this is if you are a teen/young adult, do not have sex. You will get an STD, maybe even a supernatural one.There were a couple good parts; the musical score did it's job by keeping me off balance a bit, and it did provide some tension. I also enjoyed the cinematography having a more 80's slasher movie vibe to it. But at points where the camera is scanning the scene 360 degrees looking for the creature, I had to close my eyes because it was making me queasy. But that may have been the objective, if so, well done.Although it may not seem like it, I really do feel bad not having liked it. I was so excited to find a good horror movie, since they are rare lately. But alas, No. Just No.	0

3448a294-901e-4726-bd0b-ca8f61a8888b	  Dumb, derivative and above all, awful.How this film can be considered in such high regard is probably the most menacing thing about it. When you consider that this scores higher than Hitchcock's legendary "Psycho" or Carpenters masterful "Halloween", you will be deeply disturbed.The plot is riddled with holes and is no more complex than a Tom and Jerry cartoon and it's multiple levels are presumably that it is a metaphor for STD's.If however, you live in fear of an easily avoidable adversary throwing a toaster at you then prepare to be horrified.Don�t waste your time, watch a classic horror film instead.	0

8e5f8571-66f5-4bad-b85c-c7a77ffcdd2e	  How this movie gets 97 is beyond me. How so many people think this movie is good is even more puzzling. What is good about it? In my opinion it looked like a sub par student film. Please explain to me why 90% of the camera shots had to be a zoom, pan, tilt, dolly/tracking shot? Is it because the movie is called "It Follow" so the camera has to 'follow' all the characters? If so, that may sound clever, but it just seemed well overdone, plus it made the movie's pacing even slower than it already was. And thats another thing...slowest...movie...ever!So what are the rules? We know Freddy can only get you in your sleep, Jason cant do water, dont watch the tape and The Ring girl can't get you, etc. What are the rules of "It" other than banging someone else to pass it off to them? We don't know. And that, for lack of a better word, is stupid.But how do we even know that rule? Hugh tells Jay. But how did he find out? He said he didnt remember the girl he got it from, so who told him? If I'm just sitting there minding my business and notice someone walking towards me REALLY, REALLY SLOWLY, I may think its weird, I may think its creepy, I may even run away. But under no circumstances will it just pop into my head that this person is following cuz i just screwed that chick. And even further from my consideration would be sleeping with someone else so that it starts following her and not me.And what the hell year is it supposed to be? Old ass tvs, old ass phone, but cell phones (girl in the beginning), and that weird makeup ereader thing seemed like something relatively current. I'll give it to them that its somewhat original, but it made no sense at all. The kids never have an actual plan of attack. Why not just go to Japan or something. The thing is so damn slow that by the time it walked there you'd be like 90 and wouldnt give a shit anymore.I was honestly expecting this movie to score in the 30s, maybe...MAYBE in the 40s. But 97! WHY?!	0
be93bc55-02c7-4034-b54c-adbe87beb698	  There is nothing overtly bad about this movie, but neither is there anything that impressive that will stand out. The film is marked as horror, but really it seems to have as much comedy as horror to me - in other words, this isn't about to be the start of a franchise such as a Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Candyman, or numerous other horror flicks. It's more horror to the main character and a couple of her friends. The audience? Not so much. To be blunt, I personally considered this as much comedy as horror, and for the "critics consensus" about it being terrifying? Hardly. Worth seeing as a rental, but really not that frightening.	1

9b77cad0-46f4-4166-8393-df4b4ece9fe3	  It Follows is heavily flawed in its story. Although the technical execution is superb, what one needs in order to make a good film is a satisfying story, an ultimate climax, something that the tension builds up to. What we get in It Follows is all of the suspense without the payoff. This review is coming from a mindset that loves metaphors, and is constantly looking for them when watching film. Because of this reason, the film confused the hell outta me, for it had no distinct purpose. I couldn't tell what the director was trying to SAY. Unlike other modern, critically acclaimed horror films (The Babadook comes to mind), It Follows doesn't know what it's symbolism is actually attempting to convey, and for this reason, the film gets muddled down into a pretty cheesy horror flick that probably doesn't deserve the acclaim that it has received. A disappointing, frustrating watch.	1
d2fa0ed5-858e-4ef2-869f-17d1bf0f4a78	  Probably the most overrated movie i've ever seen. I first saw this movie before I read any of the reviews on rotten tomatoes or IMBD and I thought it was awful. It does not leave you in suspense or scare you throughout. The only scares, if you want to call them that, were jump scares, only one of which not being predictable. It definitely is not smart, as it is literally about an STD. The acting is mediocre along with the plot which overall makes the movie extremely boring. At points in the movie I felt myself falling asleep. Overall a boring movie with mediocre acting, a bad plot, and extremely predictable and stupid jumpscares.	0

0836c669-2b6e-415a-a274-2429590e236b	  It Follows has a very unique premise, but the actual film is a bore. Their are a few scares and creeps, but not nearly enough for a horror flick.	1

3681f66c-2508-4956-8a64-55c0701a59be	  Overall, it reminded me too much of Final Destination. Would monogamy solve the problem? Just pass the curse back and forth every couple of days to keep the stalker at bay. Or set up a sex ring spread across the globe to keep it walking in circles. I liked the music and the overall look/feel. But, it just left me shrugging afterwards.	1
8155b3b0-49a7-485a-b993-7b69ff0cf87f	  This move is appallingly bad. The entity is not scary and the characters are frustrating. It failed on every level of a horror film - it was not scary AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!	0
4e674ecc-dbbb-4a5c-900c-7b022a64e3f7	  Mood does not a movie make, but that seems to be much of what this overrated exercise in alleged horror seems to rely on to carry the film. Its heavy-handed STD symbolism and allusions to classic horror films don't add much either, especially when weighted down by an excess of prolonged shots of characters emoting while contemplating their fates. I missed seeing this in theaters when it was initially released (I was attending the Chicago Film Festival at the time), but I'm glad I didn't waste any effort trying to fit this one in during its initial run. Easily one of the year's most overhyped offerings.	0

8193019c-8ec4-4807-8cab-f6834cebc55b	  The premise of this horror movie is pretty good - but it does make the monster strangely similar to a venereal disease. It follows you around until you pass it to someone else by having sex with them. Fortunately, it walks very slow - which is creepy and creates a great deal of suspense. The monster also takes different guises, so a different actor plays it each time. So, a bunch of teens confront this threat but it is a real challenge to stop; plaudits to the movie for keeping things realistic and practical (taking its cues from night of the living dead) even as the whole concept is not. The soundtrack and the burnt out neighbourhoods of Detroit add to the spooky atmosphere (and the absence of gore is a plus for me). Unfortunately, the filmmakers seem to run out of steam with their premise and can't quite produce a satisfying ending. But this is still one of the better recent horror flicks, in a genre that is pretty tough to get right.	1
afb0d2a5-541b-4196-bd88-074e0f0f612e	  Even if I had not heard of flattery reviews It Follows received, I would have found it not entertaining. Premise is very strong and interesting but to keep it realistic and teen friendly, there is nothing happening on screen except for nudity. I would call cinematography weak as well as there was not much shaking of camera which was eminent for this genre. Another aspect is adult absence in the movie which is confusing.Not so entertaining movie which completely failed to build strong work on good idea.	0
ebd0f5cc-921b-42ba-902a-d8dd05f2ae57	  This movie is not a waste of life don't get me wrong, its a solid 2,5 stars maybe even 3. Without a doubt the movie is scary and has a unique way of delivering its horror. However the script is sparse, dotted with awkward moments where another line or two could have helped nurture the scene a bit more. Perhaps the writer/director David Mitchel thought to fill these gaps with some kind of visual narration but it rang empty (fell on blind eyes?) in my opinion.Putting some awkward moments aside, in general the film is shot well and the sound design, excellent! If you enjoyed Final Destination (the original) then you may find the the kind of suspense beats on offer here familiar and I would recommend this movie in kind.	1
84d2dc00-e47f-466d-8e13-4b59e906c5c0	  This movie was lame. I don't know how it got such a high score.... "it" is just a weird killer thing that gets passed by banging, but it doesn't....uninteresting concept. It did not leave me "lingering" it left me with a weird face and wanting to write this negative review. Don't waste your time, the movie Teeth was better and that movie blows too.	0
a6a3d3ff-c140-4d52-b4c2-bfb9d711a096	  Such an annoying soundtrack; reminds me of Turkish psychedelic '80s movies. The movie itself was't that bad. I really liked some parts, quite scary at times. Acting was okay for a bunch of teenagers.	1
67e3e89c-3243-431a-b147-45046803ab8f	  55%Saw this on 13/8/15Aside from a few jump scares and a reasonably good performance from Maika Monroe, It follows is an unoriginal film with a pedestrian story that still thinks that those who loose their virginity before marriage are to be put under the knife. These are the kind of shits that the original Scream(1996) so effectively mocked. This is also a kind of film that you feel like appreciating while you watchit, but once it's over, you end up feeling how unmemorable all the shit really is.	1

84006593-a12a-4564-b120-67931e7fe8df	  So this movie got crazy good reviews when it came out which got me interested in seeing it. I know I am in the minority but I did not like it. It just becomes so inconsistent and leaves so much stuff open ended that is just became frustrating. There are these scenes that happen and are never answered, the kids make the dumbest decisions (especially nearly the end with the whole pool thing) when they know all about "it", the music got super annoying, and I just thought it was not scary at all, in fact it was kind of boring! I liked Maika Monroe she was a good lead here, it was all filmed in Detroit which gave it a good suburban feel, and it was cool that it had a low budget type of feel to it.	0
666e63ac-4d15-4d07-8522-9c4e039f32d5	  I can't even give this movie 1/2 of a star. This was a ridiculously stupid movie. I've never watched a movie with so many rave reviews only to be dumbfounded at how bad it was.	0

f2a7fd45-de02-435a-b8b6-9fd75dd3c203	  Oh, farting chick. Charming. I hate the farting narcoleptic girl. Do these kids have parents? It gets major points for featuring a Father and Son commercial. Is it not allowed to follow when you're sleeping? That slut will sleep with anyone to get rid of her pursuer. No wonder she's surrounded by perverts. Actually, an interesting idea. Some of the night scenes in Detroit in slow mo with jarring music are quite effective. The ending made no sense. Why would there be a bloody pool if it was already sot before? Cause it's in water, that was never electrocuted? This cause a half-star deduction. But the amazing Detroit-ness adds that half star.Paul: "You could...pass it on."Subtle.	1
083b6c64-9b12-48d1-896d-964b5dac1040	  It follows has a pretty unique story line where our lead actress, Jay, contacts an STD (Sexual Transmitted Demon) from a seemingly innocent sexual encounter. She soon finds out that this innocent encounter will eventually haunt her until she finds somebody else to pass the (STD) to. I feel like this movie had a lot of potential, but lacked a lot of depth. The story seemed to be one big loop hole. Good graphics, great soundtrack, alright actors. Like I said, it had potential, but over all I think it was just alright, and the story didn't make much sense.	0

130135eb-394e-4348-b29e-d7cdf8129d5b	  I've heard a lot of hype over this one so I gave it a watch. Overall it ain't bad but a good deal of faults stand out to me more than the positive aspects of it. It was mildly chilling but the characters were pretty much lifeless and the dialogue was poor. The toss in of Dostoevsky and TS Elliot quotes to attempt to latch onto a greater theme felt very cheap. It was cleanly shot and overall the score was quite good, except for a couple of the cues which sounded like the wrong sort of 80s horror soundtrack. I probably wouldn't watch it again. Very cheesy all and all.	1

01007be8-89f1-4275-8d9f-b92c741b9558	  A film about the over-arcing effect of guilt and the nebulous quality of fear - it could also be a metaphor for the Fox News effect.	1
0bdba826-b56f-4e82-8d97-414ec69c7583	  There are a lot of positives I can point out with this film. A good unknown cast, an original story, some very nice directing resulting in a very aesthetically pleasing movie. The ending, however is likely to disappoint a lot of people. That is unless they plan to make several sequels to explain what happens next, a question which we sort of need to know. I thought that they could have done a lot more too, there were not enough scary scenes which was a bit of a waste.	1
885ea52e-12bc-4a0e-8c26-487bceb265ab	  It Follows is only scary if you are frightened by awkward pauses and stupidity. It's like the filmmakers knew their actors were terrible and their dialogue was awful, so they avoided having the characters talk as much as possible. The plot doesn't make sense and it is constantly breaking its own rules. The stalking monster is creepy in theory, but around the third or fourth time the characters run away from it, the premise gets old. The most horrifying thing to me is that some people actually like this movie.	0

fad788f0-98c9-4c07-9ce9-5d3f14f7f918	  Finally a horror movie that does things right. It Follows gives us a great premise, likable characters and mounting paranoia.This movie is thoroughly enjoyable.	1
16762a55-4391-431f-b3f6-539479a2b641	  It Follows is the kind of movie that you bring up at parties when you want to pretend you have taste. "Oh, you went to see the latest Saw? No, I'm not really into mainstream horror. Have you seen It Follows? It's more of a cerebral horror film, you know?" The premise sounds like something a fundamentalist church would make up to scare kids into chastity: out on a date, the main character has sex with a boy. Immediately afterward, he reveals that he's passed on the mother of all STDs: a shapeshifting monster that will slowly but constantly track her down and kill her. The only way she can escape is by sleeping with someone else and passing it down the line.Shot with an eye for unflattering lighting that would make Terry Richardson proud, and scored with minimal electronic music reminiscent of Drive, It Follows is certainly stylish. Every location in the movie could double as an American Apparel photoshoot. The story drifts from abandoned factory ruin-porn to an instagrammable cabin to a normcore chic suburban living room. The characters, rock a "bland as cool" aesthetic that instantly made me feel old. Our protagonist (the one being followed by the "It") and her friends sleepwalk through an adult-shaped world where the adults seem mostly absent. Even as an unspeakable horror walks inexorably toward them, they behave like teenagers: pouting and procrastinating, lusting and bloviating. And always, over everything,they project that melodramatic sense of doom every angsty teen has felt. Though unlike most teens, in this case it's completely justified. Over the course of the movie, with the help of her friends and the boy next door, the girl attempts to escape through various means. What originally looked like a metaphor about the dangers of unprotected sex proves to be a larger exploration of the transition to adulthood and how the discovery of sex and our own mortality are linked. The running and screaming seems, somehow, more existential than usual. The fear seems more grounded in reality, despite the monster. The requisite sex scenes are less about lust than the loss of innocence and the transience of relationships. Far from turning the characters into sex objects, (there's no actual nudity by the way) they remind the viewer just how young and vulnerable these kids are. Overall, this is horror for those who like their chills flavored with a little intellectual pretension, a popcorn movie for those who insist that would rather critique than cry out in surprise. If you're looking to be titillated with blood and boobs you're going to be disappointed. But if you're a college sophomore who needs to bang out a five page paper for your intro to film class, It Follows is a great choice. It's neither as terrifying nor as deep as it would like to pretend, but there's enough in there to earn you an A.	1

9f34d9c5-2fde-4940-b685-4b2ff00a44f4	  It showcased performers playing their actual ages while talking and dressing the ages they represented which was a nice change for film makers though the director was in love with our main character's feet a little too much. This movie had potential to be better, but suffered from long bouts of nothing more than character development which it did indeed succeed in making the characters realistic and likable. But as creepy as the rare parts were, it just missed being as agonizing as it was built up as.	1

04b64b87-c89b-4588-bd93-32df7ccdf843	  Hmmm where do I start with this one? I don't hate it like some people do. But I don't actually love it like others. For me, it fell in the middle. It was another great first half, marred by a dull second half.First, let me go over the good. The soundtrack is amazingly awesome. It may have the best horror score in decades. It's reminiscent of old John Carpenter. Speaking of Carpenter, this movie is so heavily inspired by his movies that it almost comes off as a shameless ripoff. It Follows is basically the best Michael Myers movie that doesn't actually have Michael Myers. The way things are shot and characters interact is very reminiscent of Halloween. Like I said before, the first half of this movie is great. It's full of wonderfully creepy ideas and the teenagers actually act like teenagers. There's a nice slow, tense build, and the car scene and the dilapidated building scene are well done and creepy.But that's where things started to go bad though. Not so bad the movie sucked, but just underwhelming. The first major issue is the "it" itself. It really should be just one monster with one identity. The whole ambiguous "it can look like anyone" thing just made it less terrifying when you see it on screen. I get that they were probably going for an STD-type metaphor, but I just don't find old ladies, chubby naked girls peeing themselves, and hipsters to be all that frightening. Why not have the "it" be faceless? Maybe make it naked, but with no discernible gender. Just an idea, but that would be creepy and it would give more of an identity to the monster and make it scarier when it appears on screen. Or maybe the idea of "it" being faceless would make the obvious connections to Halloween a little too obvious. Another issue is there is no real way to fight the monster. That would be fine, but since there is no way to kill the monster the characters just stand around and wait till it shows up, run away, and then do it all over again. There needed to be some sort of goal the characters were working towards. How about a Ring-esque plot where they're trying to figure out where the curse started from and how they can solve it? They could go from place to place until they end up in even worse parts of Detroit (the city by the way is one of the best parts of the movie). Maybe they do or don't find the origins of the curse, but at least it would give them something to do.The ending with the pool seemed confusing and pointless. Their plan was to electrocute it? Did they realize how stupid their plan seemed and that throwing toasters in an olympic-sized pool wasn't going to work anyway? They could actually interact with it, even if they couldn't see it, so why not try to trap it? Then the movie just sort of ends abruptly.So while I enjoyed most of the movie, it really suffers for being underwhelming. It's like everything was in place for a true horror classic to stand next to Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, and A Nightmare on Elm Street, but it falls way short of hitting it over the fence. I can't help but imagine how amazing this would have been if it were pretty much the same movie, but with a Michael Myers-like killer and a Ring-like plot to keep it interesting. It Follows just isn't that scary, despite having some of the most terrifying concepts and ideas to come to a horror movie since masked killers and reanimated corpses.	1
75e47422-f7c5-4a4c-a8a7-526d73e28c17	  I watched this movie on the recommendation of a couple of sources because I wanted to see some good horror with my friend. Honestly, I have no clue how this movie has such a high score. If I could describe it with one word it would be "boring". There's a difference between a slow burn and just unnecessary padding. Half the dialogue I was left wondering what the point of putting it there was. At one point there was an aside that sounded like it might be a commentary on classism in America? But it's placement was so strange and added nothing. At no point did they make any attempt to figure out this creature's limitations. Will uninterrupted water - lake, sea, ocean? - with no crossing hinder it? The pool scene implies it can swim, but can it swim across an ocean? For that matter, how fast does it walk? And it's obviously capable of more cognitively involved processes than walking- it throws rocks through windows and apparently recognizes a trap to electrocute it - what's stopping it from walking on transportation exactly? Other than it ruining this movie's "gimmick" of course. I'm not really sure what's so apparently original about this thing. It falls into some pretty common horror movie cliches - from sex inviting in corruption/evil/whathaveyou, to the casual use of women's naked bodies for shock, to the head-desk worthy amount of plot-induced idiocy required of the protagonists to make this setup work. I could've watched 3 Headed Shark Attack instead. At least that movie I know is SUPPOSED to be bad.	0
c742c9c5-4b3e-404d-a8f4-158dc534cfd2	  Inexplicably earning a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes, "It Follows" benefits from reviewers anticipating that horror movies tend to be utter pieces of crap. Anything that exceeds these expectations gets a positive review. "It Follows" begins with a nice enough premise, practically guaranteed to build white-knuckle tension: promiscuous teens acquire an STD, "se*ually transmitted demon" who stalks them, one at a time, until they're either killed, or they pass the curse onto the next victim. The demon is always making a b-line for the victim, slowly walking. That's pretty scary, right? The only other thing the movie does right is cast a group of average-looking teens and create an environment that feels very real. For a reviewer who has had his fill of whitewashed cinematography, CGI, and perfect skin and teeth, "It Follows" felt refreshingly organic. Unfortunately, that's where the refreshment ends...precisely because that's where the writer/director stopped having anymore ideas. As the creature stalks our heroine hither and yon, the protagonists make no headway on solving the mystery or getting themselves out of the accursed jam. The filmmaker peppers the movie with anachronism, technology out-of-time: black-and-white picture-tube televisions share the same space as a digital e-reader shaped like a makeup compact. When questioned why this was the case, the director said he was trying to confuse the audience and create a "timeless" movie. Hey, idiot! That's not what "timeless" means! Additional groans can be garnered from attempts at poetry and metaphor, and artsy shots that serve no purpose to the story. There's nothing more tedious than posers trying to give their best impression of "meaningful." Stick with the scary formula and make a straightforward horror movie with an ending. "It Follows" might have reinvigorated the genre. As it happens, It Sucks.	0

17163022-6f7e-4855-8e6f-debef9507e63	  Not a unique story with some unreasonable events, but a uniquely good looking horror film, beautifully directed. You can enjoy the cinematography & soundtracks.	1
6a6e659c-ec33-4be6-a54a-de9d7d77fe4e	  Listen to me closely, the amount of positive reviews for this brutally terrible movie are both destroying my faith in Rotten Tomatoes and the human race in general. I know you think I might be harsh here, but I am honestly just trying to get you to not waste your life like I did. This movie had terrible acting,a story as empty as my own soul after watching this, and an ending so abrupt and bad that I spent the better part of my evening last night trying to find the person who wrote this, just so I could kick that person in the nuts.Please like better movies in the future and stop hyping up this sort of trash.I gave it half a star on the basis that it succeeded in one aspect of horror, as it is frighteningly bad and as such made me want to vomit myself into oblivion.	0

d86879d2-d59e-473b-9fc3-f64f784e26f1	  This is worth a watch, and maybe I should give it another chance soon, but it's not essential. Music is good and suspense wise it has a couple of decent scares, but it just didn't hold my attention and it had a lack of Giant Sharks.	1

02cb9621-7e5c-44b9-b77b-ee71d6350b65	  Horrible movie. I don't know why this movie has such good reviews by critics. It was more funny than scary.	0
c8b1b202-424c-4588-8402-e82b9c5f04c4	  This horror flick had a lot of potential and it squandered it. Instead of elevating its very original conceit to something truly terrifying and poignant, it instead lost its focus for two thirds of the movie, devolving into lame dialogue and cheap thrills. And there was something awkward about the movie's characters overall (intentional?) that I did not like. The best thing I can say about this movie is its Drive-esque soundtrack, all synthy gloss and New Wave sounds, but even that should tell you something: the soundtrack is kept to a bare minimum for most of the movie.	1
f1745143-548c-4887-bf5f-cc5bdb763b6d	  Solid horror movie, but is still basically The Ring with sex switched in for video tapes. It's not some all-time classic that some reviewers are trying to say it is. I think there's such a dearth of good horror movies (and especially great ones) that when one comes out that is "merely" good nowadays, it gets overpraised due to such low competition. Still a very worthy effort.	1

9c97ba59-07f1-46e0-bc05-0bb5b0b3dfee	  I do not understand why this movie is so hyped. I watched it thinking it would be the greatest movie this year, and left feeling 'meh'. The soundtrack is cool and the entity/ghost it very creepy and unique in how it travels. But the STD plot is cheesy, the characters were pretty bland, and the ending was predictable.	1
99923fbf-35c3-4515-a454-c78c3d804a9c	  Decent idea to start a movie, then it never plays itself out. I was hoping for a refreshing, twisting plot. Instead, its just a movie about about the weirdest STD (Sexually Transmitted Deceased) ever. I'm fine with zero to little gore, and even fine with an ending that doesn't wrap up everything in a nice little bow, but an annoying score and boring plot (with too many holes)doomed this flick for me. Not scary or even creative beyond the first fifteen minutes of the movie. Definitely a polarizing movie amongst horror fans though. The one never even heated up to the slow burn I was expecting.	0

Rent some vintage John Carpenter and save yourself the bother with this tactless, tacky drivel.	0
0e146f2c-518a-4dca-8635-79e78ca15ef3	  I give it an A for effort and it was an original horror film with a decent plot but the herky jerky cinematography and the slow pace dragged it down.

99d618f4-aced-43c3-9a2b-c174f6077d09	  There seems to be quite a few films recently which hearken back to the late 70's/early 80's in terms of filmmaking style. IT FOLLOWS is one of the films in this mold that capture a certain feeling of nostalgia while also having its foot firmly planted in the present. It's about a vague entity that follows you around after having sex with somebody who also has the same problem. Inasmuch as the Friday THE 13TH series was about abstinence, IT FOLLOWS is in a similar vein, with a heavy dose of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and Wes Craven for good measure. The most outstanding part of this film is the subtle approach taken with the horror, letting it build quietly without using the score to jolt you. There was also great care taken with the direction and cinematography that helped to build an atmosphere of tension and dread. Even without being a horror movie (albeit, more of a psychological one), the cinematography and camera-work was excellent, with precise, deliberate movement, slow pans and zooms, etc. It was quite artful, to say the least. I should also mention the outstanding score by Disasterpeace, which captures a feeling I haven't felt since watching HALLOWEEN. So, at least on the surface, IT FOLLOWS has a lot going for it. However, I do ask a little bit more from movies I watch than to impress me visually and aurally, and apart from these qualities, IT FOLLOWS was quite banal. The acting was decent, although no one really stood out from the rest. The potential in the setup for this "it" to be anything or anyone allowed for a few good sequences, but it also meant that the narratively was a little too linear for my tastes. It boils down to have sex, wait, and run. And for a 100 minute film, I expected more. There wasn't even an underlying emotional subtext like was in THE BABADOOK. Still, despite being bored through parts of it, the film does manage to pull together for a decent (and appropriate) finish. I would recommend people to see this, but don't go in expecting something revolutionary. There is a little bit of subtext about abstinence/STDs that can be read into IT FOLLOWS and, courtesy of a CHARADE billboard, possibly some meta-commentary on artificiality. However, IT FOLLOWS works perfectly fine as a stylistic exercise that aspires to little more than imitating its cinematic forebears, and does an admittedly good job at it.	1
fbe8c889-0dec-4207-b185-aeccd3874d53	  A thought provoking horror that nicely blends low-key cinematography with the slasher genre. Its a good horror to watch if your don't like being frightened with horror movie scare tactics, as they are kept to a minimum. Terror is instead made up for in excellent plot and cinematography. The only let down of this film was the ending, It may have been a little to subtle for me to grasp or it could just been intentionally straight forward, leaving many question unresolved. I've read that there may be a squeal in the works so it may have been sitting itself up for that. Nice too see a more progressive film of this genre. I will be looking out for more work by this team.	1

27f65521-2296-4fdc-8a6d-cf8b59744ac6	  I don't understand how this movie is so highly rated. I watched it three times and it is still or terrible movie. It's not even good enough to be a SciFi original movie it's that bad.The story was original, I'll give you that. But it doesn't make any sense. Nothing is clearly explained. Not scary at all. Not creepy. No jump-scares. No suspense. Instead of jumping out of my seat with fear I was rolling my eyes with disappointment.To me this movie felt like it was made by a Christian Pro-Abstinence group in order to scare kids into not having sex and making Jesus cry. If movie reviews are bought than the budget for the reviews was at least 3x the budget for the movie.	0
cbf21e4c-8876-49fd-8dd7-17118b738ccb	  I don�t agree with all the good critics at all. It�s wether "intelligent" nor scary.	0
36d64d56-25c6-45a4-981d-010ae412c217	  I would give this 0 stars if I could. I felt this movie had nothing but pointless awkward sex scenes, nudity to try and be shocking and just got trite. I wish I could get the hours wasted on this movie back so I could have the time to watch something that had a shred of scary. Ohhh find the idea can be somewhat new but if it is boring and unscary what is the point!	0
190576be-4436-42a1-a318-ee76c2e6e157	  Gives a whole new meaning to the term STD, as in spectrally transmitted disease. If you watch it straight up then it doesn't make much sense since the monster moves really slow (it follows) and while that gives it some creepy moments it's a bit hard to carry a whole film on that premise. So 1-1/2 stars for me on that. If, however, you look at it as an existential film ala Bunuel's The Exterminating Angel, then it becomes a film about life, death and our response to inevitable mortality - keep moving! In that respect it earns 3 stars, maybe 3-1/2. So, it is only so-so as a horror film but is quite good as an existential film about life, sex, and death. IMHO	0
6bebee1a-6351-4526-8eac-2416ff0644dc	  I have never seen a film so quickly and so effortlessly fuck itself out of every good thing it had going in one scene. It's an amazing movie... in the sense that you'll be amazed at how in one moment, around the halfway mark, the film-makers forget everything that makes the concept scary in the first place.	1

0967ab22-e898-4dce-a90a-a2cc2b78b67e	  This movie was a fail for me. Recently, Quentin T. praised the creator of this movie for the concept yet criticized him for failing to "take it there" and I would sadly have to agree. I thought the concept was awesome; that's why I was so eager to see it. However, the execution was just.not.there. There are no excuses even with it being a low budget horror flick. John Carpenter Halloween. I feel as though issues like this start with the writing. First off, on a basic level I didn't give a f about any of the characters. Wrong note to start off any story and not spend at least a brief amount of time developing the characters well enough for the audience to be invested. Second, the "supernatural entity" just wasn't relentless enough for me. I'm not even talking about kills here, or even necessarily explaining what it thing is (sometimes mystery is good, leave it to the imagination), it's just about creating tension and having an element of shock value to keep people on their seats. That wasn't there for me at ALL, as I spent most of the movie more interested in what was going on on Instagram. Maybe it would have been better had I seen it on the big screen or alone in the dark. At any rate, this one goes down as a "Cabin In the Woods" for me, a movie critics and horror fans love for the sake of getting something "different", but the substance is lacking and the scares were almost non-existent. For example (slight spoiler), there was a most ridiculous part in the beginning when the main character first deals with her curse in the classroom and she sees some geriatric old person in a hospital gown coming for her; she runs into the hallway and is terrified, but me I'm like really? You silly girl, you can easily just knock grandma out lol...I get what they were going for (vision - Exorcist 3), but the set up was all wrong. If this entity can take on whatever form it wishes to, why wouldn't it at least start off as something more intimidating to make her fear more believable? Overall, GREAT concept along the lines of a movie like Fallen, good camera shots and use of atmosphere, but subpar story and execution.	0
cf1bb631-4c7c-4c1b-82bd-b7b28198bb90	  The plot was weak and was held together only by the beautiful cinematography. This didn't feel like a horror movie, at no point was I scared or on the edge of my seat. Complete waste of time.	0
b5bbf706-e04e-4fe2-a801-1c06d3f12f36	  Good premise, but poorly executed. No back story, it's just there. Not scary, I didn't even find it suspenseful, just annoying. The soundtrack was the most annoying part.	0
3dc92bb1-489e-4164-a7d2-4f09516f320b	  Incredibly disturbing, It Follows is a creepy and atmospheric low-budget indie horror film. An allegory about STDs (in part), the story follows a young girl who, after having sex with her boyfriend, is stalked by a mysterious shapeshifting creature that can only be seen by those who've had sex with an infected person, and it can only be escaped from (for a time) by passing on the infection to another person through sex. Maika Monroe gives a strong performance that's nuanced and really shows her struggle to come to grips with her situation. However, the director makes some odd choices in creating a setting, as it comes off as a strange alternative reality with a mixture of futuristic and retro fashions and technologies (which is quite distracting). Additionally, the creature effects are rather grotesque; with the creature often appearing mangled and in various stages of nudity. A problematic film, It Follows delivers some effective scares, but the who and the what are so vague that the story ends up being rather unsatisfying.	0
040c7ae1-68d4-47aa-a6f6-3cbad3efc54c	  Visually compelling and stylistically refreshing for a horror movie... at least on paper. But in real life It's boring as all hell, and barely scary. And no, I'm not one of those people that needs gore and jump scares to enjoy a horror movie. I give it credit for being something more than a hunted house, demon child, or murder fest. But not a whole lot of anything at all happens. For me, this movie was a victim of the hype.	1
f28d9a54-a512-4ac5-aa15-99e173ae1b73	  So much about aesthetic, not enough about being scary. Could have made this story a lot more interesting if they switched characters away from these teens. Like maybe on to prostitutes and so forth, story lacked for me... But good music no doubt.	0

1f1926ee-3f2e-4713-86ad-f9f70253a71c	  Slow, odd & not nearly as intelligent as it would like to be. Don't look for a meaningful metaphor or any semblance of satisfaction by the end of this thing. Think Napoleon Dynamite with no laughs. I don't think it's even a horror movie. I honestly thing movie critics get swept up in some sort of contrarian groupthink at times.	0

d86b33ae-d1db-43a1-a503-164292fd54d2	  I'm not as enamoured as many seem to be with this film. Interesting concept that, in the execution, was someone flat at times.

5bc20a4f-6940-4f2a-94d2-f807a7a8d210	  100 minute movie.30 minutes of plot, 70 minutes of camera panning.

That's the last thing you want to hear in a horror movie.	0
f15fe5ec-2950-4c4d-9ac7-dfc7948ce548	  A horror movie that treats the dreaded aspect like some silly venereal disease. It's probably trying to be funny. The characters are not your usual spoiled teenage brats, but that doesn't save the story from its mediocrity. It will keep you wanting for more and the movie simply fails to deliver.	0
daacb551-67f0-4c37-bf41-4616a672cf27	  I was watching 'It Follows' and turned it off midway. Unfortunately overrated doesn't adequately describe the praise it received. The problem was the story didn't develop fast enough before the remote forced it off the screen. Instead we have a bunch of American, teen, culture references midst a girl who's been cursed for having intercourse. The setting and filming were perfect, and there were even times where I was surprised by the horror aspect, but its slow development and hokey premise were enough to cripple the thrill.	1
bac0e18f-3602-4d7a-92bf-d8ce993b18d8	  Really poor film. It has a fairly original concept (STI from Hell), but no strength in executing it. In area's where one might hope for some degree of pay off you're repeatedly left with an open expanse of nothing. As Bart once said to Lisa: "...you know what would have been scarier than nothing?

e7d959aa-5959-4a2c-a7a5-7136bb18ffff	  I'm not against indie horror films that go for style and story over scares. And I also know that every horror flick doesn't have to be packed with gore or jumps scares. However, It Follows left me with nothing. No sense of dread, I was never creeped out, freaked out, or the least bit afraid. And when the dead victims, ghosts, cursed, w/e, appeared, it was nowhere near as effective as how M. Night Shyamalan pulled it off in The Sixth Sense. I'm not necessarily suggesting skipping It Follows, but if you never end up seeing this movie, you're not missing out on much.	0

d71671b3-5e96-4af9-9742-127b20f7ccd6	  The premise of this movie is original and downright creepy, the acting performances are top notch, and it doesn't fizzle towards the end like most horror movies. However, the far away shots and the dizzying cinematography are distracting and give you a massive head ache.	1
ab79f20c-fe41-4790-9e67-5026fd4ee364	  A good movie, but it could have been better.

The trailer also made a lot of promise, but most of things were super lame to me. No offense, but throughout the movie, I was wondering if this movie was work of some i-am-too-intelligent-for-you chick. However, I did like the camera work and specially the ruthless, cold suburb lanes and some genuine style (that's why two stars from me), but everything else is lame and crap.	0
35ac2f7f-065f-480a-9a32-43e7406ff1c1	  Fresh horror film. Excellent art design and cinematography. Music good, but gets on my nerves fast (some people do love it though.) The end falls a part some and the rules are somewhat shaky, but speaking of shaky, its better than all of the found footage horror films.	1
fa0d03e4-7e95-4793-9a04-3a725c72b40c	  A slow but pretty good horror film. It Follows creates a terrifying concept that is very unique to horror films. It wasn't as scary as I was hoping it to be, but it did deliver a few scares and unique moments. The dull dialogue and slow pace does bog down the plot and the whole movie in general. It Follows is worth watching, but you might not find the whole movie as unique as the idea of it.	1

17ce0fcc-e934-4c71-a0be-daaf40565d2e	  It was sexist and weird. Furthering the notion that woman's sexuality is bad. Plain and simple. Also, what constitutes as a sexual act that would move this thing to follow? So sex act between a man and a woman where the woman clear doesn't enjoy herself, then followed by a creepy thing, after what seems to be a rape scene. No one else was disturbed by that guy being a rapey creep who kidnapped her?	0
0bbe091c-ff24-435b-9470-7a8b23092df2	  Well directed overt homage to Carpenter. The film never truly scares you, packed with bored millennials and the worst music I've heard in a modern film, of course I'm not a fan of Carpenters use of those horrible synth sounds , but at least they were innovative for the 80s . The director does capture the sleepiness of the suburbs and the slow moving juggernaut of its consuming boredom . Yeah it's arty and pastiche , I get it, but I still won't get the 90 minutes I wasted on this film back.	0
3e59804f-a747-4a9a-b723-724f68df2ca1	  This movie was a total let down. Good scary/horror movies are hard to come by and this is not one of them. The beginning will keeps you in suspense with the death of the opening girl and then as you 1st see the ghost/monster/it chasing the lead character to kill her. Other than those 2 and the beach scene, this movie has a weird fixation of an 80s feel that doesn't fit the story. When watching this movie you easily get into the mood of this is ridiculous, and if this thing is chasing me on foot at a walking pace, with not move to an island or live in opposite sides of the country for months on end.This movie may seem scary for the 13 and 14 year olds out there that often go to the movies, but critics should be shame for praising this garbage as a good scary movie.	0
2b64c110-b0c1-44f3-ae6c-0d935ec36844	  I have never reviewed a movie on the internet before, but I HAVE to make an exception here. This is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen in my life, and I watch a lot of movies. I especially love horror flicks so after reading some of the reviews online I was expecting a good time. NOTHING TO SEE HERE. An absolute waste of time and money, I wanted to walk out after 45 minutes, when I could tell that the plot was going nowhere. Just a stupid movie and an excuse to focus on irresponsible sexual behavior.	0
b0bf4350-219a-4c6f-8b3c-5e520404fe53	  "It's disturbing in its own right, especially the concept of being followed everywhere, but what this indie-horror film is lacking in is the sense that we could care so little for the characters because their development is stunted by such dull dialogue. However, the director gets props for great camerawork, a good produced score and some really eerie scenes (wait until you hit 15 minutes before the end credits roll out).	1

d2769b01-aaa3-43b4-8e72-7beaa1a310e3	  So, I bored, it's nighttime in July, I go to see what's the best horror movies to see in 2015, and there are dozens to consider, some of which have been released already.. This one, I couldn't believe -as horror flicks go- was rated pretty high for the genre. Most horror movies are too stupid to be truly scary or barely scary with horribly stupid, unoriginal story-lines. If a horror flick gets more than 3 or 4 stars it might be worth checking out.. This wasn't, There isn't, there's nothing to see here.. I can't believe the accolades or Rotten Tomatoes scores...how original is this story line? just how truly terrifying is it? It is neither original or scary. Some of it was even laughable. The pool scene, all those appliances..lol..? Them sitting discussing things around on the front lawn with the guy that gave "IT" to their friend..."I gotta go" he says? lol...10 year old's might find this the real deal, but this scores less than a star for it being a bad movie, and for the unwarranted hype	0

The ending was a bit predictable too.	1

4350b912-5c46-40fa-882c-493d2d206642	  It Follows (2015) is actually not a bad independent film. This movie plays well on the old school eerie thrill horror, and has a really nice story line to go with that style. It's for sure low budget and it happen to pull off a really cool movie and I'm sure movie fans of this style of thriller/horror can enjoy it. The acting in this film was pretty well done and the graphics were even better than I would've thought.It Follows was put together with a small cast and an even smaller crew and yet pulled off a fairly well made horror story. It's a story that makes you think, and at the same time when ya think about it; well it's kind of funny. When I watched this film I started thinking about the old horror films like Halloween, Friday 13th, and others along this film styling; very well played. So if you're up for a fairly good thriller then check this one out; it'll surprise you.	1

dc82ab47-f71c-4b1f-9491-7165c845677f	  Intriguingly different & creepy to a fault - however my praise for this ridiculously over-hyped movie ends there. Sure it's original, classy, arty (80s retro) & isn't revolved around desensitised murder & gore like so many horrors these days, but even so I thought it just didn't deliver. This is basically the ultimate urban legend come to life with an ingenious concept of some demonic relentless creature that pursues you after being "marked", which just so happens to be unprotected sex (lol), but I'm gonna be the one to call BS. This was seriously not that impressive & left me extremely underwhelmed. The creature could kick a hole in a door, smash a window then jump through it, lunge at someone & even swim but apparently skipped the lesson on running - where's the logic in that? Also what's the underlining message with the sex? Is the creature a giant metaphor for HIV/AIDS? Is this ultimately a hate movie against sluts? I'll also say, this movie relies waaay to heavily on the strange sinister soundtrack, if you took that away - it's not scary at all, just dumb. The more I think about it, the more I hate this film.	0
b8f6a947-10e5-44f4-924f-d4c97fe6258b	  Cool soundtrack. Stylish cinematography with a vintage edge. Great plot. Unfortunately, the movie just drags on and fails to deliver.

d09c6049-27d5-4644-a067-9888f1d3eaef	  Tedious rather than thrilling, any tension the movie could've offered dissipated into the haze of seemingly self-indulgent, languid pacing. The actors are lethargic and mumble their words constantly-- that is, when they finally decide to break the dead air as the camera pans to and fro across the beautiful composition. Yes, the cinematography and sound design were superb-- it's just everything around it that turns out to be a dud. If you thought the first hour and 40 minutes were bad, stay tuned for the home stretch! It will make you feel things, finally -- not quite fear, unfortunately, more like disappointment, irritation, befuddlement as to how this movie has inspired many to wax poetic about how much a masterpiece it is.Close to the movie's end, we find a main character-- whose existence is, objectively, entirely unnecessary -- reading a few lines Dostoevsky out loud to her friends. I think that line alone should tell you whether you'd be the kind to like this movie or not. I'm firmly in the "not" pile. At the minimum, good movies-- good art-- make us feel the way they were set out to do-- fear, in this movie's case, rather than ire and tedium. 0/5 would not recommend.	0

891eb3bb-dc82-4c94-b424-746df7c411f8	  I decided to watch this movie, It Follows, based on the reviews from multiple websites. Many critics seem to agree that the movie is a revelation, a revitalizing of the Horror genre itself. Let me tell you:It is not, at all.It Follows barely passes for a TV-Mature late-night B movie that you would see on the USA channel. Don't get me wrong, the premise is great. That drew me in alone, and the initial scene with the monster, the audience's first experience, is not bad. However it goes downhill very fast, and does not stop going downhill until the end of the film. Do not waste your time or money on this movie.	0

3ce01995-17d2-43dc-824c-6d077ab142ff	  Although ominous and plotted with plenty of scary moments, "It Follows" loses you with its developmental scenes by almost boring you to death, and when the movie is finally over, it feels quite unfulfilled.	1
44eaf702-a328-4dae-9dd6-2e6ca8864740	  To keep things short, It Follow is a horror-propaganda flick with questionable plotholes, unlikeable characters, laughably bad scenery prop, dear God, ESPECIALLY the scenery props, and a ghost-like STD that follows. I never thought I would regret free movie tickets, until I watched this garbage.	0

45a5ffd4-9a03-4f59-9082-4793049f0b4a	  This is definitely a different kind of horror movie. The premise is really interesting, a good idea. I think it makes a good job making the metaphors about losing your innocence through sex and how that can follow you around forever. Anyways, cinematography wise, the movie is pretty on point. My only problem would be that even though it's all about making suspense and tension, there's a fine line between that and making a movie too slow to be entertaining. It's also kind of lazy in my opinion to not explain in any way what the ghost was or what it wanted or how it started or anything. But after all, it does a great job at being disturbing. I noticed all the people I consider to be hipster love it, so I guess it's really a hipster-flick. If you're into the more mainstream stuff, you may be more likely to think this movie is quite slow and boring.	1
31fb4e52-cbcd-4b76-bc52-9990ca97474c	  It was a little cheesy of a horror movie can't say it was the best horror I have seen they gave it a good try though just think something is coming at you that only you can see and no one else can that's creepy it was slow at the start picked up little more through the movie	1
4d6cc586-ffcf-4201-a51a-c19a59e97c69	  Personally i disliked the movie, it is too slow and tries to compensate with emotional depth, which would better belong in some cheap drama movie. If you, like me, are fond of smashing special effects thrilling action and survivors deperatly fighting for their lives using the supernatural, stay away. This is some very sad movie and too close to actual life to be entertaining...	0
13b801a0-a0f6-49e6-b3e0-143209ba617a	  I must sound like a broken record (or corrupted mp3 file) when I say that quality horror films are few and far between. A good horror film can keep you on the edge of your seat, thrilling you with clever scares or unnerving imagery. But any horror fan knows that in searching for a good horror film, you're going to see a lot of bad ones. Unfortunately, It Follows falls into the latter category. This film has a familiar beginning, though skillfully done: a teenage girl in red high heels bursts out of her house and runs out into the street then to her car. She runs, but doesn't get away. There is definite skill in the staging, and it was clear from the outset that this was aiming to be a low-key, subtle horror film, but something was amiss with that opening scene. The random teen girl being menaced in the first scene is not just a horror movie clich�, she, and those red high heels even more so, are a signifier that It Follows is a film that will emphasize style over substance. That would be forgivable if It Follows was engaging and scary. However, It Follows also emphasizes style over scares. The premise of this movie is intriguing and fresh. After having sex for the first time with her older boyfriend, young Jay (Maika Monroe) is attacked by him, drugged, and tied to a chair. He explains to her that he has passed to her a ghost that will follow her until it catches up with her and kills her. If it does, the presence will go back to following him. "It" can appear as anyone, even people she loves, and though it moves slowly it won't ever stop following her. There is nothing she can do to get rid of it, only pass it along to someone else. Though clearly aware of the allegorical implications -- STDs/AIDS, or adulthood/maturity, both of which amount to decay and death to a teenager -- the film never fully embraces this subtext, insisting that the theme is open to a broad interpretation.It Follows steers clear of some horror movie clich�s (there is almost no violence or blood), but falls into others (Jay's "nerdy" friend is characterized by big glasses and reading Dostoevsky's The Idiot). There are, of course, a few pop-up/startle scares. The climax is capped off with a creepy and memorable visual element. However, too many times I noted that while what I was seeing looked creepy, I wasn't actually creeped out or scared. Is that figure in the distance behind Jay "It" or just a normal person? Speed walking or a light jog in the opposite direction is all it would take to diffuse the situation. At certain points It Follows moves too slowly, and the non-scary scenes fail to build dread and danger. The "scare" scenes, or potentially scary scenes, are separated by scenes of Jay and her friends talking like they are adults on True Detective. They wax poetic about the line between the suburbs and the bad parts of town, but those ideas are not explored any further. The one consistently effective element of It Follows is the haunting synth score by Disasterpeace.I very much enjoy slow-burn horror films (Audition, John Carpenter's Halloween, and Val Lewton/Jacques Tourneur movies are some of my favorites). Because these films typically have low budgets, they avoid effects-heavy set pieces in favor of a grand, thrilling finale. The most successful examples make up for a lack of spectacle by building atmosphere and tension and creating full characters. It Follows clearly aims to be like the classic slow-burn horror films from the late 70s and early 80s, but ultimately it falls short in those crucial areas of mood and character and instead fills the time with dull teenagers talking to each other in rooms. Horror films can be flawed and still be successful. A good horror movie can have flimsy characters, plot holes, contrivances, it doesn't even have to make sense (I'm looking at you Suspiria and Hausu), but it must spook, unsettle, creep, disturb, or unnerve. It absolutely must scare and, even more importantly, entertain. It Follows did not have me anywhere near the edge of my seat. Instead I was slumped back, my mind wandering to memories of other horror movies.	0

83a83043-60fd-4c72-a0eb-b022d29953e3	  Okay first of all, I trusted you Rotten Tomatoes. Secondly: I could never tell what was going on with the movie, it jumped way too much and frankly, I'm pretty sure I have whip lash from it. Third: what was up with the electronics around the pool? Seriously, what was that? Did you think that after shooting it in the head once that electrifying it or shooting it again would work? Lastly, I could totally jam to this soundtrack but it didn't really seem to work with what was going on. Over all, would not recommend and kind of wish I could give it less than half a star because I wasted my money and time on this.	0

2de9a49f-660e-42f6-bc8e-e6861f0ff32e	  a different type of horror film no doubt, and one with a clear underlying theme it plays off of that everyone has experienced (your first sexual experience, how it affects you, and how you deal with the aftermath). believeable performances from a cast so young, but for me this film falls victim to it's own hype. watching on demand after it's initial theater run i had heard how unique the movie was for the horror genre and was expecting something great. what i saw was a decent film that does a good job setting a spooky aura for itself but a movie that had been HEAVILY influenced by other films in the genre to the point that some of the scenes were direct copies (i.e: the Faculty, Let the Right One In). not a bad film for a late night scare, but not as innovative as The Cabin in the Woods either.	1

adab2073-b32b-4b45-a3d4-b87b6e42be38	  It Follows is not a scary movie in the least. A thought process on becoming an adult and std's maybe, but a scary movie it is not. The sexual monster has only two advantages really. Only people who have had it can see it and it never stops. The disadvantages are plenty though. It walks every where. It picks random people to be and usually they are naked. It can't open a locked door. While others not being able to see it helps it a lot, once you've had sex with someone then you both can see it. This means that you can get others help. What I think would have helped would be that you can no longer see it once you've passed it to another person. It's supposed to know who to pick to be, but that doesn't help if it decides to be naked. Most people aren't going to talk to a parent walking up to them naked. Which is another disadvantage is it can't talk. Usually you're taught at a young age not to talk to strangers and avoid people who frighten you. Someone who just walks towards you and won't say anything is in my book both. Then there is the huge flaw of it not being able to get into any place that a normal human couldn't do. I can't believe that I'm supposed to be afraid of something that can't get passed a locked door. Simple trap would be to lure it into a place with two exists and have a friend lock the door behind it while you lock the door in front of it. Now it's trapped till someone lets it out. Which if you picked a good spot could be never or at least well after you passed from old age. The last point is a flaw in the movie it seems. It gets shot, but gets back up and goes on as though nothing has happened. Then why is it afraid to get in the pool? If you say it's to kill her easier than it's doing a bad job.	0
537b2f78-23c1-438a-8bf2-ea645b669ba5	  Lets start by saying its a good premise...then lets go into saying that its completely destroyed and wasted. Most scenes just end in a fade, unresolved or really explained other then the standard "couldnt really think of a ending there". The now standard "lets put a 80s score on the film" is completely out of place and more distracting then not putting anything behind the scenes. The direction and acting is so lax that it just makes you angry to still be sitting there watching it going "For fucks sake, why are you fucking up this film?" It could be a case of a great film that was killed in post or by production, but whatever it is- its not the glory all that everyone talked about.	0
1a3a7db4-c781-4775-a951-4bc17ba0ccff	  What a terrible movie. The pace is slow, the actors seem half asleep the whole time, and there are zero surprises once the premise is established. Not scary. Not sexy. VERY soft "R" rating. One of the most overrated horror movies I've seen in ages.	0
04d0e2cd-79a8-4775-9eee-ebc7fbc0aa18	  It was great in some aspects. It also drug along. I would have liked more back story on why this thing started following people. All in all, not a bad movie.	1
b0ba3bb4-3d75-4665-9462-18b714377aa5	  The movie jumps right into the story and sets you up for what is to come, it seems like the pace will be very frantic at first, but then everything really slows down, it does have the creepy shots and feel going for it that reminded me of "Halloween" from the scenery, the way it is shot and the music, but still seems slow and there is a major reason for that which I won't say. I was expecting something more I guess. I don't wanna say too much but it did not live up to the hype. It is worth watching because it is well made and a good horror flick is very rare these days. Good is about as high as I can praise it though.	1

It felt like the director really wanted to stand out with the way the movie is presented and its neat but not for everybody	1
ee8c756a-62f5-42be-b565-a56a5e979c89	  Inconsistent, boring and weird choice of way to transfer "infection".	0
a3df0da0-2fec-47a8-a4fe-263a85e091d3	  Well shot. Acted. A handful of genuinely frightening moments... beyond that it falls flat. The effort spent trying to capture the essence of a bygone era should have been applied to a meatier story line and an ending that doesn't feel like a film student's.	1
b482ce7d-7091-4833-ab64-2dea2d036bae	  This movie would be great if it weren't for the constant 70's & 80's references. I love horror films, (a bit to much), but I don't need to be reminded of horror's greatest ages. Enough with the synth sound track and rolled up jean jackets. I need something new! The story was good, the scene shots excellent-just bring things up to date a little. Not to much, I mean, I still like pop culture references, just not an entire movie built on them.	1
8d67772d-893f-42b2-b7b5-d1daf07e32e2	  This movie was a complete and total waste of fucking time. The acting was bad, the plot was bad, the "suspense" was bad. You people want to fucking sit here and tell me that this was fucking number one movie of the year? Bullshit. The main character was also a fucking idiot. The thing walks; that's all it does. Why the hell are you freaking out over it? You could power walk away from it, no need to wreck your friend's car. This is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through.	0
3d23e403-c376-429a-b32c-dd3625a7c346	  unwatchable, the leaps from reason,common sense and obviousness, for the sake of stupidity, never ends... anyone who buys into this drivel is without clue.	0
a5b035e3-c9e8-4d5f-8131-9cd1319f6eca	  Dreadful. Awful. Haven't seen a more pointless end in a looong time. Waste of time, no chills, no scares. Nothing. At the most, it kept me more or less occupied throughout, I'll give it one whole star for that.	0
e946887f-c01f-4e4e-a546-00323ee00fd8	  The only reason i started a rotten tomatoes account, was to given this joke film 1/2 a star. All the critics giving this movie a high ratings, are either friends of the director or pretentious, academic hipters. Most probably both. The pool scene, at the end, was soooo bad, me and my friends were laughing our asses off.	0
8ab9e136-7ea4-484d-a47a-a6cdd36f84c8	  Yes, the concept is original imagining teen sex as some type of horrible 1/2 naked shapeshifting demon that "follows" you around stalking your every move and there were a few creepy scenes. It's also hard to throw shade on hot teenagers running around in skimpy clothing....but I also don't think there was enough going on here to make this movie truly scary or that memorable. It's not all bad, but it's not that great either.	1
db43729a-f1d7-4e26-b09c-8a86f6cc68a0	  It Follows had the right creepy atmosphere, interesting cinematography (nothing truly unique, but shots not typically associated with a horror movie). However, It Follows didn't follow. The story falls flat, the characters are one note (with one particular character absolutely pointless), another falls prey to some horror tropes (running up the stairs, really?). There's something to be said for not much exposition , it still treats its audience as stupid with characters that make dumb decisions and a storyline that just doesn't work. I do applaud the film for its ambitious attempt, it's a lot different than most horror fare out there going for psychological thrills rather than blue and guts that most horror films go for nowad. I did enjoy the eerie atmosphere, the throwback imagery and setting, the ambiguity of the time setting, and the panning widescreen shots. I just wish the rest of the film could have executed better.	1
5bfcfcdf-2eda-4cc3-8a75-63328fe4f5be	  Did I really watch the same film as the rest of these critics? The basic premise and the actions of the characters made no logical sense (even for teens). It was not frightening, pedestrian, and only barely held our attention. Would not recommend.	0

365489bd-cfe2-4679-84d9-a1ff218924fd	  This movie was fucking boring. Slow, quiet, artsy, and weird for the sake of being weird. The music is cool though.	0
b97c86f5-6a13-424f-8cd4-4ba09f1d0202	  BORING! Just plain boring. Not much happens in this movie. It ends abruptly, and answers very little. Why is it following in the first place? And a person dies in the movie and the movies just goes on as if nothing actually happened. The acting is fine, but it's almost as though the directer has just one move in his bag: a slow, full, one shot, pan of the room or area. It's just about every scene that he does that shot. It gets old really quickly. I would have liked to have known why "it follows." And there is a scene in the movie that makes no sense at all: at some point the main character, who is trying to get rid of the problem, is on a beach and sees thee men in a boat. They show her swim towards them. Then, in the next scene, she and another boy are talking and the boy asks her why she doesn't just pass it along. She then ends up sleeping with that boy to pass it along. But it is implied that she slept with at least one of the men on the boat! So what was the point of that scene?	1
7ae39ba1-3988-41be-9530-7c5d40c81765	  It's slow but its horrors is tense and nerve-racking at times. It Follows may have an eerily-horrifying concept but its dull dialogue and plain narrative defeats the clever scare-tactics the film offers and makes for a less-than-memorable frightening flick. 3/5	1
3b41856a-4f9c-4d3f-97e8-433e0692f099	  I was really eager to see It Follows, and I was ultimately disappointed. After a great opening, the movie dips into a lull and gets boring for a while until the scene where our lead character (Maika Monroe, who will next be in Independence Day: Resurgence) discovers "It". "It" is slow-moving and creepy, and "It" will kill her until she passes it on the next person. The movie is a great allegory for STDs, but then it dips again. And that becomes the movie's downfall. For all the gorgeous cinematography, the fascinating plot and the stunning set pieces as her and her friends battle "It", the movie keeps hitting dull patches. It's like a sputtering car; it stalls out several times over the running time before it reaches an unsatisfying ending. Perhaps it is one of those movies that need to be revisited again to catch new things, and I would watch it again. But for now, it's a slow burn thriller that fizzes out. It's also not scary at all, but it's got a promising idea for a sequel as well that I'd watch and hope is better.	1

43bc61e8-9729-40e7-9c88-04ed142a251b	  This was a giant piece of garbage that was a complete and total waste of a perfectly good budget. The acting (If you can call it that) was more on par with a early 70's porno, and the plot.... wtf.. I couldn't even sit through this piece of crap, I turned it off and got rid of it, and that says a lot because I watched Rosemary's Baby right through....	0
ad26f211-3f60-49a5-a595-b6a696092fa2	  There is much to like about this film, but I just did not find it scary. It had some great moments but overall it just was a little boring and slow.	1

1783b89f-ea7d-4e1e-84c7-62aaba306f75	  This movie tried, and for the most part succeeded in creating an original story but seems to forget about telling the story halfway through and worries too much on creating a psychological horror for which it fails at as well.	0
d5aa5004-115c-4610-83c6-604163b0e35d	  I saw this and was not impressed. The special effect were good, but beside that all it is, is a teenagers hump movie. It would make a good celabisy movie though.	0
128d0415-b461-4ba6-9db6-a95e075d6334	  I am a huge horror fan so as expected I have been looking forward to this one for months. THUD! Well shot, credible acting, cool music but not one decent scare. As a matter of fact this movie went nowhere fast including the innocuous ending. The opening scene was so promising but really had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. I just did not care for this one at all.	0
e267209e-7488-4910-ae2b-d7a83a083574	  A unique and creative story, but the film falls flat once the daylight scares and cgi take over. The ending felt a little underdone. Great directing and excellent score which felt like it was straight from the 80's horror classics.	1
30c60da7-074b-4e1c-bc29-f07828f75942	  Horror has lost its thing long time ago. Unless you're watching and playing horror games on an oculus rift or participate on the spot of a broadcast Indonesian ghost show, it's hard to get the grip from horror anything. To me, this did the same. However, it's got a nice creepiness and it did linger longer than other cliche horror shows.	1

72e7e3ec-3e33-4cfb-b7fb-8e25014d57ba	  The critics loved this film, but perhaps only the weirdos watched and reviewed it. They talk about great performances and metaphors for teen sexuality and a really uniquely terrifying film. But the film I watched was shit and excruciating to watch and it ruined my day. Sitting there in the theater watching these long ugly scenes, with shit characters and smelly dialogue and this blaring synthesizer music that must have gone on for 60 mins straight; and looking across at my date who gives me a troubled smile that seems to say "You really fucked up with this film that you said was really good, we could be hanging at the pools right now"	0
4892859b-d6a1-4c06-b96e-b13e8aa34aac	  Worst movie ever! Are you serious movie critics, to like this movie? The story is super dumb, there is no explanation, and it's just super stupid. And the worst is you guys thinking you're so cool cult, for liking such a dumb movie!	0
dc80aeb8-86af-4206-9520-88bbd6977d91	  It Follows is quite possibly the most overrated movie of 2015 so far. It has a lack of suspense, the acting is poor, the female lead is such a dumb character, the soundtrack is cool but very misused and perhaps worst of all - it's not scary.	0

a88ba834-e3de-43bd-a790-bacac3e03f96	  This movie really sucked. So stupid. They don't make horror movies like they use to. I didn't even want to give it a half of star. Poor acting and all.DOWNRIGHT SUCKS!!!!!	0
e1a7ed00-f55a-41e7-9bee-a1a40c52c9dc	  I thought this movie was really weird, yea it has an original theme and movie style but over all I thought it was kind of dumb. The movie's cinematics and editing were very interesting especially since it gave off a cheaper movie vibe. But in all it was interesting I would recommend this mostly to people who enjoy horror, as they would be the only ones who would like this.	1
35db7ce6-cbc7-40a1-86c9-e9c5335fb296	  Started off very good, with some real promise. The biggest problem I have with the movie is it made no attempt to explain anything or than 'Have sex and pass it on to someone else'. Part of what makes a movie scary or intense is the lore behind what is going on. Then, to add insult to injury, it just peters off. Im almost certain that there was no ending written for this movie.	0
4e75cc69-8f82-4a68-b1ef-f9bb358bd56d	  I was bored throughout the entire movie! I don't think I've ever fallen asleep at a horror movie. First time for everything, I guess! And if you want a terrible ending, this is it! Enjoy!	0
a6507331-4c92-4bf5-b4dc-95fc62f23c59	  Huge buzz around this movie. It had a good concept. Good horror films rely on suspense and tension, and this one has both elements aplenty. But it didnt have me up in arms and that ending though, really, come on bro.	1
e15d7251-4931-4781-9d5b-01be2941a1cf	  I'm not sure why so many people are saying this movie is scary when it really isn't (unless you count the fact everyone owns a television from 1975 for some strange reason). The premise is really good but comes off completely dull and boring thanks to the director trying WAY too hard to make the movie feel like a late seventies movie. The result is a movie acted by dull characters that comes off way too dull. Horror from the 70s was slow but riveting. This was not. Adding the synth soundtrack also screamed that the director was trying too hard to make it a 70s movie. Thinking you can electrify a giant swimming pool with some house appliances also made me lose all respect for the characters intelligence level as well. Nobody with an IQ above 10 would think that would work.	0

1a36a312-7cba-459d-8138-f8e31629d3c3	  Terrible... talk about low budget! Don't waste your time... I wasted an hour and 40 minutes of my time. Unbelievable how this got any good ratings at all. Slow, dull... not scary, and a terrible ending. Uggghhhh...	0
9c176aab-3210-4e13-ae4d-4c6845fa62b6	  slower than trees talking. If that is David Robert Mitchel's idea of horror then he should take a look at the reflection of my sweaty ballsack in a bird birth on a hot summers eve then he might be a bit more qualified to write horror. The film should be renamed people sitting around looking sad. It's basically an STI with a grudge!	0
c1e87658-e2e4-4d1a-b1b6-77c93235bce1	  Writer and director David Robert Mitchell has a very simple, very scary idea: imagine being followed everywhere you go by a lone figure that's slowly but surely creeping towards you and that no-one else can see. Unfortunately, the idea doesn't quite work in practice, at least not as a feature length film. For most of its running time, It Follows is atmospheric, engrossing and often strikingly beautiful. But cheap jump scares and an absurd climax seriously undermine it, with Mitchell either unable or unwilling to commit fully to his premise. It's a shame - this could've been great.	1
b6f1b6ab-a242-493b-aa27-9831f8cbe300	  I really missed the point with this one. Reviews were so stellar that I thought I was guaranteed to get into it. Nope! Strange pacing, and just an all around lack of spookiness!	1
a3e80a91-63ab-4e71-a138-9e64401c421e	  A rather strange movie, interesting concept but that's about it... it never got exciting or interesting for me but still an okay watch.	1
40110a07-dd7b-444e-9f64-51251b79b6e5	  What they did right: 1. Well done on the score. the music leaves nothing that will stay in your head, but fits the genre and the movie very nicely. 2. The acting was decent. Applause for them all doing a nice job coming off as normal people that react in believable ways. 3. Great shots and the general ambiance of the Michigan neighborhoods that I know so well really put a bullseye in the "Anytown USA" factor. Good attention to detail. Additional points for making me unable to date the film by mixing up the styles and technology. I liked that. 4. Successfully added suspense with minimal jump scares. This is the only thing that is making me understand the high reviews. People are just so desperate for true suspense in films, we'll take whatever we can get!What they did wrong:1. The ending. Really fell apart there. A lot of potential that ended flat and with messy, nondescript scenes. If they had just showed Paul walking in Tokyo or anywhere distant, that would have been more acceptable. Being that this is getting such good reviews, I'm sure we'll get that kind of scene in 2 or 3 or 6.2. The premise is provocative and alludes to the intrinsic basis in most horror films. That's neat. That's also about where that ends. Again, maybe having this STD from Hell is what's causing all the spine tingling, rave reviews. I don't know. To me, it's fairly dumb and classless. 3. The fear just isn't there for me. As I said, they managed a level of suspense rarely seen today, but the premise kills the fear factor. Just go bang someone young, horny and far away is the obvious solution. And the 1 death scene we got to view was far more disturbing than it was scary. 1. Just 1. So no, I'm not riding this train of praise for It Follows. I'm not fulfilled in any way after watching this movie. The best part about it was the realism of the shots and the environment. Other than that, this is Horror on Prozac.	1
905efa37-0c80-4a7b-86a1-042fedfe1cfd	  The stupidest movie ever! No plot, suspense, storyline or intrigue whatsoever. Not worth your time at all!	0
d61892eb-74da-4cf2-8f2a-55474f0d59d2	  It Follows? No... IT SUCKS!!! The only thing this movie follows is directions to the can. I am a big horror fan and I'm always searching for a decent scare. So I saw the movie based on the ratings. Not impressed. it is obvious, the makers of this production know how to bribe a critic. Unfortunately, we followed, IT won and that's the lembowski score.	0
41ba9cc8-f5ec-415d-81ce-81da90f4f8be	  I have absolutely no clue as to why this movie is reviewed so highly. I had a friend visiting from out of town and we went simply because of Rotten Tomatoes. This film was utterly boring, unscary and was one of the first times I have EVER considered asking for a refund. I also love all types of horror films and I am still seeing these scores and feel like I am in the twilight zone. Immediately upon the movie ending, another audience member got up and expressed his displeasure in what he had read on Apples as well. I truly don't get it.	0

5551713f-72ee-4293-bfad-af5721f81135	  Clearly influenced by Kurosawa Kyioshi's sounddesign and 80ies camera, but thanksfully it ends in a better story than most Kurosawa horrorpics.	1
046568f8-690c-4888-8403-5d3b5783a53e	  One of the worse movies I have ever seen. It is more concern in being artsy than in creating interesting characters to care about. There are huge plot-holes on the origins of this thing and the climax was nonsensical and boring. The acting was mediocre and it seems that the cinematography was more interested in doing panoramic shots than showing us what was happening. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.	0
d8665319-b657-4676-a3b8-a8313a8ee5b4	  This movie was garbage. I expected more. It was literally just a stupid girl running away and having sex with people. Paul was the only good thing about this.	0
98890821-6519-4761-8324-5290937f8e51	  It Follows' inspiration garnered from John Carpenter's 1978 horror vision Halloween is simply obvious from the beginning with the portrayal of teenagers that are for the most part entirely normal and deal with the things the way the rest of us would. It's totally indie but also really polished. Unfortunately, I found that the awesome idea behind the film and the originality and attractiveness of the camera work are watered down by the pace and mood of the film that make it a tad boring at parts, predictable and a bit too subtle to even be acknowledged. It could've been amazing and one of the best horror films of the year, it isn't, but its definitely one of the most interesting.	1
e0303466-ac4c-4352-8b94-7196d13832d4	  Indie horror with an original concept to passing on the demons by screwing someone haha, how cool is that! Try watching cause 96% certified fresh on RT is no joke for a horror ;)	1
19aa23c7-c2be-484f-a94e-8b7de982ec85	  This movie is $7 and 2 hours of my life I will never get back. The best part of the movie was the previews. I don't know how in the world this got such a high rating, but you would be better off giving your money to a homeless person or getting a happy meal. Trust me, it would be a far better experience. The dialogue and acting is an abomination. And there is this girl who reads random quotes from a kindle in a clam shell. It has all the suddenness of a early eighty's horror film complete with bad synthetic music yet it carries no other qualities of a film. Just don't waste your money	0
fbd3ef7a-07c6-4389-84c1-4610259dd575	  I REALLY don't know what everyone was thinking when they gave this movie anything except for a warning NOT to waste your time!

a0197761-9bea-43fa-b5d6-466856505a6f	  It Follows is a very original movie indeed but it's hard for me to put it in the horror category, because above all it's not, I repeat, It's not terrifying. In fact, for most of the time this movie is boring and sleepy. The original ideia comes by 20mns after the film starts, and it delivers with smartness and ability, but in my opinion, since we now know the premise the movie fails until the end. We have nothing new to see until the credits roll. We have some hight points here and there (I remember the beach and the pool scene) .. but man.. The inescapable sense does not exist. The director didnt give me that. I want some goosebumps. Stay only for the peculiarity. The Good: the pool scene... I guess.The Bad: this is not horror.. maybe thriller? Or a little YA sci-fi with independent execution? I don't know.The Ugly: err.. the new ground that the movie enters it's nice.	1

86723f1b-9b36-40ad-ba98-fab187da6d1c	  Very chic packaging, as if aimed toward the teenager who thinks himself a little more elite than his friends who still hire gore horror from the video store. Very well filmed, the film looks like an indie at all time, sometimes desperately. But the entire angst it wants to convey is fake, artificial and underwhelming. And the soundtrack...	1
5abecc41-782a-4432-8e3c-bf92da83892b	  I watched this really creepy horror film last night. The menacing atmosphere built up to fever pitch. However, there was no proper plot or explanation as to what the 'thing' was or why it was following people. Then, there was an odd scene where a mother rapes her son - that didn't make any sense. But still worth watching for the moodiness of it all.	0
275949c4-91c7-4c25-8fff-0866c32ff63c	  The trailer had me psyched for this movie but this was a huge let down. There were a lot of slow moments in this film with unnecessary dialogue. I had also expected "It" to be something we never saw. Instead "It" was just a series of slow walking gross looking people. And "It" turned out to be an STD. There was a lot of promise with the concept of this film but it was poorly done.	0

1883f747-356c-4ef1-8e9c-ac2594f7559d	  Why have so many critics been duped by this film? Director David Robert Mitchell's horror movie drips with faux "Virgin Suicides" atmosphere and oozes "style" over substance, with the exception of the solid performances from his cast. The trendy synth music serves only to irritate with its hipster desperation and derails any chance his scenes have of creating terror. Stop filling your movies with so much fucking score, film makers of the modern age. The lack of clearly established rules by which the supernatural force (the "it" of the title) operates should have been an invitation for the director to create a story of compelling suspense and of the unexpected. Instead we have a poorly paced narrative (this film drags like a wounded dog) replete with frustratingly unanswered questions and inconsistencies. The "conclusion" illustrates that the key concept was only partially explored, and with a poverty of imagination and an over-investment in trendiness, it is ultimately squandered. Perhaps not a complete failure - there are a handful of effective scenes - but certainly a wasted opportunity and a genuine disappointment. The 96% rating at Rotten Tomatoes reminds me that this site is not always an accurate meter for determining what to see next.	1
cac60922-7cb0-4fa9-ac0e-724408eebde1	  There's stuff to like in terms of retro style (that soundtrack!) and the acting is more than competent (Maika Monroe is terrific, although the retro horror movie she made last year, The Guest, was way better) . But the dream-like time period annoyed the hell out of me, and bottom line: this is The Ring, but with sex instead of a video. And it's a good thing the monster never actually sneaks up on anyone or comes for them while they're sleeping.	0
5bc0d33e-86d8-4bb4-b6cc-a6bdad8fa39e	  Oh Puurlease, despite the plethora glowing critiques, the follwing is a B+ movie with better than average acting skills. The best thing about this film is the concept which is at least original but as for fright value, I'm afraid the following scrapes the very bottom of the bucket. Sexually transmitted followers are perhaps only slightly more uncomfortable than a virulent STD and with an equal horror factor than originates from below the belt.Saying that, if you have nothing else to do and it's raining outside, it's worth the watch, but not recommended for those on a first date.	0

96fabcec-c792-4079-845f-1187b76bcf4e	  Sexually transmitted disemons. Kinda sad the state of modern horror...a film that is merely decent like this is proclaimed to be the best American horror film in years.	1
861065e4-4ed7-4194-9cfc-d63ba0dde4b8	  Terribly boring, super slow burn. Not scary, better suited as a made for TV movie. It just amazes me how this film is so regarded by these critics. All this shows me is that no one should be paying attention to critics, they simply are trying to sabotage the Horror genre with art-house garbage. My advise to anyone who wants to see this film, wait till it's on free tv, it will put you to sleep. I am SHOCKED this is rated R, PG would suffice, they showed absolutely nothing, all implied.	0
8c67c372-925b-48b4-bf87-03147d9506f6	  I don't know where to start...! It is a pity to call it a horror movie. It has less suspense than Troll 2 and there is none scares. Even the 80-ish soundtrack can't make the atmosphere terrifying. The pace is far off - it feels more like a drama film than a horror/suspense film.The movie has a great potential, but it feels so empty.	0
9493584f-9627-46ec-aa3a-24c0aff6b197	  While the film succeeds in spreading a sense of dread all through its running time, the multi-layered screenplay and below-par execution leave a lot to be desired. The climax as such is pretty much an arrow that misses its target by a mile. A decent effort for an indie horror.	1
01eb82b7-d46c-4990-b855-20943eb89756	  Grossly overrated but points for its originality and atmospheric soundtrack. Maika Monroe is going to be a major star. You heard it here first.	1
ae56d87a-835c-4140-9fa8-852fe03a97b5	  Good and scary atmosphere with its psychological horror and a good premise... That's all. The story is horribly developed, it doesn't sustain itself and it doesn't even have an ending. If if this is the best that horror genre has to offer I think I'll keep avoiding it.	0

2f4f5e5a-1f13-4962-b30a-e9b5fde7770d	  I don't know if I was watching the same movie everyone else was watching, because to me this movie sucked! I'll admit I wasn't watching it to be intellectually stimulated, I was watching it to get the crap scared out of me (or at least for a good story). But this movie did no such thing! Call it what you want, but it was essentially a movie about a deadly Sexually Transmitted Poltergeist!!! It cant be in her mind or some clever play on a nightmare, solely because ****SPOILERS**** HER FRIENDS SAW IT (and by "IT" I mean the actions of the "ghost" because the could never actually see the "ghost" [If you can call it ghost, because it seemed to possess few ghostly qualities.]) Also there were waaaaay to many points in the movie where the story didn't add up, and it seemed to blatantly favor the main character (by this I mean, others in the movie have died in ways that she too was exposed to, and did the same as others did- yet her outcome was victorious...if that makes sense. I'm trying not to spoil the movie for people who still want to waste their time with this movie.) My point being I seen nothing "Artistic" or "Thought Provoking" about this movie, you have to try too hard to get real meaning from this movie. At best it can be used as a PSA for abstinence in Sex Ed class. If you disagree, please show me where I'm wrong. I am always more than happy to see things in more than one way, and I am most curious as to what 65% of you seen differently. I'm not here to troll the internet at 4am giving negative reviews on movies, I was just utterly shocked that so many of you gave a good review- my opinion had to be heard for the apparent few that felt like me.	0
09f5b051-0d15-499e-832c-ee084ded9530	  Sorry, but this isn't original. It fits in the body horror genre and belongs along certain films like 'Teeth' and Cronenberg's 'Shivers'. So calling it original is for the naive or amateur horror buffs. Now as for the film it's pretty stupid and slow moving. I felt like a zombie while watching it. My brain severely numbed by the whole experience. It's artistically driven and I'll give it that, but harbors a severe amount of artsy fartsy that I really couldn't help but laugh at certain times. Like the pool scene near the end where they try to electrocute the IT that follows while the main protagonist is in the pool. Like I said stupid. Overall, Hipster horror at it's finest. The only thing I would say that was missing was the MTV Films logo at the beginning.	0
1092a98c-0360-491c-aa8e-89b32870025d	  i was incredibly disappointed. this got such good reviews i was expecting a lot more. i get what it was going for, which, yes, is a very scary concept -- something follows you that only you can see so no one else can help you. and it doesn't stop. you can run from it and delay it, but sooner or later it'll get you. unless you pass it on. good grief. it kind of seemed like this entire film was a giant metaphor for what happens to promiscuous teens. STDs; they'll get cha. anywho, the acting wasn't that great and it seemed kind of choppy -- i think they could've done much better with this.	0
a98b7756-82ab-400f-b9b0-815b8c36b44a	  Original? Yes. Boring? Oh lord, Yes!	0
8fdf034a-9c1c-4a8a-afdc-23abe10fd0c0	  Decent alternative horror flick which tries a bit too hard on recreating the 70s horror style with music and mood, but it works pretty well overall.	1
76125590-e6c3-40c1-8db1-68e94a49a3cd	  Did the reviewers watch the same film I did? When this one ended my first thought was that I'd just seen a high school or college project that received a failing grade. This was one of the least scary and most ridiculous movies I've ever seen. The film is so slow, the plot so poorly executed that IT Follows ranks among the worst movies ever to hit the theater. Even the gratuitous nudity (a staple in most good horror flix) was beyond gratuitous; even beyond silly. What a waste of time and money.	0
08bea831-7904-4074-85fe-7a4ff5937f9f	  Boring. Uninspired, but with good enough cinematography that you might forgive it and think it's smarter than it is.	0
5cca6c1e-0da5-475c-8466-d81187ba2ce2	  TERRIBLY disappointing ending. For real.	1
1fd12f7c-244f-450b-911f-0abca8ca9a20	  Despite having a good soundtrack and some decent visuals, It Follows is a mess. Yeah, a mess even when a lot of nothing happens during most of its running time.What was once a neat trick with that 360� degree pan with the camera, quickly because a nuisance. It doesn't create any tension whatsoever and the idea for the haunting doesn't help either. It's just some dudes following you around. Worse is that the way the movie is shot doesn't allow for some tension to build, to scare you, giving most of the money shots away, minutes before they even happen.Maika Monroe is fairly solid here but the rest of the cast are just there, doing incredibly idiotic things. I get the dreamy approach but the movie becomes unintentionally hilarious, specially towards the end when logic goes out the window (and we're speaking of a horror flick here) and we're served with a pool scene that seems like it was made for a Scary Movie scene.Thematically it tries to be edgy and maybe that's why the "critics" liked it but it just doesn't add up and any sort of message about teens' sex lives, dst's and whatever never really comes across, leaving us scratching our heads in vain. Did she really screw the dudes in the boat? Does it matter? Do I even care? Nope.	0

74e72708-f996-4d4f-8d10-b536b1bf75f1	  Is it possible to give zero stars? I was dumbfounded that this film received such high ratings. While initially impressed with the cinematography and use of continuous shots, about halfway through I realized the movie was going nowhere, there would be no ending and even getting to it would be a convoluted mess. but we did get to see at least 3 sets of breasts, so hey, there you go.	0
aaf83118-3e2c-4f21-9c5c-76d26aef4a16	  I saw this movie with high hopes. I enjoyed the attempt at recreating the feel of a classic 70's, 80's styled horror movie. The soundtrack and the feel of the movie are notable upsides, but in the end, it's just not scary. At first the idea sounds creepy, but there's one thing, "It" is incredibly f****** slow. It's creepy for a little bit because you never know when or where "it" is going to show, but it gets kind of boring as the movie trails on. I think two people died in the whole movie, because once again, "it" is insanely f******* slow. "It" can always be out run, and it's so boring. Did I mention that, "It" is essentially the worst STD ever in the history of STDs. "It" is passed on by having sex with someone, ridiculous. This movie should be called "Run away from the agonizingly slow killer ghost STD"Verdict: D+Good direction, and a good score can't save this flick from ridiculous amount of plot holes, boring, and slow pacing with little payoff. Seeing some random person walk slowly towards the protagonist is only scary so many times, and then it gets pretty boring. And the naked old guy on the old roof? Come on now. So, "It" hijacked some random naked 60 year old man, walked who knows how far to climb a two story house, to stand on the roof naked? What? Why didn't "It" just hijack someone's body in the room with her?! This is what I mean, so how many plot holes.	0
43fa4486-c457-4ebb-a4d9-349327036d3e	  I went into this movie with a lot of hope. Some of my friends told me it was the next Babadook or Rosemary's Baby. (two of my favorite horror movie) But, did I get it? Well, no. But, before I get into the negatives I wanted to discuss all the positives. To begin with the score is infectious. It is an awesome blend of 80s retro music and modern techno. Next up is the acting. Malika Monroe kills it as the lead, Jay. Well then, again Malika Monroe kills every performance she's been in. Another positive this movie holds is its interesting and elusive concept of a monster that is transmitted like an STD. Finally the set pieces and costume designs are stylish to a fault.Now onto the negatives. Firstly this movie was not scary. I don't think I even flinched once in the one hour and forty seven run time. I don't find this to be a problem in most cases, for example the Babadook. In the Babadook, there are truly terrifying scenes and then there are some that just aren't scary but all the scenes in the movie build up the main theme of the movie. Unlike the Babadook, some of the scenes of this movie don't even come close to building up the theme of Paranoia. Instead they are filled with cheap and meaningless jump scares. Unfortunately its originality works against it. In the guise of ambiguity the much needed explanation to what or why everything is happening is neglected. Because of this the conclusion seems more bland than it truly is.For these reasons, I would give the movie "It Follows" a 6/10 or a B like "Tomorrowland" but unlike "Tomorrowland" I wouldn't recommend this movie.	1
a4f12ae2-5ebf-450c-997d-d2b932b1a357	  Possibly one of the worst scary movies I've ever seen. I can't believe it scored this high with R.T.	0

0ccb722a-8df0-4184-8a85-e6776188685f	  This low budget, overhyped film does have some genuinely creepy moments...but the pious lesson in morality does get old pretty quick, and by the end, it just feels REALLY obnoxious! That and the horn dog stereotyping of the guys in the cast gets pretty annoying as well!	1
da3bee22-e654-4c99-858b-77685c16f5d7	  Big disappointment on this movie, ok we have a nice script and a good respect of the genre's classic codes but it fails to change up	0
bbf755b8-7e79-47c6-995d-0ed59d2ffb20	  I thought it was well directed and acted, some creepy scenes and a cool premise but overall it was just a bit meh..	0
081b027b-982b-4436-a1b2-433b3ce2b43d	  A horror film that can deliver a great story without the cheap jumpscares prevalent in a majority of horror movies today? Accompanied with Maika Monroe's perfomance, it's a film worth watching at least once.	1
510ce6bd-4d7a-4e22-83f4-b7301a2a7624	  After a sexual encounter, a teenager is told that she has been passed on a curse in which a supernatural terror is constantly hollowing her in the form of a person walking towards he. The only way to escape the curse is to pass it on.Certainly original in its premise, It Follows is still quite mired in the early 80s horror of Carpenter and Cronenburg and rather the better film for it. More unnerving than scary, though once the concept of the big bad is told, you will be searching the background for figures walking slowly.Entertaining and original, just didn't scare me.	1
c3023d61-ae6b-483c-9388-eda67fbd8eaa	  Didn't enjoy this at all. Was a well shot film in terms of camera work. However, the acting was weak, I found it as scary as a Disney film and as much as I enjoyed the soundtrack I don't think it was suited to the film. Also the ending was incredibly underwhelming and rushed.	0
575486e4-7c85-4824-b487-236cfc80b27e	  Seriously over rated. Dull, linear plot. Raise the bar people.	0
d4e4f104-2f63-4cfd-a65a-f6dc97d6bc38	  Last year the most over hyped horror flick was 'The Babadook' and this year it is 'It Follows'. It has a real feel of John Carpenters 'Halloween (1978)' about it. It is decent but with all the excitement surrounding it, I found it to be a major disappointment. It is extremely creepy in parts but overall a run of the mill horror.	0
809546fe-0d4d-4950-baec-2f3ba51fdcf3	  Creepiest film ive seen in years really!! If you are terrified of fast walking old ladies chasing you then this is the right film for you.	1
55b6a570-4c34-4c94-b7be-2a4832dcbcba	  Same script like Jennifer's Body. This movie sucks.	0
56fad45e-6c8d-4682-b82f-f15c311bcff6	  The scariest thing was the soundtrack-totally on point. I also liked that you couldn't place the time frame in which the events took place.	1
389a0c06-6e6e-4583-896e-74740ab506c7	  What are you guys talking about? What was up with the pool scene? It made no sense. This movie was retarded.	0
cdc0a46e-bf12-495d-9da8-428d878ae395	  It should be an advertisement for STDs. " Herpes, it follows." lol	1
430c2e91-5f27-4fd4-85c0-e7002e76ac26	  I read the reviews and wth are u talking about? this is a story with no story. They give a cheap idea of what this supenatural thing is and...that is it. That is the whole movie? WTH? Don�t give me that philosophical crap about it is a methapor of how we deal with death thorugh sex and some crap like that, because nothing happens to think of something remotely interesting.	0
8a57c67e-785f-4c94-999d-057882c257bb	  Watching this movie is the most effective way to waste 90 mins of your life. Expect a lame storyline and meaningless ending!	0
71e00eb4-f554-42b1-b8d8-e31f730e68d6	  It Follows is stylish, suspenseful and mesmerizing, and explores themes like death's inevitability and sex.	1
0d9eba03-0056-4c8e-9ace-239e1cea4937	  I was VERY disappointed by this film. After reading a lot of the reviews on this site, I was looking forward to a good movie and a good scare. Unfortunately, I found the movie to be, overall, pretty lame. On the positive side- I liked many of the performances and I liked the basic creepiness of the film. However, there were too many holes in the plot and the ending was absolutely stupid.	0
3ca5e05d-58c2-44ae-907c-1326a224b256	  A simple premise wrapped in slow-burn horror, deftly sprinkled with 80s slasher flavor. Some parts could have been done better, or imbued with a bit more urgency but all in all, an effective little horror piece. I appreciated some of the camera techniques like the 360 pan, but one of the pluses of the movie was the realistic portrayal of modern teens as opposed to the cliched stereotypes. The combination of spartan camerawork and naturalistic characterization really heightens the fear factor when the entity appears in the distance.	1
7931543a-2a31-4274-b322-8b3097448778	  Damn it I wanted to love this movie. The premise is fantastic, and the characters, cinematography and music are genuinely fantastic, but what it builds in tension and scares, it tenfold looses with idiotic scenarios, unrealistic behaviors, and a ghost/monster that may or may not be able to be killed but can certainly be injured and stopped easily enough. In fact, the ghost-thing is barely a threat at all when you consider the facts. And because of this, the film itself falls flat as a horror. It's only the character's unrealistic fear if this thing that keeps the movie going. But the audience is likely done with this nonsense half way through. Not to mentioned the horrible ending... ugh.	1
eb3b1f40-472e-4341-922b-a7beb82c51bd	  Sexually transmitted ghost horror? This movie has been getting great reviews about how original it's plot is, but I found the plot absolutely ridiculous. If it weren't for the awesome 80's style atmosphere, score, and amazing cinematography/location of Detroit urban ruins, this would have been pretty bad. Highly overrated new age horror.	1
d113856f-76e7-40f5-9dbf-51c460189353	  This movie got way too much hype by critics. It's nicely filmed and pays homage to the horror classics while being somehow original, but the plot is not particularly smart. The best thing, by far, is Disasterpeace's old school soundtrack.	1
0954e9df-3fd8-461a-a36d-f0a9c577bc28	  Everyone praises this movie for being an old school-style horror film and to some extent it is. Admittedly, a sexually transmitted horror that ceaselessly pursues you is a unique idea. The problem is, at a certain point, the movie starts seeming unending. I do not have a problem with them not showing the "It" which follows very much. I do have a problem with the fact that it is not particularly scary even when it does.	1
a5558804-4904-4761-9df4-2ba0887d4258	  It Follows is a horror film with a clever and unique premise that at times is executed brilliantly with great tension, creepy atmosphere and blends perfectly with an awesome soundtrack. Unfortunately, the boredom, slow pacing, excessive padding and abrupt ending devalues it for me. Still, a decent film worth seeing for sure.	1
d35b482e-640f-40df-94a9-e9815ba60815	  A teenage girl has sex with a boy she is seeing but finds that as soon as it's over he tells her about a being that will follow her and ultimately, kill her, if she lets it get to her. It can take any human form. This is highly original and at times, creepy, yet, as much as I wanted to really enjoy it, I just couldn't get why this film had been hyped so much. It is well acted and shot, some great camera work, a John Carpenter-like score of synth music (indie horror is being over saturated now by the use of the synth score). I enjoyed it but I wanted to love it.	1
52944963-ffe3-4c9d-a868-d570764e0c9e	  Strange teen horror film about a curse only passed on though sex, but that is too aimed at a youth market to show it.Dozens of obvious plot leaks and only just better than walking out.	1
35bea2fd-7e4e-41f0-ab2a-12babef3ba70	  It wasn't all that terrifying, but did have some good scares (a few scenes will make you jump) but overall unfulfilling. Left the theater thinking, "that was okay, but how could 96: of the critics like this movie so much???" Obviously left off allowing for a sequel, but I don't know if I'd make any time to see it. Too many things defied logic. Not the threat, that was reasonably established, but are all the people It follows THAT stupid? Left a lot of questions rather than leaving you afraid to leave the theater.	1
03810375-130d-403e-93fa-2fc6ab39e2d4	  Meh! I heard good things about this film so I gave it a go. Yes it's stylishly shot, yes its kind of a clever ode to horror films of yesteryear. But is it scary? NO. Is it creepy? Yes. There are a couple of jump scares that are effective but apart from that I was feeling bored by the end. Speaking of the end, its a let down and leaves it open for sequels.A horror film need to be horrifying. This film isn't. End of the day it can be the most stylish horror film in the known universe but if it doesn't horrify me then I dont really care.	1
e03985aa-3b81-4e60-b383-16762e40246c	  An original horror film that makes you think (for once)..	1

a691f77f-f6fa-4bdb-b832-e9dceebcb460	  I have never been a big fan of Horror movies, but I took a chance on this and found it to be pretty good. A little on the strange and weird side though.	1
c7e227e8-0d05-4661-bec6-8c9abf9d253e	  I was drawn to this flick by the extremely good reviews, but it was a waste of time. It was full of distracting plot holes, bad acting, and a poor storyline. Very few, if any frightening moments, and a cop out ending. I will say, I enjoyed the 80's retro score, but that was the only real redeeming factor,	1
abd0e37d-47d5-4db9-8eca-89265a7524e6	  Saw this April 18, It's a good movie but surprised it got 95% on Rotten. Well made, constant tension but short on details about It.	1
180c0ffc-ff0e-4039-a398-a61ce402bf62	  Good movie but does not live up to the hype. It certainly is not the "best horror film in a decade" as one review stated, that honor goes to The Babadook. There are some good moments but nothing spectacular. The director borrows heavily from John Carpenter's directing style. I did like the story premise but it did not follow up it's promise.	1
25520c2f-7fe4-434c-a9e3-2ae63dd2cebb	  It Follows is the most persistent film I've seen so far this year. I mean, it just doesn't quit. It's always coming for you. What is It? A ghost, a monster, a poltergeist? It is a supernatural force that is always coming for you. Slowly, never stopping, It Follows. Don't let it catch you, cause it will kill you.How did It become attached to you? By doing the nasty . That's right. If you knocked boots with someone that had It following them, then It starts coming after you. How do you get rid of it? Easy Peasy. Find some poor sucker and take them for a romp in the sack. Sadly, this is at best a temporary solution. If it kills that person, then it moves down the line to you. And so on, and so on. A Supernatural Herpes. You may not have an outbreak for a while, but when you do, it's a real bitch!!I really enjoyed watching this movie. The soundtrack was reminiscent of an 80's horror flick and the cinematography gave it an interesting look. It didn't scare the socks off of me, but I left with a case of the creeps. I kept looking over my shoulder on the walk home. If you like the horror genre, then this is right up your dark alley.	1
6857702c-f06c-4079-ad7e-e4a3aad6a357	  Cute and clever for a wordless claymation film. I appreciate the simplicity of the story for the sake of my kids, but felt like they took the easy way out with the animal control guy being so evil.	1
b7c62e73-b250-4672-a309-278761821efe	  I went to this movie ready to walk out saying that it was stupid, but this was not the case. I actually thought that this movie had more thought and talent put into it than how it appeared. Some people might think this movie is stupid, but I thought it was well-made. It pretty much goes to show that you don't need to have dialogue to have a good movie.	1

ed4573cc-6117-4b05-b718-f17ce522bbf0	  Decent animation with some funny gags, though the story is a bit slight. This was nominated for an oscar for best animated film so i went ahead and streamed it from amazon. Not familiar with the tv show this is based on, but I still enjoyed it more than Carrie did.. which is unusual for animated films. Still, its not as good as some of the others in the category.	1
92985bc2-8c66-4d83-b1fb-c5ddcd82f0b3	  I've not seen any of the TV shows so didn't really know what to expect apart from a Wallace n Gromit type film. This is effectively a silent film and it's well done, quite funny and creative.	1

fe1e440d-6204-4b5a-a9ef-58375c633fbf	  I liked it, but was only moderately. I was actually sort of bored at times. I thought they missed out on some opportunities to be funny. I don't think it lived up to the tomatometer ratings.	1
d56fe7a4-2085-4341-920f-b9ec2e6e5867	  151126: Really? Critics at 99%? Users at 82%? Spoke with my ten year old son after watching this film. Asked him if he ever thought he'd watch it again. His answer was the same as what I thought, "No". Though there are moments, Shaun lacks impact. Quaint story but none of the characters really grab you. Just felt flat most of the time. Glad I didn't buy the DVD.	1
2800bcb6-467c-4a93-844f-30b4ff556c91	  Shaun the Sheep is Aardman on autopilot: nothing we haven't seen from the studio, and already seen better. BUT nevertheless gushing with Aardman charm and should not be passed up on	1

87e5e23b-f623-4b01-80d3-fcc9f2db7b6d	  The 'Be careful what you wish for' premise works well in this animated children's film. It is difficult to maintain the intensity in any movie without dialogue, and this does result in some slower sections and a thin storyline at times. I also found the songs to be more of a distraction and seemed be just fillers. But there are some genuinely funny moments.	1
54682f74-0fc3-44d7-9c2c-f5fdf370c7a0	  Harmless nostalgia, it ultimately provides nothing original. It's mildly enjoyable, but nothing that showcases Aardman's brilliance.	1
6bf89c50-6ae6-46a7-b577-e27afdb989c6	  I've always been a fan of the Aardman Studio films. Chicken Run, Flushed Away, Wallace and Gromit are great flicks and now we have Shaun the Sheep. This one is certainly a little different as there isn't one spoken word in the whole movie. Now I don't have little kids so I don't know if it's a problem for them or if they would be bored with this, but this movie is still funny/clever/touching all without dialogue. I would say this isn't as strong as the movies I mentioned earlier, but I still enjoyed it. While the story is simple, there's enough going on that makes it clever and doesn't drag at all. It's not quite as funny as the previous Aardman movies, but still a very solid offering and I walked out with a smile on my face.	1
d477af52-3541-449b-b93f-7922f793e192	  Shaun the Sheep is a movie apparently trying to grab the audience's attention with their many attempts at slapstick comedy and disgusting humor. Something that Inside Out wasn't able to portray, except for its more clever attempts at slapstick humor.The movie was about how a bunch of sheep are getting chased by people which lures them to the city. They must disguise themselves and sneak away from the animal control to find their way back home safely. Now, I ain't going to spoil the ending, there is more action to brace along but I think this movie is more emotional than Inside Out in the case of making me cry. It was cute, sometimes too cute.The movie is very funny but the attempts at humor left a bitter taste in my mouth, as though it was intended for 9-year-olds. Older kids especially older teens would not get as much of a kick out of it.	1

e53ac163-775b-4239-83aa-c21f828b9948	  Cute movie. I didn't realize it was going to be a no talking kind of movie, so it took a little time to adjust. The sound effects are great, and work well to help us understand everything that's happening. I'd say the music was a bit intrusive, though. Overall, a fun movie, with clever sight gags and humor.	1

c7b577b5-dcd1-4023-a0e4-eed8c7c67fea	  One viewing in a packed house on a rainy Sunday afternoon with a bunch of families, so pretty much prime time for this kind of movie.Rating: Family Fun Just for some current information about this movie it is the highest rated movie on Rotten Tomatoes for the summer, and in a sense it deserves it. It has something for everyone who goes to see the film, so really I do not see how anyone could not find enjoyment here. As for me it was not an amazing experience, but I had some fun.From the beginning you know that you are in for a different style of movie. The animation is creatively distinct and the absence of any dialogue took some time for me to embrace. This makes for an undeniably unique approach and the film does a wonderful job of embracing its own style. The humor comes naturally and often, and while it is mostly for the children there are enough jokes for the adults to enjoy as well. I respect the film because of how well it does what it sets out to do.However I just do not enjoy that style as much to be fully enveloped in the experience. I get that I am not the target audience here so this really is not a slight of the movie, but I cannot say that I enjoyed the film as many others. The humor does not hit as often and overall it was simplistic and boring for me. This is a splendid movie to take a family to, everyone will enjoy some parts of it. This is markedly a better family movie than Minions, but still there is movie this summer that hits on all cylinders for everyone in the family. Hint it's Inside Out.	1
12309b3f-75f6-4de2-9630-e94e886e4528	  SHAUN THE SHEEP has been generally well received by critics with praise for the movie seeming to be primarily related to the animation and the supposed sense of warmth and humor. While I certainly feel the movie is well animated (I am a huge fan of stop-motion and claymation and SHAUN delivers!), the movie does not really do anything innovative with its animation. Or with the story. Or really any part of the project. SHAUN THE SHEEP is exceptional at being unexceptional (AKA: the "Argo" problem). The picture is incredibly well done and also incredibly boring. Poor pacing, appeals to humor (sometimes even specific jokes) that have been used and re-used without providing much application, and a painful hyper-appeal to the very, very young target audience. The team for SHAUN THE SHEEP no doubt accomplished making a movie that will feel welcome and fresh to new, young audiences, but feels like a bore from the otherwise reasonable creative production team that produced the film.	1
06dcc294-768f-4b0e-8645-cc4cec460d2e	  This Movie Is Sooo Weird And Whacky.	1
6cccc06b-e1a0-4852-a3f7-56f0bf013d8a	  A little visual treasure, this production is filled with inventivity and creativity. The characters are nicely drafted and overall the film should be a hit with the whole family.	1

eb107e76-f7cc-41a0-8846-e18aa5bd018d	  The English animation studio�Aardman Animations�- best known for its "Wallace and Gromit"�short films, television series and one feature�-�has long been a favorite of mine, producing delightful absurdist confections that I can watch multiple times without losing interest. Still, while I almost always marvel at their stop-motion ingenuity (and love the very British teeth with which they design all of their animals), I have not loved all of their work equally: their first feature-length movie,�"Chicken Run," was a winner;�"The Pirates! Band of Misfits" (in spite of its Oscar nomination) was a dud. In some ways I prefer their earlier, more raw work, in which the animation may not be�up to today's standards, but the ideas shine with sparkling mischief, such as Peter Lord's wonderful setting of Nina Simone's "My Baby Just Cares for Me"�or Nick Parks' playful mockumentary�"Creature Comforts."Now we have a new feature, directed by neither Lord nor Park - stalwarts of Aardman's past - which follows the adventures of Shaun the Sheep, who has had his own BBC television series since 2007, and is apparently a character who first appeared in the 1995 Wallace and Gromit short�"A Close Shave." I knew nothing about Shaun going into the film, but I went hoping for something at least as fun as�"Chicken Run." What I got was not quite up to that standard, but still (mostly) entertaining, and a movie that is sure to appeal to young kids, making it the perfect cinematic destination for families now that everyone has seen�"Minions" and�"Inside Out."Shaun and his ovine brethren live in relative harmony with their farmer master - the movie opens with a home-movie montage of their earlier happy days on the farm - but long for just one day off from the quotidian routine. Inspired by a bus-side billboard urging them to just get away, they come up with what should be a harmless plan to lure the farmer back to bed�(what puts people to sleep? counting sheep!) so they can run off and frolic ... somewhere else. Things go dreadfully wrong, however, and soon Shaun and company - accompanied by a most unhappy guard dog - are adrift�in the big city, looking for the lost farmer. Will they find him before a villainous animal control representative finds them and locks them up? Watch and find out.There are plenty of very funny moments in the movie - including the sleepy sheep counting - but also passages where the story drags. Unfortunately, when that happens, the filmmakers often choose to create pop-music montages that feel more about marketing that particular song than about furthering the plot. Indeed, the music, overall, is the weakest part of the film (except for one delightful "baaa-baaa-shop" scene which is actually quite cute). I loved every aspect of the animal containment center, though: it's designed to look like a prison, complete with an "Orange Is the New Black"�"Crazy Eyes" character. Overall, the plusses outweigh the minuses, even if the sum total never quite comes close to the masterpieces of yore.�	1
55a778ea-a9da-4293-9243-877788c65491	  Funny, charming and brilliantly animated. It is one of the best stop-motion animated film ever made.	1
b10a97cb-d2f7-4bc4-9640-c2c67598a1b2	  Shaun and friends take a day off and end up in the city to save their farmer.A fun-filled adventure for Shaun and his friends in the big city as they try to save their farmer and escape the clutches of an animal hunter. Even without decipherable dialogue, the film is enjoyable and easy to watch.	1
29d8205b-fb5f-4a4a-a2d9-c95483550d36	  Fun watch. Not Aardman's best, but worth one watch for some of the sight gags. Kudos to them for not pulling a Tom and Jerry and having the characters speak.	1
7a33a143-a523-4fae-9432-ae79eb772495	  Cute and sweet with jokes that are ok. But I was expecting something more intensely satirical and biting. The amazing thing about the movie is the amount of work that must have gone into the animation - which is stop motion. Apparently 20 animators worked on the film producing 2 seconds of footage per day! That's nearly seven years of work to produce 85 minutes of movie! (If my calculations are correct.) So one almost feels obligated to see the movie given just the human resources that went into it. Apart from that, the whole thing is a bit wooly. And some of the music choices are jarring. But, if you find Shaun the Sheep cute you might like this one.	1
aee9c55e-6347-49e1-aa9e-9086f77c7483	  Good for young kids, the humour is aimed at a young audience but still well made and visually interesting. The funniest bits are in the trailer.	1
df10304d-1067-456a-ade0-e674782044b8	  Consistently amusing with those little Aardman touches and a Rizzle Kicks version of the theme tune.	1
b67f2190-e7c9-41d0-89d1-38be95512605	  Beautifully made and with the usual Aardman level of detail but in terms of humour it is a quite lacking. The absence of dialogue is a nice idea but the sight gags weren't strong enough to carry the picture through.	1
1d2b782f-89f8-4431-9eef-d9bbe1cc2125	  Aah Aardman you've done it again! But then thinking about it when have they not 'done it'? They've been making animated gold for the past twenty-five years. But for some reason I was slightly more sceptical about their latest offering, Shaun the Sheep Movie. While I was never expecting it to be bad because come on, this is Aardman we're taking about, I was not expecting it to be half the film it turned out to be. Shaun the Sheep Movie is an hilarious, heartfelt and thrilling animated comedy that will delight everyone in the audience no matter what the age.When Shaun decides to take the day off and have some fun, he gets a little more action than he bargained for. A mix up with the Farmer, a caravan and a very steep hill lead them all to the Big City and it's up to Shaun and the flock to return everyone safely to the green grass of home.When going into a film like Shaun the Sheep Movie one has to weary of its source material. This is a big-screen adaption of what is basically a young kids programme on CBBC, so it was always in the back of my mind that it was going to play to a younger audience but really I found myself laughing more than any of the children in the audience. It's a natural talent that Aardman seem to have, they effortlessly give their films a universal audience and there is absolutely no one that this film isn't for.The very daring move on Aardman's part with this adaption is that Shaun is in all intensive purposes, mute, so they've played the film out like a silent comedy and as a huge lover of the genre I can say with great reassurance that directors Mark Burton and Richard Starzack have absolutely nailed it. In order for any silent comedy to work it has to have great visual comedic timing and mercifully Shaun the Sheep Movie has that.The absence of dialogue doesn't go a miss in fact you'll barely notice it. In fact I think it elevates the film into something else, something even more impressive. And as always with Aardman the animation is unmatched with its trademark use of stop-motion and plasticine, Shaun the Sheep Movie is extremely ambitious with some of its sets as a huge bulk of the film takes place in a city. The sets are just as impressive as they are meticulous and the attention to detail is just staggering.The producers have clearly been given a bigger budget to play with making the film feel surprisingly cinematic. The facial expressions are so life-like and provide first-rate comedic timing and just as I was about to leave the theatre yet another set of gags awaited me with its superb end credits sequence.I would be stunned to hear if someone didn't enjoy this, people will look down on Shaun the Sheep Movie but believe me, this is some of Aardman's best work to date. To quote Mark Kermode "As I was watching it I could feel my soul being scrubbed clean".	1
c6919e1b-bfcc-41c3-8174-2a8c83c391ed	  There have been better movies made about space, and there are elements of the film that are borderline amateur, such as weak dialogue, an uneven tone, and film cliches.	1
52fdd0f2-d803-41fd-8457-6e1e070839d2	  An astronaut/botanist is stranded on Mars and must rely upon ingenuity to survive.It's hard to divorce my opinions about this film from my opinions of the book, for after the film I thought that they had adapted the book but left out all the good parts. The cut that bleeds most is the final chapter, which gives the whole story a philosophical significance that is both poignant and naively inspiring. Nevertheless, what remains is a fine tale of how science, wit, perseverance, and intelligence are greater weapons than anything else. Mark Watney's humor survives in the film, even if the film strips him of his vulgarity, all in the service of obtaining a PG-13 rating (really, we must reexamine why one "fuck" corrupts thirteen- to seventeen-year-olds so much more than ten, twenty, or 100 "fucks"). Mark Watney's intelligence survives the film version, even if the film's story presents him with fewer obstacles to "science the shit out of," all in the service of giving director Ridley Scott the opportunity to show beautiful Martian sunsets in the time allowed. That Mark Watney character is quite a survivor. Overall, please watch the film - it's good and it's values are inspiring - but read the book too.	1
cbddbbb3-f9fd-4bfd-b530-34e26102bbdb	  This movie has everything, excitement, drama, emotion, humour, strong characters led by Damon but ultimately fails to capture my attention!	1

81d2c316-197b-44a8-89a2-051214169d9a	  A visually fine Ridley Scott flick that was formula and not the kind I enjoy. There just wasn't enough meat on the bone for me here. How does Matt Damon look that good when he hasn't showered. Why is Jeff Daniels here? His presence is distracting, as is the 70s disco music. The dialogue is brutal, Damon does his best. I've seen a recent movie from "space" that was much better. It was called Gravity. All that being said, The visuals make this movie worth seeing.	1
911f7469-e06f-45f1-b573-ecc632071ab0	  Underwhelming. Not sure why this got so much hype, it's not bad but it's certainly not great. The conclusion was so beyond belief, I could not suspend reality that much.	1
89b47189-7ba6-4dba-97ce-c68fc8afebe0	  A faithful adaptation that feels just a tad unsatisfying by the time it wraps up. The Martian is a fun, dangerous ride with no real collateral.	1
2df066e4-3e1b-4cf8-acdb-ff83769e4704	  I watched on the plane , without the enhancement of effects provided by the big screen , it watched as a stand up comedy ( good jokes) , and at times was boring , the script was patched & lacked fluidity , the last scene was kind of stolen from Gravity ( which is a higher quality film ) . I like Matt Damon , but cannot see how this film gets 93% , my note is 60 %	1
db8ddd38-7a75-41e1-add0-de70e767e439	  There's an excellent 120-minute movie in here. It's the other hour I didn't like. Basically it's the story of a guy who wasted billions (trillions?) of dollars and multiple lifetimes' worth of man-hours all because he wanted to be rescued.Pretty sure any real astronaut who made it to Mars would not be thinking, okay now everyone drop everything to get me back to Earth. For what!? Suck it up, do some experiments, say thank you, eat the food you have and then clock out you fool. It's what you signed up for.But, okay, that's the story. It's a movie, I get it. And I get that everyone has to read their emails out loud and react to them for the cameras. But at a certain point--right around where "Calculations correct" actually shows up in a prompt on DonGlover's screen--I can't help but start to feel insulted. I mean, fine, whatever. But I would have loved the movie if it left out all those parts that made me keep reminding myself it's just a movie. Basically I wanted a movie about a guy who grew poop potatoes and futzed around with solar panels for 3 years then died of starvation after writing a very brave and eloquent email to Earth. That movie was almost included in this one. That one would have been 5 stars.	1
9187227d-2a0b-4f17-8767-0fbe978130e6	  The American formula is sadly unmistakable. A long way downhill from Blade Runner from a now lazy director. NASA propaganda.	1
78931de4-c75b-4805-94c3-991733db18f4	  NICE MILDLY ENJOYABLE FILM WITH LIKABLE STARS BUT I DON'T GET WHY ITS SO BELOVED AND UP FOR SO MANY AWARDS	1

5323d16d-f58d-47e8-9ee6-4cca174f8bf0	  Yeah, it looks fantastic and Damon is as charismatic as always but the film lacks tension or dread. I suspect this is due to the scope of the plot, which has too many characters and too little time for most of them. In short less "Apollo 13" and more "Cast Away" would have done a world of good for the movie. Despite what most the general public seems to feel, I'll probably always view this as yet another one of Scott's disappointments.	1
07528aa9-fae5-4da1-b04d-c5381588e5c8	  The Martian is a good movie and a lot of fun.. But it is not without its really stupid constructs. The geeks are going to be all over this move for the huge inaccuracies and unrealistic 'science' in the film.. Mostly I found it enjoyable. I dont believe it can hold a candle to Gravity	1
23fd6261-9e28-4e3f-a900-8a07e9623243	  The Martian is little more than a typical stranded and survival film, but thanks to its great effects, strong cast, and smartly written script, it works.	1
d97fe94d-73bd-439b-bc84-6fe2e683cd8f	  Watched on demand last night. Problems were solved much too easily and quickly, very little drama, characters OK nice diverse realistic cast, sort of boring and predictable. Very pretty though.	1
f31dbe9c-37fb-41cd-9799-f119a0c6b426	  decent film. not bad but seriously? 93%?? It wasn't THAT good. Honestly, Damon wasn't really that good of an actor in this. His character's traits just seemed too unrealistic given his situation of being alone on Mars. Will give credit to the fact that production design was fantastic. But whatever, it was at least a little bit entertaining... especially the ending.	1
1394de22-ef30-4ad4-b4de-d7498a3c7a84	  OK I finally sat through this movie. One it's LONG, too long. There are major gaps of total boredom where I wanted to leave or at least catch a couple minutes of nap time. Coming around not a bad movie, but not a good one either. How the heck it won a Golden Globe for Major Movie, Musical or Comedy is beyond me. Not a Musical and Not a Comedy. Wait for it to come to your neighborhood Walmart half price bin.	1
5c638be3-c5a5-4781-98c2-78ee7186e5b8	  Not believable and highly overrated	1
76486c91-aafd-4691-aed4-092fb10f25f8	  The Martian clearly indicates that Ridley Scott still has the ability to capture the brilliance of space in a film. With stunning visuals this movie, clearly pleases at a very basic and fundamental level. The performance of Matt Damon is probably one of his best, following a steady buildup to the climax. However, the movie has little to offer in terms of new cinematic experiences. Overall a fun movie to watch, but can be skipped.	1

6e5e623d-8628-4367-ab7b-b673e56d10aa	  If I had seen this movie at the theaters on a Sunday, with no work looming, and someone had bought me the ticket, it may have been a fun romp. As it stands, the quips, over-casting, obvious soundtrack, and lack of conflict (despite the story potentially having inherent conflict) made this one kind of a dud. Nothing unexpected to be found here...	1
7c8dd364-cba9-4de9-9a6b-e16c22c19f1e	  Hmmmm! Not sure how to describe this movie. All I can say is where is WILSON in this movie, maybe that would have made this movie more interesting. This movie was charming at times but dragged. The ending was more entertaining and Matt Damon did some better acting towards the end of the movie.	1
83740f77-ba35-408a-ad71-674b691bc71e	  It was a nice film but I have seen better (Moon for example). I chose it because it was meant to be a comedy but it wasn't really funny and far too long. That said, Damon was lovely but his character was quite two dimensional.	1
0785c6cf-e47c-4f49-81a9-21acecb3350f	  A predictable adventure with no depth.	1
a5f16781-fb1b-42f7-a04a-0f3d6a41e1fa	  A fairly engaging (if unchallenging) space disaster movie with a few tense moments. Not on the same tip as Gravity. Somewhat bloated in length.	1
dc87cc5a-1b32-42c0-827c-e6b2f86e7920	  It is good but overrated. Interstellar is the best space movie ever been made, but last year every critic slammed Nolan.	1
2b5bf877-08d1-4616-9e51-c1a820ca96af	  I do not want to have anyone get the wrong idea. There are many aspects of The Martian that thrilled me...and Matt Damon certainly captured my attention. However this is the kind of movie that lets the air out of my tires a bit. Ridley Scott who wonderfully directed Gladiator and Alien...is certainly skilled, yet he stretched out the movie for too long. I love the process of trying to survive in outer space...how could you do it? Well, you must have a brilliant mind to work it all out. There were moments when I thought there is just too many long moments on this red desert that looks like it was filmed in New Mexico with a red lens. Also the science does not always back up what you see in the film. No spoiler alert needed, but sometimes my need for a reality check would have been welcome. Yet this is an entertainment and certainly intelligently put together. Yet all the characters on Earth are stock characters that you would see in any B science fiction movie...and there is not emotional depth to the characters. How many scenes of people looking disappointed or waving their hands in the air as they cheer can we see? Apparently quite a few. It sounds like I did not like this picture...yet I remember Silent Running and I thrilled over the existential Gravity last year. Too many aspects of the film were derivative of other movies. And one last aspect. I hate a narrative that is constant. Silence is all right. Remember The Artist or perhaps Robert Redford's performance in All is Lost and lastly 2001 A Space Odyssey. All can say is I wanted less at times because that could be more. The approach left me a bit cold. Still a well made film.	1
5df95cee-61bd-4104-867f-1e08d36230bd	  The entire movie is literally nonstop embarrassing attempts at humor and typical Hollywood lines, such as, "Let's bring our boy home". Really. I can't understand why this movie is getting good reviews.	1
895194ca-fa1b-4263-a514-4aea4719dae1	  Two hours of space logistics.	1
212e1c81-12f8-42dc-973f-629847c35d1e	  The most elaborate episode of MacGyver ever.	1
1078ae80-b145-466d-bdff-ba301f24d1d4	  Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Damon usually kills it, but Affleck could have played this role - that should indicate how cheesy it was.	1
877ca069-a40e-4da2-ae6c-7960575886a2	  Great movie, except it is really hard to suspend my belief that NASA will be relevant in the future of space.	1
a658e9e4-70e4-443c-994d-4e73708d977d	  I really wanted to like this movie, but t was ok. Like Cast Away but in Mars.	1
81253c6f-2f9c-40e0-b44d-fa25c17fa51e	  Two movies. One very good(the first 1.15 of the movie) one very bad. The second part of course. Part one was a captivating story of survival pure and simple. I loved the ingenuity motivated by desperation and all the tension steadily growing because of this. Nicely portrayed by Damon which is no surprise. It seemed to the second half of the movie was hijacked by Hollywood. It shifted gears from a survival flick to a kind of international UN tale of feel goodery. Way to syrupy and hackneyed to anything close to interesting. Even getting China into the mix. I'll give them credit that's a new one at least they could have made it the Russians since the seem to be the space race leaders right now. Anyway my score reflects the skitzo like persona of this movie.	1
8ceafff6-92a0-4434-8182-078c7d74b087	  Matt Damon is inside and Ridley Scott knows its job, so The Martian is highly entertaining but it seams like d�j� vu. It reminds Gravity with less rebonds.	1
9524bc53-a901-4306-beb5-d3b49c8d8b81	  Scienceing the shit out of this movie would have been a better choice rather than adding a half-hour of unnecessary exposition and flimsy character-building and mundane dialog, but it's still pretty good. Matt Damon has really come around to being a leading man and they could have kept most of the attention on him and it would have been better. I thought it was a pretty big plot hole to go unexplained in that Damon's guy is supposed to be a botanist and yet the Mars team brought no seeds or fertilizer or a mini-greenhouse for experiments (Why bring a botanist to Mars then?!) and he has to resort to poop and potatoes to survive. The ending too was pretty ridiculous. Just suspend disbelief and you'll be fine. I'd like to read the book as I've heard it was much richer in pertinent detail.	1
766efeea-2479-46da-94b0-99c5ca5e4698	  "Fuck." Ridley Scotch is not back.	1
137ae320-59cf-4f04-aa6e-6a56537d55ff	  Ridley Scott is a master of his trade, but I was disappointed in The Martian: photography, lighting, special FX were all dazzling, as can be expected from Mr. Scott; but the attempts at humor were exactly that - attempts. Some of the lightheartedness shone through, but most of the jokes / humorous remarks were constrained. The plot is far-fetched, to say the least. Yes. I know. It's science fiction, but you are meant to believe the mundane stuff (like needing food, water and oxygen) but expected to believe some of the more absurd moments in the film. I was also horribly disappointed that someone (I can't believe Ridley would do this) lifted a great line right from Ron Howard's Apollo 13, when someone refers to a young astro-dynamics wunderkind as a "steely-eyed missile man". Really? Please be more original!!!	1
282301fb-83b5-4ed9-8520-6933ffa8542c	  There have been better movies made about space, and there are elements of the film that are borderline amateur, such as weak dialogue, an uneven tone, and film cliches.	1
052829a8-6d02-4271-a680-f9c51569d195	  I enjoyed the film, Damon carried the the film effortlessly and made it very watchable. The storyline is as what you expect and the film's crew of actors do a pretty good job, the humor and lightness was a good addition to a lackluster genre.	1
7d6ea78e-274f-46ae-90c9-0ce68f2b7c0e	  Entertaining but not as good as I thought it would be. Very Hollywood and all the science was beyond the average person which detached you from the movie. Ridley Scott needs to get on with the next Blade Runner or Alien movie.	1
a5c3f852-8d22-4f5b-9c77-452813ce2325	  About 45 minutes too long	1
7b23849e-956b-444b-a17e-ee432a0d2149	  Hollywood seems to be very proud of this movie and I can see why. Great character driven story, awesome cast, and a big budget I'm sure. Nonetheless, it was predictable -- very. I liked the drama, struggle and anticipation of entire arc, but we've seen it before -- too many times. Dressing him in a different suit and putting him on another planet does little to fool us -- again, we've seen this before! Now go on and entertain us for real next time.	1
01e64517-4615-4227-8ad9-bcc423755c7e	  That was quite a boring watch... What is it with space movies? First, Gravity. Then, Interstellar. And now this? Or maybe I've been spoiled by the likes of Kubrick.	1
52706389-d499-42cd-a230-fb9be0ed208c	  All the hype about the science does not justify the bad writing and casting. There were two movies happening. The Damon movie was decent. The NASA scenes were formulaic. We're supposed to believe NASA brainiacs all look like 20-something Starbucks baristas? The NASA lines were trite and unfunny. Should have kept it on Mars.	1
2dc873a0-44ea-43dc-8d3b-c32385e3d25e	  Critics have been praising The Martian, calling it the best film Ridley Scott has done in quite some time, that's a fair enough comment, however it doesn't stop it from being a reasonably timid and beige science fiction adventure all round. When a team of astronauts are forced to evacuate a manned mission to Mars, botanist Mark Watney is injured and presumed dead, the crew set a return voyage to Earth and no one else is any the wiser. That is of course until Mark wakes up on the surface of Mars, with limited food and no form of communication. The Martian is essentially a survival romp, which to be brutally honest, could have spent more time with the survival aspect and less time trying to become everything its not. Scott is a visual genius, which is why many, including myself, got reasonably excited to see what he would do with our sibling planet. Sadly Mars is completely uninteresting and lacking any atmosphere or soul, The Martian never really looks special, it never stands out and if it werent for the constant reminder of the situation, you would be forgiven for forgetting your on another planet all together, that however is the least of this films worries. Scott manages to enlist an all star cast and its always welcoming to have a roster of this pedigree delivering lines, and that sadly is what is happening here, apart from Matt Damon, no one feels memorable or stand out, they just go through the motions. You cant blame the actors however as not only are they handed a pretty blase script from Drew Goddard, but Scott doesnt manage to ever focus in on a solid structure, leaving you miss the films saving grace when hes not on screen. Matt Damon is that saving grace, it should be his show and at times the film allows you to think that it is, having him pour his heart and soul out during video diaries and essential survival tasks, Scott continually loses all the effect Damon's work does to create character by thrusting through time at such a pace, the true test of Watney's struggles never latches on. It's a continual struggle for the viewers more than it should be, it appears to have a crisis of identity, its average at best to look at, Matt Damon doesnt get enough of our time and the film just spends far too much time hanging around areas we just dont care about. There are nice moments throughout its excessive run time, Watney's continual torment about the collection of disco music he has to keep him company, his determination to grow crops from martian soil and crafting a mode of communication with NASA is all very gripping and heart warming stuff, but just as we start to shine towards him, we are thrown back onto earth to talk technology for too long a time. The Martian is not a complete failure of a film, it has moments of heart and soul and Damon does a fine job trying to hold the film together. But it looks boring, its pacing is problematic and its run time is way too self indulgent. This will no doubt please people, but anyone looking for something deeper with any form of spectacle is not going to get it here.	1
3046f413-e489-46b3-9531-a029ab6ee748	  Very bad ending. You feel like watching a margarine ad. That US-American style pretty much kills the movie, all the national bla bla etc. Matt Damon acts great, though, and the overall humor makes it special to watch, too.	1
945d7191-af6d-4940-ab0a-de5321719a0a	  critics...getting nuts day by day.	1
d5778b72-f835-4d2e-9d64-53d153fadf14	  Ok movie, nowhere near as good as Interstellar. I don't get the 93% rating, 60% maybe. A few major oversights with the film. NASA currently does not have a vehicle to send people into space. Why would you need the Chinese to ferry supplies to orbit, couldn't one of many private companies do the trick. Any trip to Mars will probably be a multinational effort, oh but US exceptionalism prevents any of that happening.	1
f28234a6-ffc2-45e8-a4dd-e03e8b5bcbf7	  Though Damon is great and well-rounded, the supporting cast are all one-dimensional. The movie is not funny nor clever enough for me to want to sit through this again any time soon.	1
ae425eda-9522-45cb-a4d6-023ec9a588e2	  An astronaut/botanist is stranded on Mars and must rely upon ingenuity to survive.It's hard to divorce my opinions about this film from my opinions of the book, for after the film I thought that they had adapted the book but left out all the good parts. The cut that bleeds most is the final chapter, which gives the whole story a philosophical significance that is both poignant and naively inspiring. Nevertheless, what remains is a fine tale of how science, wit, perseverance, and intelligence are greater weapons than anything else. Mark Watney's humor survives in the film, even if the film strips him of his vulgarity, all in the service of obtaining a PG-13 rating (really, we must reexamine why one "fuck" corrupts thirteen- to seventeen-year-olds so much more than ten, twenty, or 100 "fucks"). Mark Watney's intelligence survives the film version, even if the film's story presents him with fewer obstacles to "science the shit out of," all in the service of giving director Ridley Scott the opportunity to show beautiful Martian sunsets in the time allowed. That Mark Watney character is quite a survivor. Overall, please watch the film - it's good and it's values are inspiring - but read the book too.	1
83dac4ac-043d-4f85-b04b-d6224822c729	  A rehash; though a very good one!	1
45d241ca-c881-4710-b217-4a2cd064d149	  As for Ridley Scott's directing, it's actually not bad. But the whole movie is totally nothing special, so-so script, and boring. Also, two similar kind of movies came out in a past two years, and either "Gravity" or "Interstellar" is better than now this one.	1
90774512-7033-46a0-bb47-fd815fa7580b	  It was just OK. Not as good as Gravity or Interstellar.	1
444361f8-12ac-414e-b64d-3ffdd5e9a69e	  Good overall; not great. A bit slow at times, but then waiting for something to hit. I wouldn't buy this for later review.	1
6c9b3575-0322-4238-bc53-7ba6f9d41935	  A deft storyline with a strong lead character, The Martian is a slick sci-fi thriller that relies on whiz-bang scientific calculations, but is undone by shallow characters straddling stereotypes. The most egregious short cut? That the writer was unaware of or worse, discounted the warrior ethos leaving a man behind. Weak insights, lead to weak characters, who inevitably, make bad decisions.	1
95d9b4a0-2dfa-45f5-a03b-0dca29526610	  While "Gravity" bests it by miles in bringing to life the numerous implications of survival in space, it's a fun adventure and its optimistic protagonist provides great inspiration. While "Gravity" more effectively handles the existential, moral, and all-out physical aspects of survival, "The Martian" focuses more on the pure inspiration that comes from creativity and virtue that comes from adversity.	1
8123cede-57c3-4288-94eb-72a6689c14c7	  I liked it, but I didn't love it, and once I left the theater, I never thought about it again. It's no Interstellar. Or Castaway. It got boring in parts.	1
9607489a-dca0-4343-a336-5be83085fc32	  Not bad trying to hard to be funny and have geeky big bang humour.	1

4f854393-28cf-4fe3-90d3-081194c0f167	  First half was compelling movie making. Second half went of the rails in a big way. Like two different directors did the film. First half was a great interesting story of survival. The second half was full on Hollywood schmaltz with bad dialogue. Worse i'll chosen soundtrack. Abba and other assorted disco period music was bad but even worse did not fit the period of the movie and was completely wrong for situation. Puzzling to say the least. Don't want to give any spoilers so all I will say is that the ending space scene was laughable. Was also amusing how the movie ticked all the PC correct boxes even down to the Chinese helping the US space program. Really? Like they would give a crap. Anyway, I thought they were going to break out the old Coke ad jingle from the 70's disco period " I'd like to teach the world to sing" I guess they came kind of close with "Love Train". Anyway, back half of the movie has heavy handed corny. Could have been so much more your far better off watching "Moon" if you are in the mood for a outer space survivalist flick	1
ead1abb3-881d-4578-9b8d-a93b92efb8b8	  If you actually know anything at all about Mars or space travel, it's hard to get engaged with this movie, with its Martian base the size of several McMansions, and Mars-scapes dominated by obviously sedimentary geology. In other words, it's ridiculously contrived and completely lacking in tension. Also the "global" (i.e. including China) to rescue a single castaway stinks of American triumphalism. Far far below Ridley Scott's best work, such as Blade Runner.	1
faac5b89-22d0-4c0c-b9c0-785edaba2b51	  A journey into space. Virtual one man race for survival. Charming because Matt Damon is such a great guy. Otherwise... meh. The actors were really in character for their roles. Believable. Human. Likeable.	1
f94d16e0-ae46-4ae4-8f45-e5831f146117	  Way too "Hollywoodized" for me. Very little character development and cheesy lines.	1
a31887d6-055b-4c1d-8feb-48712dce43b0	  I enjoyed this. Friendship, teamwork, problem-solving, and cooperation between nations. I wish we got to know the team relationship more.	1
6bfa3fb0-7c00-44c6-9604-210b09461695	  Ridley Scott attempts a sci-fi survival movie that embodies interplanetary human collaboration but nevertheless restrains to an all too familiar predictable sequence of events. It definitely lacks the intellectual depth of Interstellar but casual movie goers would be treated to a bit of applied science, a 'green message' and feel good cheery.	1
72f9af03-e7a4-4a76-82fe-314e6e225e7e	  One of the blockbusters of the year, a good adventure movie but an overrated one as well (8,2 in imdb). The Martian is Ridley Scott's return after his last good movie, Prometheus (2012).Picture this one as a combination of the science of Apollo 13 (1995), combined with the survival element of Cast Away (2000) and the lost in space fun of Gravity (2013). After the recent success of Gravity (7 oscars for an all-right sci-fi adventure movie) it seems that space adventure movies can combine Academy Awards' appreciation with ticket selling.The Martian is very well made, Ridley Scott's direction is impressive at some points and Matt Damon tries his best, but the movie is obviously not thought provocative. Still it's the perfect movie to have your pop corn with.Grade: B-	1
49145568-78e6-4997-8172-e5e53dceff3b	  Quirky. The potential for tragedy is tempered by a sometimes inappropriate humor. BTW, how could a biologist be so conversant with the technologies attending to the space program?	1
f6462d50-ed3c-4ee2-a2fa-bef126431c4e	  Dave's Famous Movie Reviews in 100 Words or Less (Just Don't Count Them)The Martian (2015) or How to Ruin a Perfectly Good Book in 144 MinutesSynopsis: a really nerdy book about survival against all odds gets the Hollywood treatment and becomes a movie about an easy rescue. If you didn't read the book and you like a movie without much detail, you'll probably love it.3 out of 5 starsWhat worked: They skimmed over all the detailed sciency stuff behind the antagonist's survival to keep the movie from being too long.What didn't: They skimmed over all the detailed sciency stuff behind the antagonist's survival to keep the movie from being too long.Random thought: It's a shame Irrfan Khan was unavailable to play Venkat Kapoor.	1
0cc0d279-3c3c-4d51-8714-e275f1ce327e	  The cinematography of this Sci-Fi set on Mars was always going to be good, and it is. But the rest of this film is ordinary. There was very little emotion or tension, considering the situation, not enough 'humanness' added to enable us to connect with the characters at a deeper level. And the choice many of the songs was strange and didn't work, only making some long scenes even longer. I felt like I had seen many of the elements done a lot better in other similar movies.	1
ac3fa81e-3433-41be-979b-23e8d243bee0	  As satisfying as a burger & chips. Not too subtle, but that's not what one expects from a Ridley Scott film.	1
105882ad-843a-4ee0-83bb-5f513e4468bf	  A fittingly optimistic take on a man fighting for his life in a parallel universe where NASA is sending men to Mars and the Chinese actually cooperate with other nations. I must admit though, I liked "Saving Matt Damon" more when it was set in World War II.	1
2001076b-8ba5-42d3-88ad-bc4bc3cbe433	  I read the book, no, devoured the book. The movie was a let down because it didn't present the dire necessity of rescuing him. There were a lot of flaws and Matt Damon appeared waaaay to comfortable on Mars. The screen play was somewhat flawed because it left out some key road blocks to getting to the MAV and ares landing site.. He was more than worried about food not just running out of ketchup. I did enjoy the 70s music and the cinematography.	1
c64e8a6c-ecf8-43c6-b488-e23041689788	  As the film adaptation - the film is not particularly good. I lost a lot of interesting details and also removed a lot of jokes. But when viewed separately, but so be it, the film is not bad. See it was interesting, although it felt that without reading the book, I would not have understood a lot. The visual part of the film is gorgeous. A couple of good jokes is still there, but the dramatic element was not felt. In the book it just a little, but it is also very important. When viewing I realized that not really empathize main character. The actors did their best. Matt Damon is handled excellently, secondary characters also coped well. Glad that after a series of setbacks, Ridley Scott still able to make a good movie. Decent fiction, which is not only much inferior to last year's movie about space, which also was Damon. I can not put a very high score for one reason only - the book. Though I understand that the movie is a separate thing, but just does not compare. This is a very subjective opinion.	1
bf9a35d1-18fb-449a-a644-fc847fc21d2d	  Ridley Scott's latest film succeeds as crowd-pleasing, straight-down-the-line commercial escapism. It's essentially Matt Damon's film, demonstrating once again his broad range as an actor and ability to both engage and entertain. Otherwise, "The Martian", whilst occasionally brilliantly shot and with moments of grandeur, comes off as disposable entertainment and is ultimately forgettable. Like most blockbusters, this feels designed to manipulate the audience and despite the setting there isn't enough stillness or space to make this film really breathe. That there is musical score in just about every god damned scene, the camera is always zooming and dollying, and that there is nary a static shot is par for the course for most big budget films made these days, but for Ridley Scott to be making films in this manner demonstrates that he's lost his ability to tell a story without smoke and mirrors. It's good, but it could have been great.	1
f2ff7f24-fe12-452d-9d6f-f1b1c1432865	  Good, but not great movie. Some of the science is a bit weak and the movie is at least 30 minutes too long. It was entertaining, but I wish I would have waited until it came to video.	1
9630d685-7c92-4ee1-bc19-17a8d81f0397	  Despite the serious story lacking desired level of seriousness in its treatment, Matt Damon's comic dialogue deliveries kept audiences from leaving the theatre. If you have watched interstellar, it may be a big let down. Despite all the flaws it may appeal non-geek audience.	1
3acdd32b-5e4d-4336-b16c-0cec75e488e8	  Overall it's an entertaining experience but there are too many assaults of unforgivably bad acting and silly dialogue that put it more in the league of "Armageddon" than "Gravity".	1
a2c033f5-ef99-4323-9ad2-12b63a5c4b6a	  Despite an incredible cast, one of my favourite directors at the helm and a relatively charismatic Matt Damon, the only act that truly shines in this film is the last. With a script heavy first two acts, the dialogue needed to exceed the audiences knowledge and have us meet it halfway, instead opting for a far safer and friendlier script. A far greater film lies within a very superficial script, unfortunately tugging neither at the strings of the heart or head.	1
e6d9b3f7-9172-43a4-b2de-40c626878616	  I've seen better space films, but I'm not sure if that's the fault of the film or the book (as it's also not the best book about space).	1
f8870a62-e800-4a8c-b5d2-cf83a0318136	  The movie is super predictable, but just considering it was not exactly the same as "Gravity" and "Interstellar" as it seemed it would be, that's more than enough for me. It's not exactly hilarious, but it's a good new perspective to the 'stranded theme'. It's also cool that it focuses on what the world can do when they work in the same team. I hear it's pretty scientifically accurate too, so that earns it some points. Definitely a flick for science enthusiasts like engineers.	1
72b203ba-a885-44b2-8521-8668aea6e3a9	  Well made but a feeling of discontentment happens when the characters seem to all act the same. All sarcastic and always in a good mood. I didn't feel that invested it didn't show nothing that new.The visuals and the sections when its him alone on Mars with no extra characters is worth seeing. There is a bigger focus on NASA and them being all ughhhhh....Its okay movie	1
d3ceabed-2c84-4d14-85b0-145e82147c96	  Could have been better if Matt was not in the starring role.	1
5b1ef8f6-b101-42cf-ac7a-42ddf1b1408e	  The Martian is a fun spectacle of a film. The 3D is decent enough to actually add something to the film without ever coming across as a gimmick. The performances, cinematography and direction are all top notch and can't be faulted. Where the film doesn't work for me is that I never ever get a sense that astronaut Mark Watney is truly stranded or helpless. Throughout the film, whenever a problem arises or is fortold, the solution comes about either withing the same dialogue, the next piece of dialogue, or the next scene (or two). There is no sense of dread or despair really present in this film. Considering this astronaut is stranded on Mars, one would think that him never getting home would be a primary theme in this film but a film about a dude on an island with a volleyball for a friend managed to do a much better job of that somehow. The Martian is but a small step above a popcorn flick but thanks for some stunning visuals, that step can feel like a giant leap.Worth checking out in 3D or Imax (or 3D Imax if you can) to truly get the full visual experience of the film.	1
4f16eac1-9efb-4be5-8809-a39192542af8	  A fun watch, Matt Damon is an exceptional on-screen presence. It's a shame that the plot telegraphs a foregone conclusion, but there's enough going on to keep it watchable.	1
b25ccebc-76c4-4f89-9adc-67a70177f623	  Dramatic but slow moving.	1
aeaba3aa-b27f-4331-b134-121cf5f917a2	  Impeccably made and with a great, charming performance from Mad Damon, The Martian suffers from a similar problem as other "stranded disaster movies." The biggest issue here is that any time the film returns to earth, it loses any and all momentum is had built up. The mars scenes are gorgeous, effecting, and surprisingly entertaining and when the film returns to Earth countless times, everything comes to a screeching halt. Even the scenes on the space station Hermes, who are in a unique position to possibly rescue Damon's stranded Mark Watney, are formulaic. Scott's visuals, though, remain as potent as ever and I can't stress enough how gorgeous and well put together the Mars scenes are. Another problem I had was the completely predictable plot. At one point, Jeff Daniels' NASA chief says something to the effect of "I hope nothing else goes wrong!" and, what do you know, the next scene shows a supply ship headed for Watney explode. WHO COULD HAVE SEEN THAT COMING?!?! I also never thought for a second that he wouldn't be rescued, training much of the tension of the movie. The Martian is really only worth it for, like I said, Damon and Mars. Everything else drags the movie down into a formulaic mess.	1

d9a2c7d6-8eb5-44d7-8390-ab22667729f2	  i know no one is going to listen to me but he film is average in every way	1
9acffc43-edc4-49b1-9baf-7685e4549174	  Funny and scientifically grounded, but also quite boring and lacking in character development. I just didnt give two shits about Whatney	1
b347ecd5-b3eb-45d2-89cb-bfea2c07d6f5	  Girl, you know, yet again showboats Hollywood's firm grasp of cinematic competence while also demonstrating its piss poor ability to, idk, think.	1
7e27dd8b-3e8a-40a9-86df-0d431cd529ae	  Felt like I was watching a movie filmed on Mars...spectacular...but, I have seen this movie before, it was called "Castaway" and starred Tom Hanks, only the setting was different.	1
9b3a8896-3e43-4f10-99aa-523416a7a34b	  Nothing new to see here.	1
46a79d0b-5a98-4234-bf91-48166d121a93	  Ok but TOOOO long - needed an hour shaving off it	1
509cdc0e-d42d-4ce0-9536-754e5893e140	  Kinda like Castaway but set on Mars with great humour. Not quite as good as everyone is raving about it but I enjoyed it	1
f99d37f7-ccbd-4dfd-b7c5-b44688ab1bda	  This was a well-executed, tightly drawn and witty thriller.It had all the hallmarks of a Ridley Scott ripping yarn. It was fun, slick, spectacular and gripping.But, and I say this with great regret, it failed to deliver on any level other than a shallow ride. And yet there were so many opportunities to explore so many human frailties, strengths and emotions. but Scott seems to have bowed to Hollywood pressure to spin a shallow yarn.Others have commented on it but the deep questions this raises about purpose, about loneliness, about luck, about comradeship, about failure, about bravery, about courage, about the very purpose of space exploration. All came begging with great actors and sets and a story line that would have easily carried them, all went begging.A huge opportunity wasted.A way behind blade runner, alien, and even Gravity.Interstellar tried, wobbled, but tried ay least.	1
1505c8c4-d77c-4e20-840e-ea6662c9a29f	  A "Fair" movie for a fictional space survival movie. Apollo 13 was much better since it was based on reality.	1
8fbb1067-63a5-4e6b-804e-9f146a67d2e2	  Having read the book I thought the movie moved way too fast. There was a lot to cover, however, it just didn't catch the details of the science.	1
1b840b65-1ba9-4006-a22b-2883112345f0	  OK but over-rated, no character development long dull musical and scenery interludes and frankly a bit dull compared to my expectations from critic reviews.	1
1f66c5f3-5dfc-4db2-93f3-4a99932c682e	  I would give this 2 /12 starts. Its fun, has the amazing Jeff Daniels, but is forgetable.	1
169692fb-c934-44ea-9577-39d49ad584d9	  The Mars travel is dry, both literally and figuratively. The support cast is the real star. There is an ok race and gender mix, with plenty of sharp wit, though the film doesn't follow through. Evidently Hollywood remains afflicted by the notion that "diverse" characters are there for contrast and light relief, and that the all-American, white boy and girl must be at centre. By the way, it is only a discredited, old, English law of empire that says you can colonize land merely by cultivating it; the imperialists applied this in order to seize vast amounts of land from native peoples, who hunted for food. Apart from the film's potted territorial ideas (p.i.), it crafts a fairly congenial hero concerned not with aggression, but with inventiveness - though he doesn't match MacGyver's quick sophistication.	1
22dfe7ae-3383-48d8-8fc9-f807cf6c6f5f	  The performances are quite good and it's hard to deny the power of certain moments . . . however this story was begging for a more stylistically ambitious film than the one we got. As it stands, "Room" seems like something made for television.	1
c4749249-5f19-458c-890e-612697bde644	  Interesting abduction drama which tugs at the heart strings thanks to the great child actor, the subject matter, and the bond between child and mother. However, the story is implausible and loses a lot when it shifts halfway through to focusing on adjusting to a normal life.	1
5933c868-0bf3-4177-a6dc-92853bb351b4	  Room is an interesting film and a very innocent take on a horrendous situation. Though not told only from the perspective of the child, Jack is the center of Room. He is how we experience and learn about the world that is Room. Though I'm not gaga over the film I did enjoy what was presented and how it was presented. It is both dark and horrifying while also containing hope and humour. Considering the subject matter involved... this is a welcomed choice by all those involved.	1
d8def7fc-6cad-48c1-8824-35e9ff96c5d3	  I have no clue why this movie is such a big deal.	1
9d5f09d0-d722-4158-b251-98fd5d3f7807	  Loudon Wainwright and his shed friends.	1
8cd5e81c-25dd-44bb-a6a6-0f7dc076f7d1	  Once you get over some of the incredulous details the director seems to have glossed over (e.g. no one heard the two of them screaming at the top of their lungs from a shed in a suburban neighborhood? The kid was able to grow to be 5 without getting sick once?), you begin to see the world from the child's PoV and you begin to feel the way he does about the outside world, outside "the room". I dont see how the Oscar could be given to Brie Larson while Jacob Tremblay is passed over for best actor, and perhaps the youngest ever. The movie needs some editing from the halfway mark, but watch the movie for Jack.	1

248d3465-8c1e-4819-a252-995389a7b86e	  Love the movie, but wasn't one of my favorites	1
b6c68205-ab47-432e-aa85-04bb528baa16	  Really well acted, pacing is a little slow, and the kid is written like a 8 year old not a five year old...but it is supper depressing...like Precious level of sadness wrapped in misery with an extra scope of dear god that is awful	1
89254353-4645-4abd-8a74-ee886d726836	  The "Room" is a good movie the acting in this movie is wonderful even from characters you don't see or talk a lot in the movie. The pace of the movie was in fact a little slow, as I did have to check the clock once or twice. The characters are brilliant but for me the movie is split into three the first half being the Jack's (Jacob Tremblay) story, the second half being Ma's (Brie Larson) story and in the third half it flip flops between the two. That being said theirs still something there that stopped me from fully caring about the Ma character, don't get me wrong there are some moments but not to the full extent were it hit me and I thought really care for her, but seeing the story from Jack's view kind of makes that a lesser problem. The script is beautifully done, but there are some question that will go unanswered in the movie or some things that I still wanted to know or for the movie to explore a little bit more. Overall this is a good movie and recommend to at least check it out.	1
e1bb9591-11d9-48f7-8ff6-78eaebd14030	  It's a fine film to watch when you don't expect much or aren't going to be critical about story-line details. To me it came across as a low budget, first time directors, masterpiece...with an emphasis on low budget and first time director. The acting was superb but I was just so frustrated with the far-fetched scenarios and a slow, somewhat unfinished, 2nd half. I hear the book isn't any different.	1
2a3db28d-05e0-476e-ae08-c9ca7c7411ce	  The first disconnection I felt watching this film was, the age of Jack, was he 5 ? or 7 ? I would believed him more if he was 7.Secondly if he was in that room for all his life, then the script written for him was more for a senior kindergarden.I can't help looking back to Danny Lloyd ( The Shining ) who was very natural which I think how a 5 year old child should be.Good script and performance, I like the story.. but since I felt those disconnection early, it was like watching a movie that was supposed to be set in Toronto, but someone messed up and showed the Empire state building in the background.	1
