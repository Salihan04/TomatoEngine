9af5724a-86e0-41b4-9103-9a2947f14196	  George Miller unleashes a feverish, ferocious film and it's an intense wild ride. Acrobatic "Mad Max: Fury Road" is thrilling and treats the audience to some astonishing action sequences. But the action doesn't dull the emotional impact and that's mainly due to Charlize Theron's fierce performance."Mad Max: Fury Road" is a ride worth taking. Wall-to-wall pumped-up adrenalized fun, it's ridiculously good.	2
78e5097d-6162-4d6f-9f73-d483718fdba3	  George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the most, lush and vivid movies I've seen in a long time. The cinematography for this film is an absolute marvel- showcasing the sprawling outback desert through hues of oranges and reds during the daytime, contrasting it with beautiful midnight blues at night. All this comes together to give the movie a very lively atmosphere. The score alleviates the sense of rush and is smartly used diegetically as well as non-diegetically. The action scenes are shot brilliantly with minimal special effect, furthering its case as a masterpiece. Finally the acting especially that of Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa is top-notch and no character is left needing further characterisation. Tom Hardy's Max is a man of little words, but the performances are so strong that the movie doesn't need dialogue in order to flourish. This movie is definitely not hyped up- go see it and then go see it again.Rating: 5/5	2
8f5ea78a-eee3-4952-8f37-e00b31375729	  Apparently, it takes an old veteran like George Miller to show this new generation of young filmmakers how action can be exhilarating, and so he gives us this high-octane, adrenaline-fueled roller coaster of a movie that is technically flawless, visually astonishing and looks amazing in 3D.	2
6e7dd5de-fd56-4994-9205-d4d751f94d4b	  A glorious symphonic ballet of wanton destruction whose visual poetry dazzles and amazes. Whereas the current popular political correctness deems all life as precious, this weekend jaunt through the local park with the baby in the stroller yells to differ (reminding one of exactly what planet one dwells on). Standing ovation for George Miller, whose charming eloquence about the well hidden truth of modern society is jaw-droppingly stunning. The best apocalyptic vision seen for some time.	2

63a5ff41-7295-4468-99fc-14a365d456fa	  30 years after the release of 'Thunderdome' Mad Max is finally back. The lone wolf, the single warrior, the loner, the lone soldier, the outcast, the outsider, the man with no name...errr...named Max. The hype has been stratospheric for this one, I have gone into this expecting truly mind blowing things, the greatest action movie ever made? lets see, I will be brutally honest in every aspect.So the bottom line, this is virtually based around one sequence from 'Mad Max 2' and made into an entire movie. We all know which sequence, the one with that bloody great gas tanker covered in gun turrets and spikes. That sequence was epic on so many levels, a truly award winning vision of distopian science fiction...where all the goodies get killed, awesome. Now, in this tale Max has been captured by the War boys who are all led by Immortan Joe. Your standard gang of barbaric lunatics, only this time not kitted out in S&M gear, no this time they are all painted up in a tribal sort of way. Long story short, Max has gotta reluctantly help out Charlize Theron's character of Furiosa (with the help of Nicholas Hoult's ill War Boy character, Nux) in saving some damsels in distress from Joe whilst trying to reach some fabled lush green lands. This of course equals a whole load of vehicle chases across the outback which basically never stop.The first sequence we see is Max's classic and gorgeous black pursuit special (the now famous 1973 Ford XB Falcon GT) getting trashed, wait what??!! I heard about this before hand and I have to say I don't like it one bit, I wanted to see that fucking car in action once again, damn it Miller! Not quite sure how Max's super fast special manages to get wiped out by the collection of clown cars chasing him but never mind, it bloody happened didn't it, ugh!So one of the first things we see as the real story kicks in is Immortan Joe's citadel which appears to built into a fecking massive cliff. How the hell did they manage to do that? there's like some sprawling catacombs in this rock by the looks of it, I wouldn't of thought anyone had any time in between killing each other and building ridiculous killer automobiles. This is actually one aspect that didn't sit well with me, this whole idea felt way too grand and over the top for a Mad Max movie, it looked like something from the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy...only with cars instead of orcs. Then if I really wanted to be picky I would ask how everyone is so muscular in this dead post-apocalyptic world, meh don't question it. Its here we start to see the strange freakish array of characters that inhabit this new Earth, gotta say I loved what I saw here for the most part. Miller has always been good at creating these bizarre characters for this franchise and he nails it again here.Most of the bad guys are just big rippling baldies covered in white paint for some reason (the War Boys), not much background given but they look intimidating for sure. Other citadel dwellers and bad guys come in various shapes and sizes such as the creepy looking Corpus Colossus, a physically disabled child of Joe with exceptional intelligence (a real person with a real disability). Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones), a huge muscular mammoth of a man, dim-witted and another son of Joe. The Bullet Farmer who is some ugly aging bloke in a suit of bullets and...is a farmer?, hence is name. The People Eater is a big fat bald guy (everyone is bald in the distopian future) who I guess eats people? Again hence is name and the reason he's so fat, he also looks to have lost his nose because he wears some kind of metal plate there. The Doof Warrior who is some crazy blind bloke that rides a war rig (the Doof Wagon) into battle strapped to some huge speakers and playing a fire spouting guitar. This guy seems to have become the new Boba Fett of the movie world but he doesn't actually do anything, in fact I fail to see the point of him or the drummers other than simply to look cool. Admittedly he does look cool, certainly unique with his mothers face for a mask (oh yes), but basically pointless.Lastly we have Immortan Joe who is easily the most effective looking character I've seen in years. His mask appears to be some kind of breathing apparatus that is attached to some kind of bellows around his neck. The mask is slightly reminiscent of an old WWII pilots oxygen mask but with a terrifying line of big teeth like a skeleton. Not too sure about his ending though, was his mask like...attached to has face and skull? He also seems to wear some kind of transparent body armour with medals and whatnot attached, obviously he suffers from some kind of affliction or disease. Visually this guy looks fucking amazing, the makeup really tops it off with his pale ghostly complexion and silver balding, widows peak hair line. All in all the selection of characters gave off a very 'Dune-esque' (1984) vibe in my opinion.The action is virtually constant here, its the trademark of the movie (and franchise), non-stop. The main bulk of the action centres around Max and co trying to escape on the tanker under a barrage of gunfire and explosions. Now yeah, we've seen this before in 'Mad Max 2' but this has been ramped up to maximum overdrive, its insane! There are vehicles being torn up and flipped all over, metal mechanical shrapnel shattering all over the desert, bodies are flying everywhere, War Boys are leaping around on pole vault type things hurling explosives, gunfire, stabbings, fisticuffs...all happening on and off various extreme vehicle creations. It all looks completely real (because all the stunts were real), its highly impressive and shows great achievement in both eruptive action and practical effects. On top of that the location work, scenery shots, panoramas and the crisp, bold colour palette really look nothing short of gorgeous, it almost looks too good for this type of movie. Gives you faith in movies again it really does.That's not to say the action saves it completely, in my view. Amongst all this grade A action you do have to wonder how Max, Joe and others manage to survive some of the horrific fender benders they get into. The good guys battle their way away from the citadel, all that way, only to come back again and do it all again? wut?! The canyon sequence stuck out as a very daft cheesy notion. This biker gang that hides out there, living in and around the canyon walls, which they ride about on...with motorbikes? bit risky isn't it. Also, where did they all get their matching costumes? When the good guys come back through the canyon, do they go a different way? didn't it get blocked off. And it does all seem nuts that all this happens purely because Joe wants his girls back. He unleashes his entire armada and risks everything just for some ass? can't you find more girls in your citadel? Oh and in the end the citadel bad guys just let Max and co into their city and take over? huh? he just killed your leader.The greatest action flick ever? hmmm not too sure about that, its certainly up there but I still find myself preferring the gritty cult classic 'Mad Max 2' with Gibson. I think Hardy does a reasonable job but he is no Mad Max if you ask me. One thing I hated actually was the deliberate lack of dialog from Max, it worked well in the older films (MM2) simply because there was less to explain, 'MM2' was like a bloody 80's videogame it was so straight forward. Here there are things that could use background information plus the amount of times Max gets into a situation (mainly at the start) where I really wanted him to just speak! say something!! Explain your situation to Furiosa then she might not try to kill you...ugh! I found that actually frustrating and it didn't need to be like that.Still, the fact that the goodies went back on themselves towards the end really made me groan frankly. Its like Miller didn't know how to end it so he just made them go back and run the same gauntlet all over again, easy option for more of the same. I won't lie and say I didn't like it, but I won't lie and say I thought it was a stunning movie, the action is monumental at first but after the initial hardcore, automobile, carnage sequence, things felt a little tamer. The initial visual shock and awe that hit my eyeballs, making them swell, started to ease off. So awe-inspiring visuals all round and some great characters...visually at least. Is this a good flick? yes, yes is it, its a very engaging solid action movie, buts lets not get too carried away. Its really a one trick pony if you're honest about it, big gas tanker with goodies fights off hordes of baddies, rinse, wash and repeat until credits. The only real difference is its Furiosa's story, and to a degree, Nux too, unfortunately Max is just along for the ride in his 30 year old reboot.	2
ebfe5eee-1de3-417e-83cc-c7c5d19feee8	  Damn! I never knew I could like an action movie this much. Made me want to watch the original 3. This movie was out of this world awesome!	2
b600b6a2-2054-4a39-a5e7-29a51448c717	  'Fury Road' rips through conventional action movie norms to provide a visceral experience. Miller's choice to use practical effects pays off tenfold, as the stuntmen and pyrotechnics deserve as much recognition as the perfect cast. The Mad Max franchise is back, and so far its a wild ride.	2
5080e1f9-72eb-4547-8b6c-353bea7628e8	  This is by far the best film of the summer. I feast of action and drama. I will say that while it did a great job of capturing the essence of the original films, it was lacking the "hardcore sensory overload / punk rock" feeling that the first two films had. Not necessarily a bad thing...I just missed that feeling.	2
5d0253a5-e643-43c8-9ea7-5b2781960bd4	  Apocalyptic films are usually a hit or miss subject. Many are forgettable or cliched to the point of being one big joke, kind of like the film within the film by the Mackenzie brothers in Strange Brew. Some films get it really right, while others get it really, really wrong with disastrous and silly results.When one thinks of the modern apocalyptic film the template for that genre of cinema was crafted by George Miller. His major debut Mad Max (1979) was less apocalyptic and more a '70's exploitation car chase flick sent to hell and back, making the film an achievement in film making. It pushed the envelope at the end of the decade.It would be the sequel to that film, Mad Max 2 or The Road Warrior here in the states, that would define Miller's vision of the world beyond the end, the people that lived after the "event". The Road Warrior is one of those rare films that exceeds its predecessor with a story that, while simple, is presented in a way that is unforgettable and burns itself into your psyche.We'll skip Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. It has its place and its moments, but is really a film that Miller cared very little about as he left the world of Max for thirty years.Mad Max: Fury Road is a return to the supercharged film that The Road Warrior happened to be. Max (Tom Hardy) once again runs afoul of a mutant clan using slave labor and water to control their little piece of a broken world. Led by Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keayes-Byrne, who played the Toe Cutter in the original film) a chase ensues after Furiosa (Charlize Theron in an awesome performance) steals a commodity that is sacred to the enraged leader.A simple story if there ever was one, but this goes beyond that. Fury Road is open to close action with very little time to catch your breath. Some films are called a roller coaster ride, that age old cliche that they slap on posters. Fury Road is like going into hell without any looking back. It's funny that a film set in a fictional version of our world can draw so many parallels to life itself.What really stands out in Fury Road is the role of women. For a film titled Mad Max, the strongest character in the film is Furiosa, a warrior that does not give up, leading her ironic cargo to a promised land that may or may not exist. Distant memories or wishful thinking? There are moments when Max feels like a side character and this is Furiosa's movie. It's an amazing thing to see in film where a woman is neither a pawn nor a gimmick, but an integral piece to the film. She is the center that everything about Fury Road revolves around.I was more than sketchy when I heard that another Mad Max film was on the way. So many returns in the last decade have floundered over the indulgences of these sequels and reboots. It's about a 50/50 split in that arena. Fury Road is probably the best of the bunch and is probably one of the best films of 2015 so far. It is a credit to credit masterpiece that really cuts at the other blockbusters of this year and the almost stagnant world of super hero movies. Fury Road is, ironically, a breath of fresh air in a cinematic universe that tends to regurgitate last years product. Dare I say that this film is Miller's masterpiece, possibly even surpassing The Road Warrior? I don't know, but I really, REALLY want to watch it again.	2
57aabbb4-c4d4-4f95-bab8-1f807cb123c4	  Its possibly one of the greatest action movies ever made. A mind-blowing visual feast for the eyes and ears with spectacular action sequences, fights and chases. Tom Hardy is a man of few words but delivering none the less and giving a strong performance showing he is more than a worthy replacement for Mel Gibson. It also provides plenty of strong female characters as well, Charlize Theron is pure power. Its The Fast and the Furious in ways only The Expendables can imagine. It's pure mad-man brilliance from a fine artist in fine form. Director, George Miller rocks this film with is gorgeous and explosive vision. An action movie masterpiece that will blow you away.	2
6c91c275-9723-4265-8420-a98c9ec5babd	  George Miller's long-awaited sequel is grandiose in scale of action-sequences overall, and it is marvelous to say the least. Mad Max: Fury Road is an exhilarating-overdose of monumental thrills and sound. The film's post-apocalyptic feel is stronger and the performances are impressive, especially Charlize Theron. It also has enough of a concise story to make this one of Miller's most exceptional works and one of the best summer blockbusters, let alone overall films, of the year. 4.5/5	2
5e3b323d-95c2-41b5-af9d-af5bc8d8f432	  An action packed thrill ride that leaves your bum tense! Thoroughly enjoyable, havent seen the originals but makes me want to!	2
245caec5-ab55-4c88-8f6d-fd638e6b40eb	  Allow me to begin with a confession. I had to see Mad Max: Fury Road again. I knew minutes into the film that my appetite would not be quenched and I needed to see it again, which I did less than 12 hours later. A week later I saw it a third time in the theater. The reason I did this is obvious in one regard - it's a highly enjoyable, pulse-pounding, amazing spectacle of first-class stuntwork and mad genius so rarely accomplished on such a large, splendid scale of destruction. The other reason, from a writing standpoint, is that I needed to see the movie again or else my review of Fury Road was going to consist of nothing but an unending stream of positive adjectives vomited upon the page in excitement. And for you, dear reader, I wanted to do better. Also, I wanted to see Mad Max: Fury Road again and I honestly wouldn't mind in the slightest seeing it again.In the post-apocalyptic future, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) is an aging warlord with his own fiefdom. He controls the water supply and has an army of gearhead warriors to enforce his rule. His trusted driver, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), is leading a caravan for supplies when she goes rogue, driving off into the desert. Furiosa has taken Immortan Joe's "property," namely his five wives. Enraged, Immortan Joe gathers a posse of death vehicles and riders and heads off to reclaim his "property." Max (Tom Hardy) is a drifter thrust into the middle of this conflict when he's strapped to a car and driven out into the desert, part of the Immortan Joe rapid response forces. There are few things more exhilarating in the realm of motion pictures than a well-executed, well-developed action sequence, and Mad Max: Fury Road is a blistering, awe-inspiring masterpiece of brilliant carnage. What director George Miller has achieved onscreen is visionary. The level of execution is so rarely seen at such a large scale, and with so many moving parts, that I was delighted and curious how something this extraordinary could escape the risk-averse studio system. I'm trying my best to restrain myself from sheer hyperbole, but this is an instant classic in the world of action cinema and a definite top five all-time action film (for those keeping track, I would say last year's Raid sequel would also qualify for that status). The movie provided me a font of joy that did not let up until the end credits ushered me out of the theater. The action sequences are epic in their scale, with dozens of different vehicles in hot pursuit, and yet Miller brilliantly orients his audience to every moment of his symphony of demolition. There are so many different parts to the action but the audience knows everything that happens. The sheer sense of momentum and pacing is overwhelming and giddy. The action sequences develop organically, with new consequences throwing our characters into different and dire directions. There's also a startling amount of variety with the action sequences. Fury Road has been described as a two-hour chase film, and that's accurate to a degree, but there are breaks in between the sequences, small moments to catch your breath and learn more about our characters and their hostile world. Each sequence is different enough that the action doesn't ever feel redundant, even when the third act literally requires the characters to backtrack. The adrenaline just doesn't turn off from the get-go, and Miller keeps throwing out new tricks, new stunts, and new cars to astound and amaze. Simply put, Fury Road shames other American film releases. The stuntwork is another facet that just raises the bar when it comes to action movies. Miller emphasized practical effects whenever possible, and the emphasis pay off with a heightened sense of realism onscreen. It's real cars being smashed to real bits, real stuntmen being tossed around. In an age of CGI over saturation, it's all too easy to become numb to big screen spectacle because of how hollow it all comes across visually. Just this past month with the Avengers sequel, I knew that all the fight scenes were mostly CGI or actors against green screens, and it eases off the enjoyment of the moment. Don't even get me started on the deluge of CGI carnage in the last Hobbit film. Real physical objects and physical interaction offer so much more believability in an age of increasing disbelief with special effects. With Miller's focus on practical effects first and foremost, it brings that sense of crazy excitement back and it ensures that Fury Road will hold up better over time. I also appreciated just how much thought Miller and his team put into crafting their world. Every detail feels like it adds to the overall richness of Miller's vision. The designs of the cars, the use of scrap, the fact that a pulley system is operated with children running up giant wheels, it all contributes to making the world better realized and more alive. The level of thought put into weird and deadly concepts in this movie is fantastic. Once the main characters pass through a bog of land, we see people dressed in cloaks traversing the land on stilts, and it's little passing details such as this that make the movie feel more complete. I enjoyed that one of Max's heroic attributes is that he's specified for his blood type, being O the universal donor. The fact that Miller finds a satisfying way to bring this attribute back as a payoff is also appreciated. I also enjoyed how Miller expands upon the family of Immortan Joe, with his bevy of freakish sons and brothers and peculiarities. I enjoyed the fact that Miller isn't afraid to embrace the weird of his dystopia, symbolized best by a blind guitar player attached to a roaming wall of speakers who can shoot flames out of his instrument. Every time the movie cut back to this guitar playing pace setter, I smiled, and I smiled a lot during this movie.Some have grumbled that Max is a supporting player in a movie that bears his name, but I would argue he is a co-lead and the real star is rightfully Imperator Furiosa. Max is not replaced with Furiosa, rather they have an inter-dependant relationship where they're both vulnerable and they both come to trust the other but without a romantic mingling. These are both wounded, shaken, mistrusting, and volatile people, and to watch their shared sense of teamwork and the gradual opening and reliance upon one another, it is itself an affecting and emotionally satisfying relationship. But back to Furiosa, it's really her story because she is the one with the personal connection o the mission. Max has always kind of been a wandering warrior who finds himself in other people's battles. Consider him a post-apocalyptic Man with No Name. Furiosa is the leader who has planned and implemented the escape from Immortan Joe, and it's she that deserves our attention. I enjoyed the fact that Miller doesn't even have to explain her past. We know she's suffered trauma, physical and likely sexual, and he assumes the audience does not need Furiosa's past abuse spelled out specifically for them, or seen in grisly flashback. She's a strong woman who is far from helpless with one arm. This is a story about women liberating themselves from sexual slavery under a corrupt patriarchy (more on the thematic relevance below). Theron is our leader and the ferocity in her eyes is all you need to know you believe that this woman will do whatever it takes for freedom.The other aspect that's very clear is that Fury Road is a decidedly feminist film but it never stoops to preaching or even directly calling attention to its efforts. It's a ruined world where men with unchecked power have exploited the vulnerable, where women are treated as "property" and valued for breeding purposes. Our heroes are by and large women who have rejected their roles in this society or are fleeing their impositions. And with Furiosa as lead, it paints a more than convincing picture of women being just as capable and badass in the post-apocalypse (I want to go as Furiosa for Halloween). It's a movie that portrays women struggling against an unjust system that devalues them but Fury Road doesn't wallow in their suffering. It doesn't have to in order to get its points across. It also treats the wives in a manner that lacks sexualization. Immortan Joe has treated them as property but Miller treats them as human beings, even going as far as to give them distinguished personalities. I'm not saying they approach three-dimensional characters but they're certainly not just eye candy. There's a sequence where they wash each other with a hose, and you could see the myriad ways this moment would go tawdry for some cheap titillation. What the Men's Rights Activists (sadly this is actually a thing) seem to have lost in their caterwauling is that feminism is not a zero-sum game; one person gaining stature and opportunity does not mean it's taken away from another. Just because Furiosa is strong it doesn't make Max weak. Furiosa being a compelling lead character does not diminish Max. It makes him an even better character because he recognizes her value and his own limitations, like a scene where he voluntarily hands over a rifle because he knows she's the better marksman. No one has to explicitly point and say, "Girls can do it too."There's also a fascinating commentary on the danger of religious fundamentalism with the war boys. These powder-white young men are Immortan Joe's armed forces and they are promised a swift appearance at the gates of their paradise if they die in battle ("Witness me!" is their exclamation before sacrifice). They spray paint their faces chrome ("Eternal, shiny and chrome") and then go in for the kamikaze kill. Again, the theme is ripe and obvious but without requiring characters to comment. Nux (Nicholas Hoult, wonderfully deranged and then sincere) actually has the closest thing to a character arc, going from hopeful martyr to independent thinker. He begins as a clumsy yet determined antagonist and becomes a resourceful and unexpected ally. This is practically a flawless film on a technical level. The cinematography by John Seale (Cold Mountain) is bright with lush colors that pop on the big screen. We've been treated to far too many color degraded films, so it's nice to view a movie that wants to use all the colors at its disposal. The musical score by Junkie XL (300: Rise of an Empire) is stirring and pulse-pounding with its heavy percussion, but there's a languid melody that returns again and again that is emotionally resonant. It's surprising how the score will punctuate the bombast and wailing guitars with a lovely string arrangement, like when we rush into the sandstorm and a car is blown into the sky. The editing is outstanding by Margaret Sixel (Happy Feet) and she keeps the audience informed with every new twist and turn, and with so many moving parts and changing dynamics, that is a miracle itself. The production design by Colin Gibson beautifully expands and informs this strange world. There isn't a department in Fury Road that wasn't at the top of their game.If I had to quibble, I could accept the argument that Mad Max: Fury Road lacks the substance to be much more than an exhilarating action ride. The dialogue can be a bit on-the-nose, Hardy mumbles through a majority of his miniscule lines, and the characters aren't as fleshed out as they could be and the plot is rather bare bones. However, I view its narrative economy as a virtue, as there isn't a moment or scene wasted in telling this breakneck tour de force of post-apocalyptic demolition. Rarely does an artist get to work at this level in the studio system let alone succeed with a final product that still manages to be strange, mordant, uncompromising, and completely riveting. This is a near-perfect action movie and a thrilling high-wire act of practical filmmaking bravado. Mad Max: Fury Road is the standard I am going to judge all summer movies by for the rest of the year, and I imagine many will be found wanting. I could continue to heap praise on the movie but the most persuasive stance I can make is that if you fail to see Fury Road on the big screen, you will always regret this decision. I am a disciple of Fury Road and witness my brethren and me. This movie was made for the biggest screen, the loudest sound system, and an endless bucket of popcorn. Nate's Grade: A	2
a4d0f1d3-afb5-4d08-9378-299656f7229c	  The visuals and production of this film are incredibly imaginative. The action sequences are different and fun, and while the story isn't great, it also isn't like many other movies out there. This film's uniqueness sets itself apart from your typical summer action flick.	2
36d9d3c6-97df-4c2e-84e4-1c425b222507	  Max accompanies a woman trying to rescue pregnant concubines from a despotic ruler.While there's no doubt that some of the action sequences are well-choreographed and mildly entertaining, the most important part of a film is its story. This one doesn't get started until about thirty minutes in, and the character development is sloppy, uneven, and unnaturally rushed. For example, we're supposed to believe that the frenetic war boy abandons his blind faith because of one embarrassing maneuver and the fact that he got to stare into a girl's eyes for two minutes. Those must be some eyes.The reason that story is so important, especially in action films, is that the audience must be kept in suspense about how the action sequence will end. Here, there's no doubt about who will survive; the only question is how, which isn't that entertaining.This film's champions shouldn't think that I don't get the gender politics here. I understand that the film puts women in positions of power, that it stands against sex slavery, and that its depiction of women is more progressive than many other films in the genre. That's all great and the reason why the film got one star instead of a half.Overall, this story is weak, and all the chase sequences in the world can't rescue a weak story.	0
59d27a0d-c3e2-4143-9663-c457430278aa	  Considering the wave of terrible 90's Scifi sequels/remakes we've had fired our way in the past few years (Terminator, Robocop, Total Recall etc.) Fury Road's success has been more than a pleasant surprise.It takes a lot of very 80's dystopian post-apocalyptic sensibilities and puts it in modern context. The relevant storytelling, characterization and heavy play on social themes make it a compelling tale but it's the barebones, relentlessly unforgiving visuals that make it a thrilling ride through and through.There's more to the world of Mad Max than sand dunes and angry people with automobiles though, with very little screen time Miller manages to convey a very elaborate society full of warrior tribes, caste systems and cultural/religious customs that are intriguing if not visually iconic.Let's also not forget the cast of characters representing a variety of minorities without feeling like forced tokens. A phenomenal performance by Charlize Theron breathes badassery into Furiosa and the manic Nux played by Hoult! It seems the best way to bring back the "strong silent type" hero is to in fact keep him silent. (who would've guessed?) Hardy skims by as Max with stern looks, grunts and single syllable words and for that we love him.At the end of the day Fury Road is both a nonsensical, visceral action packed adventure about a bunch of rebels fighting the system but also an intelligent character study with a dab of social commentary. Some of these folks are larger than life (Max) others victims/villains turned heroes (Furiosa, Breeders, Nux) which ever you appreciate more you're both cheering and enamored by the spectacle.	2
2230b950-fd5d-4372-9eca-ac0efe232650	  Over thirty years since the last instalment in the "Mad Max" franchise, Tom Hardy takes over the leading role once helmed by Mel Gibson, and takes the character to unseen heights. George Miller definitely waited for the perfect time to release this picture, coming out in an age where every action film relies on CGI. Displaying a perfect balance of practical and CG effects, the action pieces in this film are breathtaking to behold. Everyone in this film gives it their all, injecting fuel into this franchise that was believed to be dead long ago. The two main questions people will ask about this picture is does it live up to the original trilogy and will it welcome newcomers. I will say that you do not have to view the original films in order to know what is going on here, but it definitely will not attract people who have no clue what they are in for. "Mad Max: Fury Road" is a breathtaking spectacle (better than any I have seen in a long time), but it was a little too short on characters to really care about EVERYTHING that was going down. By the end of this film, I realized that it definitely was spectacle over substance, but the spectacle was so incredible that it will almost overshadow the bad upon every single viewing. In the end, I will say something that I have never said about any movie. It is a flawless film with many issues. My brain was going nuts during my viewing of this film, and I loved that. If you are planning on seeing this, please do so in the theatre, it is worth it. "Mad Max: Fury Road" is awesome!	2
5007a0bd-856b-4190-a9a1-572ebe123300	  Impressive action pretty much throughout, but I left the theatre pretty "mehhh" overall. For every awesome thing I can think of, there's three other weird things I can tell you about the movie. From what I hear, fans of the originals may get a lot more out of this one than people new to the franchise will......	2
7a9519ac-888a-4601-b67d-48d329b07686	  George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road holds no bounds in its trek across the desert landscape. "What a lovely day."Littered with little character buildup and a paper thin plot-line, the 2 hour adventure goes off-road with tons of vehicle carnage. There are enough story details, as needed, but ultimately, it's all there to setup the next incident on "fury road."The violence is erratic, over the top, and highly entertaining. A good combination of CG, as well as real vehicle demolishings come as advertised. There is so much going on, the film manages to leave the want for even more.Tom Hardy is a man of few words, it is no wonder the film belongs to Charlize Theron with Nicholas Hoult following in her footsteps. Seriously, the film could have been called Furiosa road.There's no secret here. Mad Max: Fury Road delivers what is expected of it.	2
cc3f59ce-34b7-4c00-a960-d9bdb1a53d1e	  A visual treat from start to finish! The costumes, the stunts, the action...every scene just bursts with vitality. Not to forget the sound...wow!! This is what the cinema is made for! Great to have this franchise back on our screens but it could've just done with being 15 minutes shorter.	2
1ce959db-34d0-4e65-8371-3be5b0371982	  Good heavens, this was awful. No plot, no character development, no point. Nothing but a pair of long chase scenes. Just hideous.	0
79f7401b-578f-40b5-9999-c8df3e4133e7	  An exciting, nonstop, thrilling story from beginning to end.	2
ea436c51-4607-4484-b41d-60a640906747	  Let me preface this by saying I'm not a fan of Mad Max. I was bored in Mad Max and was almost bored in The Road Warrior.I was underwhelmed. I heard all of the hype about how Mad Max: Fury Road was one of the greatest movies ever made and how it's a cinematic masterpiece. About how it gives you a rush and sometimes you need a break just to slow your heartbeat. I honestly don't get it.Maybe the hype behind the movie is what I see when I see Fury Road. What I see when I watch Fury Road is something that is just all spectacle. Is the action good to look at. You're damn right it is. The car carnage of the wasteland is incredible to look at. There's a guy with a flamethrower guitar! But that's not what I want to stand out the most when I see a movie.The main thing I look for when I'm watching a movie like this a a combination of exciting and engaging action, as well as a good story. This movie lacks the story part because it is too simple. There is not a lot about the wasteland and it's inhabitants that makes me interested about them. How did Furiosa get that arm? How did Imorton Joe rise to power? Who were those people that Max was haunted by? Who were those people on the sticks? There is no context given so I'm not interested and do not care. Is Furiosa a badass? Yes! But as cool as that is I don't care about her because I know so little.In summation Mad Max: Fury Road is all spectacle and nice to look at, but really nothing else.	1
37c648c6-5949-45d5-af46-ee519a11de86	  Post-modern feminism in the post-apocalypse. Good, but not great. Would have rated worse, were it not for some cool vehicles. A bit of a disappointment.	1

48709049-d721-4ff0-b2b0-c566eb8f1799	  Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best action films I've ever seen. A genuine work of art, it might by one of the top 3 contenders at the Oscars for Best Picture! It also DEFINITELY deserves to get recognition for it's use of vfx.	2
7867b544-8cec-4300-a219-f4a43b8648e8	  I'm not ready to hail it as the masterpiece that everyone else is calling it, but Mad Max: Fury Road is still a hell of a film. Needless to say the action is awesome, but the performances are fantastic and work hand in hand with the narrative and themes, and Charlize Theron as Furiosa is a triumph of a character.	2

4b5e808d-f775-4cb3-ab1f-4dae54441850	  The post-apocalyptic film can be hit or miss, but Mad Max: Fury Road has some of the best action and chase scenes put on film in the 21st century. Tom Hardy is a breakthrough action star to go along with his recent success as a dramatic actor. He's going to win an Oscar at some point. George Miller writes and directs this film as well as anyone, even at 70. I love it when women overshadow men in the action scenes!	2

924f9bc3-8665-492d-95ee-93fb5df9b1ea	  Great movie and I loved the fact that traditional methods of special effects were used, like with the new star wars movie, but I felt that it doesn't totally live up to the hype that most people give it. It's great, but not the best.	2
a95423d0-e723-4d95-89b2-b2d118a6822b	  Just when I thought the action movie genre really couldn't do anything else new and different, this proves me entirely wrong. Intense Action, distinctive style, and a concrete story make this a worthy installment in the Mad Max series	2

f640763e-d397-4693-98f9-f94d28c42229	  Two hours of insanity. Miller proves he is the king of gonzo high-profile action movies and a towering cinematic genius.	2
995017e8-f1a6-4124-abaf-2128b0995c00	  Mad Max: Fury Road improves upon its predecessors with a fourth round of breathtaking action. Writer-director George Miller finds himself at his peak bringing back to life the Road Warrior with a whole new cast that delivers some of the brightest performances of the year: Hardy was great, but it is Theron that owns the show with her iconic Furiosa that shall be reminded as of the most compelling contemporary heroins.	2
d0152e34-72b4-4b1d-bdda-585673f2aeac	  Fantastic action movie!!!! Spoiled ALL other actions movies for me. I've seen it twice in the theater and once at home. STILL LOVE IT!!!!!	2
de46568b-5048-4f70-b812-473828d82392	  i cant get enough of this movie. I pretty much think overall todays movies are garbage (they dont make em the way they used to), but this movie punches you in the face & doesnt let up. Thank you George for making a great piece of exciting entertainment	2
49456ddd-d3a4-4260-ae7d-3c059ee49e72	  A surprisingly worthy sequel to the original series. The director captured the ambiance of the desolate Mad Max universe through excellent photography and music. The action scenes are very good but I am saturated by the genre.	2
c78ccfee-46ae-4336-8046-16c9b712d805	  Mad Max: Fury Road is the best movie of 2015 hands down. It's one of those movies that gets better and better after each viewing, and it's the perfect example of how to do an action movie.	2
f4b9b19e-2cee-4f8c-9c00-4e12ecc062cb	  So, to preface, I have never seen a Mad Max movie. And everyone was telling me that I have to watch this, I would love it so on and so forth. And I'll be honest, in the first 15 minutes, I had no clue what I had gotten myself into. It was a little overwhelming. The types of movies that just throw you into a world with no explanation always throw me for a minute. But, what I will say is that once I'm in, I am sucked in 100%. And this I was sucked in 1000%. What is this society? Why is almost everyone from it sick? How did Furiosa become the only woman in power? Why is there a flame throwing guitar? Now, these are all questions that are still swirling around my brain, but in the moment, I could have cared less. I was simply along for the ride. The visuals are absolutely stunning (that sandstorm at the beginning. Holy hell.) The acting from the main characters is on point. (Charlize Theron is my queen.) The chase scene in the last half hour had me incredibly stressed out in the best way possible. The storyline was deeper than a typical action movie. I could honestly keep going. I would love to watch this again, now that I understand everything, and just dive in and go along for the ride.	2

0cb7c4f2-d7de-4d1c-94b7-a356a7725be3	  One of my favorite movies of this year, and possibly of all time!!! This movie was stylistically and visually beautiful. There was some really great world-building in this movie, and I love the subtly incorporated Viking/Nordic cultural influences in the Mad Max post-apocalyptic universe. I actually wasn't a huge fan of Tom Hardy, and likewise was also not blown away by Charlize Theron or any of the other acting in this movie. However, this movie was so beautiful, I couldn't resist giving this movie a resounding 5/5 stars!	2
4385dde4-8132-41eb-9fe9-50404e88b75c	  I found this movie to be incomprehensible and stupid - rescued to the two star level only by its stunning art design.Supposedly this is some "post apocalyptic" world we're in, but there is no back story presented to create any context for the characters or their motivations. Mad Max gets kidnapped and strapped to the front of a vehicle, and we watch cars blow each other up. There's not that much more going on - until maybe 60% into the movie when the Charlize Theron character explains she's trying to get back home - and eventually needs to return to where the movie started.There are bizarre kings and crazed punks and a few siren slaves whose presence appears, again with little context. People spray themselves with paint, one truck has a wonderful rock guitarist strapped to the front, whose axe shoots flames out of its neck. And this goes on for two and a quarter hours.However, the way the visuals are conceived is stunning. The home city has mammoth levels strung on hyper-industrial styled gears, with muscular percussionists pounding out something - for some reason. It looks cool. But to no intelligent end.	0

414ff708-f747-4e2e-ab34-ddcc564979dc	  As far as action films go, this is hands down one of the best of all time in my book. Nothing can amount to the fast-paced action. And for today's standards, with so many companies relying on cgi stuff, it is amazing to see a director/film finally taking the bold step to make an action film the good ole fashioned way, with real stunts and actors. George Miller really knocked this one out of the park. Not to mention a great performance by Hardy & Theron.	2
ce18601a-f8be-457d-9799-e1afcafeb3ae	  Just an excuse for a video game. Turned it off.	0
b02a7996-2b1d-4c53-b0f8-bbde53afe762	  In an era where action movies rely heavily on CGI, it's refreshing to see a movie like Mad Max. The film is a great combination of story, character development, stunts and action that's over the top in just the perfect amount.	2
bc9ccdc4-a5e3-44af-8f20-fefd5c6c18b2	  Boring. Mindless. All that running across the desert for no reason. Shallow, meaningless characters. Weird, stupid setup. Nothing believable or fun here.	0
fc5020da-c2c2-4559-8a25-60289c1dca54	  Artsie fartsie , whacked out crap. No wonder it was nominated for Best Picture the Academy is as whacked as this movie. Some films you just don't remake. Run far away from this !	0
af8827d5-5983-4517-88d3-2a6c2172beaa	  Better than the original with Mel Gibson and with an array of powerful female characters, this is a great action movie but should not have been a Best Movie nominee.	1

78629485-029a-4e26-8ab3-8c11b16f1ea4	  Mad Max: Fury Road is a continuation of the previous Mad Maxes and I thought this was pretty darn good. Watching this Mad Max you're sitting there going like, what am I witnessing? If you have never seen a Mad Max before that will be your reaction. Everything about the Mad Max universe is so different and special Bringing back Miller was the by far the best decision.Without him this movie would not have been anything close to what is was. Miller makes the movie feel like an original Mad Max film. From the weird skull guys, bad ass cars, and post apocalyptic wasteland, A great thing about Mad Max are the characters. Charlize Theron plays Furiosa, a girl who has stolen precious cargo from main villain, Immortan Joe, that all of his followers are after. Charlize Theron as Furiosa was the highlight of the movie. She is the most interesting and most impactful than any other character on screen. Fury Road is the ultimate thrill ride and definition of a good action movie. The action sequences and visual effects are so beautiful and amazing. Every shot is as real as it gets and looks spectacular. Definitely one of the best looking films of the year. The movie is so alive and bright that it makes it hard to keep your eyes off the screen because you don't want to miss anything. My biggest flaw in Mad Max is sadly Tom Hardy's portrayal of Max. I didn't feel his performance was strong enough or energetic like the character should be. But I overall I loved Fury Road. It's action scenes were amazing, awesome characters, and extremely well directed. Should be a fun watch for any Mad Max or action movie fan.	2
4b44c9a9-39e1-464c-814c-d2cd2ca5e8cc	  ish. no character build up so you even give a second thought to these people. not even close to the first mad max movie.	0

0c92f425-945a-4ec6-a1e0-2812bd7e1645	  Mad Max is the newest masterpiece in the infamous Mad Max movie franchise by George Miller, who returns after 30 years to direct this movie.Evey now and then, we have certain movies that become milestones for how great an action film can be. 1981: Raiders of the Lost Ark. 1988: Die Hard1991: Terminator 2: Judgemtn Day. 1999: The Matrix. 2008: The Dark Knight.and 2015, MAD, MAX, FURY ROAD!This movie is absolutely incredible! It is unbelievable, it is riveting, it is beautifully chaotic and desructive, and it is without question the best action movie of the decade. No other movie the past 6 years comes close to this masterpiece in terms of practical effects, stunt work, visual effects, sound editing, cinematography, directing and minimalistic, yet effective storytelling and qorld-building. Everything you need to know about its characters is told through actions, and decisions over heavy handed exposition. The pacing is something out of this world, being so extremely super crazy, yet so super awesome at the same time. While the story is nothing complez, it is still there, and serves its purpose rightfully without any forced scenery or visual pleasure.	2
9175de5d-5ab9-4ca0-a59d-146175ba68b0	  Horrifically gorgeous and beyond phenomenal, Mad Max: Fury Road's incredible aspects makes 2015 a year of success for cinematic experiences.	2

The movie was extremely monotonous, had little to no story, and I truly felt dumber for having watched it.... I liked the original Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome, not so much, but it was still head and shoulders above this one.... It is visually amazing, no question. But there was no story and dialog was barely above grunting...	0
db3a4beb-6eb4-4ff1-a678-c03085bf6a78	  I really had no desire to see this movie at first because I actually never saw a Mad Max film. But when I saw the trailers, I was blown away and I immediately became intrigued. Looking at the visuals and the action, this looks like everything I want to see in an action movie. After watching this film, I felt ashamed that I never saw a Mad Max film because Fury Road is AWESOME! It is such an adrenaline-filled rush that I feel like taking a nap after watching it. The entire movie is like one big chase. At first, I didn't think that much about it. I saw it as just a fun, heart-pumping thrill ride. I didn't think it had much story and not enough exposition for me to understand the characters. I thought because maybe it was part of a franchise and I didn't see the other films. But after multiple viewings, I saw that it was telling their story the whole time. It was all told through a visual medium. It's a film that doesn't contain much dialogue, so you need to follow the story through its visuals. Because of this, you can immediately understand the characters and the world they live in. The film also has a surprising amount of feeling and emotion. This helps us feel for the characters and adds a sense of humanity to the film. I say that the only people who wouldn't like the film are those who can't handle this kind of action or for those who have never seen a Mad Max film. But even some people who have never seen a Mad Max movie, like me, can still find a lot of enjoyment in it. I know I did. Mad Max: Fury Road was some of the most fun I've had all year and I'm sure it will please all fans of the franchise.	2
ea754575-6d88-499e-8d26-98419365c1db	  Excellent writing, great acting, a wacky and playful tone, amazing visuals. For what this film is (An Action-Adventure Post-Apocalypse Car-Chase film) Mad Max is perfect.	2
97703ee2-fd52-40b0-8118-0698683979d8	  Brilliant addition to the classic franchise that both manages to reboot with a new lead actor while continue the excellent story. Tom Hardy fills in for Max perfectly, rightly playing him as a man of few words but with a dark past. While some complained that is really more of Furiosa's story (wonderfully played by Charlize Theron), they forget Max is essentially the mysterious stranger who shows up to reluctantly save the day in each film since "The Road Warrior" (still the best of the franchise). The rest of the cast is also excellent, particularly Hugh Keays-Byrne as the villainous Imortan Joe. Behind the camera, George Miller crafts a brutal yet beautiful vision of the apocalypse like the never seen. The action sequences are breathtaking, made more so than they were done by real stunt people, and crafts a original world complete with its own religion ("Witness Me!" has fast become a popular sci-fi phrase) vehicles & costumes (Joe is a monstrous sight). Not just one of the best action movies in years but the best film of 2015.	2

ca9720cf-4df4-4e12-878f-60aa624b7df4	  Although its won audiences and critics alike the world over, this is not the definitive Mad Max film. A likeable cast heads a dystopian piece packed full of beautiful cinematics and jaw clenching action sequences. Yet despite this I left the film feeling a lack of awe and inspiration. This is in part due to the tiresome plot which acts as a prophetic odyssey but instead frames as a consistent action pursuit romp. Although played by the talented Hardy I found the titular lead underwhelming and underdeveloped. I feel this had less to do with Hardy's performative efforts and more to do with the characterisation in the script and plot. This may be in part a nostalgic attempt by Miller to homage its previous incarnation or an unfortunate side-effect from the emphasis on Theron's Furiosa. Whatever the reason, I find the underwhelming nature of such an original and iconoclast character to be a great departure from Gibson's lunatic apocalypse cop and as such the major downfall of the piece. Whilst certainly a good movie, one can't help thinking its not deserving of the multitudes of praise which it is being given	2

Also, for once in a long time, the hero in the movie is a woman, which automatically adds a different effect and meaning to the story, but it also makes it 100% better.	2

You cant help but noticing of the originality in this post apocalyptic world. It was so in depth that it reminds me of Tolkien. That's saying a lot. I mean seriously, he would write short novels about a stupid sword. I LOVED every aspect of this movie and hope George Miller has more to come!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2

9da9c354-9bdc-4518-822d-079ce796175e	  George Miller's Fury Road is full of car chases...in fact the whole film is a hyper presentation of the Mad Max world. Miller started out actually dealing with editing and the vehicle chases in the earlier Mad Max movies. This film is sped up literally in order to keep the pace and you definitely lose a sense of rational. It is a chase to be remembered with wild special effects. Tom Hardy is passable as Mad Max although he could be any man fighting his way through a dystopian society. Charlize Theron added her touch to her heroine of the piece with a relish that would make Sigourney Weaver in Aliens proud. Yet I kept on saying that this film is nominated against films like Spotlight and The Revenant. It certainly is well made though I do not think it warrants the nominations. I loved George Miller's eye for detail; he hired a mega team to handle it all. And its focus for detail showed up in earlier films. My favorite would be Babe; a story about a pig's life. Yet this picture is beyond Cecil B. DeMille and borders on a Pink Floyd' The Wall approach. You know there's a good guy, people to be saved, and the bad guys. And you work your way to the end. Afterwards you feel assaulted (the theatre had the volume turned on super high) and left breathless. It is a roller coaster ride of a movie. Yet I left the theatre not knowing or caring much for the characters. i wanted to explore Max's psyche further; he was no more than a persona much like Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name. In the age of video games, you would hope that detail would not be lost. In this case you will lose yourself in the design of the movie. Fantastic special effects and makeup are present. You can't help but admire the technical artistry. You just hope there would be more heart lurking somewhere in such a technical achievement.	1

I don't think it's that great and was not as good as i expect. I like it a little bit but that's because of tom hardy, There was no plot, Just explosions and best screening effects, There was not much acting. Part 1 of this movie i feel like leaving the movie theatre because it's just copying insurgent but i have seen 2 walk out. My Legs were shaking and shocked about seeing this movie. I thought the rest of the movie would be horrible and just makes me wanna give up on the rotten tomatoes website. let's just focus on the positive things, There are 3. What I heard is this was stunning and indeed a courage of dismandable filmmaking. Let me just tell you a few.The Plot Gone Horribly wrong, The Story is all about action and the acting was really really good!My Score Opinion: 67/100	2
a09f226c-be4e-4f5c-a2ba-0ee06bc3cddb	  This film looks great. It should win a few of the lesser oscars due to how it looks on our screens. The story is basic, the cast are not challenged to put in a good performance but this is still a very enjoyable film.	2
a0da8480-8573-4092-9f24-fcc2de7a733e	  It's a highly stylized, action packed, bloody, gory, over-the-top film that probably appeals to the majority of 18 to 30-year-olds who've spent a lot of time playing equally bloody video games. The story is pretty basic: women escape from hell looking for liberty and life, only to return after killing the evil ruler and his main henchmen to start anew. Oh, and the top babe almost, I said almost (remember now this is the apocalyptic future; no time for hope here) has feelings for her accidental saviour. Ah, what a romance. With many of the horrific, destructive fight scenes fought at such an exaggerated, frantic pace, it's a surprise all involved don't merely die from heart attacks. But you get a general idea what the film is going for when the bossman's babe is dead, and he has one of his henchmen cut the dead mom open only to see if his baby is alive, and upon finding that he is dead (I almost had a baby brother! I almost had a baby brother!) he is tossed aside like so much dead meat. At times the antics of the death squad is so silly its almost comical, such as when they spray their teeth with chrome, an allusion to the love for the shiny vehicles they worship as they hope for a battle death to take them via glory to Valhalla. An often silly, even unnecessarily abusive film to convey a story of little import that means little to most, that is unless you're an aspiring death squad recruit looking to take out the boss man to glory and victory. Spray! Spray!	1

e2a86251-9a5f-47b9-bce2-25822d46c8a9	  My anticipation was high. Academy Award nomination for best picture. Almost 100% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. Over 80% on IMDB. Charlize Theron. Great reviews. But this is where the fun stops.What a dud it was, despite all the action. Story? "A woman rebels against a tyrannical ruler in post apocalyptic Australia in search for her homeland with the help of a group of female prisoners, a psychotic worshiper(sic), and a drifter named Max."I guess if you have great memories of the original movie or if you have a thing for George Miller, this was the greatest thing ever --especially in super duper 3d. To me, it was a never-ending car chase from point A to B and then back to A, filled with fighting scenes, flat characters, supermodels turned wannabe-actresses and an almost mute protagonist. What else did I expect from a schizophrenic writer/director who not only created the Mad Max franchise nearly forty years ago, but whose last three writing and directing credits are Babe: Pig In The City and Happy Feet 1 & 2?I guess I expected too much. Even with so much garbage polluting the big screen these days, this one didn't rise above most of the big budget muck that we get to 'enjoy' as entertainment. I'm not even going to waste more words on this one. Sorry, I didn't get it. Shame it made almost half a billion dollars at the box office. There will surely be more of the same this year or the next.Pros: lots of hypeCons: everything elseVerdict: avoid	0
ceda2c37-d725-4a92-993f-f524f8f1bf01	  Although quite grotesque in it's style and imagery - something I rarely like - in cinematographic and storytelling terms, it's highly refined.I did not like it at first, the introduction fell flat with me, some scenes felt sped-up and it was just weird. I also felt that the world felt absurd and comic-y, and indeed it is. The film does not shy away from this fact, it actually embraces it.The characters felt real and their motivations felt real enough for me to eventually be drawn in, despite the absurdity of the setting.And this, I can respect.Yes, it had some gruesome scenes of violence, but it didn't focus on them.This was my first Mad Max film, I assume the flashbacks/hallucinations somehow connect to the previous films. Happily, they weren't overused and the plot didn't hinge entirely upon them, so even a newb like me can enjoy this film.	2
fb0bbc16-63d7-4d48-977d-9ec625025190	  Fury Road illustrates how far the Mad Max story has evolved or devolved as this viewer would attest. Upstream, the first Mad Max was a unique & exhilarating dystopian nightmare of a semi-horrific road rage film encapsulating the raw brutishness of the Australian collective consciousness of the 1970s. Remember it wasn't made that long after Aboriginal First nations peoples gained the right to vote. And then truck engine sized cars roamed the Aussie roads where roadside eucalyptus trees had big American copies of GM and Ford cars wrapped around the trees making them look like tinsel on Aussie Christmas trees set in the blinding heat and dust of the outback. One could be forgiven for feeling like being in A George Miller film even outside the cinema in the Australian reality of the time. Fury Road has a Jerry Bruckheimer-ish feel to it with Australian models who act like a gang of bangers from Zoolander walking down the catwalk with David Bowie wincing at their garish Derelict Ozzie-style clothing. But the film has somehow captured an audience who seeks solace in a cinema from the ever-present real thrills and spills of the dominant paradigm of daily worldwide terrorism events.	0

073bcf33-0871-4b08-af30-698bf9c4de92	  Another sign the Apocalypse has (literally) descended upon the Motion Picture Academy: Mad Max: Fury Road gets 10 Oscar nominations, including a Best Picture. I'm sorry but did they see the same film I did?! It was Fast and Furious in fright wigs and KISS makeup! And the only acting was Charlize Theron with one arm and a shaved head snarling at everybody. Of all the great films to come out of Australia over the last 40 years and they pick this?!! With profound apologies to Trumbo, Steve Jobs, The Danish Girl and especially Straight Out of Compton, this is just piss poor entertainment politics. (Come back "Doomsday" all is forgiven!)	0

72d7ed39-4ff6-4b0c-a2d2-04a8d359abe5	  I was one of the many that has never seen a Mad Max film, so I wasn't expecting much. I was blown away in that regard! Max Max is insanity on the silver screen; chaotic when there is action going on and surprisingly quiet and peaceful in lulls. The pacing is excellent.Tom Hardy plays Max, a man of little words but many actions. He was captured by Imperator Joe and his War boys, and enslaved to them, forced to give his blood to keep the sick war boys alive and make them stronger.While Hardy is the leading name, I feel that the two best performances were actually by Charlize Theron as the fierce Imperator Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult as Nux, the endearingly reverent War boy. Despite the performances, Miller's vision is by far what makes the film a rousing success.Mad Max is white-knuckle excitement at its highest octane, and I would be hard pressed to deny that I had so much fun watching it.	2
4b03a727-b67b-4cb6-a32c-581d802f9b32	  The best film of 2015 and maybe of the decade so far.	2
74bca9ff-c69d-4ce6-89f5-d8443813f60a	  Absolutely nuts and a visual and auditory spectacle. Anyone who saw a trailer for this movie got an idea of what they were in for when coming in to see Mad Max: Fury Road. Few viewers besides the most ardent of fans will remember or perhaps even alive when the last film came out three decades ago, but Fury Road will surely push them to dig up that one and retrace the history of the series.Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron both are fantastic, and the action scenes are fun and exciting to watch. However, any attempt to fully describe the experience of watching Mad Max is in for an impossible task. Just watch it.In my first viewing, while I had some appreciation for the emotional heart of the film, it didn't hit as hard for me as it apparently did for others. However, after giving it another go, I came to grasp the heart and the message. One of the most entertaining watches in a while...*guitar riff*.	2

14593933-2115-4588-bb10-88f24e1c30e1	  Shockingly bad- particularly considering the attention it's getting. The characters are thin and barely have a believable moment. The acting is good for the most part- it's the writing, the dialogue, and ultimately the directing. The story arc is simple- not necessarily a bad thing in an action movie- but the actions of virtually every character is so far off the believability track it quickly becomes a jumbled mess. The director was more obviously more interested in creating a visually stunning string of intense scenes than a good story. Should have been cut down to a seven minute music video.	0
031c337b-e1dc-480e-af6a-45e810b3bd7f	  Not exactly my full cup of tea, but not a bad film. Is it deserving of an Oscar nomination over others, I don't think so. However, George Miller does a great job with special effects and action scenes. Tom Hardy is not bad, but Theron is the star of the film. Very well done...but not my favorite movie of 2015.	2
bdb7498e-62ab-4b91-9269-f250cec1c7e2	  Rating this movie is hard for me because I completely don't get the whole Mad Max thing. I tried with the older movies since they were highly reviewed and was bored with them and tried the updated version after having it in my queue \ for two months and was bored with it too. Yes the visuals are fantastic, Charlize Theron is fantastic of course, but I just couldn't get past how shallow and silly the whole premise of it all is. Sure, there are some ironies there and as a popcorn flick for the masses it is not exactly difficult to follow. I just can't do it and despite the manic action sequences I was bored and as soon as they said they were going all the way BACK to where they started I was out. I simply do not have the patience to go through all of that nonsense in reverse and could care less how it ended. I rate the story at like maybe a half star but gave it 3 because Charlize's screen presence mixed with the high budget style and CGI is worthwhile just to look at despite the story line. I can't forget to mention Nicholas Hoult, who has officially sealed his title as World's Most Endearing Zombie.	1

3236667f-0238-4eac-afd0-fc01c4fdefbb	  An action masterpiece through and through, it's plain and simple! Since the days of 'Die Hard' and 'Terminator', the action genre has turned into a repetitive, over-the-top array of films trying too hard to create entertaining sequences that instead look too cheesy due to bad composition or an overuse of CGI, of course along the way we have had some fine exceptions in the style of 'Casino Royale' and 'The Dark Knight', but certain directors *cough* Michael Bay... don't seem to be able to use their knowledge of an action sequence to its full potential and instead have constant fiery explosions and over-the-top shaky camerawork among other things... oh but then there's 'Mad Max: Fury Road', talk about epic action pieces. It has been 30 years since the release of 'Beyond Thunderdome' back in 1985, and George Miller decided to return to the directorial chair for a Mad Max reboot, and my God, he truly is a mastermind of action. After creating the epic scale of an action film in the form of 'Mad Max: The Road Warrior' it was going to be hard to live up to the previous films in the franchise, but Miller didn't just do that, he excelled at it and instead beat his previous films. With Tom Hardy as the new face of Max and Namibia as the new backdrop for post-apocalyptic Australia, 'Fury Road' is an exhilarating action fest that goes beyond its boundaries in creating what might just be one of the greatest action films ever made. Hearing that nearly 90% of the stunts and effects were practical literally blew me away, the sequences are extravagant and complex with frequent fireballs and car crashes filling the screen. George Miller's 2015 vigorous tale blends emotion and brutality with drama and action to reignite Australia's greatest film franchise and create the epitome of the action genre.	2

6899798a-8ff6-49de-9a06-f33a05cc0682	  Madness. If this were a hokey movie blog that chose to describe movies in a single word, that is the word I would use to describe this one. When you walk into a movie in 2015 and it grabs you by the exhaust pipe and makes you squeal, you say it is madness. I'm not a world traveller, I'm not a centenarian and I don't drive a cab in New York City. I don't feel or claim to have 'seen it all.' I don't even want to 'see it all.' But in 2015, moviegoers as a breed do have that mentality about them. There is a chip on the shoulder of the undulating masses who put on their jazzy showtime boots and rip a ticket to a flick, shovelling chemical kissed corn fluffs into their mouths on a Friday night. 'Horror? Seen it. Tragedy? Seen it. Comedy? Thriller? Western? Romance? Action? Hell, I've seen plenty of action! I've seen action films you've never even heard about', they might say. And woe to the ever optimistic purveyor of fine action cinema. For he knows not the battle that he is embroiled in is a battle that has already been fought, and lost, before the first frame is even considered. Because the very audience he is so eager to please, with their noses high and their postures erect, have already made their minds up. And who can blame them? For truly they have 'seen it all.' But they haven't seen this. Mad Max: Fury Road is a cinematic revelation. And with its fist clenched tight, it will take great pride in walloping your senses with a kaleidoscopic triptych of master crafts: sight, sound and touch. Not touch in the literal sense perhaps. There won't be any oily chrome under your ass or Outback gravel under your feet (unless you have found the coolest theatre in the world). But the film is so full and so thick with ideas and invention, and pulls it off in such grand fashion, that damned if you won't feel grit between your teeth or wind in your hair as a dozen roaring, manslaughtering vehicles cascade in a symphony of chaotic road rage from stage left to stage right and back again. You will certainly feel the effects of the Australian desert in the dryness of your mouth halfway through the film, when you realize that your mouth has been agape for a solid hour. Because this film, this madness, doesn't ease in. It starts fast and heavy. It starts in bleak conditions and future foreign saturation. It starts this way before you've had time to finish reading that text from your mammy and continues on in this way, with little respite, for two solid hours, until the final battle of petrol and honour commences. Do we lament the lack of dialogue? We don't. Shakespeare, this is not. Flowery, overly descriptive wordplay curling round itself, fighting for attention, for itself and for its creator (not unlike the words you have before you now) would serve only to get in the way of the reason for the (killing) season. This is evidenced in the few blocks of dialogue we are, frankly, hampered with and their awkward placement within the story and equally awkward delivery by the otherwise capable acting talent on roster. But how much exposition do you need? It's all right there in front you. Vehicles, war machines, kitty grinders, good guys, bad guys, damsels in distress, blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts (except, possibly, for the last two). Is there a message beneath the motor oil? There is. And depending on who it is you are and what it is you're looking for, it is perhaps an environmental one. Or a sociopolitical one. Or a feminist one. Or a pre-apocalyptic one. Or even a familial one. Enjoy the one you have. It's the only one you've got. So this, it seems, is something worth seeing. This is for you, moviegoer, you who have seen it all. This is special. And it has a special effect. One beyond the 1,500 some odd special effects shots in the film. Shots which, according to legend, were achieved 90% practically and therefore only 10% digitally (which is astounding when you see them in action). Shots which sported a sea of extras. Extras which sported among their ranks talents as impressive as Olympic athletes and Cirque Du Soleil performers. No, the special effect of which I speak is that rare beast that, if you're lucky, you can experience once in the bluest of moons on the biggest of screens and in three dimensions if you feel so tickled (though that third dimension isn't necessarily a necessity). We call this effect 'pure cinema.' I call it madness.	2
3b6961e1-445b-4d39-84f3-403fa8267bd1	  Quite a shock when I saw the super high rating for this movie. Yes, there were spectacular locations and outstanding chase scenes, but that's it. Bacially, the movie was just one continuous chase scene w/a explosion fest thrown in for good measure. What's missing? Well, a damn story for starters. Very weak at best, with so little character development it left gaping holes in the whole escape from the tyrannical bad man scenario.Another glaring omission, was no Australian actors! This apocalyptic world of Mad Max is suppose to be in Australia. I guess the Casting Director went out for drink when these actors were chosen. Bad idea. All American accents, and NO Aussies. Maybe for this flick, it didn't make much difference as there is so little dialog between actors and their weak-ass story. Non-stop chase scenes w/gratuitous killing gets a bit stale w/o a decent story to fill-in. Under The Thunderdome quality it ain't there by a long shot. BTW, I am a BIG Mad Max fan, but this re-boot misses the mark for me.	1
a802ede0-4134-4fa3-b580-9e44e554bbae	  Cant believe this is up for Best Picture on several contests, including oscar. Visually spectacular. But soon could not tell who was shooting and killing who. But then, it really didn't matter, as long as someone was shooting and killing someone.	1
76e9903a-7ddf-41d4-b93c-ad099176488b	  WHAT A LOVELY DAY, INDEED. this movie is everything the trailers made it look like it would be - a totally insane thrill ride roller coaster of a film from start to end.The film opens with revving car engines, the perfect prelude to the smashing, racing, crashing action you're about to see. The casting is pretty awesomely perfect, and Tom Hardy's demeanor fulls up the pages of script he doesn't talk through.A few big takeaways: obviously, the action and stunts were breathtaking. If there's a film out there that makes a better case for practical stunts and effects, I haven't seen it. Everything in this movie is based around real explosions, real crashes, and the interaction with the physical environment, therefore you end up with an incredible scale of thought and detail put into the reasons for everything and some pretty amazing visuals to accompany the story. Another thing is the extreme visualism with which George Miller has brought back to Mad Max is absolutely stunning; it creates amazing editing and action that is so in your face but at the same time easy to follow and understand. Finally, the soundtrack almost never leaves and, while loud and crazy, sets its paces and sticks with the action incredibly well. The movie is even self-aware about it's music, pairing it with a specific vehicle in the film that forces the viewer to be reminded about the music playing and brings it to light constantly, but not so much as to distract.As with most, there's also an incredible feminism empowerment plotline to the story that shines, but doesn't feel forced. There's just strong and powerful female characters that kick all the ass, straight and simple. There's no reason why or why not, and that's what all movies and filmmakers should take as a huge lesson from Fury Road.Definitely make a point to get to the theater for this one - a small screen will GUARANTEED not do the action justice. I'll be seeing it in IMAX next week, which I would also recommend.	2

2177b930-aca5-4039-bb4b-dd581ca7b582	  Holland may not be as striking of a hero as Gibson, but he carries the film with the help of other memorable characters. The movie winds up feeling like one long chase, which does get tiring eventually, but the action is grand and things get rough. Fury Road is a fun time, with modern effects and techniques but it feels classy.	2
97096aa9-fad1-4545-bded-6deeaf4e4ed5	  Overall, this film was not good... just a Michael Bay want-to-be "big explosions but no real plot and no character development at all"... I was extremely surprised that it was nominated for Best Film at the Golden Globes! The film that should not be nominated for any awards! Except for maybe "Special FX"... but for a film, it's laughable.	0

c447dbb5-7a7c-41d6-9e11-ec87706443e9	  I watched this on an airplane, just as everyone else was leaving. It's probably not an ideal setting to watch this A-list action movie, but that's okay. I jotted down notes. Here they are:- My first Mad Max movie- Great action movie, decent drama- Action was fun and extremely fast-paced, sometimes to the level of not following what was happening- I did enjoy the action, but for a two-hour movie, it could have used more variety- Sprawling world of a desert, which, as empty as it was, was easy to understand in its geography- Disconnection between characters led to an aura of mystery- The cause was established in a short and sweet package; don't expect anything revolutionary or elaborate- Characters connect simply on grounds of not liking status quo and seeking redemption, without one of our heroes (Tom Hardy) even revealing his name until near the climax- Extra points for avoiding romantic mumbo jumbo in favour of developing strong female roles, led by Charlize Theron- Ultimately, redemption is achieved...? It's unclear, perhaps so that sequels are justifiedTo round up my points in a paragraph, I hesitate to hail this as one of the best action movies of all time. None of the characters were memorable, even in their mysterious ways. Neither was there a singular great action moment that still resonates in me. The whole package was definitely greater than the sum of its parts, and, as a whole, I had a good time. As a drama, the relationships between all of the characters, with a silent agreement to fight for the same cause, intrigued me most. As an action movie, I can see myself having an even greater time, when watching this on a screen larger than my head. I cannot speak for Mad Max fans, so as a newcomer to the franchise, I dig the world. You are definitely still relevant, George Miller.	2

5018b2d9-45c0-4c45-a6e2-a14baf78458b	  This is what happens when you have a visionary filmmaker with an idea in his head for 30 years. A film so energetic, so well-oiled and with a story that moves along faster than Max's own Interceptor that you just want to keep going back in over and over again once its finished. The first thing I love about it is Miller's direction. He almost completely does away with the shaky-cam fight scenes of recent action films and now, finally, we have someone who knows when to employ what technique. When to use slow motion (or when to go fast motion), when to cut to maintain suspension of disbelief but also to keep the viewers understanding of the scene and all its players intact. Miller also accomplishes something extraordinary with the characters of the film - here we have fully fleshed out, three dimensional characters but with barely a word of dialogue. Characters are developed as we see the world they live in. We feel for Nux because at the start he is just cannon fodder, unremarkable when standing next to the other warboys (A surprisingly easy thing to relate to in the real world). We feel for Furiosa because she has made it through so many implied hardships and has come out fighting on the other side. The character of Max is already developed fully through the canon of the original films, but Miller recreates this character by showing us his past through his fevered hallucinations, so the film works as a standalone piece as well as a part of the canon. Something else this film has received noteworthy praise for is its female leads, and personally I have yet to see a film do this as well as this one does. Yes, the female characters in this film are in the foreground and are all holding their own with the men, but it never addresses this, it just lets them do their thing, almost as if - could it be possible - woman can be proactive too??!	2

7274e5a7-42da-4970-bf95-e2c5b7bcdd53	  Awful bastardization of the franchise. Tom Hardy actually does a decent job, but it not allowed to run with it, as Charlize Theron's character takes over. We were promised a film spanning the time between Mad Max & Road Warrior. Instead we got a remake of Road Warrior. Mother's milk? Really? What was Miller thinking?	0
9c777927-eaff-4012-ae88-8a0096f86d57	  Mad Max is non-stop, nitro-injected, action-movie glory. Nobody is making movies like this and I doubt anyone ever will with such success. Like the hunt for resources in the vast, barren world of George Miller's imagination, you'll truly have to scavenge for a single pot-hole on the Fury Road.	2

bdab5791-3c50-4c15-a6df-31cba779055f	  This is the first Mad Max film I have watched. Sure, I've seen clips from the earlier ones but it never grabbed me. If it was not for several friends telling me about the anti-patriarchy themes I may have passed over this one as well. I am glad that I did not. I watched it originally in the theater a week, or two, into it's release and I knew that it would easily be one of my favorite films of the year (especially considering how few new films I watch in their year of release). The bottom line is that the story is more important than the vehicle. It is an incredible action film and marrying the story with the action is important and it's main strength but I am suggesting that the action/chase movie is could be bigger. There is little time spent on building relationships between the characters and the viewer. Now is a good time to remember that I prefer drama films so this could be the perfect feminist action film and I may not recognize how perfect it is.I waited to watch it a second time because I wanted to have a better sound system which I now have. The first time one of the diesel engine turns over it sounded perfect and then I turned the base down; I could feel the nails shaking loose.Mad Max: Fury Road is an important movie and should be enjoyed.	2

a3936190-aeab-4150-8ac6-861b9171e015	  The purpose of a metaphor is to compare a subject to another thing so that your listener better understands the point you're trying to convey. I will do that now. One of my favorite metaphors for describing movies, other than sandwiches and burgers, is to compare them to complex machinery. A movie is like a machine in that it is full of moving parts, all of which work with each other to perform the machine's job. With many machines, not all of the parts may be functioning, but they still more or less work. It's only when all the parts work as they're supposed to that the machine works at its optimum capacity. This is how I'd describe Mad Max: Fury Road, George Miller's return to the franchise after a 30 year hiatus. (Has it really been that long?) I regret not seeing this one in theater, first viewing it on my laptop, which diminished the experience for me. However, that did not stop me from loving this movie, and my affection towards it has only grown with each subsequent viewing.Fury Road combines two of my favorite things about movies for a really great package: big spectacle and meaningful storytelling. These sometimes get mislabeled as being mutually exclusive, but this film seems to be a big middle finger to that notion. Miller uses big action set pieces to tell a story about survivors, monsters, cults, and the overthrowing of tyranny to set up a benevolent matriarchy. That last one may seem a bit odd for Mad Max, but thankfully the more laid back script keeps it from being too on-the-nose. That's another thing I like about Mad Max, there isn't too much exposition. The opening shot tells you all you need to know to get caught up on the scenario, whether you're a newcomer to the franchise or a returning fan. Everything else important to the story is shown through visuals and character interactions. For example, Max is very different from how we last saw him, and I don't mean that he's played by a different actor. A lot of time has passed since he last interacted with another human being, but this is never told directly to you. Instead, the audience is trusted to figure out by the way Max behaves. He's not so good at talking anymore, speaking in low grunts and pantomiming with a shotgun in order to order people around. Likewise, we know that Immorten Joe's group of followers, the War Boys, are cultists because of their mad devotion and willingness to throw away their lives, even though the word "cult" is never mentioned once in the film. I think the Mad Max movies are a great example of how you can show instead of tell in order to make a more compelling story.There wasn't a single moment that the film lost me. Miller understands the audience's need for practical effects, mostly keeping the CG invisible to viewers. The only really obvious use of CG is the crazy scary sandstorm with the tornadoes and lightning bolts, and, man, wasn't that really cool? Yeah, this whole movie is cool, which is important for an action movie. Thankfully everything's always moving forward, nothing stopped.I could go on and on, but this is just an RT review I'm doing for fun. If this was for a publication, I'd be more thorough and professional-sounding, but nobody's going to read this but me. If you do happen to stumble upon this and wish I wrote more, well, sue me.	2

26bb5e6e-948c-4c22-916e-0a7807c77fd8	  This movie was one of the best hard action movies of all time. Yes very entertaining but never failing to teach lessons on issues such as global warming, depleting world resources, greed, exploitation and poverty, religion, roles of women ect. The movie itself was physically creative and original. It was a road traveled with constant anxiety and wonder with pleasing surprises. And although it barely reaches emotional it is unforgettable.	2

92162cf3-cef0-4d01-afc6-9f30d823303a	  There has been talk of George Miller returning the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Max Rockatansky for quite some time. It seemed unlikely that the director, now known for such family-friendly fare as Babe and Happy Feet would decide to revisit the world he created with the first Mel Gibson as Mad Max back in 1979. So I was surprised when Miller decided to direct another installment with Tom Hardy taking on the role Gibson played in the first three films. Hardy is an excellent choice, he is good actor and has a great physical presence and can suffer photogenically like Mel did (especially in The Road Warrior). But Max is almost a secondary character in this film, Charlize Theron plays Imperator Furiosa whose rebellious act stealing the brides of Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the Toecuter back in the first Mad Max film). Missing an arm (thanks to CGI) and with her hair cut surprisingly short, the de-glamorized Theron is just as riveting and physical in her performance as Hardy. The first half of the film is a chase and second half is a race. And yes, there is a surprising feminist subtext to the film as well as a not-so-surprising environmental subtext to this film.	2
2e13b15f-198c-4eab-9455-4cf14cffa9e7	  Greatest film of 2015 and deserves a watch. It is action packed for the whole movie and keeps you on the edge of your seat. A movie with nearly no dialogue is in my opinion the best movie of the year. Also with all the practical effects makes some damn interesting film making. Everyone should see this well directed and well captured film	2
8cf4c931-dab4-4d1d-8224-67a6d196eb38	  Mad Max Fury Road came out of nowhere and was a fun exhilarating joy ride throughout the entire film.

I've seen the movie seven times on big screen because I know that it won't replicated anywhere, this is probably the only film that I appreciate all of the non-action sequences because the action are so mind-blowing and spectacular that I felt it melted my face afterwards, I think I hurt my jaw after watching this film.	2
bcf42a34-6d36-449c-bd3b-1cffd15b60e6	  First, the positives. Theron and Hardy were magnificient and was rightly cast for this movie. The stunts were amazing as well as the CGI. Not a dull moment really, the movie kept a good pace and 2 hrs flew by.Now, those are what makes this bearable, if you can get past the ridiculous story, ridiculous premise, etc... To be honest? Perhaps it is a cultural thing. As an Asian, I just can't seem to understand why would anyone think up of such a ridiculous post-apocalyptic future. Perhaps this is what happens to white men when the world goes awry.EDIT: I changed this from 2 stars to 4 after watching it a couple more times. I think it really is about getting past the premise. This is not meant to be a serious film, just an action packed science fiction. Also, reading up on more of the pre-stories helped understand a lot of misconceptions in the film.	2

I can't even say this film had to be acted all that well because it's secondary to the action sequences and Maxes grunts which I guess is also part of the action cause it definitely isn't part of the dialogue. Having Charlize didn't hurt. No story. A mind numbing ride without too much effort required by any of the actors to portray anything other than shock, fear, dismay and hope.

The first 30 minutes set the tone perfectly : do not expect any coherence, depth of characters or, well, anything other than full in-you-face action here. Nothing stands up to scrutiny, no character holds up to any real logic, and of course it has nothing to do with the first movies of the same franchise.Let it be noted that Charlize Theron is the real main character here, and plays her part with talent and charisma, which sorely lack in Tom Hardy.	0
985b6244-a869-41fc-932a-1a0cfe27be5c	  As a fan of the original Mad Max trilogy, I was hesitant to watch this one as there was an American input to an Australian classic, but realizing George Miller was at the helm, I gave in and was happy I did. Tom Hardy did the role justice, but wasn't as good as Mel Gibson, and unlike most of the other reviewers I wasn't overly impressed with Theron. The hit is George Miller's vision of what an action movie should be, so I can recommend this one to all Mad Max fans	2

f0aa0199-622c-4a98-951a-45b51c7afdfe	  The surprise smash hit of 2015, Mad Max: Fury Road is a sequel/reboot to George Miller's Mad Max (1979). What's strange about Miller is that apart from his Mad Max franchise his biggest accomplishments have been writing both Babe and Happy Feet. Very peculiar then that from the same director comes literally the most action packed film of the last decade. Unfortunately however this very strength becomes its greatest weakness.Whilst visually stunning there is barely a narrative driving the action foreword. The story goes that in a post apocalyptic wasteland, where chrome and oil are worshipped and water is in short supply, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) decides to run away from Immortal Joe, the man in charge of said chrome, oil and water, taking all of his 'wives' with her. That's essentially it, what follows next is a two hour long car chase. Somehow this Max character (Tom Hardy) tags along for the ride and apart from being able to drive in a straight line and being nifty with a wrench doesn't really add much.Theron's Furiosa is amazingly bad-ass and the only really likeable character. It's worth mentioning that it's great to see a strong female lead in an action film such as this. Hardy's Max on the other hand barely says ten words and doesn't really feel justified as the titular character. Nicholas Hoult gives an unrecognisable performance as Nux a young 'war boy' but any real hope of a character arc, for him and nearly all characters, is sacrificed in place of crane cam shots of exploding vehicles.The mostly practical visual effects are amazing to behold and Miller should be applauded for his return to physical effects and sparse use of green screen. It's visually stunning but only remains interesting for so long. Coming in at exactly two hours it felt at least half an hour too long. When Max and friends finally escape their pursuers I thought it was over and the perfect ending point, however this was not the case. They make the decision to return through the desert from where they came to confront their captor. At this point I felt cheated, not only were all the previous car chases pointless now there was to be another half hour of exactly the same.Fury Road is an amazing technical achievement and should be recognised as such but unfortunately in order to uphold this, narrative and character development are sacrificed.	1

5cdc7d63-0d78-41cd-8a1b-fcd6f923aab6	  15 year old production hiatus, drastic changes in shooting locations, cast revamp. The fact that Mad Max Fury Road, the 4th installment of a long forgotten but highly revered franchise was made braving all these odds is nothing short of an incredible event in the recent movie history. And oh yes it's a sight to behold.Fury road takes us back to the arid dystopia which auteur George miller introduced about 35 years ago. Only now Miller has upped his game by several notches. Thanks to the massive $ 150 mn budget and creative freedom conferred on the creators by the studio. Landscapes are brighter, more dreadful, vehicles bigger and more revved up, the mad madder. Enter Immortan Joe, a ghoulish dictator/self-proclaimed messiah who has taken over an entire citadel by stealing its water supply. Under his wing is an army of ailing skinheads called the 'War Boys' who have been promised slots in Valhalla in exchange for suicidal fanaticism towards Joe and his ideas. This works very well given the downcast society where everyone is looking for redemption . Status quo turns into bedlam when Joe's army imperator, Furiosa (Played by the dazzling Charlize theron) goes rogue after stealing Joe's most prized possessions, his wives during a supply run. What ensues is a long exhilarating, chase sequence between furiosa and Joe accompanied by his army of white minions. Thrown in the midst of all this chaos is Max Rockitanksy who is picked as a human power cell by Nux, a starry eyed war boy for his pursuit on fury road. While max was rigged with ample gadgetry in the previous movies he is stripped down to one single instinct, that of survival (The Famous interceptor is shredded between two giant trucks in one of the scenes). Against will he is forced to help furiosa and the wives flee to a safe haven called the green place. Lean plot? Yes. Shallow? Definitely not. Amidst all the edge of the seat action sequences it is easy to miss the subtexts which the writers have carefully interlaced with the main story line. While the original script was slated as one long chase sequence, it became denser with time like a bottle of aging wine. Furiosa's missing arm (the elephant in the room), freakish figures scavenging swamps, Max's strange time hopping visions might all be part of a bigger universe whose surface was merely grazed in fury road. We will have to wait for the promised sequels to watch these elements unfold. (Yes there are more movies in line). At the helm of the movie is a mastermind who has crafted his art of direction over years. While he might be pretty inconsistent in making movies George Miller's devotion and bravura puts most his younger contemporaries to shame. Millers uses his outlandish creativity and visceral filmmaking style to make some of the most unforgettable action sequences ever made. Oscar winning cinematographer John Seale (The English patient) who came out of retirement for the project delivers with some stunning shots of Namibian Desert. The art direction and production design are equally stellar. Be it the adorable tumors on Nux's neck , the super cool skeleton engraving on the war rigs door or suave interiors of Immortal's Elysium , the amount of detail that has gone into each character, vehicle or set piece is simply staggering. (Check out the vehicle gallery on the official movie to know what I'm talking about). It would be a sin not to mention Margaret Sixel who puts her editing skills to to make the entire movie look like one long thrilling chase sequence. Junkie XL's operatic score works as a perfect complement to the mood of the movie. But the real stars of the movie in my opinion is its stunt crew. It is incredible and admirable how these guys pulled off a majority of death defying, jaw dropping, and plain batshit crazy stunts with real people and real vehicles instead of doing it the easy way. War boys, polecats, flamers would all have stayed as concepts had it not been for their raw calculated gutsiness. My adulation goes for the entire stunt team. This is analog movie making at its best. If you didn't see this on the biggest loudest screen, you definitely missed something. One of the biggest surprises of Fury Road was how the movie was not about Max but Furiosa, a warrior equally or more broken than the titular character (We see what you did there with the deceiving trailers, WB). Deeply conflicted and often poignant she tries to bring sense to a mad society. Played flawlessly by Charlize Theron, Furiosa is easily one of the strongest female characters to emerge out of an action flick. She is definitely among the ranks of Ellen Ripley, Sarah Conor and likes. Replacing Mel Gibson is a more reticent, feral, Tom Hardy who gets the job done but becomes subdued by Furiosa's intense screen charisma. Nicholas Hoult also puts a heartfelt performance as Nux, a rather demure war boy and Hugh Kayes Byrne as the nefarious yet graceful antagonist. Against all the praises I have heard some strong criticisms about the apparent feminist undertones of the story, but I wonder does it really matter? At heart Fury Road is a straight up action flick with beautifully choreographed stunts, minimal dialogues, strong characters and a seemingly linear storyline. There is no subtle way to put it. Fury Road is every adrenaline Junkies dream come true. If road warrior is the punk's Sistine chapel, Fury road is summer action flick's Holy Grail .	2
79ded464-3d06-46b6-83b4-6e6e7680a9ad	  To let you know I had not watched the original Mad Max movies when I had watched this film, so my judgment comes from the film on its own basis, and using that fact I must saw that George Miller does a good job as far as the cinematography of it. John Seale, the cinematographer, does a exceptional job here. There are many shots of the film that feel like the belong here. John Seale also did some of the Harry Potter movies were he also did a great job in. The action is directed to perfection and left me in awe struck at the amount of time and special effects put into this film with no cgi being added to boggle it down. As for characters Tom Hardy is good as Max. He hardly says a word and I really love that when watching the film. I loved that he was all about action and doing stuff and not so much about talking, because a lot of times in the movies just your facial expressions can say so much about a scene, and Tom Hardy was no exception. The fact of the matter is that he was undoubtedly Max. Now Charlize Theron I adored as Furiosa. She was what won the movie for me and made it awesome. I still remember after seeing this film the first thing I thought was "Dam she could be a great Wonder Woman." I mean seriously forget Gal Godat and get Charlize to play Diana, and bet I would love it along with everyone else. I mean the woman really does lead these women from the terrible and crooked husband. Nicholas Hoult and Hugh Keays-Byrne sadly were not as good or interesting. I mean they were just raging fits of anger. They didn't think and they had no brain. I mean really they were not compelling villains at all. In fact I found myself quite bored with them to the point were it didn't make any sense. Now with that being said I am going into all the problems with this film. The lack of story- While there were interesting characters it lacked any type of good characters which hinders the film quite a bit for me cause I do like a good story. That being said there is some story here unlike what people are saying it just takes some time to get to itThe entire first 20 mins were boring- I mean at first I was into it, but it felt like the action sequence would just keep going and going and honestly if it wasn't for my desire to finish my food I probably would have gone to sleep. Not good movie. Not good at all. The villains suck!!!- No really they do. There bad and awful villains to the point were I wanted them all dead. __ OK now that the issues are out the way the film is still decent enough. I won't be recommending it to anyone probably unless there just really into action films tho. Still tho there is a lot that we can still love with Mad Max: Fury Road which is why I am still giving it a 7/10.	1
166e440d-2cb5-4db7-97da-371d64bc74e1	  4.75 stars. What a lovely day! This movie was awesome. Very cool story, over the top action sequences and an awesome aesthetic. Very anxious to see what George Miller has in store for us next. The only knock is it had more CGI than I was expecting, but still awesome nonetheless. I highly recommend this one.	2

edf22203-c0e5-4541-9d17-affe6d9232fc	  Slap post-apocalyptic on anything and It becomes interesting. That was clearly the intent with Mad Max: Fury Road.There was barely any story involved. This coupled with what appeared to be B Grade stunts along with sporadic visual effects, the new Mad Max can definitely be skipped altogether.However, Charlize Theron's performance must be recognized in this movie, which was excellent.	0
4df02fe9-61ad-41c5-b529-a767293176f6	  Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action movie i've ever seen. George Miller returns after 3 decades to continue the saga "MAD MAX" and his return is glorious and epic in every sense. The style of the original trilogy is respected and used the same formula but with better effects and best choreography. The action scenes are amazing, it was a pleasure to see some sequences well made and very well edited in post-production. Tom Hardy is such a good Max as Mel Gibson and the fans will be very satisfied with the final result. Literally, this is the first film that of truth, the 2 hours of film are 2 hours of pure action, exciting, violent and frantic. The climax never drops, the story never becomes loose. I repeat: is the best action movie i've ever seen in a long time. Applause to the whole team, and in particular to the director, George Miller.Review en Espa�ol:Mad Max: Fury Road es la mejor pel�cula de acci�n que jamas he visto.

60287936-3744-47ec-983a-551673fb521e	  Finally got a chance this film. It ROCKS! I see the film as a metaphor for the struggles women experience in what is largely a male dominated society... and Charlize Theron is absolutely badass as the main character! Max, much like the audience, is along for the ride.	2
e9220c50-2bc9-4c4a-a1a4-42e4cd104e7e	  I liked that the movie was about Furiosa, not Max. Furiosa in particular seemed a rich character. Well, I guess that's what you get when you actually have a talented actor at work. Tom Hardy, who I like very much, had a hard time stepping out of the shadow of older Maxes who shall not be named, yet held my attention well. But:1. It seemed that F & M were a perfect match. Why didn't they actually hit it off?2. The ritual of the "culture" was WAY overdone. There's value in ritual, especially for "primitive" cultures like that into which civilization had devolved in the movie; but beyond a certain point, ritual becomes a survival risk.3. Why didn't Furiosa speak Aussie?4. No reason is given for Max leaving, except that Max always leaves. Honestly, couldn't something have been done with that? Why can't Max finally find something that can make up, even just a bit, for the loss of his family?	1
992b5e6a-43a0-4388-9b93-f56efe7c2cd4	  Mad Max: Fury Road is a finely tuned, visually insane and relentlessly kinetic action thriller that brings George Miller's surprisingly thorough fictional world roaring to life.	2
ee1685f3-ec64-4629-8401-cb254bb8f2a8	  Mad Max: Fury Road is maybe the best reboot of all time. The lack of plot and character development is out shined by marvelous action and visual effects.	2
f685da34-8317-4faa-9823-57ac1598ea8b	  So, really now. That's the ''film of the year''? I wonder what the worst film would be like.	0
f4489690-e9e7-4fd9-817d-16dcc3aff7e7	  Frenetic, Furious, Fantastic. Felt like a 4 hour movie but not in a Peter Jackson, King Kong sort of way. Worth the watch. Exhausting.	2
a4d27af1-aa0b-4e4c-b061-8f4aa3f30fe9	  This has to be one of the best pure action movies I've seen in a while. Although it lacks story telling this film exceeds my expectations with excellent action with remarkable cinematography and special effects throughout.	2
156cdcb4-39cf-4713-86e2-d8b7e5c9a3e7	  Wow...still trying to process everything I just saw. Pretty sure there were a few scenes I didn't even blink because so much insane stuff was happening all at once. Did I understand everything that was going on? Not really...but at least it looked pretty. Funny thing is Mad Max really feels like he's barely in the movie, but you won't even care because Charlize Theron is really the star of the movie and she kills it.	2
e6e26ae1-8cc4-4cb9-b0b3-889cab446a7d	  benchmark of action movie	2
094c17f1-80c1-4c9e-acc1-e6bbf069df89	  Although very, very simplistic on the story side of things - with a plot revolving around the protagonists attempts to escape the Citadel before deciding to go back - Mad Max: Fury Road excels on every other front. With brilliant visual and practical effects, tons of creative imagery, engaging characters, great acting, pulse-pounding music, and exhilarating action, Fury Road is a thrilling cinematic experience.	2
87805971-438d-4c44-882c-030be9daef98	  I'm not a gore for gore's sake kind of viewer, but being old school... Mad Max back in the day was one of the goriest movies out there. THIS Mad Max really doesn't have a drop of blood in it. A lot of "crash. boom, bam" but nothing really at stake. If you are expecting to see the old gritty, hardcore Mad Max where death, rape, and dismemberment are just around the corner... you are not going to find it here. If you want another homogenized 21st century type "action" film, it's worth a look.	1

920f8833-4dae-4f82-bb1a-2a7f944d9ca4	  George Miller unleashes a feverish, ferocious film and it's an intense wild ride. Acrobatic "Mad Max: Fury Road" is thrilling and treats the audience to some astonishing action sequences. But the action doesn't dull the emotional impact and that's mainly due to Charlize Theron's fierce performance."Mad Max: Fury Road" is a ride worth taking. Wall-to-wall pumped-up adrenalized fun, it's ridiculously good.	2
20a90b28-8c18-4f23-aa4d-0790dfcac2c8	  The "acting" was fine, the special effects were fine, the fighting and crashing were fine. If there was a story inside the running away then turning around to attack the very place they were running from, I completely missed it. If that was the story, how silly.	0
7ef7866f-70f4-495b-a6b6-a612a9fb52c2	  What a thrill ride, nearly non-stop action for 2 hours, gets your adrenaline pumping all the way. Story aside, it's weird, original and fun. Charlize Theron is the new Sigourney Weaver of tough women roles. Best I've seen this year so far, it makes Avengers Age of Ultron look like a daytime cartoon.	2
de6ab48b-0817-43ea-ba6d-0a3a93dc219b	  No, no, no, no.Not about Mad Max, it's about car chases. Glorious, exploding, no CGI car chases. But that's it. Plot - No. Acting - Barely. Those horrible movie tropes - Yup. Mumbled and dull dialogue - Yup!People be crazy.	0
1bd1d90b-be6e-41ae-81f1-c09985e8c7b1	  Great action, great acting, great story. First three films should have been referred to either in narrative or in character interactions to strengthen life of setting/environment.	2

994fd3c3-f06a-43e6-9303-3814cdea5d1f	  WHAT A DAY WHAT A LOVELY DAY INDEED!!! My god!!! This film kicked my ass!!! This is what action films have been sorely missing for the past ten years or so. Imagine if a 12 year old kid circa 1984 got hold of a lot of black tar heroin and fireworks and decided to make a movie but this time with a bigger budget. This film is great, with some of the best action films ever put to celluloid, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are both terrific as the leads and the film never slows down. This is one of the best films so far of 2015 and one of the best of the last several years. Also can we please get that guitar flamethrower dude in more movies please. We seeing this movie pour yourself a cup of gasoline induced goodness cause this is one of the best films of the year.	2
d9bc6c5b-8be2-42f6-a893-a8930b2d0bd6	  Can't even stop breathing... Charlize Theron deserves Oscars	2
9b23300a-77ea-49be-b91c-52c72c7c5518	  One of the most awaited films this year. I've seen the old film series lately as a warm up, and they where quite good to be honest.This film is even more intense and filled with effects and actions. You get some breaks from the action and the pretty good story makes it whole. The actors are solid but again - this is all about the action. I really dug that guitarist - funny, clever and original.8 out of 10 sips of mothers milk.	2
b8ce5ff7-6ea4-48e0-bd48-4c688441ebbe	  There is no question; this thoroughly modern Max is an extremely entertaining synthesis of mess and noise. The antidote to the onslaught of comic book superheroes and vigilantes of the last few years was anti-hero Max... or so we thought. Director George Miller subverted all our expectations of this film, from tweaking the gender roles in action films to astronomical production aesthetics. Few directors have the tenacity to unleash the kind of physical carnage Miller splashes across the screen here. You'll barely have a second to breathe as he seamlessly shifts from one insane set piece to another, ratcheting up the stakes and assembling his meticulous symphony of carnage with the combined result being one of the most successfully ambitious action extravaganzas committed to film.	2
df18ceaa-6e99-4e8c-a162-ca58b10338c0	  Having never seen a Mad Max film in it's entirety (I know..), and having heard of its strangeness, as someone put it, I went into Mad Max Fury road a little, well, unsure. But, suffice to say, it was good. Very good. The first 20 minutes or so are, to be frank, the weakest part of the movie. Its slow, somewhat uninteresting and as a newcomer its admittedly a little hard to get on board with the madness (pun not intended). But as the movie progresses, um, yeah, so......The action is sensational. This is one of the best action movies I've seen, and its weird how one and a half hours of action can greatly sustain your interest.Tom Hardy as Max was brilliant and so was Charlize Theron as Furiosa, and the setting was prettey sublime. There were a few things that bothered me though. One, was that Nicholas Hoult's character, whilst a great character, had a romance with some girl which blossomed in about 3 minutes, and I'm not even exaggerating.Also there was admittedly a lot of screaming and nothingness in terms of plot. But, honestly, by the time the film concluded, I had the biggest, happiest grin on my face in a long while.	2
a95f7a21-ffe6-4291-b7fb-c83893a066d3	  What a lovely movie! I had never seen a Mad Max movie before this one, and honestly, I don't think it's necessary. Each Mad Max movie pretty much stands on its own, including this one. Even more with this one since Mel Gibson didn't return, and this movie has a very different style to it than the others as well. This movie is very simple in the story department, but the main draw of the film is the extreme, practically non stop action, and just crazy world. George Miller did a great job focusing on practical effects over CG, and it shows in some ridiculously awesome action. The soundtrack is also amazing, perfectly putting the action into a musical form, even serving as the sound effect track for a good portion of the movie. The movie is just really exciting, adrenaline pumping craziness. It's definitely a weird universe though, which I could see turning some people away, and it can also take a while to figure out just exactly what's going on with the world as well, and what story is there is pretty thin, but the main focus of the movie is on the action, world building, visuals, and the soundtrack, and in those areas, I can think of very few films that do as well as Fury Road did.Personal Grade: S+Technical Score: 82%	2
85b44417-7642-4733-ab79-b51130822032	  So boring. Nothing much happens, it's just car-chase action non-stop.	0

6c95a749-b85e-4fc2-a31f-6337329ca9c7	  One of those rare films that gets better with each viewing, Deceptively smart and progressive wrapped in a heart pounding chase.	2
f1777009-8208-4c3c-aff6-58c57ce1bbad	  Believe the hype. Max is back and he's kicking ass. While Tom Hardy isn't quite as good at being Mad Max as Mel Gibson was (srsly, Gibson is a raging bigot. He's already mad), he has the look and his terse acting actually helps him sell his traumatized road warrior persona. Charlize Theron is the woman of the hour as Furiosa, a badass warrior woman out to redeem herself. The plot begins with Max being captured and Furiosa making off with some precious goods that Immortan Joe, the ruler of The Citadel, can't let slip away. Max is serving as a "blood bag" for Nux, a Warboy with terminal cancer. Nux figures chasing down Furiosa is his last chance at immortal glory, so he drags Max along for the ride. Thus, the chase begins.Every character cast for this film is pretty much perfection. If you remember the bizarre characters from Road Warrior, you'll recognize similar horrors and mutants here. The world is dead and irradiated, so there's plenty of twisted creations all around. The gangs themselves are all very well-defined, as are their leaders (I loved the Guntown dude's vehicle). The music is fantastic, and the environments are legit video game-quality otherworldly (the storm sequence and the swamp were particularly awesome). The action as a whole puts the end chase in Road Warrior to absolute shame, which is a tall order but one that Fury Road fulfills.My only issues with the movie were that the 3D stuff was overdone, the movie should have been an hour longer (I still prefer 3-hour movies for films that aspire to real art), and some leaps in logic (apparently everyone in the post-apocalypse has the same blood type). But those things aside, Fury Road is well worth the price of admission. Action movies will be compared to this for a long time to come.	2
641efd84-00bb-476b-9886-ab9829c9982d	  If the first two films of the post-apocalyptic Mad Max saga, became indispensable cult films, and entered through the front door of the big productions unfit for cardiac history. Then Mad Max Fury Road with Mr. Miller, over the years in this wasteland will be finally received into the very gates of Valhalla. And there will be revered as a hero, who made a spectacular masterpiece on human decadence and ultimate redemption, as the true artisan director of those car chases outputs of your own nightmares, and for bringing maximum glory a work 25 years of dedication and sacrifice. These unique virtues it goes without saying that scarce in the film pretentious and empty action today !!	2
e744f4b2-8cba-4c66-b506-e227b0b0cac7	  Well made but meaningful visual style. And totally collapsing story together with average actors performance. That feeling when every time you are in one step from catch the fish but each time it swim away. 6/10	2

To say this movie is a little bit intense is like saying a ghost pepper has a little bit of a kick. This might have spoiled all future action movies for me by setting the bar so ridiculously high. Wow.	2
7cc4bef1-dd37-4200-b249-50b5c923f53f	  Such an incredible movie! I'm going to go and say its definitely, by far, the best one of the franchise! Charlize Theron is the show stealer with Tom Hardy being fantastic in the title role.	2

35ac6a41-70be-4918-8cc1-8ca742f274d6	  It's been 30 years since Max left us in the big screen. Now he comes back with a new actor portraying the lone wolf from Mel Gibson in which he had established 36 years ago. While the film may look like Furiosa's story, Max's character holds on his own and shows that there are men who do selfless things without any thought of reward, nothing but the silent respect that women should give and acknowledge. And when you do, they're gone...going their own way.	2
503fcb46-cc83-44c4-a0f2-cf27dc9b3ae9	  Fury Road is the best movie of the year to date. An outstanding achievement of movie making.	2
be4787af-0296-422b-ac5f-e1f4cc3212bd	  George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the most, lush and vivid movies I've seen in a long time. The cinematography for this film is an absolute marvel- showcasing the sprawling outback desert through hues of oranges and reds during the daytime, contrasting it with beautiful midnight blues at night. All this comes together to give the movie a very lively atmosphere. The score alleviates the sense of rush and is smartly used diegetically as well as non-diegetically. The action scenes are shot brilliantly with minimal special effect, furthering its case as a masterpiece. Finally the acting especially that of Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa is top-notch and no character is left needing further characterisation. Tom Hardy's Max is a man of little words, but the performances are so strong that the movie doesn't need dialogue in order to flourish. This movie is definitely not hyped up- go see it and then go see it again.Rating: 5/5	2

This movie is insane and how George Miller handled the scale of this movie is beyond me. Mad Max: Fury Road is a must see, and is going to go down as one of the better action movies of recent time.	2
39e950d2-59bf-4346-baae-c0ad4a654937	  George Miller burst onto the cinematic landscape in 1979 with the 70's exploitation car chase masterpiece Mad Max then exceeded the brilliance of that debut with a sequel (Mad Max 2) that truly cemented him as a visionary and visceral filmmaker. Now, almost thirty-five years later, Miller demonstrates with Mad Max: Fury Road that he's lost none of his vitality; however, where previously the thinness of plot and character felt appropriate in this franchise, here they read as omission and highlight the fact that at the end of the day this is little more than a well-executed two-hour car chase.Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is the true hero of this story. Despite living in the aggressively patriarchal society of the Citadel ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) she has attained a position of some authority. When she sets out on a trade mission she takes with her a group of Immortan's breeders with the intention of seeking refuge in a remote society of women. Max (Tom Hardy), spends the first half hour of the film held captive as a human blood bag for one of Immortan's goons until he escapes and teams up with Furiosa.Miller's strong point is the detail with which he paints his world. The colours, the costumes, the makeup, the souped up vehicles, the dare-devil stunts, the magnificent collisions, the heavy metal guitarist screeching out the pursuit's soundtrack. It's riveting stuff. Imaginative and witty. And as an exercise in action direction it's pretty flawless. But the film aspires to being more than a thrilling roller coaster ride. It asks us to care. And on this level it falls short.We learn in the opening scene that Max failed to protect his wife and daughter and so (groan) there are subsequent snippets of his daughter haunting him throughout the film. The breeders are all so damn beautiful (including super model Rosie Huntington Whiteley) and given little chance to develop individually that their shared plight is easy to dismiss. The developing bond between Furiosa and Max thankfully doesn't end with a kiss but nor is it of much consequence. Nicholas Hoult, as one of Immortan's gang, has a defined arc in the story which only makes you wonder why him and no one else?Theron, with her buzz cut, racoon eyes and prosthetic arm, makes a fine action heroine. Hardy, similarly, has just the right brooding presence (and pouty lips) to more than comfortably fill Mel's boots. They look great together and I wish they were given more to do than drive from A to B and back again. Another subplot, another significant complication would've been welcome meat on these narrative bones. Fury Road is indeed audacious and thrilling but you'll come away affected far more by Miller's virtuosity than the film itself.	2

78b655ae-7ddc-4ac6-a39a-0b765ba67f7b	  Apparently, it takes an old veteran like George Miller to show this new generation of young filmmakers how action can be exhilarating, and so he gives us this high-octane, adrenaline-fueled roller coaster of a movie that is technically flawless, visually astonishing and looks amazing in 3D.	2
b74cdbb5-879a-4b4f-94c7-92efc2ee3bf8	  What can I say? As far as pure, technical achievement goes, not many films can live up to the heights of this Mad Max entry. The complexity of its action scenes and their individual, often awe-inspiring shots alone aren't the film's only attributes, however. Making beautiful use color in its dessert landscapes, incredible locale and vehicle design, and a perfect use of pacing -- especially in the kinetic energy of action scenes -- director George Miller and his team create something that doesn't really come along often. As much praise as other "artistic" action films like The Dark Knight receive, that example doesn't even come close to the skill on display in the conception and editing of Max's set pieces. It's light on story, but sometimes a film can be almost perfect without one. Sometimes.	2
4d5a0364-5e9c-41af-965a-ee67bbd8b4b4	  "Mad Max: Fury Road" is completely unique. Its visual appeal and creativity can't be denied, but it is also one of the strangest films that you will ever experience. In a market where every genre is saturated with films that recycle the same concepts and ideas, it is rare to find a film as unique as this one. It even feels unique when compared with the "Mad Max" films of the 80's. George Miller is no stranger to the film industry and "Fury Road" may be his masterpiece. I think that it is really cool that Miller wrote a new chapter into his series 30 years after the last film. Most of this story is told without dialogue. The action is constant and the imagery drives the story for better or for worse (we will never forget the brief milking scene or the idea of a "blood bag"). Immortan Joe's mask is terrifying and the production team convincingly transformed all of the actors into nuclear holocaust survivors. I appreciated the performances by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, though any sort of emotion seems to be overshadowed by the previous and next action sequence. This one won't be winning any Oscars in acting categories, but it will certainly make a run in categories like Production Design, Film Editing, and Sound Editing. To be honest, I was a little bit disappointed with the film. It had so much hype for its entire theatrical run, augmented by a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 97%, and I just did not receive the amount of character development as I expect from a critically acclaimed film. Still, I will be the first to admit that I need to see it again to process everything that happened and may adjust my rating afterward. My wife and I are still scratching our heads about the electric guitar guy (who we have discovered is named "The Doof Warrior"). We assumed that he was symbolic or sort of reference to the original films, but apparently he is exactly what he appears to be: a flame-spewing guitarist who pumps up the rest of the troops. I suppose that he left a big enough impression that he is the only character that I have discussed. The most well-written character in the film is Nux and we grow attached to him because he undergoes the greatest transformation. I look forward to watching this film again and believe that the sequels will be even better if they deliver the same amount of action while including a greater transformation of their characters. There are a lot of cheesy sci-fi films from the 70's and 80's that involve vehicles ("Death Race 2000" is the first one that comes to mind), but the vehicles are perfectly incorporated into this film's creative atmosphere and they are just cool. Everybody loves "Mad Max: Fury Road" for its creative post-apocalyptic story and constant stream of action. I believe that the Academy Awards will acknowledge its effort and remind the film industry that action films can blow our minds with more than just the action.	2

82c06a4c-b199-4e71-8f36-1027ed2472c2	  Could one of the best films of 2015 be a sequel to a movie from the 1970s featuring amazing chases, swashbuckling action, all connected through a distinct mythology and set in a time that seems too fantastic to be real? The crazy answer is "yes, yes it can" and the funny thing is I'm not talking about that little film with Star Wars in the title. Since the 1979 original, writer/director (and doctor) George Miller has given the world two other iterations of Mad Max-1981s The Road Warrior and 1985s Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (whom George Ogilvie shared a co-directing credit)-but this newest take proves an old vehicle can learn many new tricks with 2015s Mad Max: Fury Road-a legitimate candidate to be one of the most influential films currently made. With a plot told almost exclusively through visual storytelling, Miller and his staff have truly outdone themselves with what the cinematic medium can do-driving from one scene to the other with frenetic pacing, inspired use of editing (which it should win an Oscar with) and subtle yet dramatic acting from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Hardy and Theron-playing main protagonists Max Rockatanksy and Imperator Furiosa, respectively (you have to love names like that)-epitomize the brawn and finesse of Miller's filmmaking aesthetic. Amid the brutal carnage of the chases there is a chaotic fluidity to it all that evokes a beautiful dance-blending music and movement to please the senses. This level of sophistication has been hinted at in the previous films, often with socially sensitive issues that evoked the times they were made in. With real-world oil shortages in the 70s being a major headline, the preservation and fight for gasoline was at the focal point in the original three. This has now been replaced with the preservation of life, an inspired and logical way to go, showing the value of conscious awareness and preserving this place called home; Earth (similar themes were touched upon in Miller's 2006 Oscar-winning film Happy Feat). The underlining theme of survival (that spans each entry) is representative of what Mad Max: Fury Road is-a film that breathes life, has a "never say die attitude" but expresses the limitless freedom and determination of what people can achieve.	2
cdc3d4f1-0ffc-4a1b-9897-87ae7ad615a5	  To call Mad Max: Fury Road incredible would be an understatement! From a badass cast of characters led by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, to amazing visuals and practical stunt work, all the way to masterful, energetic, and visionary direction from 70 year-old George Miller!

f7557ef0-03db-4229-9d09-856237274b37	  Loud, proud, and yet relentlessly incoherent, Mad Max: Fury Road is a disaster of a film masquerading as bold. A reboot, at least of sorts, of the franchise previously headlined by Mel Gibson, director George Miller brings the outlandish post-apocalyptic world back to the screen. We find Max (Tom Hardy) captured at the hands of a crazed war lord, only to find himself mixed up in the escape of the vaunted female Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and the Warlord's many prized wives. Those that are prone to like Mad Max will point to the action scenes as proof of the film's inventive and unabashedly brutal nature. To a large extent this is true, the film does look good, and the action sequences feature uniquely conceived devices, feel impactful, and are extremely well choreographed and otherwise executed. Mad Max, to be sure, can be fun to watch. This is all fine until the point in which one dares to ask, 'what am I watching'?Simply put, Mad Max is an absolute narrative mess. Very little is explained, only the thinnest most idiotic delivered exposition is ever given, and then the sole purpose is to set up a 10 or 15 minute fight or chase scene, meanwhile leaving any characterization, plot, or coherent narrative structure in the dust. Big vehicles blowing up are good, eyes being gouged out-that's great, but in order to constitute a movie there needs to be some semblance of a storyline, some reason for us to be invested in the characters. The script deficiencies don't stop at a lack of storytelling, the dialogue is extremely sparse and quite literally dumbed-down. It feels as if it's penned by a behavior disorder fifth grader trying to be naughty during language arts. Utter nonsense comes out of characters with inexplicable motivations, histories, or personas. One might think the film's cast, featuring Charlize Theoron and Tom Hardy would be a saving grace. Talented actors as they are, they are adrift in a film that wallows in absurdity and disorganization. Neither actor is developed, and one must ask, why Max had the honor of the film's title? The character of Max in this film is relegated to that of a side character, and a rather uninteresting one at that. The reasons for this are curious and perhaps politically motivated but, regardless, it was a dumb one. Hardy is an incredible talent and to have him so underutilized is perhaps one of the greatest cinematic crimes of 2015. Outrageously terrible. 1.5/5 Stars	0

A striking lack of any real character development for any of the main characters hamstrings what, aside from the absurd visual flares (guitarist on the vehicle, anyone?) could have been a pretty good movie.	0

b5803306-28f6-4254-b1b4-d8c80174ff83	  This movie is fantastic. Mad Max Fury Road feels like it just gulped down a case of 5 hour energy shots all condensed into two hours. To say it is a thrill ride would be an understatement. There is one 5-10 minute scene of the movie where you can catch your breath when they are stopped and trying to figure out where to head, and that is it. The entire movie from the opening second to the finish is packed with non stop fast moving action. Even if you have no idea who the character is or what this movie is about, give it a shot if you are looking for a great action movie. There really isn't too much dialogue at all to talk about. Just know that Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are both really good. And I commend both of them for not being afraid to be part of a movie like this. Some big name actors might find it silly to accept a role in a movie like this with George Miller directing. A 2 hour car chase war with these elaborate man made put together vehicles, it is absolutely awesome to see. You keep waiting to see what the next gang of bandits has in store for the main characters as they are driving across this deserted landscape. It is a downright fun movie with amazing action throughout, surely one of the best movies of the year. God forbid it gets any Oscar attention though, the academy I'm sure is "above" picking films like this, even though they deserve it.	2
130235a0-ab29-4797-9293-f5c080b712d1	  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Some nice special effects, but such a lack of story line that if i hadn't been with friends i would have walked out of the movie theatre. Charlize Theron like always was an amazing actress, and Tom Hardy fulfilled his role, but they could be out doing much better movies, their performance id the only thing that occasionally made this movie watchable. But please don't waste your precious time on this, it is a pointless, senseless jumble of special effects.	0
e00f2b2b-ccd8-4eae-bd3b-c6d54c67be7d	  Does Mad Max: Fury Road have little backstory - and an extremely basic plot? Yes. Does the film reduce its title character to a mere secondary status? Yes. Are there bizarre scenes? Tons. Does Tom Hardy mumble and grunt most of the film? You bet.But all of that is inconsequential to the fact that Fury Road is one of the most visually stunning, engrossing, and glorious films of the year. In an age of overuse of CGI, Fury Road is also a miracle to even exist. But George Miller's proper use of CGI and practicality put other films to shame. This goes for both the stunning scenes of vehicular carnage, as well as the costume designs, including Immortan Joe's mask. This film's cinematography is Oscar-worthy.Charlize Theron gives an iconic performance as Imperator Furiosa. Nicolas Hoult, as Nux, delivers the best character arc of the film. And Tom Hardy - who proved with Locke that he doesn't need to move much to command a fascinating performance - proves that he doesn't need to speak much either to be a captivating. The backstories are implied enough that they don't need to be delved into and fleshed out. What's on the surface is gritty and excellent enough. And the bizarre scenes - including a guitar-wielding flamethrower called the Doof Warrior - add to the film's intensity and post-apocalyptic world-building. Needless to say, Mad Max: Fury Road may be one of the best action thrillers in a long time. It's certainly one of the best films of 2015, by far.	2
5dd8776d-3be7-4738-9432-59ecfd138d02	  An amazing action movie, a shinning light in a sea of mediocrity.	2
8421459b-4ab6-481d-a39a-3cb9c1d5de57	  "If you can't fix what's broken, you'll go insane". This line represents the theme of the entire film and the entire series. Max is a loner running from his past, who eventually finds his humanity again by helping others. Perfect. This film is one of the best of the year. And one of the most breathtaking action flicks in even longer. Definitely a contender for Best Picture, in my opinion.	2
2a02d2f6-9ff6-44d0-918c-855b1c7be05e	  This remake of classic B-movie Mad Max (1979) [the movie that made Mel Gibson a star in one day], is George Miller's attempt to re-film the first (and best known) film of his career with a budget thousand times bigger than the one available in 1979.The result is visually impressive. Absolutely grotesque good and bad heroes fight for gas in a post-apocalyptic future society in a movie that can only be described as post-modern and cyberpunk. The exhilarating action is so intense that even the rotten tomatoes critic got curried away and gave it an almost perfect score (97%). Tom Hardy (known for Inception and The Dark Knight Rises) has become the next big thing in Hollywood due to this remake. Charlize Theron (an absolutely top actress overall) is simply great in the post-feminist role of Imperator Furlosa. Nevertheless, as one might expect, the fight for gas idea, which was original, innovative and to the point in 1979, has not aged very well and seems quite ridiculous today. Still, the movie is top notch as an action film with some very funny moments and you will remember it for some time, not for it's non-existent deeper meanings but for it's overambitious and grotesque cyberpunk environment.Grade: B-	1

896a0341-63c2-4ddb-9eee-86076782cd05	  Fury Road, a�fourth installment in the long dormant Mad Max franchise, feels�simultaneously familiar and inexplicably alien. The desolate backdrop, thrilling chases, and camera work recall The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome but it's all so damn useless. Our long standing hero Max, presumably the character audiences are coming to see, all but�disappears behind�the narratives of new additions�Nux and Furiosa. Why make another Mad Max film if Tom Hardy has to sit�in the passenger seat?Writer/director George Miller never had much success fleshing out back story for his characters or the origin of their world and he seems to have completely lost interest in trying. Viewers who did not see the original trilogy of films are given no understanding of who Max is or why he's fighting for survival alone in the wastes.�Fury Road provides little more information about its�supposed lead than "I used to be a cop" and "Max. My name is Max". Wow. Profound.Friends and fellow reviewers alike have countered these critiques by reminding me of how "beautiful and exciting" the film is. I agree that Fury Road is visually impressive but I'm not sure what's exciting about not using your brain. Tom Hardy grunting�and shooting his way through a thin script certainly doesn't thrill me, no matter how well-lit the sand is. If you want car chases and explosions for hours on end then why not just play the video game?�	0
1e7eb877-2bec-49bf-804d-887e22cfb1d0	  Mad Max Fury Road is an extraordinary movie. The main characters are believable. The set is an nontraditional kinetic display of vehicles. The action has a special rhythm to it, so your eyes don't have to wonder. Lastly, the way the movie is shot is mainly in wide shot; which reveals more of the action.	2

6f718200-b3ce-46d9-92e1-8a2198c250d2	  Alright, I may have been too harsh on Mad Max: Fury Road initially. I still don't think it is in any way a masterpiece, but the action sequences are glorious and at times truly thrilling. George Miller can't be praised enough for avoiding CGI as much as possible, and instead relying on death-defying stunt work, and a huge lot of practical effects. It's hard to imagine how much planning and rehearsal had to go into orchestrating these sequences of pure exhilaration. Still, there is not much beyond the fireworks to hold everything together. The actual story isn't all that compelling or surprising, and a tad more characterization would have been welcome. When it comes to dramatic weight Fury Road is fairly bare bones, to say the least. There are also a lot of stylistic flourishes that I just didn't really care for. With that said, the extended chases are certainly impressive and the cinematography and editing is truly outstanding.	2
fa838cbb-8f85-42d1-805a-1f5faaaf9463	  As a fan of the dystopic movies, I saw the Mad Max trilogy a couple years ago b/c I heard they were shining exemplars of the genre and have great action to boot. I came away disappointed by the lack of an interesting plot to complement the over-the-top action sequences and the post-apocalyptic setting (the two sequels in particular). So you can imagine my excitement when news came of a new sequel. But after seeing rave reviews from friends and critics alike (e.g. this site), I decided to give the franchise another try, expecting somehow this time would be different.Apparently the director decided the problem with his three previous attempts was that there wasn't enough adrenaline and proceeded to make the same mediocre movie, but with everything turned up to 11. So instead of a mere waste time, Fury Road was a spectacular waste of time. I mean this in the literal sense: the action sequences were quite the spectacle and allow us a glimpse of the atavistic savagery that lurks beneath our superficial civility; and the lead actors very much impressed in the physical acting department. But those positives were rendered hollow by a script (one which I can only assume was written by a rather talented 13 year-old) that offers little character development and a plot that can be adequately summed up as (spoiler) "Guy and girl go from point A to point B and back to point A, kill bad guys along the way and save the day". The chases, fights and explosions soon became trite and, after two exhausting hours, something to be tolerated rather than relished. The handful of attempts to humanize the good characters also looked clumsy and forced, as incongruous as the brief tender string interludes amidst the near-constant industrial drumming that filled up most of the run time. In the end, this movie offers neither hope (e.g. Children of Men) nor despair (Brazil), just the anodyne comfort that the good guys won and all is right with the world again -- at least until the next sequel comes along (which shouldn't be long as there is a 5th installment on the way).So in conclusion, if you're looking for 2 hours of mindless vroom and boom interrupted by an alleged plot, this is your flick. But if you appreciate even only an ounce of subtlety and intelligence, avoid this movie like the plague. In fact, if you just want to watch Tom Hardy drive around the whole movie, you would find Locke a far superior alternative.	0

a1f7dbb4-c8c1-4f34-96e9-9d42866c2e1f	  What a Lovely Day Indeed.Writer-Director George Miller has revisited and reinvented his Mad Max franchise quite flamboyantly. In full disclosure, I had no idea that Mad Max was a pre existing franchise until after I saw the first trailer for the film. Although, When I saw Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, I became slightly interested. I believed that these two oozed amazing chemistry. Like the previous installments, there was a nuclear war that led us to this post-apocalyptic world. Food and water are noticeably scarce. From beginning to end, it is non-stop over the top action. It fairly reminded me of the old video game 'Twisted Metal" which we all know is all about absolute mayhem. So many explosions, so many collisions, so much anarchy!!!! This film roars with an absolute vengeance!!!!!! Every aspect of the film is beautiful. The score by Junkie XL was absolutely riveting. It had my heart racing when the action started up and it just felt so perfect. It really placed the film on a more grand scale. This really excites me because XL produced the score for the upcoming film Dawn of Justice, along with Hans Zimmer. So, I am definitely intrigued to see what those two were able to accomplish together. My favorite thing about the film was definitely the camera work. The way that George Miller and John Seale were able to make this world look so visually stunning yet still so destitute is by far some of the best camera work I have seen this year. The rotations and the tracking shots were just wonderful to see. This a film that is made for the big screen. It is absolutely visually stunning. The vehicles they created for this film look like something straight out of a comic book and when you see them you can't help but to stare in awe. It makes this world of desperation something to be slightly desired. The acting definitely is a high point for me as well, because the ball could have easily been dropped if not handled properly. For instance, when Charlize Theron is on screen, she steals every second. She is almost unrecognizable as a tortured soul who has had enough of this so called society. Everything that she does seems so instinctual and sometimes, although justified, barbaric. She really becomes her character and allows herself to be taken into this world.For those that may have grown a bit tired of the post- apocalyptic films that we have been bombarded with over the years, fear not, for Mad Max: Fury Road has successfully changed the game. In the beginning sequence of the film, we meet the eponymous character Max Rockatansky, played by the incomparable Tom Hardy. We quickly realize that he is already in a bit of a pickle. Just from the opening ten minutes, we learn that he's a troubled soul and that he is doing the same thing that everyone else in this world has been forced to do: survive. His survival skills are instantly put to the test once he is captured by the War Boys, the army of Immortan Joe, the film's main antagonist. The capture scene is so well choreographed and so amazing to watch. The world that Miller creates is so unique and beautiful: something that only his mind could conjure up. It's an absolute barren wasteland full of vehicular warfare of the greatest caliber. The film is full of a mass population that looks savage; however, these are just everyday people that are trying to survive. At this time, all that people know is carnage, chaos and catastrophe. Naturally, we should all be able to relate to the survival aspect. There is no order. Only a seemingly tyrannical rule, led by one Immortan Joe. There are some who follow, hence his army of War Boys, and there are some that believe that he is the reason that the world is still the way it is, insert Imperator Furiosa. Fury Road explains how Max, who seems to be a bit of a drifter, meets and works with Imperator Furiosa. Once these two meet up, it is non-stop action. While the action slows down a bit, you learn Furiosa's purpose and it is a rather plausible story arc. As a moviegoer who appreciates dialogue, I was a bit disappointed in some of the writing. Some of it seemed to be forced and other parts seem like they did not belong at all. For example, there is one instance in the film where Miller tries to create some emotional investment between two of the characters. However, in my opinion, it translate well. The film is well paced and at a run time of 2 hours flat, it's a really good film to go see with friends especially if you are an action junkie. Oddly enough, after watching this film, I do not have any interest in viewing the original Mad Max trilogy starring Mel Gibson. I loved this film and I just feel like this is something that can very well stand on its own. A very interesting take on a post apocalyptic world from the Mastermind George Miller. He successfully created one of the best action films I've ever seen.	2

f97053d1-a368-4fd1-9318-1d20ce6889a9	  The effects and setting of the film are pretty cool. I didn't like a lot of the way it was filmed, it was discontinuous, almost like they filmed it slow and used fast motion to make it look more normal. Not much of a plot. Mostly two hours of watching a bunch of cars drive around the desert and people fighting.	1
d7559115-acab-4be9-9fe5-77d7eff21770	  I love the way the women were portrayed in this they were so bad ass. Finally Tom Hardy is getting some world wide recognition that he very much deserves by starring in this movie, no doubt a lot of people will see this movie. Many people were skeptical at first when this movie was announced, however this is a return to form for George Miller the creator of the original movies.	2
0e34fbe6-6608-49dc-8f93-413bbe5667db	  While the background story maybe interesting and a good job done by the actors, stuntmen, special effects and makeup team, the screen play is anything but spectacular. Lack of character development, cheesy dialogue all masked by 2 hours of continuous explosions and brainless action. Quite suitable for those who can appreciate a film with a lack of intelligence.I'm willing to bet most of the hi rated reviews are paid promoters.Enjoy.	0

fccb4b31-e124-414d-ab9d-e04349efd18b	  What a stinker, where is Mel when u need him. They give one of Hollywood's great beauties a stump for an arm. This movie was perfect for a 15 yo male, with no discrimanatory taste. The male lead looked fat, angry, ugly, like he forgot his lines, in different scenes, no acting ability combined with poor direction. I'll bet most of the peeps who watched this never saw the original.	0
0c141fd8-ea55-4bf1-aa9c-eb15a4c6cf82	  Though the action was relentless throughout, the first hour was a little difficult to follow as the dialogue is kept very much to a minimum. The film is essentially a two hour chase movie and because of its basic premise, it was a little too long. Its gender politics is something James Bond could learn from and Tom Hardy is brilliant despite his few lines with his body language alone. The post-apocalyptic world is well made and you can almost smell the petrol but for the most part Mad Max is very loud, bit too long and occasionally listless.	1

e53be022-d49d-4c93-af2f-f934ef1c70eb	  Perhaps not quite as entertaining as The Road Warrior in my opinion, Fury Road is nonetheless a strong installment in George Miller's post-apocalyptic franchise. Despite pacing issues in certain areas and an average story, Mad Max Fury Road has gorgeous cinematography that never ceases to amaze throughout it's run time, insane action sequences coupled by gleefully bizarre characters, vehicles, weapons and clothing design. The performances are adequate as are the characters, and Fury Road is the epitome of a popcorn thrill ride.	2
4206c58e-be47-4bc7-b7f6-5fd8b9f31201	  Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action film of the decade, and one of the year's very best films!	2
1839f196-d2ef-4316-adbe-f8dc619e88c8	  A sequel worth waiting for. By any standard, this is an entertaining and exciting road movie, not dominated by CGI. Action sequences are so well choreographed; you want to see it again. They are filled with fresh ideas and audacity. There is not a boring moment. Tom Hardy's Mad Max is just as alluring too. Let's hope we do not need to wait another 30 years for the next one.	2
2b4c52f5-ada3-4684-a70a-9b1c1321834f	  this is a chase movie with a big budget i gave the original mad max a very low rating but this re-boot is way better. re.4-4.5 its so different to other movies it deserves higher rating.	2
f7bf864b-8de1-48b9-9758-0f9cc3611173	  This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time, if you are going for a movie that doesn't take to seriously in the sence of not being dark and gritty but rather fun for all the family, the cinematography looks outstanding, the colors look like they are to pop out of the screen.	2
91aa180c-0792-4208-9728-dad2c62e3cb4	  Movie of the year. All Australians must see. More Australians in this movie then Western Sydney. The girls are the heroes so is you a feminist this is for you. For more fun check out the movie cast before watching the movie, surprised me, as the history is stunning. And yes Tom Hardy is a great replacement for Mel Gibson. Specially 2015 Mel Gibson. Not shitty like Thunderdome. Closer to MM 2. Watch on big screen with sound up loud. George Millers manipulation of the time frames in scenes makes the movie. You get to See movie, the action is not to fast for the eye. Great movie.	2
3f2093f9-6055-4baf-8a45-1ee149fd41ae	  This movie is one of the most insane and chaotic movies of the summer. With George Miller returning to the helm for another installment of Mad Max, it is our viewing pleasure that we get to witness such a high explosive film. This film stars Tom Hardy, who plays the role of Max, alongside fellow stars Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult. Most of the actors in this movie do a phenomenal job, and even though Tom Hardy's character was the least interesting, he did an amazing job, as always. If we're on the topic of characters, George Miller really fumbled the ball here. Max is definitely the 3rd most interesting character along with being the 2nd strongest character. Charlize Theron's character was definitely put in the spotlight more and she was the bigger bad-ass. I'm not saying this out of opinion, but the movie clearly shows on several occasions that she is the stronger power and even the more interesting. Max had the least amount of depth given to him (which is ironic considering his name is in the title) and he had the most basic, undeveloped back-story you can imagine. They spent more time developing the character of Nicholas Hoult (which was actually a good surprise), rather than developing their main character. This movie though, was filled tons of action and was the equivalent to a 2 hour video game. The cinematography is amazing and everything looks so well done. The CGI is solid for the most part, but the movie does a great job of relying on practical effects and explosions. There were some moments where I felt that the CGI background looked really bad, but other than that, they did a good job of utilizing their budget. On the contrary, watching a video game for 2 hours doesn't leave a whole lot of room for plot development. The movie sports a basic plot that says get from point A to point B. That's all the movie really is. Nothing is really explained and nothing really has meaning. They just see how much action they can fill into 2 hours. Like I said, it makes for an extremely entertaining movie, but I wasn't able to connect to the situation nor the characters. When they tried to develop plot in the movie, it felt like it came to a dead stop. There was a point where nothing was going on and I was actually bored. They seem to throw in random, useless plot elements and it makes me groan. For example, at one point, Max and the crew meet up with these "mothers" that help them fight for their freedom. I'm sure this was connected to the other Mad Max movies, but if it wasn't. then this was the most useless and boring plot device in the movie. They seemed helpless and unnecessary and the whole pit stop derailed the movie. I know it seems like I have a lot of gripes about this movie, but I really don't. It was a great action thriller that was extremely crazy and intense. I love a lot of the unique aspects in this movie and the level of crazy that they go up to. They do things unimaginable to most human beings and it's a really fun summer movie. In the end, Mad Max is certainly worth watching and one that I myself own on Blu-Ray.	2

c29af9f0-1cc8-4cf7-9a0e-2c4a6dec4874	  For a movie with tons of potential, it falls short. Since the film had feminist ideals, everyone automatically loved the film. In terms of the films itself, horrible, stupid, confusing, and pointless.	0
6f680a65-cbb2-4cdf-8a8b-80596907b29b	  One big, rage-fueled drive through a wasteland with no history and no explanation of the characters, this film fails of any drama. The characters are trying to survive a madman, but they have no story, no background, and no hope. Characters die meaninglessly, conventions of the universe are just dropped into the film with no explanation whatsoever, and the plot is indiscernible other than as a pointless fight to the death on a confusing wasteland for reasons that are known only to the characters and not to us.	0
ae1ea942-339d-426f-8ceb-71e845ff4ac3	  Absolute and utter rubbish, I can not believe it has good reviews on here. It's undermined the legitimacy of any rating on the whole site. A car chase one way, then an other,no coherent plot, no development just driving and explosions aimed at a brain dead audience who care not for story, dialogue and a cinematic experience. I despair	0
55b9cd6a-8dc3-4b91-9ec0-688d827c677d	  I don't understand how this movie got such high ratings? I didn't understand anything I watched for 2 hours. Did I need to watch the first one from 1979??? I was 8 and don't remember anything from the movie except the car. What was the silver shit they were spraying in their mouths? Why were they using other people for blood transfusions? Cool special effects, but I still have no other idea what the movie was about.	0

e46dfb26-bdca-44e9-a2ce-2a8f7c1d3e7f	  A proper action movie, and a must watch. Despite a not-so compelling story, and little character development, it stands out in all the other aspects, an action movie could desire for.The main change in cast from Mel Gibson to Tom Hardy, and the character of Furiosa gives a different yet fresh feel from the original series.The action sequences and the carnage is stunning to watch, amidst the arid and difficult landscape.	2
1f952fe7-91a0-4c87-b422-c3819724256f	  Unique and succulently gory, it breaks ground much like 300 did some years ago. Great performances by everyone involved. Few words, lots of excitement.	2

e8e026a7-7c13-460e-9dc5-d1fab1273227	  Physical effects make a triumphant return to the GGI saturated season of summer blockbusters. Max Rockatansky has emerged from the waste land in Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) to show us the light of epic cinema. George Miller gets another bite at the Mad Max apple and produces a Lawrence of Arabia (1962, David Lean, UK) type epic while making a strong feminist statement in a post apocalyptic acid trip fever dream.  I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the uncanny valley but the epic scope of Lawrence of Arabia (1962, David Lean, UK) versus Revenge of the Sith (2005, George Lucas, USA) is apparent to anyone whose viewed both. CGI is helpful and can be a great asset to a filmmaker. Fury Road has over 2,000 visual effects shots[i]. That being said it's not how much CGI you use but how you use it. It's the motion in the ocean not the size of the boat. Often Miller's use of CGI is used to color correct shots, add clouds to the clear Namibian sky, and dessert rocks turned a much richer hue.  After screening Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) themes George Miller was hinting at in Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome (George Miller, AUS, 1985) became much clearer. The Triple Goddess helps redeem Max when he is at his most feral, his humanity holding on by a shred and our titular hero can only manage guttural sounds in lieu of language. Tom Hardy plays the titular character in this latest Mad Max incarnation. Max fights to protect the maiden or in this case maidens. He is aided and rescued by the mother and in this case the mother is the warrior Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron crushes this role), and lastly he is aided by the crone. In Miller's post apocalyptic wasteland the crone is a bunch of motorcycle driving, seed toting, rifle shooting bad ass grandmas. At one point Max washes blood off his hands using the contents of a tanker full of mother's milk.The themes in Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) are often not subtle but don't seem heavy handed in a movie that has little to no exposition. In an era when movies find it necessary to have a pseudoscience explanation for our super heroes and science fiction it's refreshing to have a movie not crow bar in needless exposition. Much like Sergio Leone Miller uses action and his actor's body language and facial expressions to convey story instead of relying on dialogue. In Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) there's no time to waste with monologues as the drums of war beat in the distance and a war party race towards you and among them is flame throwing guitar player strapped to a flat bed full of speakers racing down the dessert with dozens of other maniacs painted white. Oh did I forget to mention the maniacs in white body paint drive hot rods that have gentlemen with explosive spears ridding atop them.  I've heard the notion bandied around that George Lucas is treated unfairly by adult fans who didn't like the prequels. That the movies were not bad they were just now adults and not the target audience as they were in 1977. Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) takes that thesis and crumples it up and tosses it in the rubbish bin. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (George Miller, AUS, 1981) & the Star Wars trilogy live in the same sweet spot in my pre-adolescent heart. In fact they are probably neighbors and enjoying going over each other's homes for summer BBQs or drinks around the holidays. Coincidently they live down the street from Raiders of Lost Ark (Steven Spielberg, USA, 1981). If my review hasn't been clear up till now stop reading this and go see this movie NOW!By Jake Cohen5 out of 5 Martin Riggs(s). RECOMMEND	2

Film is 100 years old and change, and in that time i have seen most every version of the car chase and fight, then mad max comes along and give you 2 hours of action you have never seen before. George Miller does a flawless job of creating and executing this set pieces as well as creating a unique and intriguing post apocalyptic world. This film has strong feminist undertones evening without a complicated plot. Several times the question is asked "who killed the world?" and its clear it wasn't the women. In a time of pretty wise cracking super heroes this throwback style seems so fresh. Possibly the best film of this year.	2

Daring in both ideas and imagery, a spectacular carnival of carnage that puts most other blockbusters to shame.	2

She is as good as she's ever been in this. We know we're going to guess a lot of stuff before it happens, but how it happens and how it's filmed make this a thoroughly enjoyable romp, breathing a solid breath of gasoline fumes into the franchise.

36ac48fb-5785-4476-8a17-254057e34bac	  Where in Valhalla did "Mad Max: Fury Road" (2015) come from...? For years it was nothing more than a ghost story, limping along in production hell, until finally its trailers released and piqued little to no interest. Now, with the feature finally in cinemas, an unwitting audience has had its eyes opened and re-emerged crazed and amazed. Without warning, "Mad Max" has become a must-see theatrical experience and required viewing for filmgoers and filmmakers alike....Don't skip what I just wrote. Must-see is what I put, and must-see is what I mean. This is an unexpected hit that has shaken audiences in the most awe-inspiring and thrilling way imaginable. After a decade of planning, George Miller has finally shown his hand and taken the world by storm - electrical sandstorm, to be precise. After making children's movies for the past couple decades, Miller somehow convinced the studio that he was fit to direct a sequel, not a reboot (the Hollywood weapon of choice), to a film series that hadn't been popular for 30 years. In addition, he seems to somehow have maintained complete creative control over a property of which many millennials (read: target audience) have little to no knowledge. How he pulled this off is a mystery and a miracle - and one of the best things to happen to movies in a long time."The Avengers: Age of Ultron" (2015) has been hotly anticipated, but this summer belongs to the mad.It is simply the most gorgeous, exhilarating film I have seen all year. Breathtaking action is conducted with balletic precision; Miller masterfully leads the eye from beat to beat, giving his scenes room to breathe and his audience a broad scope to behold. He is not afraid to pull back and let every element of his rich, textured world be absorbed, studied, and most importantly, understood in the midst of incredible chaos. The direction and editing stands in stark contrast to the claustrophobic, frenetic camerawork that has dominated action films over the past decade.It's been reported that Miller spent the years leading up to production crafting every element of this post-apocalyptic future in the greatest detail. From mechanical body art and dashboard decor to endless storyboards and a choreography of violent, perpetual motion, Miller's own gleeful madness has crafted a movie so eye-popping in its reality that repeat viewings are a happy necessity. The camera brilliantly frames and deftly tracks through increasingly intricate, explosive, and dynamic chase scenes with deft purpose.Cinematographer John Seale presents us with generously saturated shots, resplendent with deep blues and fiery reds. Even the night scenes are a triumph of art: Seale overexposed these shots during daylight before giving them their midnight blue tint, thus allowing the shade and depth of the elements to be captured and clarified in the dark. Even if you hate everything else about the movie (impossible), it's intensely beautiful just to look at.Although titled "Mad Max", Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron absolutely share the lead, with the warrior Imperator Furiosa given just as much narrative depth - if not more - than Hardy's wild dog of a Max. Like Max, Furiosa is a professional badass - even with a missing hand. Their gradual alliance is destined to be one of the most classic pairings in cinema. The nihilistic Max is put to the test by the idealistic Furiosa, her sense of morality a bright light in a dark future. In turn, Furiosa's gambit against Hugh "I Played Toecutter" Keays-Byrne's tyrannical Immortan Joe proves disastrous without Max's honed, remorseless instincts. Both the hero and anti-hero plunge into the insanity with only a faint hope of rising above their personal tragedies.Significant portions of the thundering soundtrack are played by Immortan Joe's own band on the run, a raging, tireless team of drummers led by a mutant guitarist shredding an axe so rock 'n' roll that it literally spurts flames. The absurd concept is a wonderfully bizarre choice for the film and a terrible temptation for those of us forced to drive the speed limit on the way home."Mad Max: Fury Road" is a spectacular victory in filmmaking and has rightfully earned its status as a new standard for action movies. Its balance of practical, in-camera effects with tangible CGI imagery, coupled with Miller's patient planning and meticulous layout of his story, is exactly why a movie that could've been another run-of-the-mill action flick has instead become an instant classic....What a film! WHAT A LOVELY FILM!!	2
531d6547-e822-44b6-ae11-d7316dcc8fa8	  The best description for this movie that I can come up with is that it's like a combination of Looney Tunes (Road Runner & Wily Coyote), Fast & Furious, and Mario Kart on STEROIDS! While the story and plot are very simplistic, the visual elements of Mad Max are all amazing to witness (WITNESS ME!). From the practical action sequences to the undeniably incredible production values and stellar acting, MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is definitely an over-the-top masterpiece.	2
304faa7b-0658-4291-add2-741a23c3f40a	  A woman has to drive a car from point A to point B. Then she turns left. what follows is a thrillride like no other that will leave you breathless by the end. This movie will ride eternal, shiny and chrome.	2
6c3c8463-27b7-48d9-bdb5-b77e81be58e4	  Fury Road will make you question if you've seen a real action movie lately. With non-stop sequences and a fantastic ensemble, you are never disappointed.	2

f53e3ebe-fd15-45e5-88cb-6f5b087694b7	  It's not often that remakes can match the original. In this case, it's my opinion that this remake surpasses the original in many ways. The film is dark and light in equal amounts and Hardy & Theron are outstanding. Special mention for art direction & set design.	2

6e7497df-5520-4bda-9387-26ebb5dfb2fd	  Mad Max is amazing. Pure adrenalin awesomeness. Editing is wonderfully coherent for the action scenes. Really wanna see a how it was made of it. Theron was fantastic.	2
c497b2d2-9674-4667-bf78-8772726ac756	  Impressive hyperkinetic action movie, redefining the standards of the genre.Top visuals and consistency. 3D is a must.Dusty deserted landscapes makes you cough. Don't drink too much coffee before watching it!	2
f5420a60-d0d1-4899-b1af-7071bbf89338	  Excellent action, excellent effects, and excellent performances. The title however, should read, "Mad Furiosa". But that's not a bad thing.	2

f27cc9ae-a645-470b-b640-4dbcc257bcbf	  It is certainly a visual and aural feast and a stunt junkie's wet dream but without much else it does get a bit tiresome. There is very little character development and why it is called Mad Max is beyond me, he is practically a nothing character in this. There are a few interludes where characters take a breath to let us know why we should care about what is going on then off they go again and we realise we don't.	1

842c019f-1281-4585-908d-77cfec0fe0cb	  Really stupid movie that is absolutely nothing but a 2 hour chase scene. Now, I like chase scenes as much as anyone, but not for the entire movie and not in lieu of a plot. Any plot. Not even anywhere close to the originals.	0

10ba5cba-2d62-4a67-96b0-a0fefe0e4d86	  I was really really young when the first movie of Mad Max came out and it was kind of weird. I liked it back then but for obvious reasons it kind of scared me, so it was a bittersweet feeling back then. Watching this one, I kind of went down the memory lane and really enjoyed it! It was both nostalgic but also intense for me, and it did not let me down in terms of effects or the general feeling I had imprinted in my mind! The acting was OK, and I am not sure if it really matters. The movie is so action packed and intense that even less talented actors could have pulled it off I think. I was amazed by the costumes, the make up, the vehicles, everything! The music of the movie was so good! I liked the "bad guys" as they seemed and were really really bad and I enjoyed every minute of the chase that goes on for almost the entire movie! The fiction part was there, but it's something you expect in such movies.I was really really close to rate it with a 9 out of 10, but I decided that an 8 is closer to the truth based on other movies of the genre. If I could, I would give an 8.5 to it!	2

b0fc3ceb-49b2-45bb-bc52-afd653161ebe	  Mad Max Fury Road could quite possibly be the best film of 2015, it came out in May and I still have not seen anything better, and we are in November. The action is amazing, some of the best action sequences ever put to film. Furiosa is really the main character of this film as she drives the plot quite literally, Max really only says a few things the entire movie, he is still badass though. The practical effects are what make this movie worth seeing, they could have easily done these amazing action scenes with a computer but that would take away the immersion and this movie would not be what it was, the only drawback is that there is a time when the film really slows down and it gets kinda boring. 4.75/5	2
8ce26176-b6ff-4343-aa54-9eb1875e13c2	  In this fast-paced chase that doesn't stop moving, George Miller finds himself directing not just the movie, but the viewer also. Taking us on a Rip-roaring ride for the ages.	2
f87046ee-246a-4d4d-b1a9-5e1f3b4f2796	  What a disappointment. Only the third movie that I've left mid way. Does no justice the the 1st and 2nd in the set	0
85a784a8-4250-4ee3-ac71-35eaad8cee80	  Is it any good? Yes, it's exceptional. Is it as crazy as it looks? Crazier. Did Tom Hardy deliver? Absolutely, he nailed those thirteen or so lines.	2
12fe21cb-8384-42ea-ac4e-78b0c91dd19a	  great film full on action and not over the top.	2
4f4e0fd8-7ed2-4f69-b851-b98fc76182ad	  Hands down one of the best and most artistic action films I've ever seen. Highly recommended. I'll be watching out for Mr. Hardy now!	2
24d6fe5b-de5e-467d-97fa-386798bce5a3	  How, oh how, can the critics have got this so wrong? Incessant, witless, virtually plotless cartoon action, devoid of everything that made the previous Mad Max films terrific.	0
c4a4cbbb-6c0c-4b86-b452-5f3a832d0c5d	  This one is like an aquarium screensaver, it looks cool but is not something you want to sit and watch for two hours.	0

ed246846-bb63-4635-9b5d-c6f786edea8a	  I am a huge fan of Tom Hardy, he is a very talented actor that commands the screen and seems to be very versatile, however because once again he goes through the film grunting and mumbling I have had to know half a star off. At first I thought he was going to attempt an Aussie accent but soon went straight back into Bain. Nevertheless I do believe he controlled the screen well! The storyline itself was good, simple yet easy to relate and gave a good sense of morality. The main stand out element to this film was the superb special effects and stunts which has been one of the best I've seen within the last 10 years. The film itself knows exactly what it is and plays well upon it, high octane, none stop, balls out action! Contender for film of the year...please stop grunting Tom...	2
886e7d82-c228-4da5-8496-3a4cc4f1a090	  It could have last 45 minutes less, and so doing concentrating action and sparing some useless footage. A lost occasion for a better movie. Back to life? Naiiing the coffin, I would rather say.	0
857f6e54-3508-4fec-9388-3220ed6b9054	  One of the weirdest movies I ever seen.	2
9c25da6a-92a8-4734-890f-3123e8830748	  One of the very best action films ever made, Fury Road is a testament to what all movies should strive to be: A medium so creative it transports us to places our minds couldn't even possibly conceive themselves. The post-apocalyptic world and society in the film is fascinating to examine, and the action sequences that take place within them will have audiences' collective jaws on the floor for the two hour non-stop thrill ride. A 21st century masterpiece.	2
e29659bb-700c-4735-9950-7b30281829b2	  Containing many, many car chases with lots and lots of thrills and spills along the way, it took me a while to settle in to this action blockbuster. Helped along by some touching human elements and occasional comical ones, 'Mad' Max is strangely the most 'normal' character in the film.	1
ed0ca817-16f1-400d-9a9a-f13585f266e2	  Great art direction, strong characters. Great FX.Only notice, I felt like the ending was a little rushed, especially when the middle was that developed.	2
c1f4cc32-ccc3-46a4-a108-40102afcba19	  Mad Max: Fury Road, much like its protagonists, operates on sheer force and drive (pun intended). The thrills and style of this movie are unmatched.	2

38581a97-2f73-402a-bac0-604d927cd51f	  So much action! It was non-stop! Even I was exhausted by the time the movie was over and I watched it from my couch while wearing my pjs.	2
9614c6a5-8a58-46d9-9bbc-c9c32771ee9c	  A glorious symphonic ballet of wanton destruction whose visual poetry dazzles and amazes. Whereas the current popular political correctness deems all life as precious, this weekend jaunt through the local park with the baby in the stroller yells to differ (reminding one of exactly what planet one dwells on). Standing ovation for George Miller, whose charming eloquence about the well hidden truth of modern society is jaw-droppingly stunning. The best apocalyptic vision seen for some time.	2
de62c255-a899-4d16-939c-e324fc5133de	  The movie is beautiful. But Max is not good like Mel Gibson!!!	2

28ae7bba-c8ab-4e44-b944-8086bcfc7955	  I expected to see stylized visuals, amazing action scenes, and awesome backdrops and settings. However, the film's plot and narrative were great surprises. They are both far better then I could have imagined. There are some very minor nitpicks that I can make. However, they do not draw away from what is a great movie, and one I would recommend to anyone.	2

aae2628a-b6a5-40fb-9b2c-1c766edf84c8	  This is a mesmerizing and beautiful cinematic experience that has shaken the film as a whole and resurrected the action genre from the deepest of depths. This film is glorious, magnificent, mad, and raw. Above all, Mad Max Fury Road is a masterpiece, and will stand the test of time as the greatest that cinema has to offer. Thank you George Miller, thank you.	2
4d46d2ac-42a2-446a-9a0e-53f9e8acc092	  May be I was expecting too much, but this feels like retelling of an old story.... everything is predictable. Just ended up watching it for the action....	0
5e08a4b7-623c-44e8-897d-af6fb7947eaf	  I would say that this movie is pretty much the kind of movie that I expected it to be. That being said I think it was a bit softer than I hoped it to be. I think that, again, the Hollywood plonkers have opted to make a movie that got a more palate rating (to them and their cash registers) than what it should have been. It is not as obvious as with Robocop and a few other movies but the feeling is there.It is still a fairly entertaining movie. It is of course yet another special effects movie and as such it does not disappoint. It differs from a lot of the usual special effects movies in that the effects are pretty down to Earth in a bizarre way. We are not talking about superheroes or near magical technologies here but instead we have a devastated landscape, scrounged together equipment and a totally ludicrous desire to blow up the last remains of human civilisation. The bizarre vehicle designs and the totally ridicules behaviour of a lot of people in this movie is alone worth watching it to be honest.As with the previous Mad Max movies this one stretches the bounds of reality (I hope) when it comes to human behaviour and how they waste the few precious resources, specifically gasoline and bullets, that remains after the apocalypse. It provides some spectacular scenery but it also puts a bit of "what the f..." feeling to it all. Not that this part is not expected from a Mad Max movie though.What I think was my latest let-down in the movie was the Mad Max character itself. To me he is supposed to be a real bad-ass. In this movie he was not really that impressive. He certainly was far from the original Mad Max character in my opinion and was really overshadowed by the Furiosa character. I could have lived with that if this character would have been really impressive but she was not. She was cool but she was still underwhelming when comparing to anything in the original bad-ass Mad Max universe. I would say that Tina Turner and Mel Gibson still rules!Still it is a decent futuristic, apocalyptic action movie, maybe not living up to this old movie geeks expectations, but not at all a wasted movie evening. The sound track of the Blu-ray certainly gave my subwoofer an exercise as well.	2
0e78b39c-f803-4124-bb11-1be62c1343fd	  A superb film packed with intense edge of your seat action, powerhouse performances and a fresh sense of absolute craziness which carries throughout the entire run time. It's a fun, entertaining and thrilling chase film with compelling characters, perfectly choreographed action and suspense. Not to mention, it is utterly unpredictable. By far one of the best films I have seen all year and absolutely gets an A*.	2
2dd10ffa-aebe-4892-922a-6bfc1a42094d	  Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best action movies i have ever seen. It has redefined the action genre and had the best practical effects i have ever seen.this movie does have some flaws, one being when you think back the story was't the greatest. Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicolas Hoult and Hugh Keays-Byrne all give outstanding performances.	2

7be24b85-3bdf-49c8-a22c-fab31a897fa4	  This movie is way better than I thought it would be. It's mindless action fun, of course, but it's an incredible ride, an adrenaline rush from start to finish.� I honestly cannot believe that this is the same director that did the first Mad Max films more than 30 years ago.� The direction is so fresh and energetic, it seems like someone MUCH younger with a fresh perspective on action films would be responsible for such a film.� I'll admit that I was never a fan of the first films (never even saw the third) and found them exceptionally boring.� This film is a complete 180 of the originals, it's jam-packed with action, action and more action.� And it's all awesome.� The whole film is a series of car-chase/fight scenes (Car chases!� Fights!� Fights on top of cars!), yet it never gets boring.� It's visually eye-popping, everything is well-choreographed and composed, and the stunt-work is freakin' incredible.� Luckily, there are some moments of down time where we do get to learn a bit about the� characters. It's just enough to let the audience catch its breath, then off it goes again.� The film doesn't bother explaining the hows and whys of this dystopian future, but shows you the world and society as it is now, complete with a culture that is surprisingly well-developed.� The story isn't that deep or compelling, but it's got more substance than I expected it to.� The acting is solid too, especially by Charlize Theron, who is completely believable as a badass (don't let the title fool you, this movie is Theron's show).�� I do wish there had been a little more explanation of the backstory, sometimes the story and characters' motivations get a bit murky... but there is simply not enough room for that in the movie like this, it would have disrupted the flow.� This movie is pure action spectacle and raw entertainment.� It's a Wham Bam Thank you Ma'am, and everything a summer action flick should be.	2

Sometime I like a movie better but not worse, this one breaks that. 98% to a movie I would give 15% and that is for special effects and because Charlize Theron.

24ce95b0-bfff-4393-8693-84ebc7f9514d	  Mad Max: Fury Road was far from a perfect film but it was much more enjoyable than I anticipated. It was exciting, the acting was great, the story (yes, unlike what you've been told there's actually a story) was captivating and, while not really all that original, it felt fresh and unique in how it was told. Overall, this was very entertaining and I look forward to future installments. The negatives were that Charlize Theron has way too large of a role. Even in the trailer and promotional posters, she's clearly the star. Does this hurt the film? Not necessarily but it feels unnecessary. The story should've focused more on Max. We got almost no backstory for his character whatsoever and he maybe speaks a dozen lines. The other element that was a weak point was that some of the scenes were a bit too ridiculous. I expect some of it but not to the extent where you have a guy standing on top of a vehicle traveling at high speeds through the desert while playing an electric guitar with flames coming out of the tip. Yeah, that happens.	2

ce0d9fcc-4f01-4711-8c4e-3dca790eb96b	  While Fury Road is superior to it's predecessors and profits from interesting characters, clever dialog, some great make-up and costume design and fantastic use of practical effects rarely seen nowadays, it also suffers from a lack of a compelling story and fails to take advantage of Tom Hardy's suitable portrayal of Max Rockatansky.	2
af96af02-437a-4b6b-b399-6600c400dd63	  I was worried at first, what with all the hype, that this existentially 2-hr chase movie would be an underwhelming pile of tripe. Of course, it is a very simplistic action blow-em up. Characters are archetypes, dialogue comes with a fair amount of spittle, and there are no real revelations here. It is really succeeds best at drawing you in visually and not letting go. You are chained to this balls-out burst of blood and oil spectacle which hurtles along at such a pace that thinking too reflexively is not advised. There has been much made of the film's feminist elements, and they are intentional and well-intended. However, it falls short in the end; as the plot still relies on the trope of the strong silent man with the brave plan whom the queen needs to convince her to not despair and risk the messy death again to do the "logical" thing. Come for the satisfying crunch of righteous fury, stay for a captivating sequence of explosions.	2

d30daf7c-c43a-40bb-bdff-7dd3ced63985	  This movie is completely crazy and full of weird characters. But if you watched the other movies from the series, you know that this is what you expect when you go see a Mad Max movie. With that in mind this is an amazing ride full of action and crazy car chases with a little bit o story here and there.	2

e5d9229c-9748-40b8-9ac4-117b0e5bc06a	  A headbanging thunderous movie with enough action to fill several more sequels - the guitar guy alone could have his own movie! Awesome summer popcorn madness.	2
992fa8f0-7dbd-480c-b2b4-087af369e1c5	  Far and away the best action picture of 2015 (and possibly of all time), Mad Max: Fury Road crackles with outstanding visual design, superb narrative symbolism, and fascinating editing. There isn't a boring second in the whole picture.	2
2f37671c-a3d7-4a91-a524-576a87d0371e	  I gotta say, a lot of people hyped this movie up big time, and I feel like it didn't meet such high expectations. A second watch is probably in order. Nevertheless, it was a highly entertaining action flick. You can leave plot at the door, it's all about crazy action, and it does crazy action very well. Despite being a gritty story, visually its beautiful.	2
dfd57d41-187e-47a1-a215-cb54544ac814	  Really great visuals and really great action. Characters range from "meh" to good. Hardly anything that can be called a story. Sadly, doesn't live up to all the hype it's been given. It wasn't really meant to be much more than a really good action flick, but, at least for me, that can't make it a great film. At least not as good as I was led to believe.	1
14fbfcac-d9f4-4e62-b638-f51a54f0095f	  Rarely a film of such epic scale has come with so much anticipation and mystery all at once. The long delayed George Miller 's fourth Mad Max film in the franchise is finally hitting the screens and let me tell you, the 30 years gap between Thunderdome and Furry Road was well worth the wait. The film is actually more a reboot than a sequel and it's maybe for the best. Mastermind G. Miller is back with the most incredible slice of dystopian madness you'll ever experience at the movies these days. When everything look and feel the same with avalanche of CGI and total lack of depth, Miller manages to give his film not only heart and guts but a look absolutely unique and beyond anything I have seen so far. Combining the best of technology and old school film making this new episode of the adventure of the lone desert 'Samurai' has a taste of madness like you will rarely see. Inspired by paintings of Dali and Goya for the visuals and probably a few more, the film plays like a massive chase across the desert, restless and uncompromising, nightmarish as hell but gorgeous as can be. Many themes are tackled along the chase and Miller seems to have understood a long time ago that men are beasts with no real future unless women take control and bring back the necessary balance our world needs if we wish to survive and have a future. The character of Furiosa is shown as an equal to Max and some scenes show them looking very similar to each-others, both broken and desperate for redemption. This films manages to bring back the old school adventure flick, a no brainer on the outside but with a lot of depth if you look closer. Miller is a genius on his own, shots after shots he builds a tension of a rare intensity and manages to offer to his audience a film that will definitely surprise a lot of people through it's unusual pace, messages and visuals. The soundtrack is amazing with a lot of percussions during the chases across the desert, pushing the madness as to have a group of drummers playing on the rooftop of a truck and a heavy metal player blasting his flame thrower guitar while chained to one of the trucks. By now you have figured out that you are dealing with a film like no others, filled with images from another world. It will take me a few days to recover from the experience because i haven't been thrilled by a film this much since El Topo of legendary director A. Jodorowski. By now all hope is for another episode soon, a Mad Max: Furiosa would be quite thrilling, let's only hope mister Georgy won't wait 30 years this time... (BTW did i mention that i have seen the film 11 times in all the movie theaters of the Bay Area? You are a fan or a foe...)	2
e4f8e97b-fa62-4fcf-90fd-3d86d182d054	  Mad Max: Fury Road. It's been 30 years since the last time we experienced the escapades of Max Rockatansky and his leader-clad dystopian future. Were the years of waiting worth it? Hell yeah! but not as much as everyone thinks. Of course, it's an action movie, and a phenomenal one at that. Fast-paced, outlandish, and incredibly creative driving sequences make up a decent portion of the film, and these scenes are incredible. But of course, this is what everyone is expecting. I'm noticing very few people are asking "how's the story?" or "how about the characters?" or "how does a dystopian future lead to cult driven biker gangs?" This is the biggest problem with the film, nothing is explained. Why is Max captured by the strange cult? Who is Immortal Joe? How does he have control of all the water? What is the basis of his religion? Who is Furiosa? Why is she leading this convoy? What's the story of all the other gangs? Are they friendly with each other? enemies? Why do Joe's minions spray chrome on their face? Why is Max really involved in all this? All these questions and more will NOT be answered in this film. This is what turned me away during my second viewing of this film. There's a lot of sacrifice of character development and filing in plot holes to make room for all the action. But in theory, that's what Mad Max is. The only film that really had slow moments and focused on the story was Beyond Thunderdome, a film that's overblown by the other two, as well as getting lost in the 80's. At the end of the day, that's all Fury Road is, a chase movie. Although I personally prefer Road Warrior if I'm watching a chase movie. But Mad Max is definitely a great addition to the emerging genre of the Secretly Smart Dick Flicks	2
b1c9362f-337e-4ddd-ae39-ddca4b498ef9	  Even at the beginning, there's no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.The film shares Max Rockatansky's (Tom Hardy) adventures. Max is an ex highway patrolman. He's been haunted by the past, by family he never saved. He meets the Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is being pursued by the dictatorial Wasteland leader "Joe". Furiosa reaches for Max for help in keeping the 'Five Wives'-women she brought with her-into safety, as Joe's deranged breed of warriors called The War Boys, that are barely humans, are raging across the desert to capture them. This pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape, suddenly sending them into a game of survival.After a rip-roaring opening chase sequence, Max is held captive in the Citadel, the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader "Joe" is ruling over. The grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land. This brings the entire populace crippling under his control. As for Max, he becomes merely a blood bag for Nux (Nick Hoult) one of Joe's War Boys, who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader, who has promised them the glory of getting into Valhalla, the promised land.Everything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur, even the feverish chase, even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence. Miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clich�s and retreads, surging into the cinemas, today. It's a visual feast, but surprisingly, with sense. It's explosive in every unimaginable ways, but it's not devoid of a human story, which in this case, is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movie's payroll. Tom Hardy is utterly capable as the main hero, but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on Theron's character. At some point, there would be a sense that Max isn't the only one playing under the spotlight, as it gets evident Furiosa is equally as massive as his role is. Hardy here is singularly stunning, playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required. His mission transcends past his emotional torments and he's never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past. Same can be said with Furiosa, who is not only running from Joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip, but also to bring every woman into safety, back to freedom where they belong.Much of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of Joe's subjugated land, while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way. It's like it doesn't know how to stop, and if it does, that's surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece. There's an enigmatic style Miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world, and it keeps the momentum in tack, if not ever progressing. The tone of the movie, all those vividly dark colors, that magically shifts from something to another, imparts a drowning experience, only it's enjoying and looks festive to the eyes. This makes every eye-squashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza, turning all those burning combustions, metal blasts, and endless pursuits, from mere technical marvels into a hair-raising escapade.Amid these sanity-grabbing action sequences, though, is an emotional streak that keeps Max and Furiousa's humanity alive. This prompts them to survival, into carrying out their similar humane causes, clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society. This turns the movie into something visceral, cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand. It will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives. This needs to be experienced, felt, and forever cherished. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, ignites eternal fire, and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history	2
0d95a146-41bd-4d6f-a7a3-0daf9f7eb2a8	  Good action and good special effects. Story... nothing special. Theron but specially Hardy cannot show their best...	1
c16010f8-0bdf-4ea9-b8f8-dc5410d23813	  If you're into nonstop action and gore, you'll love this critically acclaimed flick. I enjoyed George Miller's Fury Road as much as the next viewer, but I still couldn't help feeling a little empty based on the lack of actual involvement of the titular character. I get Charlize Theron's Furiosa is vital to the progression of the series, but I need more participation from Max. Nonetheless, it's a worthwhile watch. The coolest random bit of this summer was the flamethrowing guitar guy. Amazing stuff.	2
c8cb6524-e521-417e-99fb-ad95b7b5595b	  Best action movie ever. I saw it three times in the theaters.	2
1e2a62e3-3901-44a9-a475-933c794852a6	  Not my type of movie, but well done. A mess of a plot, hard to follow.	1
879e6ada-0e83-428d-9a19-52efe05138b3	  This movie in a nutshell: Victoria's Secret supermodels, one of which is pregnant, run off with Bane from Batman and a really butch amputee Charlize Theron across a barren wasteland, while being chased by the characters of Twisted Metal. Basically, the plot of Waterworld with even crazier characters, but on dirt. At least the cinematography was pretty impressive.	0
c5932a92-8266-4641-833f-eb209c1a1e77	  "Visceral" is the word most often associated with Fury Road, and it's the right word to describe this film. Everything is satisfyingly crunchy, from the roar of deranged V8 rat rods and muscle cars, to the spectacular action sequences, to the colour-saturated landscape, to the pounding soundtrack, capped off by the unforgettable flame-throwing, guitar-wielding, red-onesie-clad Doof Warrior.From the moment it starts, you'll be dragged along for a pulse pounding chase across the desert. It's a simple enough story, but it's obvious from the start that plenty of thought has been put into constructing this dystopian reality. Small touches will jump out at you, like the intricately designed roof of the War Rig or the ritual scarification of the war boys, that will complete your sense of immersion in this world.The only reason it doesn't get the full five stars is because of the lack of Australian humour, although even that appears in places, and for a touch of sentimentality that jars somewhat with the nihilistic survival themes that characterise the Mad Max films.Other than that, so close to perfect that it doesn't matter! Greatest film of 2015, hands down!	2

6f851970-1eb4-4162-aa65-a0ea35e0a144	  While moderately overhyped. Mad Max: Fury Road is still a really good movie. In fact I will go to as far and say that its pretty great. And for someone who is not too familiar with the other mad max movies I can safely say that anyone who hasn't seen them will find a lot to enjoy and it may introduce new fans of The series. While Tom Hardy may not share much resemblance to Mel Gibson He does a good job at making the role his own as well as preforming some great stunt work which is what I want to see from this guy. But by far the best Character/performance in the Whole movie is Charlize Theron as Furiosa who steels the entire show and makes it her movie. In fact she is more of a hero than max is in this movie. Visually this movie is absolutely fantastic. This movie is gorgeous to look at if this film wins the Oscar for best Cinematography I will not be disappointed. The number 1 thing fans go for in this kind of film is the action and boy do we get a lot of it. The action scenes pretty much take up take up almost the entire movie and to say that it keeps you on the edge of your seat would be an understatement. But once in a while the film slows down so that we can learn more about the characters especially Furiosa now granted it is very short lived just so that we can get back to the action but I at least give the filmmakers for at least trying for trying to help us latch on to the main character and making us feel for them during the action scenes. Also did why is no one talking about Nicolas Hoult in the movie. He did a great job and I really felt sorry for his character. My only problems with the film would be that the flash backs that max kept having did get a little overused. Yes we get it movie he has a dark past you had 3 Movies to establish this. Also the Villain was really underdeveloped but with a good look and a bad ass voice that does not matter. All around a great film and probably the best experience watching a movie in a while.	2
0e5546d1-4caa-4863-989b-d05d1d8b6528	  Simply one of the best action movies ever made!	2
8b7fc5cb-19ef-48c2-9901-37edfa60bce5	  For a movie that's essentially one super-long chase scene (with pit stops), it packs a huge amount of narrative power. Character arcs are well-defined, histories are intriguingly hinted at, and the world-building is mind-boggling. And all this done in the midst of spectacular action sequences. But what strikes one the most is how ANGRY it is (as if the "Fury" in the title and character named "Furiosa" weren't obvious enough) - angry at the state of women in a destructive patriarchal society such as the world we live in. And that is the reason why this could very well be a game-changer.	2
b93e1dcc-0739-4de9-a919-2ae0ec439ade	  A great revival to the series. We needed a new one after thunderdome.	2
cfac0a09-aa45-495e-991c-29e5cd5c8741	  The best action movie in years.	2
2b596eb9-77d9-44bd-97c4-2561d7a523c4	  Tom Hardy is constrained even without the face mask, however it's adrenalin, over-the-top action that fuels this bonkers desert race. Hugely enjoyable from mad start to mad finish.	2
46cbe57d-9ae4-408e-b6e6-5de05b0e6250	  Not quite as good a story as the originals, and Mel Gibson boasts a better 'mad max', however the visuals happened to be very engrossing and wonderful to look at.	2
a31f55f5-db6f-4ccd-9b23-a9e32277853c	  I was really looking forward to this film because it got such good reviews and a couple friends said how much they liked it. I thought that there wasn't really much of a story. It was just a lot of mind numbing action and explosions. All of that was really cool to watch, burt there wasn't much more to the film than that. I think the best thing about the film, that made it interesting to me, was the way in which it was filmed. Visually, it was a very unique and interesting film, and I I liked that aspect very much, but the story was pretty simple. I was expecting more.	1
6df9ec99-88df-436a-ae27-6f510962d510	  Wafer-thin plot, but the shear creativity of the visuals and out-and-out lunacy of the stunt-work make for an incredible and exciting two hours.	2
b1fef7ee-6e24-46bb-810e-1f9c8eb2be84	  might I just say if you want to kill 2 hours with amazing action and fun this is the way to do it.	2
6b343537-923a-4b94-bde5-029e0961d3c1	  A thrill ride from start to finish, Fury Road sets a new archetype for modern day action movies, and most will fail to compete. Fury Road just goes to show what can be accomplished with commitment to vision and piratical effects.	2
19688a61-3ebb-4604-acb1-469d6ee5eae5	  THIS. This is an action movie. I hate action movies because the stories are often vapid. The story in Mad Max: Fury Road is meaningful, It's powerful. And it's matched only by the stunning cinematography. This movie is gorgeously shot and perfectly edited. Every action scene is natural. It isn't forced, even if there are some very choreographed scenes. It works. And considering the movement of the vehicles as these shots take place, it feels real. I'm sure there are some effects used, but the scale is epic and reminds me of the intensity of the chariot races in "Ben-Hur." Simply said, this movie is brilliant.	2
e7285ed1-cbcd-4f41-a40c-14a707b894f3	  God this movie is "Mad" fun! Yes, the movie takes it's time to develop but it's an awesome ride till the end. Over-the-top stunts, great speed and mild gore with the occasional laugh moments (The GUITAR GUY is awesome). Catch this movie if you can... Perhaps stop thinking much about the story and you will be in for a hell of a ride!	2
f62d4226-b14c-4b6e-aab0-65420c2812e7	  Spectacularly shot action movie, but nothing more than one big car chase.	2

Some of the f/x were fun. Lots of practical stunts and such that you don't see much any more. But really, a 2 hour car chase? Yawn.	0
dd03b0be-d977-4a06-8eb9-46115550de45	  George Miller gives us exciting action, a simple story and great performances from Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy and Nicholas Hoult in the 4th Mad Max movie.	2

90ee209e-4913-4fa5-9f04-4d1d0cb1247e	  Mad Max: Fury Road is a visceral ride, featuring incredibly impressive action scenes, some surprisingly strong performances from TomHardy, Charlize Theron, and Nicholas Hoult, and achingly beautiful cinematography. While Inside Out is probably the strongest film of 2015 I've seen in cerebral heft, Fury Road will probably be higher on my fend of 2015 list act due to the fact that I can see myself revisiting this one many times. Verdict: A	2
e50c68bd-ae5d-472a-9e8e-7f54c38c029a	  Unbelievably good. Better with each subsequent viewing.

66a4a326-8cdf-4377-b02a-7f3e2a71a9b8	  Upon watching The Road Warrior, I assumed that the rough-around-the-edges low-budget look to the whole affair was part of the charm (at least it looks like budgetary constraints to a modern audience). It turns out that the only thing holding The Road Warrior back was a huge pile of money and a light technological touch-up. Mad Max Fury Road uses The Road Warrior as a baseline and takes it to its natural conclusion, a riptide of cars, guns, and hellfire that starts thirty seconds in and keeps going for two hour straight. Its not without its missteps, and some of its flourishes fall flat, but overall, Miller has shown us exactly how good a post-apocalyptic joyride can be.	2

What was George Miller thinking when he decided to redo his original movie? Maybe it was to cover up the Mel Gibson controversy, now he has another mess to dispose of. Like Gibson or not, and the original was a bit before my time, the new Mad Max is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I don't know what the lead actors' names are and don't want to know either, because their completely uninspired performances have me wanting to forget everything about them. Oh, Charlize Theron, not my favorite and further down on the list after Fury Road. The movie reminds me more of the Italian knockoff films made to resemble Mad Max than the original Mad max series of films. Action movies do not captivate my interest normally, and this movie reinforced the norm.	0

09b72289-db80-48f1-975e-4ecde829e03e	  No character development. Whatever little immersion there is, is stripped away whenever Harding speaks. The sped up action sequences keep immersion at bay. The introduction doesn't leave you very impressed with Harding's character, so when we meet Theron's, she isn't built up as a bad ass very well - as its rooted in her hand-to-hand combat with Max.As for world building: spilling water? Are we to believe that anyone survives on such a brief outpour with so much lost to the ground? And what gasoline shortage - everyone and their grandmother, seemingly literally, has an engine in good working order and plenty of juice. Wouldn't have cared less if Max bought it, didn't care when his car bought it. The actors just don't pull any of their scenes off. When the villain fixes to hate the heroes (death of pre-mature son) it looks like he may of just called it a day (silly mask didn't help the actor). When the young hottie takes to meaning business with watching the back or using a gun, it doesn't even live up to the clich�. Zero sexual tension through-out. The Nux and redhead relation wasn't even sweet - again the scenes were weaker than the clich�. I don't even know any names besides Nux and Max.I did like the cinematography of the cool desert night. However, this is where they hatched the idea of travelling 160 days on bikes. Well, maybe if they travelled a mile a day. And of course in a post-apocalyptic world that was short on gas beforehand, there are plentiful bikes - in good working order - enough that the stranger guy gets one laden with supplies and brimming with fuel.Harding is either a bad actor or wrongly cast. Mel Gibson, or any number of others, would have shown guile when turning them all back towards the citadel, a bit of sexual tension when the blonde was in tight beside him in the hatch, and so on.	0
cd6683f0-1ba3-4243-bf6b-d3d6ad32cb20	  OK. Sure... Honestly I'm not really sure what the point of watching this movie is. It's just weird and intense. Not in an out and out bad way, but not in a really compelling way either.	1
432482df-a790-4ddb-9234-0f5158dd9663	  Mind numbing repetition. I don't understand how this film gets good reviews. The story is thin, characters are thinner, mostly this is two hours of car chases and crashes in the desert. It assumes too much. Mad Max was a character driven film where we see Max go from a family man that wants to live in peace, to his trial by fire towards the Road Warrior. By Thunderdome we knew Max, so so it was the development of others against Max's foil that made the story. In this weak tale a Warlord named Joe keeps many wives and has many more sons. Imperator Furiosa helps several of Joe's wives escape while on a "gas run". When Furiosa takes a detour Joe finds out immediately and engages in pursuit, catching up quickly, thus begins the bulk of the film, an endless chase scene across the desert. You'll notice I've said nothing of Max as Max appearance in this film is merely gratuitous. He really isn't needed except to convince Furiosa to turn back to the Citadel and that could have been done by any of the characters. This was not a worthy addition to the Mad Max universe. Perhaps it's time for the franchise to die. I'm glad I only paid $1 to see this.	0
bd70204c-9dae-40ad-81b5-f90c9119ee62	  I look to Rotten Tomatoes to provide me with expert Movie Reviews. In this case I think their rating of 97% must have been influenced through bribery. Mad Max (2015) was visually an ugly movie with stupid dialog and unrealistic special effects. The Original Mad Max w/ Mel Gibson remains a must-see classic.	0

919a5c3a-7235-4ad0-94bb-bf4a58a2b098	  Acting and story are paper thin and the action doesn't pick up until the second half. Mad Max him self doesn't have any personality so you don't connect with his character at all. Forgettable unless you spent full price on this then you will be mad for a minute.	0
e5076b8d-05d0-4a2d-9dd7-04404dbbcccb	  There's a lot of good about this movie - It's a great looker, with a great aesthetic and feel. There's action, guns, drugged up skinheads who want to rush to "valhalla" (Or in otherwords, death.), Post apocalyptic setting.. It has a ton of things going for it, but the issue is.. There's no story OR characters.The story is just a simple chase-movie. Main character get caught after which he escapes from being a blood-bag (Skinheaded druggies need his blood to continue functioning.) while accidentally meeting up with a truck full of women who are escaping from the Cult leader of the skinheaded druggies. They're trying to escape to "eden" which by the words of Furiosa (The manly woman who kicks ass) is a green land from which she was stolen from.That's it for the story. 80% of the movie is about getting to that place while fighting lots of skinheads in crazy spiky cars.Characters also aren't built up. Max is the blandest of characters. His character is literally just looking at things angrily and shooting at them. Occasionally sees phantoms of his daughter show up (Which isn't explained at all in the movie.) and shoots more people.Furiosa's reasons for escaping are explained and that's also literally to "save other girls" not really a character trait that has much to it. And otherwise she's also similar to the main character, a hard-ass who gets shit done.And there comes the issue. You will feel interested in side-characters that come from the enemy side because there's simply no reason to LIKE the main characters. Until the end I was actually cheering for the enemies because hey, they were interesting. There was literally a guitar guy who sat on a huge truck which had HUUUGE speakers and was shooting out fire from his guitar!! That's BADASS! Immortan Joe also looks like a barely alive bulgy old man who's like "GO TO VALHALLA NOW".. Which is again.. Pretty neat.But this movie, although it isn't horrible.. There's nothing "GREAT" about it.. It's a solid 60% imho. It's being kept up by its licence and style, but half of the movie is simply less than mediocre.	1

b45feb47-ef12-48e2-aa6a-946ec6ec4b83	  Terrible. 15 minutes of decent movie, but mostly a 2 hour car chase with no plot whatsoever. Absolutely terrible. I want the last two hours of my life back!	0
3c1e3354-fcc2-4bbb-bf89-f5a1b4b13d25	  Good special effects, but not good enough to make up for the horrible story, waste of time. I have no idea how this movie received the reviews it did, childish story. Not worth the red box fees even.	0

eeae1c6e-0113-4d53-8330-12e856e5b3d5	  To be blunt this Movie is overrated, Now why is that? Well I suppose people find this movie is be "One of the greatest Action Movies in the past decade" due to it's overwhelming use of Explosions and Death to it's artsy weird atmosphere and more use of action than focusing on a story? Nope, people don't seem to realize all of this stuff and are tricked into believed "HOW AWESOME" this movie is, even asshole critics are giving 5 stars to this Eye Sore. So please don't be fooled by It's overwhelming use of action to make you believe it's a telling a complex and interesting action/drama story, because It's not. And yes It does have a plot but It's focusing more on action than it does It's story when It should be a balance, I don't even want to explain the plot because It's way too fucking obscure for me to explain without sounding incredibly stupid, I don't even remember half of the plot in fact. And you're probably thinking "Where's all the positive aspects of this movie for you to give it 3 stars?" I wanted to put everything positive at the beginning but I was just too impatient to wait, this movie is plain and simple Overrated.	1
4dcd3f82-9b2b-44c0-a5b3-3cb5a9fda930	  This movie has 97% critical consensus on rottentomatoes... so I'm a bit sad to be joining the 3% who didn't like this movie.It's not for some of the reasons I've seen floating around - it's a Mad Max movie in name only, since Furiosa is the real star, the iconic car is barely in it then destroyed, there's no Mel Gibson, and whatever else. I remember liking Beyond the Thunderdome when I saw it, but I wouldn't call myself a Max aficionado for these details to really matter.I just didn't like it because I was bored. 2 hour movie, and all but 30 minutes of it is car chases. They were well filmed and choreographed and all, but that wasn't enough to make me car about any of the characters or stop me from looking at my watch in desperation wondering if this thing was ever going to end.I'm just glad I didn't see this in theaters.	0

e77ddf9d-d58c-4edd-bf3c-bfded68792c5	  Mad Max Fury Road. Not bad if your a gamer. Reminds you of an action game, except it lacks their depth.

d9e5ff8a-c7ef-4880-aa43-430db1c5d8dd	  Well, I watched it again. I am still not impressed with this movie. I see tons of action movies, I love them. Yes, the visual effects were amazing, but the rest of the movie falls flat. Lame dialogue, lame characters, etc. One of the villains is a fat guy with an oxygen, really? I was happy with the story until everyone decided opps let's turn around and go back the exact way we can for the past hour and a half of the movie, WTF. Weak story. Where did the ambino war children come from? Why is there no towns other than a gas town? Even shanties would make sense of the story world. Story world environment was lame also. Desert, more desert. I know it was a post nuclear war world, but there could have been more than what we were given. Anyone see Oblivion, way way way better story world environment. I would love to know how people this is an action masterpiece, must not have seen John Wick, Lucy, the new MI movie, which are all 20x better than this. OVERRATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
a48093d4-ba79-4545-8968-ccc9a14e1baf	  Meaninglessly gory, depressing, ugly and bereft of substance, this movie was by far the most torturous two hours of my life--two hours that I regret that I will never have back (and I've had a sigmoidoscopy before). The characters have about as much backstory and dimension as a toothpick, and the mindless action is stupefyingly dull. While I can never un-watch this overrated drivel, I sincerely hope that my review will help you recover two hours of your life.	0
64a319c4-3307-49d4-a2d5-dd3e311ed3d7	  Am I the only person that thinks a chase to the middle of the desert, only to turn around and go back, is a non plot? Loved the first two in the series, third and fourth very disappointing. This was visually very well done so that brings the second star.	0
4738a7b4-48f4-4e12-a417-64b6f7080437	  Very disapointing, lots of movement but no substance. People who say that this movie is feminst totally miss the point of feminism.	0
344bc50d-4b65-4833-a42a-497d30633f4f	  This was the biggest waste of two hours I've spent in a long time. If you're into meaningless undeveloped characters, over the top props, ridiculously impossible in the real world action and shootings, CGI generated stunts, and almost no plot, this is your movie. From the first moment of the movie till the end, its non-stop explosions, chase scenes and gunfire. Thanks, but I'll just play call of duty when I want to watch insane action.	0
bb2f6603-6ede-413b-9bd9-3fc7ecfeaee2	  As a action packed movie, this movie nailed it all the day with it's incredible colourful visuals and lack of CGI. The problem was that there wasn't much of 'Mad Max' in this film than the other prequels, which was very disappointing since the entire franchise is depicted on him. Instead the film should've been called "Furiosa: Fury Road" as she was mostly featured through out the film. Another point, was the whole vehicle chase scene was just copied from the second and third installment with more gore and action. Though gotta give credit for those damn monstrous vehicles. See my point is this movie was great and all but I would like to have seen more of Mad Max and a fresh unexpected story to start of the fourth installment after like what 25 years!	1
5193d487-f43b-434b-a4f4-50f16fc247a9	  This was a tedious grungy chase / war movie that I couldn't wait to end ! Despite the good art direction everyone looked like they just got back from burning man and Charlize Theron was a waste as an action star . I'm glad I saw it on DVD and didn't waste the money at a theater ! I'm really amazed that so many critics liked this ! I'm being generous with 2 stars ( for the art direction ) Sorry but the rest was a bore !	0

625c787a-1e1e-42b7-806b-48ec10bdaf62	  Critics gave this a 97% positive rating. Many were amazed at how Charlize Theron was "transformed" physically to play this role. PROSA possible new drinking game here. Every time you discover a really bad visual blunder or terrible editing job, take a drink. I guarantee you'll see less than half the movie before you're passed out on the couch. Another possible drinking game.....Charlize Theron is beyond beautiful. For this role, she cut all her hair off and rubbed axial grease on her face. Guess what, it's still f**king Charlize Theron only with short hair and grease on her face. So the drinking game is, when you first realize you're looking at the "transformed" Charlize, start drinking and don't stop till you pass out. Unless you have the intellect of a grape, that'll be in the first five minutes of the movie and you'll be spared death by boredom which occurs within a half hour. Positive note and suggestion. It's better to rent the streaming version as opposed to the less expensive physical DVD. This will actually be less expensive in the long run. Having the actual physical DVD, in front of you will give you the strong urge to destroy it and relieve the world of one copy of this crap. Investors gave money to this project. They're out there and they're giving money away. CONSWriter has serious Mother issues. This movie took two hours of my life which I will never get back.	0

bc76fd21-bfd1-4418-aed5-108dc49ded61	  I would best compare this film to another film that came out in 2013 by the name of Gravity. Gravity, much like the film I'm reviewing right now, was a spoon fed, overly praised film that places more value on aesthetics than it does on engaging characters or a worthwhile story to be invested in. Just like Gravity, one bewilderment towards the overwhelming positive reception versus the actual quality of the film shouldn't be a surprise since if you remove the technical achievement all you'll have left is superficial entertainment with a two hour car chase. It's a dumb action film with a high budget, and cool car stunts which is sadly all it has to offer.Around this portion of my reviews I would provide a synopsis of Mad Max: Fury Road, but any sort of synopsis should be considered a spoiler. There's very little plot in the film that required three writers to create. To put it in perspective the film without giving away thin specifics is basically like driving a couple miles away from your home to get water while being chased by lunatics, remembering there's no longer anyone guarding your home for some reason, and returning home the same way you came even though it was blocked after an explosion. That is all that occurred within two hours. Like mentioned before, this took the effort of three writers to create is pretty pathetic not just in writing, but filmmaking as a whole.It's titled character, Max, is a man of few words, fewer defining characteristic beside having a tortured past, and less of an engaging character. Max is relegated to a supporting role who just goes with the motion of events. Some attempts are made in providing a backstory to Max, but it is thinly stretched out. All that is told about Max through hallucination is that he failed to protect people. Their importance is never specify almost as if discluding any newcomer in the franchise. If it fails to stand alone as it own entity then it failed before filming began. Nope, instead of providing stronger context it's better if that time was better spent on very long car chases instead.More ridiculous than the thinness of the story is the presentation of serious moments. Car chases take up 90% of the film are bombastic, and loud which when applied to a character, Furiousa, talking about redemption can't be taken seriously. That's the clear points of these moments, though once again I want emphasize it took three people to write this story. Without much exploration into character backgrounds it further deteriorate into an eye candy spectacle that only manages to hold your attention because of it belief it would lose its audience if there wasn't a extensive car chase for every few minutes focus on plot.The film opens up with our main character Max being captured, and in an attempt to escape shows to the viewer(s) how insane the world is. This very early scene shows a crowd of people gathering around to get water with the images presenting a clear picture of how important this resource is in the world. Yet, the three writers felt the imagery of this scene wouldn't be enough to convey the desperation in its world either being water, healthy people, or fertile land which is why lines like "As the world fell, each of us in our ways were broken" is spoon feeding to the definition. Much like the example I use in the opening paragraph, if it was entirely muted (we're talking about virtually no dialogue) the film would actually be an achievement in storytelling regardless if it needed to use simple caricatures for an action movie. Unfortunately, with spoon fed dialogue like that it's a blessing and a curse the characters don't talk as much as they do taking away from the experience.Characters are simplified to very basic character arcs; most notable examples comes in the form of Nux and Furiousa. Nux wants to be taken to Vahala which loosely can be tied to religion as much as Furiousa search for redemption from an event that's makes a very loose connection with the antagonist. Nux doesn't suffer as much as Furiousa in his basic characterization due to his simplistic loyalty painting a clear picture of his arc when he enters the picture. Max goal is to possibly get over past demons and survive without talking much. Now, Max getting over his demons isn't an issue since it's what drives his character to be a better person than he was before. However, Max being muted when Furiosa is trying to kill him is idiotic. He's man of few words, but not very intelligent...or is he? The script can't decide on that as in one scene Max manages to get a truck out a swampland that got mired in the desert by the use of the only conveniently found tree in that area. So his reluctance to speak in a scene where women are trying to run away from the same lunatics chasing Max, and the leader is attempting to kill Max a simple explanation would have avoided a well choreographed, but rather pointless action scene.So earlier I made a rough outline of the film general story by making up an example. That outline has serious issues. First, there is an explosion in a canyon with only one entrance way being shown. That entrance gets blocked by rubble of rocks. Yet, when the characters decide to return to where Max was taken seemingly using the same road. Second, we're in the desert and making further suspend your belief is despite the large locations shown throughout the film Max takes the same route to return to the Citadel (where the film basically starts). Lastly, the antagonist took all of his men when chasing down Max? If not, how come the citizens of the Citadel didn't kill Immortan Joe (the antagonist) if his power was so limited? It would explain the ending, but if so, even if the antagonist did strike fear in the people's eyes the numbers of baddies still in the Citadel is larger of that of what the Immortan Joe took with him when chasing down Max and his Five Wives. In context characters finally stop looking for answers in other places that might not exist, but also in context it basically means the outline of the story is unbelievably goofy.If you're looking for action, but mostly in the car chases variety Mad Max: Fury Road has impressive stunt work. For starter, the way Mad Max: Fury Road is filmed is done like an expert. The camera in these car chases usually follows the cars without shaking the camera. No matter how many cars are on screen together or if there's an explosion the camera doesn't need to shake to emulate the chaotic nature of just occurred in a scene. It does it through visuals favoring long takes with wide shots angle to see every bit of carnage done in the film.Another aspect of the car chases is the smart uses of wide shots throughout lengthy sequences. A common problem for directors of higher budgeted action movies is that a director would make the mistakes of using many mid-shots instead to be closer to the action instead of pulling the camera further for a better flow. One of the best example is a scene where Max is attempting to break the window of a car from his capturer who's planning to kill himself in a blaze glory during a desert storm. In the background, Max is seen struggling to hang onto a car and attempting to break the window while in the foreground his capturer is preparing to kill himself. This paints a picture of struggle, and a time limit within the same shot. This also applies to car crashes as when a car gets destroyed the camera shows the entire car as it gets destroyed. However, instead of pausing to display this demolished car it will instead continue to follow the action. One prime example of a George Miller expert direction is in the film there's tanker that explodes, and how he displays it incorporates many techniques. From this lone scene in a couple of seconds Miller combines CG, shot composition, and editing to seamless effect. As Max is fighting against a Warboy on a pole/ladder that's very close to touching the ground in motion he successfully kills the Warboy; with the ladder now having less weight Max attempts to get himself onto safety in the foreground on a moving car while the background a tanker is exploding within the same frame of shots. This moment doesn't last any longer than seven seconds, but seamlessly through expert uses of CG, shot composition, and editing it's a seamless flow of coherence that Miller often succeed in duplicating throughout the film.The stunt work is nothing short of amazing. Cars are demolished on screen alongside obtaining a high body count from in the film characters death. In general, the stunt will require a dozen or so cars as well participants to do insane set pieces. Not only do the stunt crew having perform a dangerous stunt on constantly moving vehicles, but also do it with visibly little protection and sometimes with props like spears, pipes, baby bottle, spray can, and anything that can be found in this post apocalyptic film. What's pulled off successfully is a string of convincing looking stunts that at some point in the film you'll begin to believe every single stunt was done by actual person. In some scenes a dummies is used, but with an expert stunt crew it blurred the lines between a real person and dummy that it's not even noticeable even among action aficionados.CGI is used in virtually every single shot of the film, though it's mostly use on either filtering colors or enhance the effect of a scene. For instance, going back to the tanker explosion if you removed the CG from that explosion you'll still have the same explosion and stunt in place. The only thing the CG is adding was enhancing the effect of an explosion to give it more visual finesse by darkening smokes and brightening up the flames. Sometimes CG will add an explosion or make a scene colors pop out. Fury Road usage of CG is smart as it only uses it to add to a larger piece of the film instead of it taking over for an entire scene.Set design is also detailed with a rough-hewn general look for the clothings. Getting across a clear picture of this dystopia fascination with worshiping cars like a religion. There is no normal looking car in the film as you have muscle cars on top of tanks, vintage cars on top of oil rigs and things that look like killer porcupines with wheels underneath them. There's a lot to admired from the vehicles including the manic arsonist guitarist surrounded by a wall of amplifiers. The guitarist is also a key feature of the soundtrack, with Junkie XL using the chaotic music to stamp a mark of citizenship upon the particular tribes across the journey, mixing in suspenseful, looming soundbites to show the ever-nearing distance between threats.The acting I can't complain about, but that's mostly because the cast provide a lot more conviction in their portrayals than the script does in providing details. Tom Hardy hardly speaks in the film with most of his performance relegated to simply grunting and facial expressions. Despite the limitation in his performance Tom Hardy sells the image of a broken, desperate man. Everything his character is feeling is received by the viewer properly. Charlize Theron plays Furiousa a cool looking character with a no-nonsense attitude. Playing a complex character whose composure hides a lot of her inner turmoil. Having to display a rough surface while at the same time a character whose holding onto what little hope for a better life there is left. Her chemistry with Hardy is excellent displaying the changes in their relationship through the film going from strangers, to enemies, to partners convincingly.Nicholas Hoult plays Nux a character heavy on a visual arc. He has the most easily definable character traits utilizing them in his portrayal of Nux. A character that enthusiastically goes into blindly following a belief of the antagonist to a more down to earth person contemplating a new view for life. His changes are among the most evident in the film benefiting from a character whose entire journey unlike the other two characters is seen to the finish line. Hugh Keays-Byrne is a appropriate looking "Obviously Evil Bad Guy" type of antagonist. His costume leaves little imagination for what kind of person he is. Consumed in the role Byrne exudes desire, hatred, and vengeance through his portrayal of the film antagonist. I also must give credit to the casting of largely unknown actor Nathan Jones and playing on his strength by giving him little words to speak and allot to express. This movie was expertly put together needless to say.Mad Max: Fury Road will make you mad and furious for the wrong reasons. It's more of an issue of the shallow writing that excuses itself to be a two hour chase scene. Gazing upon it you'll be in awe at the large scale practical stunt work, and gorgeous cinematography before realizing its product of its time that is only appreciated as such. The biggest drawback to the film is it uncertainty to trust the audience; it's powerful images tell its story majestically, but due to the spoon fed dialogue the reward that comes with figuring out what occurred in the story yourself diminishes the impact when it does it for two hours. It's technical achievement on all fronts, but if the spoon fed dialogue was virtually removed than it would have also obtained a storytelling achievement to go along with its wild world.	1
f5462e26-ef6f-4757-a1bc-dbd37959ae0c	  Good action, boring story, bad pacing, good acting.A movie this well liked by almost everyone was sure to disappoint me, and it did. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. The acting was fine, and the action was great. It was the pacing that bothered me and the CG. The story was shoehorned in and it took the backseat like it was supposed to so, no real complaints there. I never really cared for any of the characters or their plights, the use of flashback to humanize Max didn't do that at all and rarely made any sense. It became cartoonish at points, and the other characters were underdeveloped to care about their motivation or plight. The acting was there and there wasn't a bad performance out of anyone.The graphics when not practical, but CG looked terrible and extremely CG. There is an establishing shot of the base in the beginning and it looks like a paper cutout diorama you made in middleschool, it looked like a comic book since there was a thick outline around the people in the foreground, it was weird. Most of the CG was bad, there wasn't enough textures at times, so it had that weird plastic look to it. The pacing was the worst offender in the film. I get that it's an epic car chase, but there were scenes that took too long and didn't really feel like it fit or did anything to further the story. There's this "night" scene (which is clearly a blue filter over the lens of the camera, it's that bad) that nothing seems to happen, I get that they're trying to strength the bond between the two leads, but it felt out of place and annoyed me. Then the whole movie is about running away from the problem (which is totally fine) to go to this "Eden", that takes a great chunk of the movie to get there, but SPOILERS, there's something wrong, "Eden" is dead, so they have to go back to where they came. So the first part of the movie takes 1.5hrs to get to eden and 30mins to go through now an army of cars and ruthless killers (that weren't there going out, but on their tail) to get back to the starting point. "Eden" should have been the middle point, the "blue" scene should have been cut a lot shorter (develop that relationship with action, not exposition, since nothing gets resolved there, since they tell each other their history, kind of, which we the audience already know) and more time should have been given to the fight to go back to the start. There were more problems going to "Eden" (don't remember what it was called in the film), then there was going through a fleet of murderous men and their vehicles. That doesn't make sense. It's a good film, that would have been made better if Miller kept it as a mindless action film and didn't try to make it just above that. The story/pacing and CG were the biggest retarding factors in this film with a very basic and somewhat cliche premise. Ironically, Max is the most useless and unnecessary character in the film, to the point where I think he was a hinderance. His character trope is so cliched it's annoying. Guy with a troubled past that closes himself off to the world, yet it affects him enough to retard progress in the real world. He was overly melodramatic and it got annoying.	1

1827f4f1-a687-4f95-a323-8fabfa01ca06	  Campy and like a cartoon. Max in this movie has no substance. Huge budgets, models and wild costumes contribute nothing. The story is flat and goes in circles. A waste.	0
ca2a3005-85d6-47ab-8aa2-81bb87bd1285	  Ah, yeah. What happens when Hollywood goes ape shit with an Aussie classic, throwing a butt load of money at the screen? This. This is what happens. Mad Max Fury Road. If you like car crashes, explosions and more CGI than action, plot or character development , this is the movie for you. Tom Hardy as Max sucks balls. Big ones. Hard. Charlize Theron as Furiosa spends the entire movie with a single facial expression - scowling up and to the left. It's a movie that spends 2 hours going no where - both literally and figuratively. Whereas Daniel Craig breathed new life into James Bond bringing out a dark and sinister side - almost an anti-hero - to a film classic Tom Hardy neuters Max and takes character development no where. He says about three words (does he have an inability to remember scripts or was the scriptwriter just lazy??). If they had put Mel Gibson back in the role he wouldn't even have had to act - just pay him in Jack Daniels, throw him the keys and follow him around with a steady cam. Job done and twice as interesting without the CGI bullshit. A bollocks of a film and crucification of a classic.	0

Barely any dialogue (and the little there was was mediocre... ha! mediocre...), zero character development.Just a bunch of screwed up dudes driving screwed up vehicles, with a couple of girls tossed in so the whole movie wasn't just screwed up dudes.Another movie in what is sure to be a long line of crappy movies, since Hollywood can no longer make decent films.	0

3942f2aa-9cca-4865-b69b-c71be77cfe99	  Someone hired this for me and accidentally got the DVD rather than Bluray. This was fitting because its just like a mindless 2 hour action scene from 10 years ago, (I thought we all agreed this concept sucks!?) Basically a cheesy death metal band chase an anonymous man and or woman possibly other women too, from one side of the desert to the other. People roll vehicles, use RPG's, hop in/out of moving vehicles and eventually much to the audiences relief it all comes to an end at some point. The ironic thing is this film probably has a higher rating than the originals. And if you think there is going to be some of that magic apocalyptic Ozploitation theme from its predecessors think again. A solid action grind for people who enjoy that sort of thing, not much else. Someone in Hollywood should start selling movie 'kits' complete with video game, so you can regurgitate any old classic you want. MEDIOCRE	1

647f8e4f-841a-4baa-9ecf-1ba4163a0ab8	  This movie was just a perpetual train wreck. It just starts in the middle of a story that has no real plot. People drive off into nowhere for no real reason. People drive all the way back because they finally say 'oh hey, water would be a good thing'. The only high points of this whole snore-fest is some mediocre action scenes and some hot women. But the main douche character doesn't even bother to get a congratulatory kiss. I struggled to just finish this movie, hoping and holding out that there would be some sanctification brought from watching this film. No.	0

The only actor who gets any sort of "character" development is Nicholas Hoult who plays War Boy "Nux". Everyone else just fights everyone else. I'm now glad I didn't see it in the theatre.	1

8d72085f-cda4-4660-8915-0322af22e69c	  Good movie, but not as memorable as the original. But George Miller is smart and is getting positive publicity by getting a well-known feminist to give her stamp of approval. Of course shared with the world so everyone knows... Anyway, I appreciate the practical effects, but the little bit of CGI that was used was VERY jarring because they were pretty poorly done and stuck out like a sore thumb from the practical effects they did... That and the fact that it was basically just a car chase movie, are the only complaints about it. Otherwise good movie. Charlize Theron definitely outshined the character the movie was named after.	1

I'm guessing after a second viewing, they will see how bad this movie is. The "dialogue" is the worst I've ever witnessed in a major production. The story; sorry, there is no story. And when will the studios realize Tom Hardy has no charisma?? Would have preferred to have Charlize Theron's character be Max instead; maybe changer her name to Maxine. Then towards the end, when he thinks Theron's character might not make it, Hardy finally says, "Max, my name is Max." Who cares at that point?? Wow, I still can't believe how bad this movie was and how it's getting such positive reviews.	0

2a48ae69-a688-4ae3-a230-ed3876705103	  Some loved it. Some hated it. I draw my opinion right down the middle. Some elements such as the attention to detail across wonderful panoramas are great. Most of the characters make efforts to make the unusual landscape believable but the main antagonist and a few others draw the the viewer away from a sense of realism into most of a comic book chase caper.	1
cdfd1b1b-de3a-4792-ba36-4dd6657ac0cc	  The visuals and action are top notch, but the story just wasn't there. Even the old Mad Max films had more character development than this. It's worth watching, but I doubt you'll ever want/need to watch it again.	0

222b73b4-6b9b-4a6b-ae2f-164f6b3ae592	  Really disappointed in this movie. The plot just jumps around and the entirety of the movie is just one big chase scene. Tom Hardy's dialogue for the entire film could fit on an index card. Charlize Theron's character isn't developed at all and then you're supposed to care about her. The ending left me asking "why?"	1
59b06c36-ab4c-4a5b-9557-43f46776069b	  This movie was so overrated. Watched this with a friend with the sound on the first time and I literally fell asleep.

Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are great actors but this movie did not showcase their real genuine talent. I do not understand how the director was able to release this film in theatre. As a movie lover I will not watch this movie ever again. Word of advice do yourself a favor do not ever watch this movie. This movie is a waste of time and money. Your welcome.	0
cb75eb5f-5ba7-4812-8e03-7c9c33a285f7	  Don't get mad with me to the max, but I was not enthralled at all with "Mad Max:Fury Road". George Miller's redux of his classic 80's Mad Max franchise was mostly about visual storytelling but there was no true connection with any of the characters, mostly the madman himself Max. If you are not familiar with this franchise, the film takes place in a dystopian future where eccentric characters set the pave to a divided society. Tom Hardy stars as Max, who is about to be killed in some type of mundane "chain to a speeding truck" kind of deal; when circumstances change, he now joins a group of female rebels led by Imperator Furiosa, profoundly played by Charlize Theron; but not to the caliber of Oscar nominated, don't get furioso with me, just my take. Tom Hardy, who is one of my favorite actors, turns out his worst performance of his career; he looked lost and stale throughout the picture. However, I am still in the Tom Tom Club as a Hardy fan; Hardy har har. Nicholas Hoult was sound as the desperate Nux. Director George Miller's direction was way over the top, and not much could be said of his limited screenplay. Hey, but I did not hate it all together. John Seale's brilliant cinematography got my seal of approval. "Mad Max: Fury Road" was a road for me that will be less traveled. *** Average	1

Mad Max was refreshing because it didn't have a Free Will, forgiveness, anti-government, anti-tax, anti-Muslim, anti-atheist threads running through it. The oppression of women theme was in step with today's problems.	1

Just a whole lot of things going boom, exploding, catching on fire, getting shot or stab.

I found it to be rather boring, the plot to me kind of sucked. It just seems like the movies critics or people on this site seem to like I normally hate and the ones that do bad on here may not be great but aren't as bad as people make them out to be.

f13866d8-2c01-4292-958d-229e4d554926	  I always wondered about lone critics who disagreed with the general consensus. Did they not see the same movie the rest of us did? And yet for Mad Max: Fury Road, I find myself going against the grain. This was a good movie, but certainly not a great one. The Road Warrior was a great movie. At the risk of sounding heretic, the first half of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome might have been even better.What those movies had that Fury Road does not were two welcome qualities in an action movie, which are attitude and restraint. In regard to restraint, this movie was almost non-stop action. That sounds good on paper, but it tends to diminish the impact of action scenes as they pile up throughout the film, one after another. It's a bit like Indiana Jones riding off on a horse and stealing a truck from the Nazis. It's one of the best action scenes ever filmed, but part of why it's so great is because it's not 2 hours long. During parts of this film, I felt like I was watching a Cirque De Soleil performance. It was too much, too often. And though the movie had character development, it lacked attitude. As an example from Beyond Thunderdome, there's a scene where Gibson's Max has to relinquish his weapons. As he pulls more and more of them out from every nook and cranny, the collector of weapons has a look on his face that says, "I've seen it all, and even I know this is one bad man". It's an incredible scene that sets the tone for what Max has evolved into since The Road Warrior - and it didn't take 5000 extras to film or require a massive explosion. That's what I mean by "attitude". In Fury Road, Tom Hardy's Max never has a single moment of even that magnitude, much less a Thunderdome-esque scene where all eyes are on him. Instead, we get that for Charlize Theron's character. And while that might please some who are looking for more female heroines, I didn't pay to see "Tomb Raider". I paid to see Mad Max. In The Road Warrior, the villains knew who Max was by the end (though not by name). And the people he saved? They knew him as well, hence the haunting monologue at the end. But in Fury Road, it seems the only one who knew him by the end and was truly impacted by his presence along the way was Furiosa. Which brings up a natural question, "If the grand majority of the characters in the movie don't know or care who Max is by the end, then why should the audience?"	1
545072b2-58ef-4c2b-8e20-6c772b81659d	  Watched this movie on Dish, I did not go to see it in the theater because I was afraid of being disappointed. My disappointment was just delayed, remake turned Mad Max into pussy Max, and the whole thing came across as a victim mentality. I don't think the filmmaker was in touch with the nerve the original Fury Road touched and its a shame, if he would have got it, it could be the new cult movie instead its just a Starship Troopers 2 with no redeeming qualities other than the cute harem of gals.	0
2461fcd6-aff2-4f60-9e67-c3c04f53250b	  Road to NowhereThis movie was absolutely deplorable. Sure no sex or swearing but it paled in comparison to the original Road Warrior and Mad Max. Where was the dog and Gyro Man when you really needed them?The acting, if you can call it acting was limited to 10 word utterances. Hardy was god-awful with his Aussie type accent if you can call it that. In fact the accent changed towards the end of the flick. The only redeeming features where Charlize Theron and some of the action sequences. But while it was loaded with action so much of the film was speeded up to supposedly heighten the action which it did not. The plot was so thin as well. All in all a total waste of time of true Mad Max fans.	0

114dd66c-a8ce-40c3-93c3-34ccdd8cfc6c	  Why I didn't care for the Fury RoadI'm sure most of us have seen Mad Max Fury Road. The movie critics gave it great reviews, rotten tomatoes, and IMDB all show it having approximately a 98% approval rating and now the international film festivals all giving it awards and high accolades.These are all opinions and everyone is entitled to their opinions. There was just something missing when I watched this reintroduction of one of my childhood heroes. That despondent loner who was first on the search for vengeance for his life that was torn apart and then as a he wanders the dessert in a post apocalyptic Australia he finds himself an unlikely hero to people more desperate than himself. He always manages to win the fight against overwhelming odds.When watching the former Mad Max Trilogy I always felt a sense of isolation, and desperation. I felt I emotionally connected and could empathize with how lonely his world could be; His family and friends gone, food, gasoline, and water are so scarce they are priceless and coveted by all.Much of what had built that emotional connection for me in those movies were the cinematography, the sound track/audio work, and the pacing. It wasn't a rip roaring adventure chase scene throughout, it slowed at times and built a sense of suspense and offered time to know and understand key characters.In my opinion I felt at the opening of Fury Road we should have received a more thorough reintroduction to Max. Those of us who know him already, have not seen him in 30 years (certainly some have re-watched the films), others may have no clue who he is, also he has lived for a period of time wandering the post apocalyptic wasteland on his own since the last film. Show me how this has affected him. In the opening of Fury Road we get a brief voice over monologue as introduction and we see Max forced to eat a lizard as a means of sustenance. Then he is almost immediately captured by bandits from the Citadel.Even a brief montage of Max searching for something, fuel, food, civilization, show him on the outskirts of the Citadel contemplating if it is a safe place or hostile, give me a camera shot of a small section of road sand blowing over it as a hint of the world that use to be but is now forever lost, Max shaking an empty canteen thirsting for water, shaking empty gas cans. These small things could easily build an emotional connection to Max and make me feel a need to root for him as I then have a better sense of what it would be like in this desperate situation. Then we find ourselves at the Citadel... Lots of dirty skinny people here, it must be a crappy place to live but better than wandering the dessert alone. I really don't know how bad these people's lives may be but they get really excited when that rare and coveted resource called water is released...Wait is water not such a rare resource or are these people just idiots, because when the water is released they catch about 1 cups worth in their random pots and pans then splash around in what is left on the ground. Is this a utopia of plenty filled with a population of morons?Then their leader Imperator Joe the one who controls the water tells them to not become addicted to the water. Everyone needs water, it's not an addiction it's a necessity Joe. Just bad dialogue...Joe is a God like figure to this community we later find out because he controls the water and it is pumped up from the ground and only he can command it to be released. So obviously this clan is beholden to him. Also there is plenty of water he is just holding back to maintain his hold on the communityHe does have a very ominous mask and costume so I honestly like him as a bad guy figure regardless of some of the less than stirring dialogue he is given.Then we meet Furious. She gets to drive the truck. Why? I don't know. Apparently she has proved herself in this male dominated militaristic society. I appreciate woman in a strong leadership roles but this society clearly doesn't seem to be heavily dominated by women. I would have appreciated Furiosa's character had I some idea of how she managed to become so entrusted that she gets to drive the truck that hauls their most precious resources fuel, water, and breast milk. That's right the Citadel is a lady milk dairy farm. It doesn't specifically say that but it is conveyed through brief shots of women in a milking room. Just a brief glimpse into her past, flashbacks something throughout the movie to show me what she overcame could really help elevate her character and make you cheer for her. Again it's all about creating an emotional empathy for a character for me.So Away she goes with her small contingent of security vehicles on her way to the Bullet Farm and Gas Town, I guess to trade milk for supplies... ROAD TRIP!!We are driving, we are driving, whoa wait what? she went the wrong way...WHY!?! Don't know. Joe's crew is watching, Uh oh she's gone rogue. Why? Uh oh Joe is mad apparently Furiosa stole his lady friends or prized breeders as Joe calls them. You know pet names and all. So cute.Joe sends out the call to chase down Furiosa and get his ladies back. Rally the WAR BOYS!!Now we meet NUX, who I really didn't like in the beginning but now I will say he is the only character in the movie that was dynamic enough to make me care about him. NUX as a war boy has one purpose in life and that is to do as Joe commands and if he does an honorable job and pleases Joe he will enter the gates of Valhalla; which I can only assume is some form of heaven. As the movie progresses NUX goes from only wanting to please Joe to realizing he can do good for others and in doing so he would be more significant in this life than he ever was when he was just a war boy out to please Joe.Additional characters that I believe could have used better development are the Breeders and the Mothers or old ladies, I'm not sure what they were real called because by the time we meet them I was just wishing the movie would end.The breeders are taken to safety by Furiosa, or they were kidnapped by her because she thought they were abused and didn't want to be with Joe. I'm not sure if the Breeders wanted to leave or Furiosa convinced them they should leave because once they are being pursued by Joe they seem to want to return to him. A simple scene showing how these women suffered under Joe's captivity would have made me care much more about these women. Not that I want to see abuse or cruelty to women but an indication that they had suffered would build an emotional connection that you then want to help save them as well.The Breeders are the central component of the movie; we should be made to care if they escape.The old women seriously they just loosely tied a few things together like hey there is no green place turn around and go home. Honestly they could have driven there met no one and formulated a plan to go back.Now the guitar guy...I enjoyed the concept of the guitar guy jamming out as the war party moved along but I wanted him to actually play the music that you hear. Instead he plays a bar and then there is a score that takes over and includes none of his guitar work. I wanted him to be James Hatfield from Metallica melting my face with Fuel for fire...makes sense they need fuel, guitar guy is shooting fire. Also guitar guy is shooting fire but not using it to fight anyone, super wasteful!Here in a post apocalyptic world where fuel is scares and this idiot is just burning it up!!I don't feel a sense of scarce resource or desperation. The Breeders are wasting water when they get one of their miraculous escapes from a horde of fast moving vehicles. All the vehicles are supercharged gas guzzlers, NUX empties about 10 gallons of gas into his car in an attempt to kill himself and blow up the war wagon. Really if I was in charge and someone wasted that much gas there would be no Valhalla for them.I just didn't get the same desperate, these are hard times sense from this movie. I wanted to feel suspense, the whole time you just knew these guys were going to make it and Furiosa and Max would live but you knew NUX was going to be dead before the movie was over. Of course they had their close calls but never did you think "oh man this is the end for them".It was a great bit of Cirque Du Sole style chase scenes pieced together again and again but I really could have done with 45 min less chase scene and 45 min more character development.On top of all of this I'm a car guy and there were a number of ridiculous vehicle related items that were wrong or nearly impossible.Climbing around touching hot exhaust pipes, an 18 wheeler can escape motorcycles and supercharged cars, Nux drives with a flat tire at high speed (Max would have to stay in place for this to be somewhat possible but still incredibly unlikely, spitting a fuel mixture into the supercharger and getting boost, climbing around in an engine compartment fixing the engine while driving down the road and its not just a single engine it's a dual engine setup. This rig would lose so much power after losing 50% of its power it would be crawling along not out running all those other vehicles.Yes, Yes it's just a movie don't nitpick the silly details but really character development could have tied it all together in a Lovely package for me.Okay enough of the why I didn't like it. Honestly I just wanted more of an emotional connection to the characters.Positives There were lots of explosions It was well shot The action scenes were well choreographed Joe's costume was unique-ish (Post apocalyptic Darth Vader) Pro-Breast feeding	0
14affd2c-568e-4b8c-9b17-95865c5322b0	  I don't usually give into reviews when it comes to my interest for movies, but when a movie gets a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, I have to see it. Now I'm incredibly flustered and trying to figure out how to get my $5 back (ITunes rental). I've watched the Mad Max series before, but when you do a reboot/ sequel, you need at least some kind of introduction to the series. The movie depended on the mystery of each characters past and future, but failed to fulfill the suspense. I'm disappointed in the reviews here. The action was great, but the storyline sucked.	1

ba631a60-d9dd-4b5e-bdf0-4f8308e398c7	  It is quite a good film, although not much happens in it, it's basically one long car chase sequence.

f78de2b3-191d-41ef-9cd0-634ccba50c0d	  extremely disappointing installment. Non of the actors made me believe in them. I saw them make the journey and I was viewing from a far. If I want to connect to Max's story I am better of dusting off the first three. It is, however, visual entertainment and for that it is great fun for a movie night, but not a worthy successor. I do not understand that the titular character is playing second fiddle to Ms. Theron's character. I almost feels that Mad Max was added to justify the Mad Max elements (post apocalyptic landscape, tribal societies and outrageous vehicle) and to boost box office sales. The script seems to be written not to tell Max's story, he's just along for the ride. The one moment MAx had an opportunity to take central stage and which might have made it a Mad Max film, was cut on the editing floor I assume. It was the nightly action, where Max returns with blood on his face and the viewer does not even get a glimpse of what our boy did. Just Charlize's words "it is not his blood".	0

I applaud the other 2%. In fact I'd say this film was exactly the same as the 1995 flop Waterworld except this time they switched from the sea to the desert. Waterworld was actually a far better film compared to this tripe. Anybody who fancies the film I can sum it up in one line "nutters drive from one place kill each other along the way and do the same when they drive back". Virtually no dialogue, no character development....nothing. Crap!!!!	0

4e834a4d-582f-4298-9e3a-0bb4381ca7fe	  Its a bit over rated, the plot doesn't really make any sense. They make everyone so unlikable besides Joy. I really hate watching movies where everyone is so dislikable. Riley is annoying and she makes decisions out of happiness and sadness even though Joy and Sadness aren't with her. I know it seems like a nit pick but if you're making a movie about emotions I expect each emotion to show their respective properties. Its better than The Good Dinosaur at least.	1
7d5b4b64-8149-4a6e-8f59-d726c6f6c436	  The movie was trite and predictable in my opinion. I'm also bothered that the portrayals of anger and depression were male in the girl's head. The implication is that those emotions in girls are driven by men. About the only thing I enjoyed was the visuals.	1

Puleeze. There is a concept here, which needs a movie to beat it to death. Nice voice performances, heartwarming story, occasional chuckle. But this is not greatness, not for me anyway.	1

574caf2a-3659-42c2-9cfb-7b8eebdddca8	  This movie had far too many flaws. Disney gets an A for trying but a D for execution. For one they established that the emotions are supposed to generally act like the emotions they are. Obviously they are going to feel other things as they are personified but when you establish in the concept in the beginning you need to follow through. In other people's head the emotions act the same and don't show off their actual emotion. Such as the mom's saddness acts more like reasoning and logic than sad. Then the whole build up to the movie is Joy realizing that "oh my god we need sadness." that's played down since a lot of tv shows tell kids the lesson of "it's okay to be sad." and "other emotions are okay to be felt." There was too much build up for just these lessons to actually make it a compelling movie. Maybe these can be excused to a certain degree since it is a childrens movie. But the one thing I can not excuse is the absolute lack of humor in the movie. I like kids movies despite being 19 mostly because they tend to be funny this movie has the worst humor ever. I have never sat through a kids movie with such a straight face, but it was so easy since there was basically nothing funny about this movie I figured if anything anger would make me laugh since Lewis Black is hilarious but he was just so bland. The funniest part was at th every end with the boy she meets and his emotions screaming "girl!" This movie gets far too much praise and honestly I think it's because Disney is written on the front.	0
6c5ac973-c90a-4978-88ab-03d5f09d6ae8	  Pixar presents its next film Inside Out. The movie explores the idea of creatures in your head that control your emotions. Joy (Amy Poehler) naturally wants everything to be happy and feels that the other emotions with her (Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness) get in her way. An incident however causes them to be removed from the control headquarters and they must find their way back through the maze that is the mind to be sure that their host Riley does not continue life without Joy and Sadness. As the two try and return, the other emotions do their best to control the situation at hand. Only through viewing other emotions and memories do they begin to realize that together they form the best team to make Riley a better person. Inside Out is clever at parts, and has some good moments, but for the most part the emotions in my head found this movie to be too short and not as imaginative or interesting as some of its predecessors.	1
5183808f-7cae-409c-852c-54bc370edd43	  Very disappointing. The characters were annoying and unimaginative. The plot was dull.	0
3f13b57a-6548-4e9e-9ef6-9929d6f224fa	  Top marks for originality. Conceptually brilliant. But I found it too melancholic and the subtle messages too disturbing for my liking. I didn't enjoy the film at all, in fact I found it irritating. I may be the only one not raving about it, but I think there is cause for concern as to how Inside Out undermines the mind of a person. Firstly, it was a look into the mind of an 11 year old, as if she had no control over any of her emotions, and it was her emotions having control over her, pressing buttons as if she were a robot. It comes across as if we are are at the mercy of our emotions, and we start to doubt ourselves. Second, the animation was suggestive of stereotyping of the emotions. For example, the melancholic "Sad" character, was drawn as fat, bespectacled, short, blue and turtlenecked, while Joy, the happy character, was lithe, tall, slim and pretty. This animated film is packed with subtle messages which are detrimental to children's perception of themselves. It shames body types. It shames emotions. It shames the self. Inside Out is neither smart nor emotional. It is dangerous for children and young people.	1
f787adf1-1448-48a7-9d34-6c6d35204339	  Do not watch this film if you are expecting something funny. It is one overly long emotional journey into the mind of a 12 year old girl, not what I would consider entertainment. It was mostly SAD. I want my hours back.	0

c92874c4-faa2-4a03-96c8-bdcc44b4d7cb	  An infuratingly flawed piece of animated cinema that is universally liked. With an idea that is perhaps the best in the Pixar canon, it is a shame that things don't add up or are not thought through properly. It is also a shame that I would have prefered a movie of Riley and her troubles moving to a new home, as that is the most subtle thing about the whole movie. This movie is loud and clunky and it amazes me how well it is has managed to sway people. This particular story has so many things wrong with the engineering of its narrative construction that to dissect it all would ruin anybody from watching it on a first viewing. Let's just say that the five main characters do not evolve (or at least not as many as you'd want) in any pleasing way and three of them do not become more than their stock character. Everything that happens inside Riley is bombastic and theres a character ripe for a twister or a villain but the creators of this film are too short sighted to see it. The animation and character design and Riley's company are all that I liked about this. The very end credits are amusing too but surely they were done with that when they released Finding Nemo.	0
1e997662-c8f4-4966-956a-4b0eecefb801	  I had such high hopes for this movie... As it was, the concept was really cool, but the plot was severely lacking. The effort it took to establish the "world" made it so that what was actually going on in the real story was super boring. Also, I'm not sure that the main character should have been 11 years old. This should have been a movie aimed at younger children who are just figuring out what emotions are. My 2-year-old repeatedly said to me, "This is boring. I want to watch something else!"

b42ca75f-2fb2-4382-b519-fb6f2bd248c6	  What a disappointing film.As the film follows the theme of proving the importance of sadness in developing a rounded personality, it puts some of the characters into some very dark places and prolonged periods of stress that will upset many of the children who go to see it. This should not have been rated as a "U". I know it could easily upset my own daughter and this DVD will be hitting the charity shop first.From an adult point of view, it has it's funny moments (virtually all of which are available FOC in the online trailers). Buying the film and sitting through the whole 91 minutes provides very few additional laughs.The story itself it mostly fairly dull, with very little in the way of a finale, while it was almost impossible to relate to, or even care about, the main characters in the film.A very rare dud from Pixar.	0
0b943837-f5f1-4736-ad62-59d2262f14c5	  Here's this movie in a nutshell: A young girl gets sad and upset cuz she and her parents had to move to San Francisco. And then she decides San Francisco isn't all that bad.That's it. That's the movie. And the story is told thru some cute characters who represent the girl's different emotions (Sadness, Joy, etc.) Sometimes I wonder if I watched a different version of the movie than the rest of those who stumble over themselves to heap praise on it. That's certainly the case here. Sometimes animated feature films are written to appeal to 8 year olds, and other times they are written to appeal to a wider audience, including adults. In this case it was written solely for 8 year olds. She attends a new school and has to stand in front of the class and tell them about herself. So, you guessed it, Fear takes over as she stands up, then Joy tries to overcome and get her excited to talk to the class, then she sees the kids staring and gets fearful, and so on. That's the movie. You watch the emotion characters inside her brain dealing with events in her life as she moves to a new city. Now I suppose if you really enjoy the cute little emotion characters then the movie is okay. But otherwise there's nothing here. No story, no tension, no really funny moments. And the characters are the definition of predictable. Geez, let me see...what will "Sadness" say? Hmmm...I could only stand 1/2 hour and ended it. Terrible. UPDATE: I forced myself to watch the entire thing. Yeah, it sucked. Joy and Sadness spend most of the movie trying to get back to "headquarters", and in the end Riley decides San Francisco isn't all that bad. Yeah, this sucked.	0
eef27d30-d552-4d13-b5e0-ec1aead2320c	  Awful movie. Boring. Not a comedy. It's mostly sadness. The only emotion it provoked was a desire to throw the "sadness" character over the edge into the lost memory abyss.	0

I would imagine most kids will find this film a sleeper, as in they're going to nod off, or worse for a parent, they're going to get restless. An ending does not a movie make.	1

I just wasn't as engaged with this movie as I have been with other Pixar ventures. The animation is fabulous, though, and my kids seemed to really enjoy this movie.

f8455e87-4de7-42a1-bed5-8bb613fd7baa	  I can see why this movie has gotten a lot of good reviews, but I wouldn't put it up high on a pedestal like some people have. The 'emotions' make for interesting characters, which is the main reason this movie was amusing(good voice casting too). Still, it's not without its flaws. I left with more questions than anything and I felt like a lot of this made things up along as it went just to continue the plot, but it is a kids movie I suppose. Entertaining and no annoying singing(save for that gum commercial jingle, but it was used in a funny way so no bad marks for that).	1
bfdfbb3f-35d4-44b3-9d45-7a540072311b	  The movie is not the emotional gut-punch or the technical marvel I was told it to be. It seems to get too much praise for being a downbeat, mature story only translated into an animated movie for kids, though it can and should be enjoyed by people of all ages. I suppose my disappointment stems from the fact that the powers that be that created the emotional system inside everyone's head created a stupidly flawed world that not only puts the emotions (and thus the person) in danger, but also hopes to circumvent any logic gaps that might occur, granted though that this little world inside people's head is made from scratch, but set up for failure from the start.	1
9718bc0b-310a-4e86-922d-cdd3427f5306	  i enjoyed the ideas and i enjoyed the concept but i couldn't get into the plot. the character's emotions run away with her because she moved one time when she was a child? someone whose mother died and had to move from foster home to foster home takes absolutely no pity on someone who merely had to move to a different place. as well as running away simply because of that. boo hoo! you have a loving family and you go off on your shit. so privileged and i didn't appreciate it. the concept is great but the plot of the little girl certainly makes this movie scream #firstworldproblems because nobody who has actually had real struggles in their life would feel that bad for the child. now, in my defense considering it seems like i'm bashing this fictional little girl, i do understand that she was upset for moving, but if you want someone to feel for the character, something besides the insult of moving would do the trick.	1
d0d9f42f-4bed-47b9-9567-3508ff0b3ace	  It was ok at best. The animation was fantastic although the human characters look a little wonky depending on their facial expressions. The movies main errors come from the relationship between the emotion characters and their human host. Cheesy dialogue is present everywhere due to the fact that the emotions just kind of react to whatever their host does whenever they are in the "Control room" the brain. So in other words, there is a whole lot of "Wow!" and "Oooooooohhh" reactions from the emotions the whole time, which does get annoying. There are also too many plot conveniences and plot holes, but you can youtube those if you want to hear about them. Is this movies concept original? No, but well executed for the most part. All in all, it is much better than "Frozen" and worth a watch to formulate your own opinion.	1

0b709d2d-c5eb-4a01-a3fe-aee185149ee4	  All the praise made me think this would surely be another Disney Pixar classic enjoyed by both children and adults. Personally I don't see great appeal here for older viewers. Using personification of key emotions such as joy and sadness to provide commentary on a young girl's childhood is a strong concept but it eventually becomes mind numbing to mature eyes when the script, characters, humour and design are all heavily geared towards kids.	0
c2b52ac6-709d-41a9-83e0-dc802989f83b	  Severely overrated, it's a good movie, but way too blatant in its attempts at forcing tears out of the viewer. Not to mention that the whole premise is entirely unoriginal. Too many sappy and cringe-worthy moments. I think the only reason people are rating this movie so highly is because we're all so desperate to see Pixar make a comeback, but I'm sorry, this is not it.	1

It doesn't quite go far enough though, and the storyline is perhaps at risk of confusing younger audiences. I can't see it going down as a classic.	0

Some forseeable action happenes, sometimes the pace gets way too slow.

All in all, the movie is a nice cartoon for young and all but I would rather recommend to watch it on dvd than in a cinema.	1

927a1747-fe94-4e31-8dae-f2ef99cee6bc	  Well that was disappointing. My high expectations for this movie were kicked in the crotch. It lacked substance, like it was missing vital organs. Sure it was cute, but not as cute as I had hoped. It was funny at times. But parts were really Disney cliche and generic, plus I had to ignore the character issues and plot holes. I like human psychology (not that this movie was clever, but its simplicity I guess was for the child audience), but this was meh. Too bad, cuz I really wanted to love it. I wanted to feel, to cry, but I was let down. 6.5/10	1

452c01e7-2d65-42ff-a959-6e5af4ff18d8	  A brilliant idea that shines for the first few minutes and gradually dies out for the rest of the film due to the lack of animation creativity and deep script, hmmm, this sounds familiar to me. Ah yes, "Up" - a profoundly creative and emotional ... short film of first-ten-minutes coupled with an utterly boring full length animation that follows. They might share the same director, right? Bingo! Indeed "Inside Out" has a very good premise - the simplification of human's feelings and thinkings into some distinctive factors, but its execution is somehow boring, full of clich�s, repetitive scripts, few emotional moments that were dwarfed by the same monotonous set-pieces like "Monsters, Inc." (which was directed by, obviously, the same director). A human mind is always something fascinating, but its depiction here in "Inside Out" is disappointing with not much creativity put into its vast boring emptiness of a landscape. Basically the film has no "villain", but the poorly-developed characters themselves are already villains to the audience - why does Joy (should have been "Optimism") always lead instead of Sadness (should have been "Pessimism"), given the psychological fact that sadness is, in most case, the most memorable feelings in our memory? Why does Disgust need to be here, given another psychological fact that it is way less important in our mind than, let's say, imagination, creativity, or especially desire? And why in the world do emotions prevail reasons in controlling our everyday life? The simplification of the mind is acceptable if it brings out a clear, coherent, and fascinating "inside out" portrait of our mind, our emotions. But if such simplification only induces misunderstanding and incoherence, than it is simply a failed effort. I understand that the journey of Joy, Sadness et al. is only an euphemistic depiction of the changes in the mind of a coming-of-age girl in new situation, but her emotional journey is disappointingly uneventful and thus could not bring any weight to her "inside journey". Still, the film is very OK as an entertaining piece, but its lack of creativity and caring execution is unforgivable. It will be very sad if this film wins another Oscar for Peter Docter, such winning only gives way for more unimaginative animations and a poorer taste by the audience.	1

b11bcff6-4cdc-4c0a-881a-333bf2549b35	  I'm yet to see a Pixar film that I haven't enjoyed, and Inside Out continued that tradition. My hopes may have been a little too high heading into this one, as even though it was a good film, it definitely fell short of some of their previous classics. I foolishly expected it to go a little bit darker into Riley's emotional state, but it still touched on some themes that are important for kids (and adults) to see and understand.	1
512acd9c-d92a-49d3-a90d-8a3512d0fdc9	  Not top tier Pixar, but not bad either. Bing Bong and Anger were great characters the rest were sporadically good.

a9ac5150-e3d5-478d-9888-2cc912530ce7	  Very disappointing compared to Pixars other work, or even other big animation studios like Dreamworks' recent films. This film just takes one of the first rules or filmmaking (Show, Dont Tell) and slaps it right in the face. There's so much exposition spat at you that within the first 10 or 15 minutes, you can form the entire plot, character arcs and twists straight away. The design here is lacking the immagination or other Pixar movies and is nowhere near the level of eye-candy we've some to expect from animated features. The story felt forced, and I found it difficult to give a damn about any of the characters, the main two are downright boring/irritating/unlikeable. Side characters are great though, making it tolerable, and were animated really well, but the film lacked substance and heart of other Pixar films. There were a few gags in here that made me laugh, but mostly I was rolling my eyes in frustration at plot-holes and those horrible "golf-clap" moments. Definitely one you can buy on DVD and play for you 5-year-olds on a loop to keep them busy with purdy colours, but far from films that anyone of teenage and up would enjoy (Like pretty much all of their other films) Hard to beleive this comes from the guy who made Monsters Inc. and Up,	1

e8f29882-4779-401b-ba79-eb5dfbe67a13	  I actually saw this movie several weeks ago. I just haven't been able to come up with a lot of in depth things to say about it; at least not enthusiastically. This seems to happen to me a couple of times a year. A highly anticipated movie starts generating a lot of buzz with critical acclaim and with great word of mouth which gets me pumped to see it. I then see it; I like it, but don't love it. Skyfall, Captain America 2, Lego Movie, and now Inside Out.I've never been a die-hard Pixar fan. I do really like most of their stuff, but they've clearly seen better days. It seems since Toy Story 3, Pixar has been in a slump. We got a sequel nobody wanted (Cars 2), a prequel nobody wanted (Monsters University), and a creatively bankrupt bait n' switch (Brave). Don't get me wrong, Inside Out is a good solid movie that has a lot going for it and it is a step in the right direction for Pixar.Inside Out's premise is very intriguing. A young girl named Riley whose emotions are manifested within her mind as real characters: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. These characters collectively represent Riley as a person as they each play a role in her life and upbringing. As she gets older and goes through life-changing situations, her emotions become conflicted and at odds with each other. This is easily the deepest, most complex movie Pixar has ever conceived. Although not at all an ORIGINAL concept, it is still very creative and thought provoking. Everything going on in the mind is visually represented here. Core memories, the Train of Thought, memory dumps and many many others. It's very clear really smart people worked on this story and they go straight for the jugular on its emotional impact. This is a movie everybody can relate to and I will admit, I got a bit teary-eyed toward the end during a final moment between Riley and her parents.So why aren't I over the moon about this movie? It's very creative, beautifully animated, and is universally relatable. For me, Inside Out is so deep, so mature, so... emotional that it often forgets to have fun. Oh, there are fun moments, but they are completely drowned out by the heaviness of Riley's increasingly chaotic inner thoughts. I can't remember the last time I've seen so much crying in a movie. It just wasn't very pleasant to watch at times because the movie rarely ever takes a break to lighten up the mood which can make it seem dull at times. When I watch a Pixar film, I expect to be entertained as well as emotionally moved and Inside Out just didn't do enough entertaining for me to fully love it.Inside Out is a respectable step in the right direction for Pixar, but I still don't think they're fully "back" yet. I did enjoy it and I'm sure most others will too.	1

df4f1188-6a65-42ac-bff4-1b6770e14e35	  Riley, 11, a girl with an astonishingly limited range of emotions (joy, fear, sadness and anger) has to endure the terrible hardship of relocating to San Francisco from Minnesota and loses her shit. And then (of course) finds it again - by rehabilitating sadness because sometimes, Sadness Can Be Good. Sentimental skit, no that's not a typo, based on the premise that Joy, and her handmaiden happiness, constitute the fundamental human condition. This is of course a truth we hold to be self-evident, and therefore cannot be disproved - like by actual evidence. Best moment comes at the end (no, not for that reason) when the conceit that humans are driven by four simple emotions operating a console that becomes upgraded as we grow up (i.e, the apps get cleverer but the operator doesn't), is extended to other characters, including (best of all) a street cat (no, not that sort, an actual cat).	1

But, for me, the journey of Joy and Sadness was much too long, and a bit boring. I started eagerly hoping we'd "get back to headquarters" - maybe even more than the characters were! Still, it's a fun, family movie and the end, with all the peeks into various brains, was great!p.s. - The short film before, "Lava", was so wonderful! Flat out wonderful!	1
aec3c7f9-1355-4653-84a4-4ebbea77bc17	  So... You want to watch Inside Out? Let me answer that question for you - no you don't. Think of it as a culmination of all the worst films you've already watched with a sprinkling of your worst fears. I'm talking clowns for all you party virgins out there. I don't think I could possibly put into words how terrible this film is. I spent about half of the film with my fist in my mouth trying to prevent myself from either screaming at the screen or just laughing tears of despair and frustration. Sadness (an extremely sad, depressed emotion living in the pits of Riley's brain) is probably the most unfortunate character one could ever have the misfortune to turn their nose up to. Think of her as the offspring of the annoying little kid from UP who everyone seems to pity because of his lack of a brain or any form of common sense and Jack Frost from Rise of the Guardians - or, even better, the disastrous result of a cruel sexual experiment between Justin Bieber and Susan Boyle. And that's putting it lightly.I can only begin to imagine the sheer temptation to throw her over the edge and into that pit of forgotten memories. How Joy managed to refrain from doing so I cannot comprehend.I would like to end this review by saying NO. Just NO. This film is one big disappointment and left me feeling, quite frankly, like a deflated walrus.Do not put yourself through an hour and 40 minutes of this. It's not worth the �7.70 you spent on it.	0
0001cc5c-6d99-4532-9a62-1e417964e87e	  Well only one word came out of this movie for me. Mental Health. Well two. hahaah. I found the movie very heartwarming. The plot very confusing, but basically all over the place. I said to a staff member who has seen the movie, whom I know well, that you'd have to have a very good mental health ie not depressed etc., etc., You'd have to be very mentally strong. A girl Riley(Dias) moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. However her emotions are played upon. Emotions being Joy(Poehler), Sadness(Smith), Fear(Hader) Disgust(Kaling) and Anger(Black). Sadness keeps interfering with the Memories and the Core memories. And hence Joy and Sadness somehow get out of teh HQ, so they meet up with Bing Bong(Kind) and have many an adventures. So overall, not the best movie from PIxar. However I can sense a sequiel thou. So lets hope that'll be better. hahah	1
4632be0a-f43c-44d6-923d-914da58fdc46	  I didn't think that this movie lived up to the 98 percent score and critical acclaim that it got. While it was a fun and fresh story by Disney, it wasn't Frozen, Toy Story or one of the other Disney heavyweights. A definite renter especially for those with children, but I'd temper expectations a bit.	1
a583158f-7db4-42b2-9fa4-5fa12d10abf9	  I admire Martin Luther King, very much. I have watched many such films, movies and made for television, and, this is the most disappointing, boring take on telling his tale that I have ever encountered. However, I read, in an article, that Oprah Winfrey starred in this movie and she was not in it, when it was rented from Red Box. And, the thing that I saw was so boring that there is no way 86 percent of anyone would like it, ever. So, that does make me wonder what they saw versus what was released in other places. That sort of shenanigans happens, you know?	0
03054495-cada-43a1-96cc-e929005da769	  I'm giving Selma a bad review for one reason. It's blatantly and unapologetically historically inaccurate. This is a Hollywood trend that seems to be hitting biopics and period pieces really hard, and that is if there is something about a true story you don't like just change it to make your movie better.The movie falsely portrays President Lyndon B. Johnson as an enemy of MLK, going as far as using the FBI to discredit him. In reality this couldn't be farther from the truth. Selma was LBJ's idea, he considered the Voting Rights Act his greatest legislative achievement, he viewed King as an essential partner in getting it enacted, and he didn't use the FBI to disparage him. Did they really need to create lies in order to tell MLK's story? No, it's already good enough in full truth.	0
e0f5f8f6-98ef-46ad-ac34-6456fc8d8fbb	  I was not impressed with Selma overall. I honestly expected a bit more from the film and instead ended up watching every other Martin Luther King movie ever.Now this movie does have a few things going for itAn amazing soundtrack- One that really goes with the impact of the story A few deep and emotionally gripping scenes. Yes there really powerful in many ways.However we have seen these emotional scenes before and for a Oscar caliber movie it didn't bring anything new in the way 12 Years a Slave did. it kinda just felt like the Oscars wanted a 'black lead' film to be in the running so they said....Selma.. there happy.But I am not happy and really don't think this is a Oscar caliber film at all.I never got into the actor playing MLK. David Oyelwow just didn't capture me. I also think Ava needs more time to become a better director and don't get some first time writer in the chair as well, because it did not go all that great as far the story was concerned.There are just other movies that do Martin more justice-Our friend, Martin - Bringing King to ChinaThis film also had many chances to go deeper and darker with Martin Luther King, but instead it runs away and tries to play it all safe.Overall there is some good here, and if this is your kids first look at Martin Luther King then hey let him watch it, but I have seen too many Martin Luther King documentaries and movies and this just doesn't do it for me.	0
051751de-86ca-4df6-b902-4bf1d0d4dd36	  Good movie although I had the feeling at the end that it really missed something. Anyway outstanding work from Davdi Oyelowo and Carmen Ejogo too!!	1

e12eeb83-7316-41cb-bc76-7150b2eb5a8d	  Very good film with strong performances, and perhaps it should be beyond criticism considering its historical importance, but Selma doesn't rise to the level of greatness that it perhaps deserves, nor manages to surprise, but keeps strictly within conventional boundaries.	1

e3baff1e-e8b2-4dd1-b4ae-019de7ea11e1	  This drama is interesting from an historical perspective. It contains good solid performances with few surprises. But I wasn't able to connect emotionally and found Oyelowo to be uninspiring, except for when he was giving a speech. AAN	1
5e250ae9-a0d0-4e0e-a0cd-f9bc54950639	  A powerful subject that resonates strongly with the present. However, it is far from being the cinematographic masterpiece that I was expecting, given the reviews. It is a textbook biopic. Not that there is anything wrong with that.	1
06c0d1e2-511e-4a1d-bf7b-5704cd4b4c1d	  People were upset at the 2015 Oscars that this movie didn't get recognition in certain categories, making it seem as if the Academy was discriminating. I disagree with this disappointment as I didn't see greatness in this movie.Selma was a slow movie for me, but it had a lot of allusions and historical figures to make for a good movie for history buffs. The movie had an aura of significance throughout, but it wasn't necessarily intriguing to me. The film's focus is on a short segment of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life, specifically the march from Selma to Montgomery (I believe) to protest the suppression of African Americans' right to vote.The film was only mediocre. Firstly, I did not think David Oyelowo played a good MLK Jr. Secondly the film seemed to rush through interactions with historical figures instead of keeping them on for the ride. When they show Malcolm X in the film he is pronounced dead only a few scenes later. J. Edgar Hoover shows up once in the film even though he is mentioned on a few occasions.Nothing stood out for me regarding the overall aesthetic of the film which is why I call Selma mediocre at best. Everything seemed pretty typical - the direction, the cinematography, the editing had a slow pace to it, the acting - all fairly typical. With a boring movie I really don't have much to say, and this film bored me, but it was historically significant and still relevant to recent African American issues such as the riots in Ferguson.	1

3821d966-d6b9-4ffa-8f94-8ceb0fda1e9c	  Boring, makes things up. Democrats are cheering a movie where they show how black people have overcome the oppression of Democrats.

0fd0516c-5543-4418-a9be-309db106e21e	  I feel that people are in love with the true story of this movie more than the movie itself. Its story is a true one and the true story is indeed a fantastic story. However it does not translate well into a film. I think that because of the sociopolitcal themes covered in this movie, that people are rating it higher that what it should be. I was hoping for something truly touching, sad thing is one already knows how it ends. I feel that a full documentary of Dr. King would have been better than a story of one town and its political push as Dr. King did much more than what is shown here. It has just been a current trend for the academy in recent years to reward movies with "racial" themes. I think this movie is overrated and I feel dead asleep for like 20 or 30 minutes. When I awoke I heard at least two other people somewhere behind me snoring.	0

f4ba8027-4ec6-4c98-bada-dac8aaa27fd1	  An adequate though uninspired depiction of the momentous events in Selma, Alabama in 1965. All films, even historical films, deserve some license to enhance the narrative. Ava DuVernay and Paul Webb have an odd relationship with the actual events in Selma and it detracts from the natural drama. Notwithstanding the wholesale misrepresentation of LBJ, the film also toys with the timeline of the actual events. The fact that LBJ had publicly announced his intent to pass the Voting Rights Act before the actual march on Montgomery, or that a federal judge had also ordered Alabama to end it's literary tests before the march aren't depicted even remotely accurately in the film. I'm bewildered as to why J. Edgar Hoover, whose intense animus for MLK led him to constantly torment Dr. King, is soft peddled as a mere loyal servant of the president. The reality is that Hoover was Kings primary foe and LBJ was very much a partner and ally in 1965 (they later fell out over MLK's anti-Vietnam stance). It was unnecessary and odd to transfer Hoovers enmity to LBJ. The cast is fine. David Oyelowo is a talented actor but, not for a second do I feel like I'm watching Dr. King. The film was hamstrung by the fact that Dreamworks owns the rights to Kings actual speeches and they had to be paraphrased/re-created in Selma. Oyelowo doesn't have Kings voice or cadence. Paul Webb has, frankly, done a poor job trying to replace the eloquence of Dr. Kings original words. MLK was famous primarily for his oratory. His speeches and delivery were transformative and without the powerful words and delivery, we are left with a very thin facsimile. The film hardly compares to the great Jeffrey Wrights masterful portrayal of a younger MLK in Clark Johnson's fantastic TV movie "Boycott". Wright captured MLK with a mesmerizing performance and Johnson did a far better job humanizing the real life hero's of the civil rights movement. Where "Selma" fails "Boycott" soars. I'm still waiting for someone to do justice to Dr. King on the big screen, until then check out "Boycott". Sadly "Selma" was adequate at best.	0
69a4976a-1b8a-42c3-8e3e-93698e05d49d	  I hate that I was so bored. This movie is about one of the greatest men in history, for Pete's sake! I hope this doesn't make me a terrible person...	0
f6b228d6-3e50-407a-8cec-fdb21b393a42	  The movie acts as if every black person during the movie's time setting was a well educated person. It also acted as if 99% of the white people in the movie were racist bigots who wanted to murder all the blacks. Neither of these were true. While it did a good job at portraying what had happened back in those times, it also gave an innacurate portrayal of the time's people as well.	1
314a319b-1013-4bdf-89d3-220bf71f0025	  I understand why DuVernay wasn't nominated for a Best Director Oscar after watching this. This was a good movie, neither bad nor great though, it had a strong cast with good performances, but it was done in a fairly dull and uninteresting way; lacking much passion, tension, or really much feeling albeit some short emotional moments here and there. A little better quality than a TV movie bio. Dr. King's story is a great one though and the actors did their parts well, but overall this was just an okay film.	1
18aaccc1-1f93-45a7-b0cd-27d1e7269a6e	  Brutal. Strong. Beautifully portrayed.	1
00f74533-22c6-4c0e-832c-4cd2d56c84f0	  A few scenes sprinkled in there to raise your blood to the boiling point followed by a too many with some back room mumblings of no real import. Many may not be willing to call a film dull when it has such a historical figure... I'm not one of them.	0

51618a0f-4a11-4cec-85df-741e614f9a16	  Well made, pretty much what you'd expect after watching the trailer. Racist white people are a bit too cartoony (even though maybe not far from reality). Brings nothing new to the table but the performances and direction make it very engaging.	1

b0e1e492-b5e3-409f-9412-bef74ba05964	  This movie was incredibly boring, especially given the ample source material. It was competently thrown together, with some pretty good performances. It certainly didn't live up to the extreme hype. I fell asleep on two different occasions trying to watch it, but made it through the third try. Not very good. Not bad enough to be good. meh.	0
d0bf6423-ee1e-4fe4-afa5-2e9863965835	  This movie blew hard! I can't believe it got such a praise. A two hour historic race card just wasn't my forte, I suppose. The fact that I'm not black and wasn't around during this time has nothing to do with why I found this movie so boring. It was a good story, but a really boring film. If you haven't seen it, wait until it's an "ABC World Premiere".	0

50a1a855-fb03-4755-93b9-69a650efc988	  It was a good movie. But not powerful enough. It was really slow, violence and too long... David Oyelowo was really Martin Luther King Jr. His performance was great and he needed to get Oscar nomination. But I was thinking like this, history of Martin Luther King Jr. was great. But his movie was not really great. I was really tired to watch it... Co-Executive Produced by Brad Pitt. Oscar winner for best song.	1
58f09a29-6355-4c84-9d2b-706411cf5528	  I kept wondering how much of the drama was fiction and how much was real. It's a good movie, but I wonder about it's historical accuracy.	1

30112cee-e554-4703-8b7a-a8df4d3c44fa	  Great performances, but there's nothing in this film that hasn't already been documented a million times before.

I just would have liked to see something, some aspect of filmmaking, that made it stand out from every other MLK movie I've seen.	1

But the rest of the film is rather ordinary.	1
ad394a1b-c373-404a-8ec1-5c01217e052f	  David Oyelowo does a fantastic job, although the director's vision feels a bit muddled and the screenplay is a bit spotty. Outdoor photography is a standout but the interior shots are poorly lit and really took me out of the moment. Quibbles aside it's a decent movie.	1

5e11cd80-dc4d-41e9-a0a1-9aa1b62b79cd	  I didn't see any of the Oscar nominated films this year except Selma. I thought Selma had its moments but just wasn't a great film and had lots of problems -- poorly-written dialogue, a confusing crux, a lack of oratory, the best actors playing small parts, constricted camera shots, too much about the Kings' domestic conflict, too much about LBJ (he could have appeared just once or twice). It maybe attempts to be restrained but comes across as constricted and lacking the full range of affect and emotional depth. It doesn't even come close to a film like Spike Lee's 4 Little Girls, which was nominated in the past. Another film that comes to mind is Malcolm X, which is an excellent and masterful portrayal of a charismatic figure. The fact that King's family didn't endorse this film speaks volumes.	0
fa9808d9-589c-4877-b05e-eb05400554de	  Considering the subject matter, the film couldn't have been less inspiring. The film drags through its constant cliches without ever a moment of intensity of originality.	0

7dc0dce5-ea0b-4518-bcf4-f1600aee3b2e	  Oyelowo is great, no question, I just have a dislike towards movies dealing with specifically oppressed people as opposed to just oppressed in general. There were a handful of powerful scenes though that did resonate so if you dont have that same sensitivity, its worth watching.	1
00b675c4-cfe8-4029-ad3e-1c75bff79e50	  "Kinda of inspiring but still over rated".	1
d5828c7a-718d-4cdf-bce9-9095b35631ad	  If the civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 was half as drawn out and painstaking as "Selma", the movie that tells us about this moment in history, then it was certainly an epic test of endurance. I wanted so badly to like this movie because it is so well made, and perfectly acted, and it tries so hard to be honest and righteous, but it is so damned slow and plodding that I felt myself almost willing Luther King to triumph in his endeavours just so the film could end. The best parts of the movie are undoubtedly the magnificent speeches delivered by King which are now legend but if I wanted to hear these I would prefer listening to the actual recordings no matter how well David Oyelowo performs them. Only 3 out of 5 I'm afraid to say.	1
da62ee20-4671-4ccb-a537-67ed94d196a4	  I've said this many times about biopics based on significant historical figures... sometimes, a feature-length movie isn't enough to do their true-life character justice. Maybe producers should consider an HBO mini-series perhaps. Of course, having said that, there are exceptions to this. "Selma" serves as a great snapshot of the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr, but I'd have been keen to see a whole series highlighting more than just one part of the man's story. Oyelowo definitely delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.	1
f6b17e1c-80ad-430e-8690-3dacf2efc881	  If the Wikipedia website is right about M luther king then this movie is historically incorrect despite the fact it tries to pretend to give an eye to eye picture.Too long, too slow, certain scenes are just minutes of boring slow talk about peoples memories.Still it was good enough to be worth seeing but was pushing that limit very close to be too boring.	1
a082cc44-80c0-444f-8d92-04182d44d1ce	  *Ryan Shakes his head* Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. *And continues shaking it* Can I make a recommendation for your Oprah BookClub 2.0 March read? Yes? Ok I would suggest reading: Too Much Oprah: Oprah's Global Domination Overkill Who's it written by? Me. Yes yes yes, I knew that Selma was produced by two other production companies aside from Oprah's Harpo (jesus. even typing "Oprah" and "Harpo" in the same sentence exudes pretentiousness). But before watching Selma I mentally crossed my fingers and every other crossable body part hoping that Oprah wouldn't show her face in a movie she produced ( a la The Butler) Alas when she shows up in the second scene as one of the first shown black women trying to vote, that magical Make-A-Wish Foundation hope was obliterated. Thank Oprah-Almighty she only appears in like 4 other "Oh look it's Oprah again" scenes during Selma's 2 hr running time. My bigger issue surrounding Selma is related to the high-profiled or highly-celebritized people attached to film. Oprah; Tom Wilkinson (who actually did a decent job of playing President Lyndon B Johnson ), Giovanni Ribisi, Cuba Gooding Jr., Tim Roth, Martin Sheen and (pardon me why I ask the multiracial Gods of this universe WHY? For the love of WHY?) Common. Yes Common and John Legend do a powerful, get-off-that-pew-and-clap-your-heart-out synthesized performance of Glory (the film's only chance for an Oscar I feel). Played as the film closes, it backdrops Selma's final and most successful segment: the inclusion of real life, black and white news reals and camera shots of the actual march of Selma. But Common as an actor? Believable? Comm-on! No!! David Oyelowo does a valiant job at capturing the prestige yet keen fighting persistence of Martin Lurther King, Jr. Even if at times the ego in his portrayal feels somewhat inflated. There was one shocking moment where I gasped: the explosion of the church that kills the four girls. However after its initial quivering effect, it became one of many gratuitous stand alone scenes that was integrated into Selma as an incongruous scene purposely trying to sway the audience's feelings, perceptions and impressions to the film's subject material. Or at least that's how I felt by the finish of the film; a bit emotionally manipulated by director Ava DuVernay (first Hollywood wide release directorial debut) Even though it wasn't a "bad" movie, Selma was not a revolutionary movie I would put on any "best of" lists. Selma - along with American Sniper - feel like Patriotic historical pats-on-the-back flicks that got recognition not truly for it's material but for how they were produced and showcased. I would have more graciously enjoyed and appreciated watching a documentary on Martin Lurther King Jr's life rather than sitting through an all-star glamorized, Hollywood red-carpet engagement of it.	1
3013d55a-1cd1-4ed7-8675-817535c744a8	  It was good movie. I wouldn't go as far as to say it was a great movie, though.	1
7a4a58b2-2833-4371-a18b-eb3f98fc1a17	  Felt too many punches were pulled - esp. in MLK's relationship w/his wife - and the despicable bigot George Wallace should've been the main antagonist instead of splitting it with the flip-floppy LBJ.	1

d60516a1-5a70-4952-a3c1-f4134de62a8f	  David Oyelowo is just amazing as King but th overall script is rather dry & a drag at points. Director Ava does bring history to life with great characterisation & meticulous precision to the events of that time.	1

89db3990-6ed4-43f4-8c8f-21a08ec6a000	  A powerful movie in some ways, but in other ways it was powerfully slow. Weird directing and editing choices, but very well acted by a strong cast. But I do agree with the lack of acting Oscar nominations; they were good, but the other performances I've seen were just better.	1
8e759db3-ce4a-41f9-a5f8-4422f05fba96	  The film's high praise I fear is due to its reverential subject matter. David Oyelowo is quite good, but the characters never come alive. The film just sort of meanders to King's inevitable victory. Its depiction of LBJ is wildly inaccurate; its depiction of George Wallace fails to show why he opposed desegregation (it was a way to get votes). So he becomes simply a fool and a boogeyman, which dilutes his true evil. Not a terrible film, but many critics think they have to praise it or else look "racist" even if everything tells them this is a rather unremarkable movie.	1

7e1c73d0-1c40-4fa5-a2ea-453a3cfa2253	  Is a movie great just because the subject matter is important for all of us to see? To me not necessarily, and case in point the movie Selma. There are parts of this movie that are top notch. First off the acting is very good. David Oyelowo nails his performance of Dr. Martin Luther King, and much of the supporting cast is very good. I think Tom Wilkinson is at his best at President Johnson. So why only 3 stars you ask? The movie at times seem like they are stringing together many of King's top speeches, and his entire message and body of work into a small period of his life. While this movie is about his time in Selma, and planning the march from Selma to Montgomery, it feels like the filmmakers are trying to cram in as much history behind his entire civil rights movement as they can. I liked this movie, didn't love it. Oyelowo very well might when the Oscar for Best Actor as his work is excellent here. I just wish the writing and story movement were as excellent as his acting. It is a movie I believe we can all learn from and see.	1
20c86a97-7165-42eb-870f-1a1c14927fd0	  Let's start with the positives. I had heard from a local rag newspaper (The Boise Weekly) that Oyelowo's performance didn't match the vocal tone and pitch of MLK. Not sure what that means or how someone born after his death would gauge that but it isn't true. Oyelowo does not give a Best Actor performance but he delivers better then anyone else in Hollywood currently. I loved the speeches and I really can't think of anyone else who had both the look and attitude to pull of this role. The emotion of the movie is powerful. Selma really captures the horribly racist attitude of Alabama and the tangible ways in which that was expressed. I liked the supporting cast as well, with the exception of LBJ, who I will get to in a moment. Pretty good soundtrack, although I could imagine a more moving score. On the African-American side, relatively accurate portrayal historically as well. There was a nod to the affair rumors that surrounded King but the movie didn't make the mistake of giving rumors to much screentime or importance. But Selma is far from perfect and in fact, really takes a dive in the face of historical scrutiny. I am quite familiar with the LBJ presidency and Johnson's attitude towards the events of his time. Although his personal feelings may never be known, Johnson's public persona was strongly in support of King's movement, with the president going so far as to publicly bully Congress in order to see results. Portraying Johnson as a weak, indecisive and paranoid leader who stood in the grey in regards to racism is a leap that takes this movie from history to fiction. It would have been completely acceptable to portray Johnson as having to wrestle with some of these actions but the creators of Selma take one of the icons of the Democrat Party, African-Americans and the Civil Rights Movement and turn him into a weakling. To top it off, the movie blatantly ignores the fact that Johnson had the final march escorted by 2,000 soldiers, a move that stands as one of the most blatant government acts against racism since the Civil War. I would really like to say that the movie moves past this mistake, but it doesn't. Unlike other historical blunder movies (Fury being my top choice), Selma simply cannot overcome the weight of its mistakes. And the biggest question in my mind is the why. Johnson was never on the fence. He never did anything publicly to earn the ire of liberals, especially not with the 20/20 vision we have today. To attack him, of all people (Governor Wallace, the KKK and the town leaders are all people who could have been successfully deconstructed without an issue) seems counterproductive, especially in the current context and I think that this is a good indication of DuVernay's future as a director. On top of all of this, the LBJ character wasn't even a great choice and the final scenes of the movie seem to be an about face, as LBJ does what he did historically, in direct opposition to what an hour and half of film just told us. In truth, I think that movies like 12 Years A Slave and even Django Unchained do a better job of pushing for modern day civil rights reform. Selma was a mistake and is a failure to honor all of the dimensions of the story of that march.	1

02481195-c9c9-4cf5-9a99-44169437bbdc	  Superb acting. Major problem is that it rewrites history. While I am not a political liberal, the treatment of LBJ's character is 80% untrue. Those too young to remember will take this story line as fact. Too bad. LBJ was probably the greatest supporter of civil rights in out time.	0

06059f99-5a73-47ff-88a8-4998acf65b37	  It is obvious that the person who wrote this movie did not live during this time. POTUS Kennedy could not get civil rights legislation through congress. Much like the Tea Party today, the Dixiecrats of that time (legislators from the south) could block any legislation they chose not matter who was in control of congress. It was POTUS Johnson, as a Dixiecrat who was able to Jawbone then to pass civil rights legislation. He was the enemy he was portrayed in the movie. Not Worth the price of admission, if fact I left early.	1
015a14cc-2715-4962-b8d9-18fa310dc438	  The courageous and tremendous story of the significant and victorious march from Selma to Montgomery during the civil rights movement should have translated easily into an uplifting and remarkable film, but instead drags along with monotone, perfunctory performances. The one exception is Carmen Ejogo's portrayl of Coretta Scott King who captures more intensity and emotional impact in her powerful and soulful performance than the entirety of the film.Bottom line, this is a history lesson we should all know and remember, but you might find it more spiritedly told in an elementary school classroom. The story is a great one, the film not so much.	0
4d471564-b3a6-43f6-8b55-74a20824ff58	  Just for the record, LBJ never opposed voting rights, nor suggested the Voting Rights Act be postponed. In fact, he had already proposed it by the time King accepted his Noble. You can look it up. Just for the record.	1
77460cea-fc7d-4c38-8fa6-8f10b9c02ee7	  Another way over hyped flick. Nothing we didn't know already and you just went with the flow. It was like watching film you had seen already and throughout I just wanted to see Alan Parker's 'Mississippi Burning'. In saying that it is enjoyable and worth watching alone for the performances of Tim Roth as George Wallace, Tom Wilkinson as President Johnson and David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King, Jnr.	1
3aa6e266-f42d-430c-8f77-1ca975c7b17f	  I almost didn't like this one, just based on the fact that the dialogue here is mostly pretty boring to sit through. It does have some pretty inspiring things to say in this event of history and the performances here are all top notch. But as for being one of the top films of the year and something I one would want to sit through again, I would say no. This is the type that was made for history classes in school and not something to be marveled as a masterpiece of film itself as most critics would say. The soundtrack, I believe is what saved this movie and David Oyelowo's portrayal mostly. For those interested in the full story of what happened at Selma, I would recommend this to, otherwise it's more of a rental than anything.	1
ce37582a-7354-40fd-b5e0-c791f13b25bc	  SELMA is a movie about process, about the gruntwork and strategy and planning and procedure of staging a civil rights campaign, about how change is enacted through through careful swaying of public opinion and deliberate framing of a compelling narrative on TV screens and in newspapers around the country. In a similar way to Spielberg-Kushner's LINCOLN, it's thrilling to see a movie that gets at the practical political mechanics behind an easily romanticized revolution. But, for a movie about strategy and power dynamics to work, it needs, more than anything, the couple of things that hurts SELMA above all.The first of those is subtext. This is a movie almost entirely made up of people standing in rooms explaining what they are going to do. It's historical drama Christopher Nolan-style. It's a problem in the writing and it's a problem in the direction--nowhere is there an inventive variation on the dramatic dynamic to make things interesting. Contrast this with a film like LINCOLN, which is all about how people lie and cheat and make deals and barter and trade and wheel and deal. These are obviously two very different films about two very different sets of characters in two very different sets of circumstances, but it's that lack of subtext, that lack of dramatic layering that keeps the whole thing playing on one level. And, seemingly opposed to this, but actually tied directly to it is the second point...A driving sense of clarity. Clarity in the drama. Clarity in the objectives (both macro and micro) and in the tactics. In the obstacles. In the sense of cause and effect. In each character's particular motivations and where and why and how they clash in any given moment. Clarity in the timeline. Clarity in even something as basic and seemingly irrelevant as screen geography (I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie that crosses the line so frequently or so carelessly, and the lack of establishing shots in almost any scene only adds to the confusion--especially when much of the film plays out in a series of pretty nondescript rooms and curiously-framed, and coldly desaturated medium close-ups). When SELMA has this clarity, it is exciting and engaging--some of the conversations between Dr. King and President Johnson are among the highlights of the film precisely because the negotiation is so thoroughly grounded in such clearly articulated stakes (probably not coincidentally, this subplot is drawing some heat for taking some dramatic license with the events). The finale, aided by some actual documentary footage, is rousing and moving in the way it should be. But there are long stretches that do little to advance the story in actual story terms, content instead to reiterate the same dramatic beats without providing any further context or elaboration. The movie's ambitions are admirable, but it's never as smart as its subject matter, and the result is some often deflated drama. Still, this story is important, and continues to be discouragingly relevant in all kinds of ways. It's a story we need to hear, but I wish it was better told.	1
1539bf82-6ccd-4587-9614-e91cf8734054	  The first time a 99% movie on RT has let me down. It's pure sap: slow motion beatings, constant emotional monologues, with the whole made-for-TV inspirational aesthetic thing going on. Plus Oyelowo doesn't seem charismatic enough for the role. Someone needs to make a real MLK movie.	1
0d68c2cf-8201-41ab-88ed-ef9a067a14a3	  Oyelowo was very good in the lead role and the supporting cast did a good job. The movie overall was a good history lesson, however - it was very slow at times. Some of the more biopic drama with King's family just went on too long. People talking slowly and softly in dark rooms with dramatic lighting gets old after a while, just like it did in Million Dollar Baby.	1
0f6b9845-b761-41d8-af26-009080cc50ac	  Overrated and overhyped, Selma is a made for TV movie that has been given far more credit than it has earned. The real problem is that it is a well-acted slideshow of history, rather than a cohesive story. Monologues are the name of the game here and while I do enjoy a good monologue or two of self-awareness, here it just got annoying as it was hard to relate to characters who most of the time speak in monologues rather than as people.American History X did a much better job of exploring the themes of racism and hate while still maintaining a genuine (and very tragic) character story.	1
6449550e-8dac-4c45-9a34-fc7f20e78d12	  David Oyelowo gives an amazing performance as Dr King, but overall, Selma is a pretty average movie. Not bad, but not great.	1
a9071661-7722-4eea-aaef-be9ef78959cc	  This may step on a lot of toes, but I was not crazy about Selma. Granted, this is a movie that should have been made long ago, and coincided perfectly with the turmoil created by the police shootings; I was not impressed. The first half of the movie discussed the politics and legal wrangling involved in the march. I felt that Martin and Coretta's characters were underdeveloped, and needed more fleshing out. How did Martin's absence affect the children? Why did Coretta put up with the cheating? Okay, but not worth buzz.	1
7d17edf3-04b1-400b-b3fe-1a458527303c	  Oscars got it right...not a good movie. How can you have murder, politics, and racism seem so mundane? And rap music???? common, shameful. Not an exciting movie, not gripping, very underwhelming. Pacing bad, cinematography bad. No fire in the actors...Oprah was the best part of the movie, and the end where they tell you what happened to the characters.Watch "Malcom X" instead. Million times better and more information and better performances.	1
c7fd47c5-888c-4515-8117-75dc857d35fe	  Hum... Sometimes you read a true story and it is so moving you just can't imagine a movie doing it justice. Well, Clint Eastwood on American Sniper delivers brilliantly and Spike Lee on Malcolm X killed it. Why did the people who wanted to bring Selma to the big screen not call upon Spike Lee? What in the world where they thinking? I seriously thought this was another Angelina Jolie directed movie because it had the same look and feel as the butcher job that was done on another powerful story like Unbroken. I say redo, but please give the directing of these great stories to people that truly have a vision and skill to do the stories justice. Kinda mad cuz I love Martin Luther King.	0

39642213-8424-403a-958b-f2eacfb70d27	  "Selma" pieces together several scenes of monumental moments in American black civil rights history. The performances are no more than adequate and the characters are left undeveloped, leaving a disjointed film that's trying too hard to emulate a Best Picture instead of innovating enough to be one. The story itself, however, is so moving that it's almost impossible to not feel its emotional power.	1
7589b10c-ddf8-4d96-9e4b-21afb4249ee3	  I really wanted to like Selma, but it just missed the mark for me. For starters, very few of the characters were formally introduced, so their story or names for that matter weren't well known until the end of the movie when they flashed their names with a bio. Also, the police report-style text that came after some scenes really didn't seem to have much of a purpose or fit in with what was going on in the movie, and it wasn't ever explained why it was shown. Besides that, the movie was very slow-moving with a lot of awkward silence that just added to its longevity. Overall, Selma just didn't do justice to its important subject matter and it felt unfinished. It just needed a little more clarity and cohesion to be a good movie.	1
89cd97d5-abc9-4412-b2fa-9718a0775b2d	  I didn't love Selma though it was far from bad. The acting is fantastic, the story is very interesting, upsetting,and heartbreaking, and the look of the film is very well done (especially in the scenes regarding the bridge crossings). MLK's public speeches are generally quite powerful, but when it comes to the private meetings his words start to feel contradictory, wishy washy, and some ideas don't seem fully realized. These talks even start to feel stale at parts. And while it is a part of the film, MLK's family interaction is underdeveloped.And while the history behind Selma is important for every American to know about I just didn't think this film was all that great.And boy, do you really hate LBJ while watching this film. Well, until the scene with his sudden, random, uncharacteristic change of heart.	1
031a3715-eaf6-4bc5-863c-e157c4d051e0	  pedantic and over-long.clumsy. the main characters stutter-stepped their way through the picture. no flow, and no energy.the best scene was Johnson and Wallace's meeting.	1
c4ea8945-2c67-4d15-b8bc-5b9f0a664c89	  A solid MLK biopic driven by the performance of David Oyelowo. Though it's not until the very end that the gravity of the drama finally climaxes.	1
91534c0e-f680-4f0c-a985-64d00f360870	  It depresses me how many lies this movie tells and how poorly white people are portrayed. This movie is blatantly racist It rewrites history and casts any one other than black in a poor light. The people who made this should be ashamed.	0

dd4576de-eec3-4536-ab41-4ab483e0815c	  The movie just wasn't that good. I've been to Selma a dozen times...I've crossed the Bridge with students numerous times. Every time I go to the Bridge Crossing Jubilee (first weekend in March) I feel like I belong, this is where American democracy was born. Selma, Alabama is pivotal in American History. I love movies; good movies.. Maybe its because I've seen Eyes on the Prize a hundred times...but "Selma the movie" didn't move me the way I thought it might. It didn't have the depth that I wanted it to have. I didn't think it was a great movie; great material but an average movie. And that doesn't even include the LBJ controversy, which I don't really know enough about to have an informed opinion. I do believe the movie has brought awareness to a significant and fascinating story that many have no knowledge of... and that in itself is good. But a great motion picture it is not.	1

71d4e6dd-3d20-4080-8de6-6f68ccb74ec9	  It's all about the way things look. One can make something look a certain way and the masses will believe it because they don't want to take the time to view the truth. I don't want to discredit the man Martin Luther King Jr. for he is a man of greatness. Yet he was not perfect; he did make mistakes. However, this film shows him as a man of no fault. Ava DuVernay skips over the darker parts of his life in order to show MLK as a man with a clean slate. All this does is create a fiction. To present every caucasian in this film as evil does nothing but show ignorance. To be honest the message was clear from the beginning. If you don't know it yet just listen to the lyrics of Common's track during the credits. Destroying the truth is injustice in itself.	1
b8f927d7-5867-44bb-aa51-4a568785b6b1	  Boring, flat, slow, and with really no emotion which I feel is amazing considering the subject matter. I'm really blown away of the high percentage of people enjoying the movie. Do they feel guilty to not like it?	0
79cc9fe5-0f8a-4a12-b14a-ba5119f83866	  I'm not afraid to say I gave up on this film about half way through. Wilkinson and Roth aside the performances were dull, especially the lead who is one note and a far cry from the real MLK. But the writing is what kills this film, a string of screenwriting cliches and awful dialogue.	0
2c9b66cc-eb62-435b-81ec-c0be85aa13f4	  A languorous look at Dr. King's life and legacy, encapsulated in the events leading up to the march from Selma to Montgomery. There are highlights: David Oyelowo's performance in the lead role, and Stephan James' turn as civil rights icon John Lewis were both moving. Carmen Ejogo also infuses Coretta Scott King with a quiet dignity. But the pace is slow and the call to peaceful resistance feels passive, despite dialogue telling you that just the opposite is true. The message of the film is unassailable, but the vessel - the film itself -- is imperfect.	1
9234c1a3-e6d6-4c83-83b4-69303d673e29	  Moving film that often falls short in the telling of such a historic event. Good, but far from great.	1
bc4ef6c5-275a-4afd-a069-c1d1c0097dcd	  A good film but a bit underwhelming. The actor chosen to play Dr. King sure resembles him but has the charisma of cardboard nor does he even remotely sound like him. Was there no African-American actors available to play MLK, they had to choose a Brit? They also made the mistake of choosing a director with such little big screen experience. Her last directing experience was an episode of Scandal and it showed. This film lacked the pacing and storytelling it takes for a 2 hour film. The supporting cast was superb which also made the role of MLK seem even smaller in comparison. Good film, but missed the point to expand further on fight for voting rights in Selma.	1
de672cd5-c19a-4f4c-9f51-26391b5fd1ff	  There's been a lot of talk about the Oscar snubs for Selma. It only got a 'Best Picture' and a 'Best Song' nomination but failed to get nominated in any other category.Now I won't deny that there's a 'soft' kind of racism at play here, combined with an unfortunate release date and a bad Oscar campaign. But did 'Selma' really deserve to be nominated in other categories? Well, let's see.First of all: Selma is a hard watch. It doesn't shy away from showing you the awful truth. I often flinched and felt my stomach turn in disgust while watching the atrocities on screen. So far so good - but in between those poignant moments the movie struggles to hold your attention. And yes, that is largely due to a screenplay that's never more than just 'ok'.Another Oscar snub was for Ava Duvernay, the director, a black female. She would've been the first black female to be nominated for a 'Best Director' statue. But to be quite frank: visually the movie is no '12 Years a Slave'. It's decently directed but nothing ever pops the way it should and again the small moments are never noteworthy.Is 'Selma' an important film? Yes. Why? Because Oscars are political. Period. Therefore it is important for a film with this message to be included in the race. Does it deserve to win or did it deserve to get nominated in other categories? No. Because in spite of its important and powerful message, the film as a whole doesn't have the qualities of an Oscar winner. It's a good film but it fails to be as great as its real life subject.	1
9c44b92f-3ce2-488d-afd3-eb16385f20b9	  Another movie about Martin Luther King and his struggle. Nothing stood out about this movie compared to every other movie ever made about the movement or his life. "Mississippi Burning" was a much better movie, and it didn't get the ratings this one did. This was more like watching a documentary than anything.	1
086f6c0b-e291-4f15-a137-42f1ca5f6e5e	  I wanted to see more organizing of the protests and training of the protesters. I also wanted to get to know the organizers and participants better as people. It's not that I didn't like the glimpses into King's personal life and struggles, but it took away focus from what is presumably the focus of the film: the behind-the-scenes of those protests, and peaceful protests in general. The actors were good, especially King. I wish also that they had used less slow motion. It made the scenes seem more movie-like as opposed to realistic and visceral.	1
dd5ebcd1-3b26-443e-b3bf-080176229f36	  Oyelowo gives an impressive showcase performance as MLK. Despite some occasionally nice artistic flourishes and a modern, pop beat, most of the rest of the movie seems small. Almost all key non-black characters in the gov't. are also negatively portrayed making the film too literally black vs white . The actual story was strong enough on its own and should have been left to stand unaltered.	1

6e34115c-51b5-4d8c-bf16-912738317509	  Selma thrives and flourishes thanks to a star making performance from David Oyelowo, terrific authentic production design and shockingly realistic scenes of police brutality. However, it pains me to say that due to bad pacing and a stretched run time - I felt myself struggle to reach the end of the march. Tim Roth, Wendell Pierce and Tom Wilkinson give impressive supporting turns that keep the film afloat and I was also impressed by the candid take on MLK Jr.'s private life regarding his affairs that has often been swept under the rug regarding his cinematic manifestations. Other problems arise as producer, Oprah, feels she has to act in the film and pops up sporadically as a glorified extra which makes for distracting viewing. Some odd music cues, stale direction and uncertainty to the story it wants to tell; Selma is the most mediocre of the Best Picture nominees this year at the Academy Awards. Nevertheless, if you are not well versed in the history of the civil rights movement, this film could be a nice eye-opener to the plight and struggle of African Americans during the 60's	1

f91634c0-a259-4503-828f-94a341b67769	  Although Selma is worth seeing for its historical perspective, I found that the directing was weak. While trying to squeeze out every last drop of emotive acting from David Oyelowo, Director Ava DuVernays failed. I found my self losing interest in scenes before their conclusion: like watching a movie in slow motion. I thoroughly enjoyed the performance of Carmen Ejogo who portrayed a very lifelike Coretta King.	1

dfad7f31-25e3-4684-a8f9-ae5ae6fe2af7	  3 out of 5 stars. An earnest and noble portrait of Dr. King, with a terrific performance by David Oyelowo, but the film has technical errors that keep it from being as great as it wants to be. As with many other biopics of people this year, specifically Stephen Hawking in "Theory of Everything," and Alan Turing in "The Imitation Game," "Selma" also wants to not offend anyone with its selective biographical memory. All three films seem to deify their subjects, which keeps them from seeming human, ignoring flaws or unlikeable character traits, which could mar the films' intent. "Selma" is well written, selecting a 2 month period in King's life, instead of trying to incorporate all his accomplishments, which would need an 8 hour canvas at least. While the film is interesting and well acted, it's unwavering tone of "historic importance" sometimes drags and is less entertainment than historic document that wants to be a school staple for future generations to examine as good for them. King's infidelity is only hinted at for example, in an otherwise hermetically sealed portrait of harmonious marriage. What is more troublesome is the cinematography and editing, which continually jump "the line," and seem low budget, almost amateurish. It's unfortunate, because so much of the film is really well done, especially the acting. "Selma" is as polemical by omission as "American Sniper," but the technical work is far less accomplished.	1
aca44e4e-3284-4576-ba68-19fb23b8742d	  Predicted winner if 10 MILLION Oscars, because it's about a BLACK man giving a BLACK speech to BLACK people about BLACK people. No surprise that all the 'critics' are giving it top ratings, to cover their sorry politically-correct butts.

5637854e-ba78-4c39-aecd-87fae0257b9a	  It was an enightening movie to see. It brought tears in the scenes of brutality upon fellow human beings. Dr. Kings speeches were well done. But where it fell short for me was the scenes of LBJ (partial truths?) and some of Corretta King and her husbands interactions. I am sure she was far more passionate and likely less tearful than depicted. Had there been dates added of the key meetings with snippets from Correta's memories, it would have seemed more factual in total. It left me thinking it was a little disjointed and wondering what really happened behind the scenes. What parts are made up? I do believe the awfulness of it all ,as depicted on the bridge, and the wonderful moving speeches. The view of Dr. King was impressive and timely for the times we are living in. But while it is a very good movie, ultimately I felt it missed out on being outstanding because I am left with too many questions as to what really happened behind the scenes.	1

c42bc186-9fd9-4385-b17a-1114deb5ffd7	  I thought David Oyelowo did a good job playing Martin Luther King, Jr. He nailed that accent. The film overall is average. It's a boring story. There is nothing exciting about this movie.	1

954d0411-f340-4830-ae20-232c216d167f	  Preachy, historically inaccurate, over-dramatized and slooooow... however there was good acting by the two leads. I found the direction to be uneven and some characters stories not brought out enough. This movie could have been much better. There was more to tell. The movie did a very good job of making it feel like I was seeing the 1960's south. I went through the south as a kid and the sets were very well done. I like seeing historic films and pointing out the inaccuracies. The biggest one here is the treatment of President Johnson who was made into a racist. To big of an inaccuracy to forgive for me.	0

254c820e-8f84-40cd-bd8c-2f1361fd59a1	  After all the great reviews I was expecting a moving tale of the march from Selma to Montgomery. That is not what I got. The movie started out well...actually a masterful piece of insight and direction for the first scene. After that it went down hill. The actors playing Johnson and Wallace were ill suited for the role. The actor playing Dr. Martin Luther King, JR lacked the charisma of Dr. King. I remember Dr. King's speeches...I watched the events unfold. This movie did not do justice to either. It would have been better if the story would have been told from the point of view of a participant instead of the leader. And it would have been a hell of a lot better if Oprah Winfrey hadn't hogged scenes, bringing nothing to the story.	0
91117bec-f88a-4ee8-82e8-cae700ae1ade	  Massively overrated, but the kind of movie you feel like a racist if you don't like. Starts with a halt at the Nobel awards, recovers intermittently. Excellent performances all around. Distracting little mistakes like modern buildings and modern blacked-out billboards. Good enough but definitely not great.	1
dbe94368-8ef4-482a-85ce-8bb2c9583b8b	  There were parts of the movie that were emotionally gripping and the story needs to be told BUT there was at least a half hour that dragged on and on , making the audience restless.

d703de78-f3d8-4faf-8275-dbef8f86466e	  Probably the most overrated movie of 2014 in my opinion. The film can definitely be powerful at times and David Oyelowo is great as King but this movie just shows us what we already know and in an extremely dry fashion.	1

bb3189a8-7810-4ab4-a1f3-08ba9fb188ff	  Okay, this one's worthy of a few more sentences than normal. Yes, Oyelowo's performance as King shines through, even if it occasionally descends into the realm of caricature, but the screenplay undoes him at every term, unable to decide whether or not to focus on King the man or the events at Selma proper. It settles instead for a bizarre mixture of overwrought family drama, gratuitous violence, and ham-fisted political commentary, and none of it works at all. Though it has a handful of profoundly affecting moments, the vast majority of the film feels like it was written with a pen that somebody accidentally dropped into a sugar bowl. Characters constantly pander to the audience, speaking as if they know the future and generally behaving like the pawns of a writer more interested in scoring political points than writing believable dialogue. All-in-all, the film is the very definition of Oscar-bait: a safe, broadly-drawn drama that reveals exactly as much as a reading of the SCLC's Wikipedia page would, provided it was set to a stirring score.	1
5a676198-53ae-40ee-ada9-f396638e2d28	  Selma is a very good film about an historical episode that had huge consequences for the change and evolutions of laws in the 60's for African American people. wonderfully shot and acted, this film is a case study of the fight led by Dr. King and his followers to gain the right to vote like any other citizens. It's a smart film, with strong dialogues and a message of hope, pride and dignity crucial for times. The fight our ancestors drove to eradicate segregation and racism is still much needed today and once in a while a film such as Selma comes to remind us that a lot has been done but more, so much more need to be done to end the racial hatred still unfortunately present in our modern society.	1

d7501dea-3732-481b-a896-8f84be172a88	  NOT as REAL and INTERESTING as the real MLK. Go watch a documentary AND just like in general THE REAL PERSON IS 100X more powerful than ANY actor could portray AND you'll learn something. This is a WATERED DOWN MARTIN LUTHER KING and the worst part is they don't really capture the spirit of the era. Doubt me? Well tell me how many times you see this movie as I DOUBT you will see it more than once. AND in that case it IS NOT a great movie as great movies you see again and again and again. A case in point is the GREAT movie GANDHI that does capture the spirit of his era AND you learn something. AND the actor, Ben Kingsley captures Gandhi himself.	0
76adaadd-03ab-4562-8b6a-ee594115f2de	  The story can't help but be affecting - especially this year - but the film is barely a cut above "Movie-of-the-Week." Some scenes are effective, but it's wildly uneven, the script's a mess, and the performances are not nearly as good as guilt-ridden critics are saying. No doubt it will score beaucoup awards.	1
4507b671-e028-4176-a62d-147f65d6267a	  While it was a well intentioned effort at examining the dynamics and strong personalities behind the march to Selma and the subsequent signing of the Voting Rights Act, there were several intriguing threads that were glanced at, then left unexamined. Malcolm X's influence on Dr. King's movement was mentioned then left out of the conversation thereafter, as well as the first tentative displays of respect between the marchers and the State police when Dr. King refused to continue his second march after the troopers withdrew were ignored in the film. Understandably, when issues are so vast, the filmmakers have to decide what's relevant to the picture they are making and what is extraneous, but those two factors I felt left me feeling I was not given the whole story and I left the cinema unsatisfied.	1
86bd0e5b-14c2-4586-9489-cfbe9bbb2ce2	  The actors playing King and Johnson are perversely miscast, bsrly no resemblance either visually or vocally to their real life counterparts. The pace is glacial, the drama inert. It takes a lot of effort to turn one of the most dramatic moments in history into something this dull. Still, the story itself is so important, it still manages to hold the attention.	1
b5fc1b35-9945-4bf8-8a63-e2970d143ad5	  Really, really boring political/civil right film. Maybe the film is good (98% Rotten Tomatoes must be something), but to me this is nothing more than a tedious portrait of Martin Luther King, who was played by a passionate guy but without the necessary charisma of a born leader. Really, not my type of film, at all.	1
8a3be391-81d5-4ba3-ac39-274660b7802c	  Main characters are well acted and fleshed out. Everyone else is a cardboard caricature. I blame this on the monochromatic and overly simplistic script that gives us the story with almost no shades of gray.	1

9ab0163b-540a-412d-a1c6-ecfc2776978e	  Rey, a young smuggler, is thrust into a battle between the First Order and the resistance when she teams up with a storm trooper who suffered a crisis of conscience.The new entry into the Star Wars universe is profoundly derivative, essentially an updated retelling of A New Hope, and while ignoring the backstory about the First Order largely mutes the events of Return of the Jedi, the new characters are interesting enough that J.J. Abrams has successfully made me excited about the new installments, rather than cringing, as I did after The Phantom Menace. It's a fun, popcorn film, returning to its roots, and this isn't all bad, even if it fails to advance the scope of the original films.I especially like Daisy Ridley as Rey. Ridley gives Star Wars a feminist character, one whose hand should never be held and whose life isn't dependent on others, but the film doesn't allow Ridley to explore enough of the character because it withholds so much information in the name of suspense.Also, Star Wars as a series is based on the struggle between good and evil. In the original trilogy, we accepted the empire as evil and the rebellion as good - the bad guys had red light sabers and the good guys had green or blue light sabers. In the second trilogy, George Lucas bungled a political plot, which by necessity forced the film to explore intricacies of good and evil and descent into evil. Obviously that failed. In order to deal with the rise of the First Order, we needed a political plot, but yet the film disavowed itself of this responsibility, and as a result, the film's antagonists are hollow and the series doesn't hold together as a narrative whole. Star Wars has to get better at politics, not just for the sake of Episode VIII but for the continuity of the series as a whole.Overall, I liked this newest film if only because it manages to return the franchise to the rails; now if only Episode VIII can get the train moving again.	1
1ebb53e0-719c-492f-9f70-d1a468c69cf2	  I thought this is so over-hyped. I didn't feel that this was a new unique film. There was too much recreation and fan service of the the original film(s) and felt more like a nostalgia film rather than a new film. I wasn't impressed with Kylo Ren. I expected more out of the action sequences. I didn't feel I cared too much for the new characters. There was one emotional scene but other than that I didn't feel this film brought any new exciting things to the table.	1

329da4c4-52a0-4bf4-9ad6-ca5dd3e1b7fa	  Great for Hardcore Starwars fan's out there I'm sure. But I'm not a diehard fan so 3.5/5 for me. With a big budget, start director and all the resources possible, it still bugs me with the poor choices made by so many characters in the plot and how much this movies tries to play homage to Episode IV. Else it would easily have been a 4 to 4.5 in my books. Thank you Lucas for setting the bar so so low with the prequels.	1
d99365b5-21b2-4ba1-819d-bd307c406df0	  Possibly the worst star wars due to the infinitely recycled plot points, extensive plot holes, sappy music, a quarter of the movie with two characters staring at each other as the music swells, characters as tropes, and this ren girl being magically better at the force than one of the strongest dark force users in the universe without any training who can also fight without any training and who doesn't kill the main baddie because of a magical chasm that appears between the two just in time. Oh, and there's another death star that gets blown up again. Basically, just watch the original 3 again and you basically just watched this lazy cookie cutter movie. The only reason it isn't 0 stars is because it had great visual artists.	0
6f7fbb82-8d33-472d-8a09-5e26b4b03360	  Bad script. Story is a mixture of episode 4-6. Very bad casting (Kyle Reno is joke) and acting. Last scene with Luke Skywalker is like from bad 80s movies. CGI is not too impresive. I was very disapointed and not sure wha the hell happened bty JJA. I guess evil Mickey Mouse from Disney screwed the thing.	0

7bec9430-6f4d-4a9b-9e7d-481101b0dfa3	  Movie was at some points a rip off of "A New Hope" from the original trilogy. Made the plot line boring and predictable. I don't see how anyone who has watched the first movies could possibly rate this anything more than a one star. Not even close to being worth the ticket price in theater, or the price it is going to go for when it's new. The only redeeming factor for this movie was the visual effects were better than the second trilogy Lucas directed as well as SOME of the acting was at least bearable. All in all, for the amount of force fed Star Wars hype from ads, and the huge amount of commercial items all over the place, this movie is one to wait for to show up in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart.	0
1e38eb65-517a-4a69-aa39-89de3144b230	  JJ Abrams proves a very good action director that can channel heart and great chase sequences with large explosions, I find him far more palatable than Michael Bay. That being said, this is nothing more than a strict cash in for the hearts of and minds of those who still love the original three but loathe the others. It's fun and mindless drivel but it's all been done before. There is nothing special to this other than the hope that it offers at the end that the following movie will be better than this. It's a great story but the telling of it is getting to be tired trash for Hollywood blockbuster sci fi action movies.	1

771aca16-e6b1-42b8-9cf7-5e4a010f3f95	  Sorry to say, I found the movie to be a bit lacking. Still a good movie, but in my opinion it was barely better than Jedi (thanks to the stupid Ewoks) and not as good as Sith (fight scenes were the tie breaker for Sith). That puts it #4 on my list of all Star Wars Movies.There are a lot of small issues such as how adept new users can be with, well everything. However of these minor issues, the biggest issue was with the light saber. Apparently training isn't necessary. With that said, instead of listing the remainder of my minor issues item by item, I'm just going to touch on my two biggest irreconcilable issues. First and biggest of my issues is that in their attempt to go back to the "winning formula," they "borrowed" too much from previous movies. There's good familiarity that makes you feel warm and fuzzy. Then there's been there done that, got the t-shirt familiarity that makes your commitment to the franchise feel insulted. If you've seen all the movies, you know what I'm talking about.**SPOILER ALERT**Second major issue was how easy a storm trooper could just break away from the First Order during his very first battle after being taken as a child, brainwashed, and reprogrammed. Some would argue that scene somehow humanizes the Stormtroopers. OK let's go with that. So you are asking the audience to then believe that this human character, who drank the kool-aid his whole life, but had an epiphany after seeing one of his brothers in arms killed, then had no problem killing so many of them moving forward? #nofriendsgrowingup. Beyond that, the rebels just welcomed him in without question or suspicion? #nospiesinspace.Sorry JJ Abrams, I am disappointed. It's sad that I could be disappointed in a good movie. But you had a great franchise, and a great track record, so yeah, a good movie is a disappointment. You did such a masterful job with the revisioning of the Star Trek franchise that maybe I was expecting too much. I will submit that I'm as much of a Star Wars fan as I am a Star Trek fan so there is no bias here. My litmus test is simply that if I'm not ready to leave the theater and immediately get back in line for a movie from the biggest franchise in history, you have failed sir.	1

I do not feel like explaining because I have already released my anger in the youtube comment sections, but most of the major things have been discussed by people already; except one thing:Luke's lightsaber was lost along with his hand and thrown out the garbage chute into the clouds of Bespin... so it just magically teleported to the creepy old ladY?	0

53b37260-c9bf-4f44-b0e7-0d1994e4b479	  If I were to summarize this movie in one word, it would be "fatigued". What few effects there were lacked professionalism, modernization, and any sort of epic feel.There were only a handful of characters, way too many close ups. The movie felt confining, claustrophobic, and narrow. It was very slow paced, and failed to keep my attention. Moments were so slow I thought it was for comic relief, when it was actually being serious. The acting was forced and awkward. I think I saw Harrison Ford's pain in his eyes at how bad Leia's acting was. The plot was weak, with a sudden "New Order" evil appearing. Somehow they already secured a planet sized superweapon, aimed at a solar system conveniently next to where the heroes were staying and with the first firing of the weapon just so happened to destroy every other planet filled with people except they one they were staying. Episode III was much better. I have no plans on seeing Episode VIII or IV, and if I by chance do, it certainly won't be in theaters. I had set my expectations much higher for Disney. This movie was terrible. 1 out of 10. I want my money back.	0
4e1b9956-300c-4b83-b118-ac14e85d9a60	  Well I did not have a very good time watching this movie. SPOILERS!And by the way, JJ Abrams is one of my main influences and a wonderfully talented filmmaker and man. So I'm not just a cynical idiot. This is just my opinion.The fever had hit me by this point and I had just re-watched all of the original unaltered Star Wars films from 1977-1983. So I was primed. I saw it with family and everyone was stoked to return to one of our favorite universes. SO what happened? This movie fell on its face, it limped, it crawled, it tried in vain to recapture the magic and the awe. This was 95% failed remake and 5% spectacle. Other then some small throwbacks and homages, plus some epic battle sequences, nothing in the film excited me, impressed me, inspired me, or elicited any emotion that could be categorized under "positive." Mostly I was feeling disappointment and disbelief. The appropriate adjectives for the movie are "safe" "stale" "unimaginative" and "predictable." The convenience of the scenes, the ease of the struggles, the pathetic backstory and undelivered promise of a saga continued instead of repackaged. So many plot holes, illogical concepts and uninspired backstory. Even individual lines felt on the nose. Abrams keeps a pace that is too fast, too fast in that he just wants to get it over with rather than let the weight of the moment consume the audience.How I appreciate the pace of the originals. The characters, the vision of such a good vs. evil story. Luke, Vader, Obi-wan, Yoda, the Emperor, Han, Leia, Chewie, OHHHH so good!!Kylo Ren is trying to be Vader. Fail. Rey is trying to be Luke and Han. Fail. Finn is trying to be - something. Fail. By the way, although I liked Finn, his turn from a stromtrooper is unrealistic and unmotivated in any universe. Rey pretty much is perfect at everything and being left behind by her family was executed poorly though it's a great backstory - except it's been done before. I did like her self-sacrifice towards BB-8.Snoke is - come on. A CGI projection of a deep evil that came from???Kylo Ren kills every other Jedi apprentice, forces Luke into a depression and exile and yet is beaten by Rey who uses a lightsaber for the FIRST time! He doesn't even look like Han. The coolest story is lost in the decades since Return of the Jedi and reduced to flashbacks.Han dies in one of the most predictable scenes in history, plus Harrison wanted out! I didn't even care about his death and I blame that blasphemy on the movie forcing me to know what will happen before it does. R2 wakes up conveniently when the battle is over to reveal the map. Rey finds Luke in 60 seconds. BB-8 is no R2. 3PO adds nothing. Leia and Han have a weird and lazy history. The Empire pretty much wasn't beaten, bigger death star, more planets destroyed, have to destroy the energy shield, I could go on. The General even gave a speech that was part Nazi part why was it in there? This film could have been so much better and different but AT LEAST different.I feel for Abrams because I think Disney enforced a rapid timeline and the script that maybe began as something great was red-inked until it was safe enough to release.This is a return to the Star Wars universe but it offers me nothing I haven't already seen and loved. I didn't like anything that was happening and I will defend any criticism I have. If you enjoyed it, more power to you. Keep enjoying it and DO NOT wake up to the critiques that will surely come with time. I pray Episode 8 is awesome!	0
394df347-9639-4cda-95b6-0624677b4403	  A complete disregard for not only the brilliantly made expanded universe of numerous writers, but also of a vastly more intricate, logical and believable universe then this failure to the entire star war universe.

3823c424-0e27-4757-85dd-ab00f013592f	  The film opens with a vast Star Destroyer looming across the screen. A comical droid with information vital to the resistance, running away from the occupants of this Star Destroyer, is dropped onto a desert planet where someone who doesn't know they are a Jedi finds it.The jedi wannabe (who is unsure as to where and who their parents are) and companion escape the planet in the Milenium Falcon, pursued by the bad guys in a sequence involving a zany alien bar complete with musicians. Han Solo, Wookie and male lead go to rescue the female lead from a vast planet sized weapon/spacestation.Bad guy in black with a mask betrays male lead and kills him after demonstrating that he can kill folk without even touching them.Armed with inside information on said vast space station the rebels send their X wings to exploit the weapons one weakness and blow the thing up. Which they do on the second attempt.Jedi Wannabe goes off in search of someone to teach them Jedish.Is it just me or did they make Episode IV all over again almost scene for scene (But in a slightly diferent order. No doubt in the hope no-one would notice). This reached a truly farcical climax when one of the rebel generals felt he had to explain that it really wasn't a Death Star. Why? Solely because it was much much bigger.Virtually the only points of difference are that the Darth Vader character seems to be played by Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and the Emporer character by Gollums grandad.Lazy, cowardly writing with no cliff hanger ending.At least Mark Hammil learned his lines.	0
84396d31-1e44-45ce-82d9-abd9759589a8	  Maybe, I have become a cinema snob, or after having partaken in over 5,000 movies, I find the latest episode of Star Wars to be bland. It conjures nostalgia for beloved characters from our younger days, but tries to sell the same story, with better special effects and fresh faces. The acting, cinematography, screenplay, etc are all top notch, but the movie doesn't wow all Star Wars fans, as you may have thought reading the reviews. The plot is somewhat predictable, and the climax reminds you of the original Star Wars. At best, this is a re-make of the original with a few minor plot twists.While George Lucas would be licking his lips with the expected billion dollar payoff, I do hope he does not succumb to bland for his next edition. Incidentally the villian in that movie is slated to be Benicio Del Toro - that is formidible. Worth a watch, but not worth a second visit to 3D or IMAX 3D.	0

Then there is the whiny, Darth Vader, picture a long haired Ross from friends. It is not the worst movie ever but I certainly don't understand the hype. I noticed the guy in front of me fell asleep. I don't blame him I was just waiting for this snooze fest to end. Either have a realistic gripping story or dump the over the top immersion killing humor. You cannot have both. Furthermore why would 2 people who have never used a light saber do so well against a master....	1

5c487beb-f828-445c-88f9-b67db16d6cf0	  Not a good movie. The plot makes no sense. The story is the same as Episode IV. It's badly written, very badly written. Big disappointment.	0
42e34b6a-655f-4ced-a6dc-a4f048aa8121	  Very poor, offering nothing new from the original series, dialogue was excruciating at times, acting merely average. Just skip this and watch the prequels instead.	0
7596b3a6-d7d6-45a4-b5b4-be7414333999	  A good Star Wars flick that kept the characters and some of the Lore from the books intact with the new story. You could definitely see the Disney touch with the writing. Overall a cool epic flick that clearly had a ton of money thrown into it and a ton of money profit from it. It was great to see the older actors come back for the story and to reprise their roles.	1

c0db1ea2-e2f5-4726-9e81-d9a1b7071dc1	  It was just OK. It was more of a re-hash of the other movies rather than something all new. I didn't think the special effects were as good as they were in the original Star Wars movie. Maybe because this one was filmed in 3D and they developed the special effects to look best in 3D.	1
ed0cc471-f298-483b-a202-c2b8130889ba	  I think Disney and JJ focused far too intently on bringing Star Wars towards a modern audience and "rebooting" the franchise, largely ignoring what they should have done which is provide a standalone story with the components of a good Star Wars movie. Too much of it was rushed, so much so that most of the film's major plot points (including the Starkiller Base battle) was pretty anti-climactic. In fact everything about it seemed rushed, making it appear like they tried to squeeze everything about what's to come in the newly rebooted series into one "preview movie". Force Awakens was essentially: "Look who we're killing off, look who we're keeping, this desert-dwelling loner girl who already knows how to use the Force is going to be the next super-awesome jedi, and there's this Nazi-like group who scraped up what was left of the Empire. By the way, you won't ever see the fruits of the Rebel Alliance's labor in reforming the Empire into the New Republic. These new guys' sphere of death is so awesome it destroyed EVERY major New Republic population center in ONE shot." Short version: They really need to follow this movie with more than two films; it's just too much of a two-hour long trailer rather than an actual movie.	0

1923e79d-dbfa-4630-976e-4c7d729da723	  This new episode is disappointing and aimless. It doesn't offer anything new (except the great special effects) and what it really does is to recycle the formulas of the classic trilogy.	0

And the Princess and Hans were so old looking it freaked me out. Give me the old Jedi Knights that were in training for years. These new female type pick it up overnight and beat the darkside like a drum. Which reminds me Hux needs a bigger helmet and a kick in the teeth for crying.	1
f2245151-dd7d-4dcb-9a6d-9d0f3719a804	  The latest return of the most iconic space fantasy franchise was anticipated with mixed feelings. Star Wars had returned once before with awful results when George Lucas, the director of the original beloved trilogy of adventure flicks, resurrected his greatest money maker in 1999. That trilogy of prequels has often been called a series of commercials meant to boost toy sales.After this cinematic disaster, the franchise was kept off the silver screen, until Lucas decided to gather his winnings and sell the exclusive SW license to none other than Disney Pictures. The most critical viewers foresaw more toy commercial material, but Disney seemed to know they had something to proof. J.J. Abrams, the guy who managed to resurrect cerebral Star Trek as a goofy slapstick extravaganza in 2009 was assigned to do- financially, at least- the same trick with Star Wars.He succeeded. Not only did "The Force Awakens" make unimaginable amounts of money, it isn't an awful film by any means. It's about the safest bet Abrams could have made, but he managed to concoct a reasonably entertaining piece of harmless entertainment even under overwhelming pressure from a passionate fan base.The approach here is extremely retro. Everything from lighting to framing to sound design is pure late seventies, making "The Force Awakens" feel quite like "A New Hope" all over again. The same is true for the script as well. Abrams was criticized heavily for using too many familiar elements in "Star Trek: Into Darkness," but here he basically remixes "A New Hope" right down to structural detail. The clear nostalgia-over-anything -mentality might have made this film a sort of non-movie, but all the channeling is done with care and precision.Then the problems. Hollywood spectacle scripts are plagued by incongruences and conflicting details, which is more of a crime when the story as a whole doesn't set out to do anything on any deeper level, as seems to be the case here. The second act has some easy emotional moments but kind of falls apart into a sequence of aimless action sequences in familiar Abrams- and, yes, Star Wars- fashion. But the beginning and the ending entertain well enough for me to forgive the lazy writing midway through. Also, the dialogue is okay, which is the clearest improvement to all the previous installments.Another resurrection of the "A New Hope" approach is the decision to use relatively unknown stars in leading roles. All of them do well enough if not excellent. I hope there will be some involved character building in the future, because so far the new characters don't have that much meat around the bones yet. The supporting characters known from previous films still steal the show just because of their history.We begin the saga with Finn (John Boyega), a soldier of the Empire who decides to switch sides as he witnesses military atrocities in the field. There's bound to be some internal conflict here in the future, but not much is seen yet. Boyega doesn't have much to work with as it stands, and that shows a bit.The major hero this time is a more kick-ass version of Luke Skywalker, Rey (Daisy Ridley) who gets caught up in the conflict between the rebels and the Empire and happens to have a natural mastery of The Force bordering on the Deus ex machina. I'm hoping for more nuances here as well- Rey is even more of a Mary Sue than Luke was, and that's too much. Ridley spends a bit too much screen time simply looking astonished, but she fares well in the end. There's a physicality to her that suits the two-dimensional action hero Rey still is.The most tragic character failure is the antagonist. Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver. He is very difficult to take seriously. His arch has mirrored that of Anakin Skywalker, and there is way too much gothic emo angst and hair products involved in the character design on every level. His scenes came across more parodic than nostalgic.At times, the parody feel is also present because of the music. John Williams returns with a score that nicely plays into the retro feel, but at times the melodramatic strings just make a scene feel like a spoof. The melodies aren't horribly memorable either.In hindsight, the original Star Wars trilogy seems to thematically announce and reflect the Reagan era. Militaristic bravado, religious war romanticism and na�ve hero myths abound. In 2016 the very same ideology persists in the franchise, but it presents itself as less influential as it just blends in with all the nostalgia. Abrams inserted a same sort of hard values -romanticism into his first star Trek film and it was painfully ill-fitting inside a franchise known for its soft values and logical non-romanticism. Now he gets to do what he wants in a franchise where it all fits, and seems to make the assumed fanboy enthusiasm work in the movie's favor. Now that he's won approval for a remix, he has the opportunity to take risks and take a worshipped mythos further. I hope he will.There are some Daesh similes here to make it all a bit more current, though. And overall the conflict between the Empire and the rebels is presented more as a holy war. The original trilogy- in its time of libertarianism and Reaganomics- presented the Empire vaguely as a communist state, but it is more clearly a church here. The war among the stars might be less about ideology than about scripture.	1
0e513a53-c629-4478-b832-b7c0d90596e3	  I thought this movie was a colossal fail. While arguably slightly better than its modern day predecessors, its at times glacial pace, often unsubstantiated plot progression, and absurd 'deus ex machina' moments destroyed its unlimited potential. Without getting too much into spoilers, the idea that (a) character(s) in the movie were able to (without training) defeat obviously far more practiced baddies struck me as inane. I understand it was an awakening of the 'force', but there is absolutely no premise to support anyone exercising advanced abilities without training whatsoever. Especially when considering the demonstrably powerful opponent's skills. This along with the film's glossed over and at times completely unexplained plot progression, delivers a film rife with forced tributes to Lucas lore and sporadic, incomplete character development that ultimately begs the question: What exactly just happened?I'll obligingly see the second hopefully more finessed sequel in hopes that it at least somewhat makes good on its promise to elevate the quality of the franchise. Disney purchasing the rights to Star Wars should have provided a clear step forward from the modern Lucas generation tragedies. Unfortunately it was at best, mildly better than its antecedents, and at most partially delivered upon its massive prerelease hype.	1
66ce7e84-198b-4e56-adf7-5704bd142ff3	  This film is profoundly OK. Among critics and fans alike, it seems to be benefiting from a hefty dose of low expectations brought on by the prequels. Half the scenes were lifted straight from A New Hope, the story-line was painfully simplistic, and the main "bad guy," Kylo Ren, is disappointing (he went from intimidating to weak and laughable way too fast). There are some notable bright spots here. The new characters (Finn, Rey, Poe) are good although their dialogue relies a bit too much on cheesy comic relief (so, you're telling me that a guy who was born and bred as a storm trooper from such a young age that he doesn't even have a name--only a number--somehow talks like a wisecracking fanboy on Reddit. Come on!)	1
47a29dae-2d0e-4b95-b7f5-1ddd6c9341a3	  It's okay. No better or worse than the prequels. More of a lateral move. Better cinematography, worse story. Almost no story. This exists as the set up for more movies and borrows heavily from ANH and KotOR for copious filler that has nothing to do with the plot of this film. The actual plot here constitutes no more than ten minutes of screen time. Only a heroic set of performances from the cast elevate this film into something worth watching. Disappointing but not bad.	1
1f8c7a9a-354a-43b5-9352-22edc623af13	  Is an amazing production, but I don't like that technically is a remake from the first movie.	1
8cf5f478-48b6-4cd3-9f0c-e0c9f7c95724	  The movie has embarrassing moments (mostly with the former stars reprising old roles), but overall it is pretty good. It would be much better if it were 25 minutes shorter.	1
d7bd8fcd-3378-4e3c-9c53-8c6d1ba4201d	  One of the weakest Star Wars films as far as storyline goes. First of all, it is too similar to "A New Hope" and doesn't thrive on much except nostalgia and special effects. With that being said, I will say it is a good action flick, but don't go into this movie thinking you are going to get a lot out of it.	1
52af963c-eb48-4daf-b675-31c31debf1d9	  I found the characters less approachable than the original. Save one. When a CGI barkeep can out act Carrie, you know there is a problem. Rey...was just bland and annoying. She was bossy, rude and inconsistent. I liked Finn and Poe, the only emotional high points of the film besides Harrison Ford.	1
59c4711e-bb92-472d-8785-45af4d4b2611	  Upon reflection, I have a hard time saying this Star Wars is as good as any of the first trilogy, or much different for that matter. I think the initial excitement of seeing the first Star Wars film in 10 years and the original cast being in the film fueled my initial reaction(s).	1
6b4bdf35-f314-4afe-8038-f154be25ac4c	  Even though it's a quality movie, it plays its cards very safe and isn't perticularly inspired. If you wanted something new out of Star Wars, you won't find it in The Force Awakens.	1
0ba81cca-e0d3-40c6-a7d8-fa91afa52939	  A film that only superficially captures the feeling of the originals, but is let down by it's lack of originality, it's predictability and it's poorly written new characters. Motivations are to be presumed as they're never explained and it's hard to feel any threat or attachment to any of the new cast because they're all blank slates, void of personality or individuality. Performances from all actors, Harrison Ford aside, feel hammy, twee and sometimes at odds with the brief backstories we have of these characters. The rehashed plot quickly becomes tiring, as apposed to the nostalgic romp they had aimed for. The positives mainly come from the exceptional design teams, cinematography and score.	1
39fb35ba-3dca-430b-93ac-ec6858219cf4	  Force Awakens, Looks in Mirror, Goes Back to Bed Again. Seriously.So, I purposefullly did not read anything before seeing this movie. Which is probably why I am so dumbfoundedly disappointed that it was a damn remake of the original. Let's break it down a little:- Disaffected youth in out of the way locale stumbles over rebellion. - Boy meets girl. - Girl kidnapped by Establishment to their planet-sized weapon base. (Again. Seriously?)- Father / Son duel over void. (Again. Seriously??)- Rebels rally and fly in to exploit weakness and blow up mega-weapon just before it can blow up planets. (Again. Seriously???)Come on.Out of a universe of possibilities, we get this slavish rehash? I think they even reused the loading graphic for the big weapon powering up.	1
cd84ee69-0f10-4ba8-9d3c-617261217525	  I had more problems with it than I anticipated, but taken as simple entertainment it was okay. The effects were decent and it felt like in a galaxy far far away enough. What got me was how it was kind of too slow and too fast at the same time. Reams of exposition thrown into dialog that had a LOT of staring in between, instant plot as vehicle coincidences that seemed super fake, instant force mastery based on nothing, and a villain you might as well call Darth Emo. You can get any number of spoilers somewhere else, I'm not doing that, but a lot of things certainly don't add up. It's almost like a paint-by-number in it's simplistic setup for the next one which hopefully will be better.	1
f6413fb3-9c4c-4e81-8bc1-a4a6725225fc	  Great special effects great! Too many holes in the plot!Basically a Teaser for the next the Next movie.	1
40461f30-f55e-4fa3-8c8c-540b5b9b17a8	  I must have been in a different time warp than others who saw this movie. I was really disappointed. I am a Star Wars Fan and they could have saved us all a lot of trouble, and them a lot of money, if they had introduced Rae and said: She would be a big star, she I did her level best to drag this thing into the real movie category.Mav is wonderful sorry we wasted the rest of the movie around her and then blew her up. That character needs another movie. Harrison would get his stride about half way through and then -- well we all know what happened to him!The dark side son would be a no chin whimpering imitation of a Star wars character - who thought he was a good idea? He took the helmet off and I almost left the theater. And Princes Leya??? Did she get paid to show up? Was that really her or some fans look alike Gramma who filed in? She looked fine somebody just stole her ability to even remotly act. The person sitting next to me actually said out loud "Are you serious?" after a few lines from her.Rea and Han Solo cannot hold a movie Iike that alone and the drone, while cute, was just not enough.Just another note here. I know you have to suspend disbelief for movies like this and it is part of the fun - BUT neither a young storm trooper nor a really young untrained girl can take up a light saber and go against an adversary who has trained for it most of his life. Some alternative talent that got them through this might have been appropriate. At least have them run and the bad guy gets his foot caught so he cannot move around giving them some inkling of a chance. Or Rea's awaking Jedi power slowed him up and makes him drop the light saber??? We are of course ignoring that DarkSon would have just removed the saber from their hand with his mind but I am good with that not happening so we can have the fight.I know - the movie made billions and people loved it and who am I to talk like this? I am part of the paying public that has seen every episode and enjoyed them with my kids and my grandkids - that's who. All in all pretty weak.  There were moments I loved but all in all I an really glad I waited and saw it at a BIG discount, and that I didnt't pay extra for 3 d.	1
30ffd2fd-4eb6-4be7-81db-d805f5ab3a6a	  I found some time to see this flick and hoped to find out if they got this franchise back on track as one of the most innovative and creative science fiction epics ever. But I was sorely disappointed to see so many great things (you've heard it all by now) developing during the first 40 minutes and then brought to ruins when the old cast enters from the original sequel entered, followed by a rapidly thinning plot and a befuddling conclusion whereby yet another death star is destroyed by the equivalent of a couple of Chinese firecrackers. Seriously, a moon or planet turned into a weapon of unimaginable power, capable of destroying entire worlds had its shield brought down so easily? What? You'd think the "Evil Empire" could think of a better way to protect their assets from the pesky rebels after two previous death stars are brought down by similar methods. Blah. And what about Princess Leia's weird appearance? I found myself wondering about Carrie Fischer's personal life right in the middle of the movie. I understand a StormTrooper could suddenly develop a need to defect, but the way it was done made me think that thousands of others would eventually do the same. So much is missing from this movie. Rottentomatoes critics gave it a 93% rating and this is surprising. What was J.J. Abrams and his Co. thinking? Perhaps they were trying to appease too many different fan groups. This movie had the makings of a great turnaround story, but it fell flat on its face. The true winners are the moviemakers, toymakers and the entire Disney franchise as they cash in on this clunker. The good news is the original cast work and cgi of the first 40 minutes could bode well for a fantastic second film next year. Even so, I will temper my expectations for the next one.	1
8e7a1639-5b4d-43b5-b927-f26cd0687d96	  After watching Star Trek Into Darkness and Star Trek (2009 Film) I was expecting more from the film than what actually came out. Though it included some impressive effects, I found The Force Awakens was basically a rehashing of Episode IV without a clear plot. Apart from the money, there was no real meaning to creating a seventh episode to the series since it was perfectly fine the way it was. Some scenes in the movie had already been repeated several times before.	1
4863756f-1823-49b6-9dca-7447b6f7ade8	  The original trilogy had much more depth and pathos, Disney turned this into a a jokey, simplistically and flatly action packed feminist propaganda. The success was sheerly dictated by the fan fueled hype and nostalgia.	1
35fd2eee-df86-4d51-bfe0-3d0338b84e43	  Its a competent story, with enough fan service for the 'true' fan. Heavily telegraphed though. And definitely a march device. (How many different storm trooper armours?)	1
f3afb0c9-afa9-4260-91d4-bf3a549308d8	  A hollow quotation of "A New Hope." Desert Planet? Check!Droid that has all-secret plans to a super-weapon? Check! Death Star? Nope, because it is a BIGGER DEATH STAR. Get it? This unimaginative trite also is a blatant ripoff of the Jedi Academy Books.	1
8bc3c841-3d5d-4d4c-a011-141f5b54eb6c	  Better than the prequels (Unless they remake it with Darth Jar Jar), but not a good as the originals.Star Wars The Force Awakens was kinda predictable, even though they rhyme with each other there was some room for surprises (like Yoda vs. Dooku, I remember people gasping when Yoda came in and started fighting). Even though it's been years I remember being entertained more by the prequels, than with the Force Awakens.It was predictable and the fast pace didn't allow me to soak it in. I've seen more entertaining movies than this.People will probably be surprised at this, but I just wasn't impressed. It was still a good movie, but I didn't feel like a kid again. I mean, I liked Avatar better.Now it could have been my expectations were high, and the hype was a bit high with this movie...but seriously this is Star Wars.Now, they could have used this movie to set the stage for the rest of the series. I do feel the next installments will be better. But as the first entry, I just didn't feel it.	1
95dfc037-2a68-4896-a1f8-809c959c8fa2	  Essentially a rewarming of the first Star Wars film, with enough new plot twists to barely make it a new story. The special effects, acting and directing is much better than the first version.	1

071c3f8f-25f0-4c27-bbab-b19e9eaab87d	  I don't understand why this has such a high score. It is basically a repeat.

025599eb-0ea2-40c0-ac64-393402fe27ce	  Well, when the film was over I had very mixed feelings. To describe it in short - I enjoyed watching this movie despite considering it a pretty bad product; fun with a guilt if you know what I mean :-)Scenario was no more than a digest of chunks and pieces from previous movies, deja vu was the prevalent feeling for entire movie. Cast was questionable at times, and performances far from plausible (leaning towards bad). Nevertheless, it was fun to watch despite all its flaws, probably just a nostalgic kind of joy :-)	1
e1d7b314-fe06-4aa2-b5fc-742120d16181	  Held off on this for long enough, as saw it the day it was released so if you haven't seen it by now you are not a real fan. I didn't mind it, it reboots the franchise, but that's all it felt like, a retelling of the same story. Should have been called Stars Wars A New Hope (Again). Also galactic empire stop wasting resources on gigantic bases. Doesn't seem to be working out. Really hope the next installment isn't some kind of rehash of Empire strikes back and it takes us somewhere else	1
9e0be7bf-790d-41bf-9341-2bb8a45c9f6d	  Grading on a curve compared to last efforts, of course this is 10 stars. However, what's the point in grading on a curve? Should be called Nostalgia Wars. Ripoff of 1977 all over again with some good action scenes. Would never see it again and feel ok about it.	1

29357039-8e60-48e0-8705-aea7bc91e9b0	  Technically beautiful, but story is a repeat of New Hope with a broken more humanized dark side villain. As usual Abrams skips backstory and assumes you can connect the dots and care about what is happening. Hans and Leia disappointing and uncomfortable. Still...a must see.	1
06c39f06-1bc4-4485-9d87-21ade90adeec	  its star wars as you would expect, simple story line a few over paid stars, bit of action and loads of effects. saddly it falls flat on what it should of been. star wars should wow us, leave us brethless and exited as we walk out the cinima. instead you walk out chatting about the weather and the only thing that really stands out is just how slow the fight sceens where.	1

d859c99f-5ce4-4b4c-a20e-dbf9028b5235	  This Star Wars was pretty weak. "SPOILER ALERT" There is very little originality: Good young Jedi person lives in the desert & likes to tinker with stuff, Bad guy runs around in a mask breathing deeply, Lost droid has the info to save the good guys, Death Star is now Death Planet, A father/son confrontation ends in tragedy with one of them falling to their death down a huge vertical space(Empire). I also have a problem with the fact that Rey can fly the Millennium Falcon when it has been sitting for 5 years(no maintenance) and she has no training on it. In the first movie Luke(Son of Vader) has to practice with the light saber and in this movie people just pick it up and miraculously know how to fight with it. I also felt the dialog was not as good as it should be and there were some pieces where the actors should have done more takes.	1
3c56663a-cae3-411c-8776-ef15439f1497	  Maybe I'm just old and jaded but this felt like somewhat of a retread to me. I don't dislike the new characters but I don't really love them either. Darth Vader made for a truly iconic villain but there are none of that caliber to be found here. In many ways, I think the less well regarded episodes I-III had more "zest" and intrigue and I'm a bit puzzled as to why this installment has become such a chart topper.	1
5e44df51-bebf-49d8-b46a-8b6bd37fc1bf	  Meh Way too much hype surrounding every aspect of this film. Even after a week, I'm still trying to process the film...Well, not really process it--just figure out why I still don't like it. I'd see it again if someone pays for my ticket.	1
ef6d1127-e2b5-46dc-8860-e4416c95746b	  I know it's not just me when I observe that the seventh episode of Star Wars felt flat, contrived and, frankly, not very interesting. "The Force Awakens" was, of course, nothing but a re-imagining of Episode 4, with basically the same motivation, same scenes, same dialogue, and same (identical) ending as "A New Hope"... but without the thrills. I never thought I'd say this, but even Harrison Ford (with his hefty $34 Million role as Han Solo) failed to inspire. Seriously, I DID NOT CARE about this cast of characters, including those of the original cast members. And THIS is the best that the golden boy J.J. Abrams can do? Fortunately, I take consolation in knowing that not one thin dime of my money went to Disney on this one.	1
140dbe16-1290-48c7-b470-735a2791cd12	  Pretty fun, just go to enjoy a good adventure movie and don't think to in depth about the plot or you will find issues. If you liked the originals you will like this one. You should at least see the originals for this to all make sense for you or this won't completely stand on its own. This is on par with a bond or mission impossible movie as far as quality but has a lot of nostalgia going for it.	1
e5c78108-ef84-4c69-881f-53b2deb47e8b	  It's a good movie set in an interesting universe, with just the right amount of special effects, and tight acting and directing. Everything is far superior to episodes I and II, but the storyline is not a creative one.	1
d0f98b5b-99d3-40a3-b774-d7c516c3ed0a	  I liked the new Star Wars but I wasn't wowed by it. Over-hyping this movie lead me to be a bit disappointed with it.	1
48d177a1-3779-4abb-ac4e-a75794b31deb	  I left this movie not feeling happy I felt empty I dont know why so many people think this movie is great its better than the prequels but not the originals	1
f6174633-1680-4158-b21c-09927d2d0eda	  well crafted, but completely lacking of ideas, the movie recycles original trilogy ideas and trademark without the necessary determination. Plot is weak, characters are two-dimensional, the movie lacks of memorable scenes but is overall well directed and not much boring as the second trilogy.	1
97a5794f-c68e-4acd-a094-643e030d9df4	  Kylo Ren in my opinion was the most interesting story, besides Luke, to come from this movie.	1
0cbd91d0-6e0c-40f0-a764-1f81d83cd226	  Better than the prequels; however, I felt like this was similar to watching the pilot episode of a television show. This movie seems to be the set-up for the upcoming sequels. It left me with a half-full feeling. A bit more "meat" could have been added to this intensely anticipated movie. Most disappointing was that the familiar characters were a little too self-aware that that were in the previous movies. Corny self-referential lines took me out of the Star Wars reality and more into a wink-wink nod-nod frame of mind. Overall, though, the movie was good. Not great. Good. Here's hoping that SW8 is a fuller movie.	1
db108f86-ab22-412a-9300-1c19c44835d1	  Was good fun to watch but coming away from it and thinking about it, I just can't get over how stupid some of it was.	1

f267841a-a270-41d7-b444-3ba191f50f13	  Unoriginal re-make of Episode lV (The 1st one)	1
8eb656b9-1998-4dc7-b94d-0ae467e26e04	  Unfortunately, I walked out of the film mostly underwhelmed. J.J. Abrams directs the new movie competently enough, but the story they've constructed is nothing more than a recycling of George Lucas' original story. For me, the biggest crime is how wholly unnecessary all of it ends up being.	1
ff739488-fe71-4f16-85db-4ff56d353ee6	  Movie is overall ok but something doesnt work without Darth Vader.	1
2d8ced9f-016b-4ad1-b7eb-834758525a3a	  I loved it from the beginning with new characters and possible new futures for them but while going towards the end, the story line starts shaping and its quiet a disappoint due to certain characters not getting their recognition , and for a non fan I am not looking forward for its sequel	1
c8b37376-4cd3-4091-9282-ac843b2eed20	  From fairy tail for adults is fairy tail for teenagers, nice visual effects, weak story	1
bc4b904d-d6f1-4108-b68f-30c933bbc692	  Overhyped movie of this year. Basically a regurgitation of the first series of Star Wars. Complete with the heroine being just like her dad Luke living in the desert wanting nothing to do with the force. The Republic planets get destroyed again. Of course someone dies off the platform of the ship after their family member kills them. They have a new robot that has all the important info. Also they shoot to kill the death star again and the falcon js the ship of use. They have the scene of going into the weird creature bar all over again. Lots of cameos from the old crew still acting the same like hans solo owing ppl money. Action-packed, good acting, some humor, nice effects, but nothing new. The only surprise was that a girl was the heroine and that a storm trooper turned good. Yawn they played it too safe to the original franchise. I sincerely hope they up their game for the next one.	1
