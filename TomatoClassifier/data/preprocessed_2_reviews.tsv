gravity one bewilderment towards overwhelming positive response versus actual quality film not surprise since remove technical achievement leave superficial entertainment two hour car chase dumb action film high budget cool car stunt sadly offer around portion review would provide synopsis mad max fury road but sort synopsis consider spoiler very little plot film require three writer create put perspective film without give away thin specific basically like drive couple mile away home get water chase lunatic remember longer anyone guard home reason return home way come even though block explosion occur within two hour like mention take effort three writer create pretty pathetic not writing but filmmaking whole title character max man word few define characteristic beside tortured past less engaging character max relegate supporting role go motion event attempt make provide backstory max but thin stretch tell max hallucination fail protect people importance never specify almost discluding newcomer franchise fail stand alone entity fail film begin nope instead provide strong context good time well spend very long car chase instead ridiculous thinness story presentation serious moment car chase take film bombastic loud apply character furiousa talk redemption not take seriously clear point moment though want emphasize take three people write story without much exploration character background deteriorate eye candy spectacle manage hold attention belief would lose audience not extensive car chase every minute focus plot film open main character max capture attempt escape show viewer insane world very early scene show gang people gather around get water image present clear picture important resource world yet three writer felt imagery scene would not enough convey desperation world either water intelligent people fertile land line like world fell way break spoon feed definition much like example use opening paragraph entirely mute talk virtually dialogue film would actually achievement storytelling regardless need use simple caricature action movie unfortunately spoon feed dialogue like blessing damn character not talk much take away experience character simplify very basic character arc notable example come form nux furiousa nux want take vahala loosely tie religion much furiousa search redemption event make very loose connection antagonist nux not suffer much furiousa basic characterization due simplistic loyalty paint clear picture arc enter picture max end possibly get past demon survive without talk much max get demon not issue since drive character good person however max mute furiosa try kill idiotic man word but not very intelligent script not decide one scene max manage get truck swampland get mire desert use conveniently find tree area reluctance speak scene woman try run away lunatic chase max leader attempt kill max simple explanation would avoid well choreograph but rather pointless action scene early make rough outline film general story make example outline serious issue first explosion canyon one entry way show entry get block rubble rock yet character decide return max take seemingly use road second desert make suspend belief despite large location show throughout film max take route return citadel film basically start lastly antagonist take men chase max not come citizen citadel not kill immortan joe antagonist power limited would explain end but even antagonist strike fear people eye number baddie still citadel large immortan joe take chase max five wife context character finally stop look answer place might not exist but also context basically mean outline story unbelievably goofy look action but mostly car chase variety mad max fury road impressive stunt work starter way mad max fury road film do like expert camera car chase usually follow car without shake camera matter many car screen together explosion camera not need shake emulate chaotic nature occur scene visuals favor long take wide shot angle see every bit carnage do film another aspect car chase smart us wide shot throughout lengthy sequence common problem director high budget action movie director would make mistake use many mid-shots instead close action instead pull camera good flow one best example scene max attempt break window car capturer plan kill blaze glory desert storm background max see struggle hang onto car attempt break window foreground capturer prepare kill paint picture struggle time limit within shot also apply car crash car get destroy camera show entire car get destroy however instead break display demolished car instead continue follow action one ground example george miller expert direction film tanker explode display incorporate many technique lone scene couple second miller combine shot composition edit seamless effect max fight warboy pole or run very close touch ground motion successfully kill warboy run less weight max attempt get onto safety foreground move car background tanker explode within frame shot moment not last long seven second but seamlessly expert us shot composition edit seamless flow coherence miller often succeed repeat throughout film stunt work nothing short amaze car destroy screen alongside obtain high body count film character death general stunt require dozen car well participant insane set piece not stunt crew perform dangerous stunt constantly move vehicle but also visibly little tribute sometimes prop like spear pipe baby bottle spray anything find post apocalyptic film pull successfully string convince look stunt point film begin believe every single stunt do actual person scene dummy use but expert stunt crew blur line real person dummy not even noticeable even among action aficionado cgi use virtually every single shot film though mostly use either filter color enhance effect scene instance go back tanker explosion remove explosion still explosion stunt place thing add enhance effect explosion give visual finesse darken smoke brighten flame sometimes add explosion make scene color pop fury road usage smart use add large piece film instead take entire scene set design also detail rough-hewn
