	 b'would best compare film another film come 2013 make gravity gravity much like film review right spoon fed overly praise film place value aesthetic engage character worthwhile story invest like gravity one bewilderment towards overwhelming positive reception versus actual character film not surprise since remove technical achievement leave superficial entertainment two hour car chase dumb action film high budget cool car stunt sadly offer around portion review would provide synopsis mad max fury road but sort synopsis consider spoiler very little plot film require three writer make put perspective film without give away thin specific basically like road couple mile away home get water chase lunatic think longer anyone guard home reason get home way come even though block explosion occur within two hour like mention make effort three writer make pretty pathetic not writing but filmmaking whole title character max man word few define characteristic beside tortured past less engaging character max relegate supporting role go chase event best make provide backstory max but thinly stretch tell max hallucination go protect people importance never specify almost discluding newcomer franchise go stand alone entity go film begin nope instead provide strong context good time well spend very long car chase instead ridiculous thinness story presentation serious moment car chase make film bombastic loud apply character furiousa talk redemption not make seriously clear point moment though want emphasize make three people write story without much exploration character background deteriorate eye candy spectacle manage make attention belief would lose audience not extensive car chase every minute focus plot film open main character max capture best escape film viewer insane world very early scene film crowd people gather around get water image present clear scene important resource world yet three writer felt imagery scene would not enough convey desperation world either water healthy people fertile land road like world fell way break spoon give definition much like example use opening paragraph entirely mute talk virtually dialogue film would really achievement storytelling regardless need use simple caricature action movie unfortunately spoon give dialogue like blessing curse character not talk much make away see character simplify very basic character arc notable example come way nux furiousa nux want make vahala loosely tie religion much furiousa look redemption event make very loose connection antagonist nux not get much furiousa basic characterization due simplistic loyalty paint clear scene arc enter scene max goal possibly get past demon go without talk much max get demon not issue since road character good person however max mute furiosa try kill idiotic man word but not very intelligent script not decide one scene max manage get truck swampland get mire desert use conveniently find tree scene reluctance speak scene woman try go away lunatic chase max leader best kill max simple explanation would avoid well choreograph but rather pointless action scene early make rough outline film general story make example outline serious issue first explosion canyon one entrance way film entrance get block rubble rock yet character decide get max make seemingly use road second desert make suspend belief despite large location film throughout film max make route get citadel film basically go lastly antagonist make men chase max not come citizen citadel not kill immortan joe antagonist power limited would explain end but even antagonist strike fear people eye number baddie still citadel large immortan joe make chase max five wife context character finally stop look answer place might not exist but also context basically mean outline story unbelievably goofy look action but mostly car chase variety mad max fury road impressive stunt work starter way mad max fury road film make like expert camera car chase usually follow car without shake camera matter many car screen together explosion camera not need shake emulate chaotic nature occur scene visuals favor long make wide shot angle see every bit carnage make film another aspect car chase smart us wide shot throughout lengthy sequence common problem director high budget action movie director would make mistake use many mid-shots instead close action instead pull camera good flow one best example scene max best break window car capturer plan kill blaze glory desert storm background max see struggle hang onto car best break window foreground capturer prepare kill paint scene struggle time limit within shot also apply car crash car get destroy camera film entire car get destroy however instead pause display demolished car instead continue follow action one prime example george miller expert way film tanker explode display incorporate many technique lone scene couple second miller combine shot composition edit seamless effect max fight warboy pole or ladder very close way ground chase successfully kill warboy ladder less weight max best get onto safety foreground go car background tanker explode within frame shot moment not last long seven second but seamlessly expert us shot composition edit seamless flow coherence miller often succeed duplicate throughout film stunt work nothing short amaze car demolish screen alongside obtain high body look film character death general stunt require dozen car well participant insane set piece not stunt crew perform dangerous stunt constantly go vehicle but also visibly little protection sometimes prop like spear pipe baby bottle spray anything find post apocalyptic film pull successfully string convince look stunt point film begin believe every single stunt make actual person scene dummy use but expert stunt crew blur road real person dummy not even noticeable even among action aficionado cgi use virtually every single shot film though mostly use either filter color enhance effect scene instance go back tanker explosion remove explosion still explosion stunt place action add enhance effect explosion give visual finesse darken smoke brighten flame sometimes add explosion make scene color pop fury road usage smart use add large piece film instead make entire scene set design also detail rough-hewn general look clothing get across clear scene dystopia fascination worship car like religion normal look car film muscle car top tank vintage car top oil rig action look like killer porcupine wheel underneath lot admire vehicle include manic arsonist guitarist surround wall amplifier guitarist also key film soundtrack junkie use chaotic music stamp mark citizenship upon particular tribe across journey mix suspenseful loom soundbites film ever-nearing distance threat acting not complain but mostly cast provide lot conviction portrayal script provide detail tom hardy hardly speak film action relegate simply grunt facial look despite limitation action tom hardy sell image broken desperate man everything character feel get viewer properly charlize theron action furiousa cool look character no-nonsense attitude action complex character whose composure hide lot inner turmoil display rough surface time character whose make onto little hope good life left chemistry hardy excellent display action relationship film go stranger people partner convincingly nicholas hoult action nux character heavy visual arc easily definable character trait utilize portrayal nux character enthusiastically go blindly follow belief antagonist earth person contemplate new scene life action among evident film benefit character whose entire journey unlike two character see finish road hugh keays-byrne appropriate look obviously bad bad guy type antagonist costume leave little imagination make person consume role byrne exude desire hatred vengeance portrayal film antagonist also must give credit casting largely unknown actor nathan jones action strength give little word speak allot express movie expertly put together needless say mad max fury road make mad furious wrong reason issue shallow writing excuse two hour chase scene gaze
