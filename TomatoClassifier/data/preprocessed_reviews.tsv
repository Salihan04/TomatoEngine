also seem wear kind transparent body armour medal whatnot attach , obviously suffer kind affliction disease . visually guy look fuck amazing , makeup really top pale ghostly complexion silver balding , widow peak hair line . selection character give very 'dune-esque ' ( 1984 ) vibe opinion.the action virtually constant , trademark movie ( franchise ) , non-stop . main bulk action centre around max co try escape tanker barrage gunfire explosion . yeah , see 'mad max 2 ' but ramp maximum overdrive , insane ! vehicle tear flip , metal mechanical shrapnel shatter desert , body fly everywhere , war boy leap around pole vault type thing hurl explosive , gunfire , stabbings , fisticuffs ... happen various extreme vehicle creation . look completely real ( stunt real ) , highly impressive show great achievement eruptive action practical effect . top location work , scenery shot , panorama crisp , bold colour palette really look nothing short gorgeous , almost look good type movie . give faith movie really does.that not say action save completely , view . amongst grade action wonder max , joe others manage survive horrific fender bender get . good guy battle way away citadel , way , come back ?

9cdbce07-f3ed-466a-b9eb-8b0e86994cc0	movie incredibly painful . constant flaw within character 's story within overall plot . everything felt force rush along jj abrams tire best smash easter egg could would give old timer sense nostalgia make forget bad movie watching.my problem ( inappropriate ) humor : not get wrong , enjoy humor previous film star war but movie felt like marvel superhero film , humor add wrong situation . star war film ( good movie ) history darker tone , despite odds , hero barely manage escape , marvel movie get reputation lighthearted , funny movie without real danger pose significant threat . joke insert inappropriate time , ruin gravity grave situation hero force awakens . big example star-pilot poe dameron capture face-to-face newly introduce kylo ren blab `` talk first ?

'' prowess lightsaber throw audience well , defeat stormtrooper close quarter combat hold trained kylo ren . even able use tie fighter 's millennium falcon 's weapon system expertise , shoot train first order pilot ship . problem character rey : throughout first portion movie see alone , wait someone come back , presumably family , come contact scavenger negative interaction . despite reclusive lifestyle able understand bb-8 tell , understand chewbacca 's language ( shriiwook ) , seem understand machinery multiple ship work . big problem character possibly action . able fly millennium falcon flawlessly around 15 second trial error , weave star destroyer wreckage outmaneuver first order 's trained pilot . also seem know ship well han solo show fix hyperdrive , portray never millennium falcon . another thing , able out-duel use force much well actually trained kylo ren . even training emphasize previous 6 movie able defeat feared kylo ren despite not even believe force halfway movie.my problem character kylo ren : portray new vader see immediately nowhere near fearsome instead kill messenger bad report vent anger onto control panel like child throw tantrum . finally lose fearsome characteristic take mask , show man , scared one , bring back memory pre-vader anakin skywalker whine way movie . new sith show powerful force , stop laser blast paralyze two rebel fighter . but time get information rey use force , apparently use form telepathy , deny entry rey use force first time life ! not show power rey but merely lack power ren . also kylo ren kill father , han solo , leave no room redemption future . scene han 's death theme seem fall upon kylo ren want redemption join light side force , but kill possibly loved character star war universe find no love fan still alive end trilogy disney need pull miracle fan accept han 's death go unavenged . problem character captain phasma : much like rest first order , captain phasma initially portray character give hero great deal trouble . eventually , short amount screen time get , come look like wuss . capture easily agrees demand 4 rebel despite base full loyal troop . amazingly agree turn crucial aspect battle station 's defense . without captain phasma , rebel would never succeed . give easily surprising know risk go action , good soldier make solo , rey , chewy , finn kill enable rebel destroy `` weapon '' possibly first order . problem han solo 's death : not problem death character but rather handle . han solo arguably loved character franchise give proper send kill . never get movie . han 's death seem brush aside sake focus finn rey 's story . never really screen time dedicate dwell loss everyone 's favorite scoundrel . quick look rey leia get . one would think would ceremony hero rebellion but would not fit new jovial star war . least qui-gon get funeral one movie franchise but fan-favorite complete fourth movie barely get 30 second character mourn . conflict emotion jj abrams want feel exit movie . course still sad loss han no real closure time mourn stay sad rest movie , meanwhile tone shift one hopefulness rey find luke ( much easy movie make seem would ) start training . hopefulness sadness emotion not easily mix , though one could make argument could feel sad han 's death hopeful rey beat sith but already . since rebel seem already beat first order left not know hopeful feel sad time.my problem `` epic duel '' : come time see final duel end movie matchup evil kylo ren two hero , rey finn . kylo ren clearly hurt blaster take blast chewbacca 's crossbow but demonstrate ability endure pain function regularly beat wound repeatedly . expect complete massacre desert soldier scavenger but audience get opposite . course good guy must win eventually but not need win first movie new trilogy . previous trilogy , successful not , see hero attempt face villain lose . happen case qui-gon darth maul phantom menace , anakin obi-wan count dooku attack clone , yoda darth sidious revenge sith , finally luke skywalker darth vader empire strike back . loss happen reason , show hero not yet ready defeat evil oppose him/her . give add fear toward main villain show powerful . idea jedi training gain skill stress much previous 6 movie thought even novice jedi defeat sith lord would absurd . but star war 7 not see scavenger beat sith , but also see ex-stormtrooper hold `` fury '' kylo ren . new darth vader figure beat scavenger never wield lightsaber , never combat training trained soldier , not even believe force halfway movie extremely belittle ability bring concern audience danger hero . next movie possibly see rey another main character face kylo ren . end movie see ren go complete training ( no idea charge training incomplete ) but also see rey find luke begin training . star war 8 improve but one would think rey would improve exponentially due absolute lack training entire life . face-off later series already see , no added tension not much doubt hero due kylo ren already brutally defeat star war 7 . still rebel ? 20 year since destruction empire new republic create . usually rebel force overthrow government become govern body cease rebel , create capital government rule . one would think rebel create new government would least move base planet new government . rebel still exist movie ? also , new republic allow creation new death star ? must clearly understood go hard build modify entire planet without ruling government find . still nothing happens . no one remember decade ago entire planet destroy clearly no precaution enact stop type attack happen . but hey , everyone seem love lack originality . end leave search anything like movie ( really want like ) , anything would give decent overall feeling film , like fight darth maul , qui-gon obi-wan dual fate ringing background . but even film score leave want something much well . unless someone convince something like movie besides less 3 minute cool x-wing v tie-fighter action easter egg , movie take place 7th best franchise mind .	0
