    "review": "  A frumpy CIA analyst is forced into the field when a nuclear terror plot blows the cover of all the other agents.Melissa McCarthy and Jason Statham are as unlikely a comic duo as one can name, and yet they work wonderfully together in this fun spoof of the spy film genre. McCarthy is hilarious, and Statham's deadpan delivery never misses.While there is a lot to like about this film, it stretches the suspension of disbelief to its limits. At times it tries to walk the tightrope of pseudo-realism and Naked Gun-style farce but totters back and forth confusingly. Also, there are some wells that the film goes to too many times, as though all the writers' brainstormed lines had to make it into the film.Overall, it's a fun diversion and a fine comic turn by many of its stars.",

    "review": "  Director Paul Feig once again teams up with Melissa McCarthy in this comedy/action flick. While Melissa McCarthy has had a somewhat bumpy road after the hilarious Bridesmaids, we finally get a return to form film from her. I was genuinely surprised by this film thinking it would be played as a spoof of spy movies- and to a degree it is, but it also has heart, giving McCarthy a lot of material to turn CIA agent Susan Cooper into a capable and smart spy, without compromising the characters' integrity through unneeded character development in previous films such as Tammy. The supporting cast is also on form, with Rose Byrne, Jason Statham and Jude Law all hilarious in their own right and providing a hysterical back and forth rapport with McCarthy. The action scenes are surprisingly well shot, and the violence and swearing are mainly played for comedic effect. All in all I quite enjoyed the film.4/5",

    "review": "  OK, so this looks like an interes...oh my God! its another bloody Bond parody!! seriously!!! Yes the modern age feminist hipster, Paul Feig, takes a swing at the Bond genre, and oh what an original concept that is, gee I wonder what we'll see here...ugh!So naturally its an adult comedy with lashings of semi-serious action, CGI blood, swearing and a whole heap of Melissa McCarthy and other actresses. Basically the plot revolves around McCarthy playing Cooper, a desk jockey CIA analyst who helps the very suave, completely cliched character of Fine played by Jude Law. Yep, if you ever wanted to see what it would be like having Jude Law as Bond, well here you go. After a botched mission Fine is supposedly killed off and the CIA need someone to take his place, an unknown, hence they can't use Statham who plays another totally cliched agent character we've all seen before. We then follow Cooper around as she slowly but surely sinks deeper and deeper into a mission, which she was never really suppose to get into in the first place (she was only meant to be surveillance).Oh geez where to start, the plot is unoriginal sure, we all know that, but how about some original ideas...oh too late. From the very first scene I had a good idea what this film was aiming at and how the characters would play out. Spoiler alert! but the minute you see Law as this debonair spy, you know he's obviously gonna die early on, he's clearly the plot setup for McCarthy's Cooper, I mean come on, who didn't see that?! But wait! as the film progresses and more and more characters are introduced, we start to see double agents and characters popping up outta nowhere who are suddenly spies or assassins. All of sudden characters we saw at the start who appeared to just be the butt of a joke or background fodder, are now main characters out to kill the protagonist. Its at this point you know that anyone is fair game and anyone can surprisingly come back from the dead when you thought they had been killed off. So I quickly realised that Jude Law probably wasn't dead at all. Seeing as we didn't actually see him die, clearly he can come back, and he did...*groan*The plot is a mess of characters bouncing back and forth between the goodies and the baddies. Seriously, there are characters popping up all over the place, getting whacked, and then replaced minutes later by new ones, only to get killed just as quickly. The ones that don't get killed, you just know are probably gonna turn out to be secret agents, but on either side. I honesty thought Law's character of Fine was gonna keep flippin' sides! he was a goodie, then a baddie, then a goodie again, but at this point I genuinely suspected he would turn on Cooper yet again right at the death, and then get properly killed off. Amazingly the film beat me on that one, but this film could of kept spinning these characters round and round, one double agent twist after another.The actual characters are a completely mixed bag of nuts that all had one thing in common, none of them managed to actually make me laugh...at any point. McCarthy was...well, pretty much like McCarthy is in every bloody movie she's ever done (whilst looking oddly like Dawn French at one point), whilst her sidekick, played by Brit Miranda Hart, was just simply annoying and unfunny. I swear, an early scene near the start has McCarthy and Law in conversation at dinner, they are both talking about themselves and offering basic foreshadowing of things to come. Now initially there are moments that made me smile (as there were throughout this film), but this obviously intended funny sequence just went on and on and on...it just didn't fucking stop. Like seriously, the moment has passed, the joke is over, its not funny anymore its just awkwardly embarrassing, stop flogging this dead horse!!The only characters that did offer some genuine giggles were Statham as a dumb, cocky but tough agent, nothing gobsmackingly funny mind you, but reasonable. Next to him I quite liked Peter Serafinowicz as the slimy Italian (yet another secret agent) Aldo who can't keep his hands off the ladies. Sure this character felt like a cheesy 'Carry-On' character (something I would of thought was beyond the realms of acceptance for Feig), but his antics were amusing. Other than that everyone was just there, doing exactly what you expected them to be doing with these character types. Get a load of Law by the way, how much flippin' makeup?? Oh and both Statham and the main baddie fall into the lake from that helicopter at the end, so why does only Statham survive?I know this movie was relatively successful but I don't really understand why. Yes some parts were good such as the gadgets sequence near the start which is obviously yet more parodies of a certain franchise, and I did quite like how the main female villain was a spoilt bratty Princess type, although again that did become annoying at times too. But in general everything just felt very generic to me and relied far too much on feeble visual gags including male genitals and slapstick, lots of profanity and lots of weight/looks shaming jabs. Even the inclusion of lots of blood and a bit of gore didn't do anything for me, that just felt unnecessary and shoved in to appease the male audience. I would say this was more enjoyable than 'The Heat' which was pretty dire, but at the end of the day, I found this to be an infantile, factory assembly line, cookie cutter of a flick.",

    "review": "  A clever, well balanced script and a even hand at the directorial duties (Paul Feig) cement this effort through and through as an unlikely office nerd gets to try her hand at the filmic international spy roulette table. Everyone in the cast, too, gets a fair chance up at bat, unlike so very many Hollywood efforts, so that you get a real feel of all the characters. The emphasis though is on the ladies, both as protagonist and antagonist, and so w/o peddling WOMEN'S LIB it manages to do so more or less. An enjoyable affair from title credits, a riff on the Bond franchise openings, till the end, but I got the most fun out of McCarthy's heated verbal sparring contests w/bad guy Rose Byrne.",

    "review": "  Melissa McCarthy's meteoric comedic rise hasn't been without its missteps, mainly the complaint that she seems stuck in a rut playing aggressively weird and foul-mouthed characters that are growing tiresome. McCarthy is never better than when teamed with her Bridesmaids' director Paul Feig, and Spy is a welcomed return to form for a great comic actress who relishes being outlandish. The best part of the film is that it's a character-centric comedy, with McCarthy as Susan Cooper, a CIA agent who works as a handler, the voice on the other end of the earpiece, guiding her partner the handsome Agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). When Fine is compromised on a mission, Susan unexpectedly finds herself in the field to track down some very bad people. McCarthy does get to be vulgar, but fortunately it's only one persona she adopts as a mask, and it's cleverly utilized. Feig's screenplay makes sure to find different comic beats as it goes, rarely repeating itself and, like any good action movie, finding twists to further develop conflicts. Part of what's so enjoyable about Spy is how comic scenarios will evolve while staying true to the characters and the central conflict. Also, Feig acquits himself more than well with the film's semi-slick action photography. The supporting cast is nicely tied into the story and matter and each actor has material to cut loose, none more than Jason Statham (The Expendables) as a hilariously boastful and incredulous agent. His boisterous chest-beating about his past deeds are some of the film's funniest moments. Consistently funny, witty, and mildly progressive with its heroine, Spy is a vehicle that makes perfect use of McCarthy's talents and then some. Nate's Grade: B+",

    "review": "  Paul Feig has always known how to handles his actors and retrieve the best performances possible. \"Spy\" is no exception to that notion, because not only does this have more laughs than most of them, but it is arguably his best film to date. Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham, Rose Byrne, Jude Law, Miranda Hart, and the rest of the cast all have such perfect comedic timing that the film feels effortless. After the death of her colleague, Susan Cooper joins the CIA as a spy and hilarious ensues as she works toward taking the bad guy down. That is the broadest and best synopsis to give this film, because it really is all about the comedy. My one complaint about this picture is that it feels about 20-minutes too long, and when you have a film relying solely on comedy to keep you engaged, that can be a little tiresome. In the end, I had a great time at the theatre with this film, even though it felt it's length. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of comedy or who is just looking for a nice romp between people who have starred in action films in the past. \"Spy\" is great!",

When an arms dealer learns the identities of the CIA's top operatives, the CIA sends untested data analyst Susan Cooper into the field in order to track down the location of a nuclear weapon that the dealer is selling. Starring Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, Jason Statham and Jude Law, the film has a strong cast. And, the comedy is quite clever, and does a wonderful job at lampooning the genre tropes and clich�s.

The action set pieces are put together with style and many of the more intense, up close action sequences feel extremely fluid. The knife fight were \"Coop\" tries to fend off an enemy by use of various kitchen equipment is funny and very impressive to watch.The comedic aspect of this film is also perfectly captured through character dialogue and visual gags, the cast chemistry also adds to some truly laugh out loud moments.Statham's \"Rick Ford\" proved one of my favorite characters. His crazy tales are used to improve upon his super spy status and are gut wrenching throughout as he always seems to pop up to ruin Susan's plans. As for negatives with Spy other than Rose Byrne's character \"Rayna\" the villains are very one note and quite forgettable. Also the plot gets a little too convoluted towards the end and the few twists are extremely clich�.Overall I had a very enjoyable time watching Spy and at times it had me bursting out with laughter.",

    "review": "  THE WOMAN WITH THE GOLDEN CHARM - My Review of SPY (3 1/2 Stars)Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy are kind of having a moment right now. Perfectly matched as director/writer and actor respectively, this Dream Team delivered big laughs in both BRIDESMAIDS and THE HEAT. With SPY, the don't disappoint, in fact, they've added some terrific filmmaking to their repertoire. SPY plays like a Bond film, but with McCarthy's brand of outrageous, fearless and funny underdog added to the recipe. What I love about all three films are those extended diversions from the main story, where characters get stuck on a minor detail, effectively stopping the plot for a few delicious moments. It's something Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder excelled at in the 70s and it's in almost every scene in SPY. The opening sequence is a killer, with McCarthy's Agent Susan Cooper talking into Bond substitute Bradley Fine's ear. He's played by a very game Jude Law, who clearly enjoys towing the line between suave and douchey, sometimes within a single line of dialogue. I could have watched McCarthy be his office bound eyes and ears for the entire film, but there's that pesky thing called a story to tell. After a crazy inciting incident, the plot mechanics dictate that poor, put-upon Susan needs to get out into the field to help solve a crime. With her assistant Nancy in place, played by the extremely entertaining Miranda Hart, Susan receives a dumpy undercover assignment from her tough-as-nails boss, the always reliable Allison Janney. After a very funny gadget scene in which Susan and Nancy geek out hilariously over the oddly disappointing tools at their disposal, off we jet to Paris. It's the dark, seedy underbelly of Paris, so don't expect glamour. Besides, McCarthy settling into her \"crime scene\" hotel room is better than a tour of the Louvre. Feig's script does a wonderful job setting up Susan's character, with McCarthy bringing just the right amount of pathos and confidence to the material. It's so easy to fall in love with her, because she clearly has great detective skills and refuses to let anybody box her into a corner. At some point, a spy thriller needs its super-villain, and Rose Byrne fills those 6-inch stilettos perfectly as Rayna Boyanov, a condescending, rude, big-haired monster. Byrne has become a bit of a comedy secret weapon after years of honing her dramatic skills, and here she steals every scene she's in, sometimes with just a sneer. Watch for her response to a toast, and you'll feel you've gotten your money's worth from that moment alone. With BRIDESMAIDS, THE NEIGHBORS and now this film, Byrne has proven she can take a stock role and turn it into gold. Also along for the ride is a surprisingly funny Jason Statham as a shadow agent who continuously insinuates himself into McCarthy's investigation. His lines aren't the funniest, and truth be told, it becomes a little one note, but I enjoyed how much he threw himself into it, especially the end credits tag. Sure, SPY brings the laughs, although I could have done without 50 Cent's awkward, unfunny extended cameo, but the surprise here is the thrill of the action sequences. Feig directs these with such muscle and gusto, I wanted to applaud. Whether it's a chase scene through the streets or an epic kitchen fight using knives and pots and pans, Feig understands kinetics and momentum, which is rare in a comedy director. It's exciting to see a writer/director with one type of talent stretch and excel at another. Underneath this 007 splendor is a message of female empowerment and bonding, something usually lacking in Bond's universe. SPY takes back the night and makes you root for women in a way that feels exhilarating. That's no small feat for a dopey comedy.",

This scenario writes itself as you have a overweight nonathletic woman doing one of the most dangerous jobs. Spy has its moments of comedy for sure, and for me Jason Statham who is one of the other agents steals every scene and offers more comedy than McCarthy did. Spy has many forced offense scathing jokes between McCarthy and Byrne to try and keep the film on all cylinders as well.

    "review": "  Melissa McCarthy finds a perfect vehicle for her talents, and it works beautifully. Once again, she teams up with Paul Feig, who is the writer, producer, and director here. Feig seems to know how to get the best out of McCarthy. The two worked perfectly together on Bridesmaids and The Heat, which are Melissa's strongest efforts to date. Spy lives up to and may even surpass the duo's previous projects. McCarthy's role utilizes her physicality, high energy, and her uniquely aggressive mouthy behavior. Her character is also rounded character with depth. She is a kind person, with self-doubts and emotions to make her vulnerable. McCarthy is at her best when she is not just playing a fool and lets her lovable soft sideshow. It is an exceedingly funny movie. It pokes fun at the spy movie genre, but does not reduce itself to a full-fledged spoof. More surprisingly, it is also a good action spy movie in its own right. The plot is not the typical flat action-comedy format. It has a few surprises and action scenes that really deliver thrills. Melissa McCarthy may look harmless, but she is kicking butt in this movie. Sure, it is ridiculous and it is fun to watch. Rose Burn plays a terrorist villain who is a deliciously exaggerated uptight snob. She provides a straight character to banter with McCarthy and her deep bag foul mouth comebacks. Perhaps the greatest pleasant surprise is funny performance from Jason Statham. He plays an idiotic loose cannon antihero messing up at every turn and has a never-ending stream of terrible ideas. Statham is completely self-deprecating and self-aware. He relentlessly makes fun of the roles he typically plays. Feig and McCarthy are a winning team and a joy to watch. It is unusual for a comedy movie to deliver legitimate fun thrills, but this movie does both extremely well.",

    "review": "  Hilariously funny, the action-comedy Spy is a clever spoofing of the spy genre. When an arms dealer learns the identities of the CIA's top operatives, the CIA sends untested data analyst Susan Cooper into the field in order to track down the location of a nuclear weapon that the dealer is selling. Starring Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, Jason Statham and Jude Law, the film has a strong cast. And, the comedy is quite clever, and does a wonderful job at lampooning the genre tropes and clich�s. However, McCarthy's brand of humor gets a little tiring after a while, and is kind of crass. Still, Spy is tremendously entertaining and delivers a lot of laughs.",

    "review": "  Spy is a spy spoof comedy from writer and director Paul Feig. He has put together a fun cast, with Melissa McCarthy in the lead as agent Susan Cooper.Especially for me as a heavier woman, it's gratifying to see McCarthy kick lots of butt and ultimately save the day. While Cooper starts off as sidekick to agent Bradley Fine, upon his unfortunate demise she ends up being called upon to go out into the field, for the first time. Hot shot agent Rick Ford isn't going to let her do it alone; he wants the glory for himself, but somehow Cooper ends up saving Ford's butt, over and over. It's fun.Cooper ends up saving the life of ruthless criminal Raina Boyanov, whom she is supposed to be shadowing. Her relationship with Raina gets more complicated; they even seem to be bonding. Eventually Cooper's friend and coworker Nancy from the basement shows up in the field to help her, so there is some girl power going on.Just as James Bond tends to romance some of his opposite sex coworkers, Cooper has some connecting moments with her male coworkers, moreso toward the last half (in the first half, agent Fine ruthlessly dashes any hopes for something more with him). Near the end, after Cooper miraculously saves the day, guess which lucky coworker gets to take her out to celebrate.Just when you think it ends on a happy girl power note, there's one more surprise James Bondlike scene. Hilarious!",

The film doesn't discover anything new, the jokes are for the most part unoriginal and Melissa McCarthy plays the same role she always plays. On the plus side, the action portion is filmed well with Statham and Serafinowicz being the funniest and biggest highlights of the film. Fresh jokes are just far too rare to make this anything more than a watchable film if you really don't have anything else to do or watch.",

    "review": "  I've heard people say that comedy films are the hardest films to make. They are tough to translate for international markets (because a lot of comedy is cultural), they are hard to act out (because actors need to have comedic timing to pull them off), and if they're not funny, the whole film becomes a disappointing waste of time. The last part is a bit tricky too, because comedy is such a subjective thing that it's hard to draw the line where something is too offensive, or too juvenile, or too centered around toilet humor, and who that will appeal to, and who it will turn away. It is because of this, that the best recent comedies have just had funny actors in them, delivering dialogue that they think is funny, which has been a successful formula for folks like Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jason Segal, Paul Rudd, etc. When Spy came out, a lot of people were talking about the film, hyping it up as the best comedy of the summer. If you're reading this review, I bet you want to know \"well, is it?\" The answer is. No. The Martian is more of a comedy movie than this, so it's no wonder it won the Golden Globe. Spy is about a fat woman working at the CIA who acts as some sort of desk jockey/intel liaison who feeds the field agent mission details on the fly through an ear piece. She has access to omniscient levels of information, and it's unclear how or why that works, but I guess we're just supposed to accept it. Ugh, fine. So she's working with Jude Law, who plays an effeminate version of James Bond, and doesn't realize or care that the fat woman in his earpiece is in love with him. Because of plot shit, all the CIA field agents end up getting outed, and in order to stop the nefarious plans of some dastardly villain, they need someone who has never worked in the field and could fly under the radar. So the CIA head, who looks like a female version of JK SIMMONS, decides that the super overweight American who doesn't speak a second language will be a good person to send to Europe on this mission of great national security. Do you see what's happening here? They're justifying a fat person being a spy, none of this is really that important. They just needed a setup for all the wacky fat jokes, interspersed with insult jokes, and then peppered with sad moments where they talk about how difficult it is to be different and made fun of for it. This movie is comedy for the sort of people who like sitcoms and modern day SNL. That is to say, it's not the worst, it's something you can watch and laugh a couple of times, or have a smile on your face. But it better be in the background because there are a lot of groan inducing moments that will make you wish you had something else to occupy your mind with. TL;DR - 4/10 Fat jokes can be funny, and shitty spy jokes can be funny too. But when a movie cycles between fat, fat, spy, spy, fat, can't get a man cause I'm fat, spy, jokes for two hours, it becomes a tedious exercise. There's also so many inconsistencies, like the fat spy woman being extremely acrobatic and aware of the matrix when it comes to gun fights, but then clumsy and oafish when trying to jump over a car hood, because, fuck it, I bet we can stick another fat joke in here, right guys? LOL *fart*.",

With 'Kingsman' coming out recently, which is in my opinion one of the greatest spy spoofs of all-time, Feig had some competition in creating something original yet effective. With Melissa McCarthy, Jude Law, Jason Statham and Miranda Hart, 'Spy' boasts a brilliant and talented cast, supported by a well-executed plot and some stunning locations across France, Italy, Bulgaria and Hungary. A definite improvement over Feig's previous collaboration with McCarthy on 'The Heat', 'Spy' is a rip-roaring spectacle of laughs.",

BUT LET'S ALL JUST HOLD THE PHONES.This movie really surprised me; maybe it was the marketing or something, but I was just suspecting a stinker that needed the cast to get a fighting chance in the theaters - but it was INSANELY hilarious. Laugh a minute from all characters in the film - Melissa McCarthy is the lead and leads the charge, but the supporting cast is so strong and comedically skilled.Paul Feig's script is so finely tuned - the room was laughing over probably half the jokes. The huge thing I loved about the characterization is that most of the characters (Peter Serafinowicz's Aldo not included) took their turn as both a cartoon and the straight man from scene to scene, which is insanely refreshing in a fish out of water ensemble comedy. More so than I ever felt like I was missing out on. Of course, there's issues with the various production: VFX, etc. but it never didn't serve the character interactions and pushing the plot forward. The story was incredibly lean, and actually filled with some twists and turns I didn't see coming.Do yourself a favor, catch this in theaters when it opens this weekend, where the seats will be packed with laughter.",

McCarthy is hilarious, and Statham's deadpan delivery never misses.While there is a lot to like about this film, it stretches the suspension of disbelief to its limits. At times it tries to walk the tightrope of pseudo-realism and Naked Gun-style farce but totters back and forth confusingly. Also, there are some wells that the film goes to too many times, as though all the writers' brainstormed lines had to make it into the film.Overall, it's a fun diversion and a fine comic turn by many of its stars.",

McCarthy seems like a decent comedian, but at least during this film I thought I would be laughing a little more (not that it wasn't funny at all). Most of the raunchy stuff felt pretty basic to me, but the jokes aren't something you see in a lot of films it seemed like to me. Pretty clever plot for the most part with enough of the humor-here-and-there type thing going on, but overall it just didn't seem to get to me as much as it may have to other people.",

The jokes are hit and miss as usual, but tend to stick more than her more recent efforts; likely in part to writer/director Paul Feig's ability to balance the ridiculous plot with an affable protagonist.Part of the charm is in the excellent supporting cast; Statham in particular absolutely steals every scene he is in to perfection, as well as villainess Byrne getting to go toe-to-toe in one-liners with McCarthy is certainly worth checking out.Spy is not essential viewing by any means, but the great cast deliver plenty of worthy laughs and entertaining action set pieces to keep the film's pace brisk and fun.",

    "review": "  The best part about this action/comedy is just how clever the script actually is. All the parts (the direction, the writing, the acting the pacing) work together in perfect sync, with McCarthy's performance as the anchor. There is no question that McCarthy has been typecast (at this point in the game) as a certain type of character on the big screen. There could be a temptation to cite he previous works as \"more of the same\", however, I think it would be much better to cite Spy as the pinnacle of perfecting her certain brand and craft. The beautiful thing about \"Spy\" is that while it is not afraid to be so bold as to make the statement that she now owns her unique craft, there is something underneath it all that hints at the fact that there is still more for her to reveal as an actor. And that simply adds to the notion that \"Spy\" is much more than simply more of the same when it comes to McCarthy's past work. The film is over the top, but it never stops to allow us to reflect on this while we are along for the ride. The film (and be forewarned, it is a bit crass at points in an over the top way) hits a comedic sweet spot with a nice mix of physical comedy and witty dialogue (the whole ongoing romantic subplot surrounding McCarthy is brilliantly executed). Adding to this is a nice mix of characters which feel far from generic. In fact, if there was one drawback that I might make it was my initial reaction to Statham as being slightly out of place. However, as a testament to the development of the film itself, Statham's schtick merges in to a dynamic that feels right at home (and perfectly enjoyable as his character continues to pop up spontaneously) by the time the film is done. There is no question that Spy should cater to McCarthy fans as s celebration of her craft. What would shock me is if it didn't create new fans. She is more than just a stereotype. She is a genuine comic actor, and this film should prove this once and for all.",

While Melissa McCarthy has had a somewhat bumpy road after the hilarious Bridesmaids, we finally get a return to form film from her. I was genuinely surprised by this film thinking it would be played as a spoof of spy movies- and to a degree it is, but it also has heart, giving McCarthy a lot of material to turn CIA agent Susan Cooper into a capable and smart spy, without compromising the characters' integrity through unneeded character development in previous films such as Tammy. The supporting cast is also on form, with Rose Byrne, Jason Statham and Jude Law all hilarious in their own right and providing a hysterical back and forth rapport with McCarthy. The action scenes are surprisingly well shot, and the violence and swearing are mainly played for comedic effect. All in all I quite enjoyed the film.4/5",

    "review": "  \"Spy\" delivers everything that you expect from a Melissa McCarthy movie. Many of its slapstick moments will have you laughing out loud... but you will have to endure a barrage of 100 f-words to get to the end. It is a shame because this story is very clever but the writers obviously don't have enough confidence in their ability to write clever dialogue; instead, they defer to shock-value profanity as their main comedic device. Probably the biggest travesty is the talent that they had to work with, including Jude Law, Jason Statham, Allison Janney, and Rose Byrne. McCarthy's oft-self-shaming-but-hilarious comedic delivery is enjoyable in the first hour as we tolerate the film's 17 f-words, but everything goes out of control during the second half when the film becomes an all-out swearfest that completely overshadows a great twist and an action-packed final battle. If I wanted to hear an hour of multiple f-words per minute, I would have watched \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\" Actually, I wouldn't have because that much profanity is entirely unnecessary. In spite of the script, I think that this film really embraced the idea of a spy film. It has the intrigue, exotic locations, car chase, epic shootout, and gadgets that we love in a Bond film, all permeated by McCarthy's brand of slapstick comedy. This aspect of the film is incredibly well done and I wish that I could have fully enjoyed it for what it is. My rating of \"Spy\" seems like it would indicate that the film is average but it is actually the opposite. My rating is meant to indicate that the cast and story are on par with the best comedy films out there but the script's reliance on unnecessary profanity drags the entire film down.",

She works for the CIA and is thrown into the action when she has to go undercover on a serious mission. Jason Statham appears and had me rolling with his vulgar one liners, and his sense of badassness. Rose Byrne was halarious and she played an evil vixen, who was steady and relentless but pretty funny in most of her scenes when she blurted out vulgarities. The writing was so good for this comedy as all the lines that were delivered were halarious and unexpected. The funny vulagaries caught me off guard, and were unique. You also have some silly action that is really fun to watch. I would give it 4 stars but it's hard for me to rate comedies high. I just rarely do it.

There were a lot of fun plot twists and it kept me entertained the entire time. Funny dialogue too. Some parts were a bit gross and the physical humor went on too long sometimes (such as fights). Overall, I enjoyed it and loved Melissa McCarthy in this role. She was fierce and dynamic, as well as super funny. It was an empowering role for her too.",

    "review": "  Not all of the jokes land, but those that do, do not disappoint. Intended as a spy movie parody, the film is quite engaging and has the twisty, high-speed plot of a great spy movie with the added dimension of a comedy on top. I'm not particularly a fan of McCarthy and I actually didn't find her character to be the funniest one here, but she holds her own and delivers some solid laughs throughout. If you are staunchly against her and her brand of comedy, I still think you will find a lot to laugh at here. Overall I found it genuinely funny - easily the funniest film of the year - and I'd recommend it.",

Melissa McCarthy has done worse but her brand of expletive-filled insults and physical \"hey look I'm considered unattractive' comedy again fails to touch my funny bone. Also, it is only a quarter-way through when you realise the spy spoof genre is now officially played out, though admittedly the unconventional looking female agent twist adds a new dimension. A few jokes here and there hit the mark but it fires jokes out nearly every second that the laws of probability determine at least a few will be good.",

    "review": "  This action comedy from the director of Bridesmaids and The Heat, Paul Feig (and likewise starring Melissa McCarthy) is about a CIA analyst, Susan Cooper (McCarthy) who has to stop a suitcase nuke when her partner Bradley Fine (played by Jude Law) is assassinated by Rayna Boyanov (played by Rose Byrne). Things get complicated when fellow FBI agent Rick Ford (played by Jason Statham in a comedic turn for him) gets involved too.There are a few reasons why I enjoyed this film. While I didn't see Bridesmaids or The Heat, I still found the film funny. Special kudos to Jason Statham, who was my favorite character of the show despite being a total asshole in the movie, as he was so stupid that he was the funniest character. McCarthy was very funny, too. Another thing I liked about the movie is the action sequences which were well executed.In conclusion, Spy would definitely be worth watching if you enjoy a light-hearted action movie. Do look out for 50 Cent's cameo, too.Pros:Melissa McCarthy and Jason Statham are fun to watch and are hilariousWell-executed action sequencesRose Byrne's portayal as the villainCameos to watchCons:This show was so fun to watch. Cons are probably very minor. Violence was probably too high for a comedy, I guess? Not really much bad to say here.",

    "review": "  I always appreciate the comedies that don't take themselves too seriously, but also don't treat the audience like they're idiots. Spy is a good balance of the physical nonsense humor that Melissa McCarthy is known for, with a mix of smart and witty humor that ultimately bring in the most laughs. It's also one of the few action comedies this year that actually is more impressive on the action end than comedic. This is all a tribute to Paul Feig, who is establishing himself as a comedic staple of this decade.The best parts of Spy all derive from the fun that this cast has at playing these characters. Jason Statham does indeed steal the show like everyone says, but he's even better than advertised. He's notably making fun of himself and his numerous over the top action films over the span of his lengthy career. The biggest laughs come from his monologues that 'explain' all the 'great' things his character has done for the CIA. It's Statham's serious delivery that makes the comedy hit so hard.Feig has stated that he was inspired by the James Bond franchise, which is clearly visible through everything from the opening credits/song, characters, and it's official poster covered in gold (Goldfinger, 1964). The important thing is that it's a good spoof. How McCarthy's character becomes a spy so quick? Not the most believable transformation. And she does tend to fall into her usual McCarthyisms from her other films, but it never takes you out of the film. So in all, the performances are all good and more importantly, fun, and the action is surprisingly well handled. Spy is definitely worth seeing.+Statham poking fun at himself+All the actors seem like they are having fun+Feig's directing+Bondisms-Quick transformation into a spy7.2/10",

    "review": "  I've been hesitant to write this review since my reaction to Spy (2015) has largely been due to the overwhelmingly positive response to this very mediocre comedy. It's not anyone involved with this film's fault that currently on Rotten Tomatoes, Spy(2015) has a 92% freshness rating(that's 4% points shy of the Godfather Part II )or that the Village Voice recently published a top ten of 2015 list including Spy(2015). Spy (2015) isn't an awful movie and it genuinely made me chuckle a few times. Jason Statham shines playing an over the top parody of the uber masculine James Bond cold war era super spy. The transporter unexpectedly delivers several timely laughs in this bland comedy. One of the biggest failures of this film is in its narrative. I couldn't figure out if Melisa McCarthy's character was supposed to be a lovable but bumbling spy or super spy in the making who never got her shot at the big time. The film's dialogue seems to points to the later while McCarthy's slap stick comedy points to the former. I wonder if perhaps the filmmakers thought making Ms. McCarthy's character an inept spy would be misogynistic. If they didn't crowbar in the idea of the main character being a super spy Melissa McCarthy's character repeatedly engaging in slap stick hijinks would make a lot more sense. Her characters repeated gaffs point to her being an inept covert operative but the film's exposition would lead us to believe otherwise. Spy (2015) is a decent film that makes for a fine weekend rental. I apologize if my review comes off overly negative. Frankly this review is a victim of the overwhelmingly positive press this film received. It's like if you told me Point Break (1991) is one of the best films of 1991. Point Break (1991) is a totally watchable film, I happen to enjoy the movie very much. However, when you start rating it with the best films of that year like Silence of the Lambs (1991) or Terminator 2 (1991) I'm going to have to ask you to pump the breaks and take the film down a peg or two.",

    "review": "  OK, so this looks like an interes...oh my God! its another bloody Bond parody!! seriously!!! Yes the modern age feminist hipster, Paul Feig, takes a swing at the Bond genre, and oh what an original concept that is, gee I wonder what we'll see here...ugh!So naturally its an adult comedy with lashings of semi-serious action, CGI blood, swearing and a whole heap of Melissa McCarthy and other actresses. Basically the plot revolves around McCarthy playing Cooper, a desk jockey CIA analyst who helps the very suave, completely cliched character of Fine played by Jude Law. Yep, if you ever wanted to see what it would be like having Jude Law as Bond, well here you go. After a botched mission Fine is supposedly killed off and the CIA need someone to take his place, an unknown, hence they can't use Statham who plays another totally cliched agent character we've all seen before. We then follow Cooper around as she slowly but surely sinks deeper and deeper into a mission, which she was never really suppose to get into in the first place (she was only meant to be surveillance).Oh geez where to start, the plot is unoriginal sure, we all know that, but how about some original ideas...oh too late. From the very first scene I had a good idea what this film was aiming at and how the characters would play out. Spoiler alert! but the minute you see Law as this debonair spy, you know he's obviously gonna die early on, he's clearly the plot setup for McCarthy's Cooper, I mean come on, who didn't see that?! But wait! as the film progresses and more and more characters are introduced, we start to see double agents and characters popping up outta nowhere who are suddenly spies or assassins. All of sudden characters we saw at the start who appeared to just be the butt of a joke or background fodder, are now main characters out to kill the protagonist. Its at this point you know that anyone is fair game and anyone can surprisingly come back from the dead when you thought they had been killed off. So I quickly realised that Jude Law probably wasn't dead at all. Seeing as we didn't actually see him die, clearly he can come back, and he did...*groan*The plot is a mess of characters bouncing back and forth between the goodies and the baddies. Seriously, there are characters popping up all over the place, getting whacked, and then replaced minutes later by new ones, only to get killed just as quickly. The ones that don't get killed, you just know are probably gonna turn out to be secret agents, but on either side. I honesty thought Law's character of Fine was gonna keep flippin' sides! he was a goodie, then a baddie, then a goodie again, but at this point I genuinely suspected he would turn on Cooper yet again right at the death, and then get properly killed off. Amazingly the film beat me on that one, but this film could of kept spinning these characters round and round, one double agent twist after another.The actual characters are a completely mixed bag of nuts that all had one thing in common, none of them managed to actually make me laugh...at any point. McCarthy was...well, pretty much like McCarthy is in every bloody movie she's ever done (whilst looking oddly like Dawn French at one point), whilst her sidekick, played by Brit Miranda Hart, was just simply annoying and unfunny. I swear, an early scene near the start has McCarthy and Law in conversation at dinner, they are both talking about themselves and offering basic foreshadowing of things to come. Now initially there are moments that made me smile (as there were throughout this film), but this obviously intended funny sequence just went on and on and on...it just didn't fucking stop. Like seriously, the moment has passed, the joke is over, its not funny anymore its just awkwardly embarrassing, stop flogging this dead horse!!The only characters that did offer some genuine giggles were Statham as a dumb, cocky but tough agent, nothing gobsmackingly funny mind you, but reasonable. Next to him I quite liked Peter Serafinowicz as the slimy Italian (yet another secret agent) Aldo who can't keep his hands off the ladies. Sure this character felt like a cheesy 'Carry-On' character (something I would of thought was beyond the realms of acceptance for Feig), but his antics were amusing. Other than that everyone was just there, doing exactly what you expected them to be doing with these character types. Get a load of Law by the way, how much flippin' makeup?? Oh and both Statham and the main baddie fall into the lake from that helicopter at the end, so why does only Statham survive?I know this movie was relatively successful but I don't really understand why. Yes some parts were good such as the gadgets sequence near the start which is obviously yet more parodies of a certain franchise, and I did quite like how the main female villain was a spoilt bratty Princess type, although again that did become annoying at times too. But in general everything just felt very generic to me and relied far too much on feeble visual gags including male genitals and slapstick, lots of profanity and lots of weight/looks shaming jabs. Even the inclusion of lots of blood and a bit of gore didn't do anything for me, that just felt unnecessary and shoved in to appease the male audience. I would say this was more enjoyable than 'The Heat' which was pretty dire, but at the end of the day, I found this to be an infantile, factory assembly line, cookie cutter of a flick.",

    "review": "  Was looking forward to this movie just from the commercials - turned out to be way funnier than I expected!Not only is Melissa McCarthy funnier than I've ever seen, but the mix of cast was equally hysterical all the way around (and Jason Statham as the overly intense co-spy had me dying). An excellent, excellent spoof with fun action, great unexpected cameos (including a MM movie regular) and silly, ridiculous humor from start to finish. This movie buries Bridesmaids - I will be watching this many times over.",

    "review": "  After the abomination that was Tammy, I figured Melissa McCarthy had nothing in her except to flaunt her obesity and fall down on screen. However, as juvenile as it was, Spy was actually pretty funny. Focusing on Susan Cooper, a spy's earpiece located instructor, and her recruitment to becoming a real spy, despite her ludicrously nice personality, which is slowly lost as she evolves into a hardcore spy and her... physical boundaries, which are used advantageously throughout the film. There's definitely the intruding fat jokes every now and then, but most of the comedy lies in spoofing classic spy films. Miranda Hart was probably the funniest, though Melissa McCarthy definitely holds her own, and was a refreshing and surprisingly upgrade to the abysmal films of late at the hands of McCarthy, let's just hope that she can continue this sort of humour in future films.",

It was only a couple of jokes that bring a smile to my face, and almost all of them were connected with the character Statham. Just like an actor works Jude Law and Rose Byrne. But Melissa McCarthy was the same as in other films Feig, and it begins to strain. The plot is quite predictable, although in some places and caused concern.

It's crystal clear that this is a parody of a spy movie and not some Tom Cruise action movie like Mission Impossible. This movie is what it claims to be and more. It's a parody but it's really life-like and shot really professionally with no less than a real movie of the genre. The action scenes are awesome and there's also the humor built within! What more can you ask of? OK, at some points they may get carried away or drag the jokes out too long, but overall it's a good attempt. The lady rocked it, although I think she's too fat for the part and I don't like her as an actress, but she was more than OK. Jason Statham was phenomenal as was Jude Law! This was an awesome movie for its kind that made me laugh hard, more than once, and this was actually what I was looking for when I pressed \"play\". So, nice movie, laughs, time well-spent!

    "review": "  I don't know if I've written about this before, but I'm sick and tired of people not finding Melissa McCarthy funny either because of her weight or because of the fact that she's a woman. There are these types of people out there, seriously. Check Twitter or Reddit and see for yourself. Don't me get wrong, comedy is incredibly subjective, even more so than any other film genre. It all depends on what you perceive to be funny. Not every comedian is gonna be your cup of tea and I understand that. So I'm saying that I know not everyone is gonna like Melissa McCarthy and that's fine, because her style isn't for everybody. I don't have a problem if anyone actually has legitimate reasons for why they don't like her. I do have a problem, however, when people dislike her for physical reasons that have nothing to do with whether she's actually a talented comedic actress or not. When you start bringing her weight or gender into it, then that's when your opinion is null and void. It's null and void simply because it has nothing to do with her as an actress and all to do her physical appearance. You don't have to respect everyone's opinion if they're basing it on something that has nothing to with the person's job or talents as an actor/musician/author. With that out of the way, and my personal opinion of Melissa is that she's an incredibly talented comedic actress, I thought this film was pretty excellent all things considered. Some of the most fun I've had watching a film this year. For something that goes close to two hours, it's a film that, surprisingly, is paced really fucking well. Like the time just flies by when you're watching this movie. It's surprising in the sense that a lot of comedy films, particularly ones that go this long, end up having a period where they really start to drag and they end up suffering for it. This is one of those rare examples where it actually doesn't drag and the film moves at an incredibly brisk pace. It's obviously for the benefit of the film. It's also one of those rare examples of a comedy film that has so many characters to draw from when it comes to memorable characters that provide a wide variety of comedic highlights. Seriously, I'm having a hard time coming up with another, mainstream Hollywood comedy film, that had this many memorable, and funny, characters. While some comedy films may be great, I do realize that not every character is gonna be funny or contribute something that's memorable to the film. The supporting cast to this film is one of the best of any Hollywood comedy in ages. Jason Statham, essentially, plays the same role he plays in all his films, but with an obvious comic undertone and he is actually really great here. Rose Byrne has some of the best lines in the entire movie. Miranda Hart, as Susan's best friend, is also immensely entertaining with great comedic timing and facials. Peter Serafinowicz, as Aldo, is one of the funnier characters in the entire film. Even 50 Cent, in his cameo, is funny here. There's even this character, Anton, that doesn't even live longer than 10 minutes after being introduced and his antagonistic relationship with Melissa's character led to some funny bits. Not to mention Melissa's character herself. I can't even begin to detail some of the best bits, because I would be here for a long time, but I think this is one of the more consistently funny movies I've seen a while. Much like I said earlier, there are a lot of comedies that end up dragging before picking right back up for the end. Even What We Do in the Shadows, one of my favorite comedies of the year, ended up dragging a bit in parts. Though, honestly, I would rate both films at about the same level, even though this one is more consistent. The film, obviously, parodies the spy genre and its tropes and how it, for the most part, treats its women characters. I wouldn't call it like a heavy spoof, like the OSS films, where it obviously heavily parodies the James Bond films and the stereotypes associated with the genre. This one just features a female character being thrown into the spy world after other CIA agents are compromised. The writing is sharp and quick witted but, honestly, a lot of that is the cast and, I'm sure, the freedom they were given with being able to deliver the lines in a different manner or add their own little tweaks. I'm sure there was some ad libbing going on here. I can't really complain a whole hell of a lot about this film. It's a top-notch quality comedy film that adds its own fresh and modern twist to a genre that has been telling stories from a single perspective. I thought this was great. An excellent cast, one of the best you'll see this year, and excellent writing make this film a must-see. I'm sure some people will find flaws, and I wouldn't discount them in the least, but I just had a great time watching this movie. And, when you're talking about something like this, then having a great time is what matters. So, yes, I loved this movie. It comes highly recommend, for sure.",

Though McCarthy is talented as a comedic actor she seems cringeworthy at best and obnoxious at worst in most of her scenes and this fails to build up to anything exciting. Laughs are sparse and strained.",

    "review": "  Spy (2015)(((Spoiler Alert)))The movie starts out as a somewhat fun and even partially charming. Everything is pretty fun until Bradley Fine (Jude Law) is killed. Almost from that point forward in the film the script seems to change from a nice almost fairy-tale type of a spy story to something written by a bunch of crude delinquent hooligan drop-outs from high school, or even junior high. I'm betting money that such a group of hooligans could and would still write a better script with less foulness than this movie has. Susan's character is lovely and fun in the first 10-20 minutes but turns into a raunchy horrible and disgusting bitch from hell after Bradley Fine is killed. The audience can understand that she's upset about his death because she obviously had some high hopes that he liked her but even the most vile and disgusting man would blush and most likely run as fast as possible away from the woman she becomes after Fine's death. And to pour even more filth and foulness on to Susan's abrupt and distasteful character change it seems that everyone else she deals with or comes in contact with from that point forward is just as raunchy and nasty as she becomes. The mentality of the script drops to a level of IQ that a neanderthal possesses. A neanderthal that has only learned every curse word in the English language to describe nouns and a few connecting clauses. I can not believe that this movie has actually received as high of the rating it has here on Rotten Tomatoes, I pray that the mentality of the human race has not actually stooped to such a low level that this piece of garbage is actually considered entertainment on any degree or scale that is worthy of measuring. The action is not worthy of anyone's time or efforts to watch and the script literally makes me believe it was written by stoned junior high school drop outs with an IQ lower than apes. Everything audible where you can understand the actors after the first 20 minutes was basically an expletive of some type or some type of belittling comment to another person. After you discover that Fine was not actually killed the movie stoops to even further lows as it gets into disgusting childish jokes regarding genitals and more disgusting crudeness. By the end of the movie Susan's character is so low on the scale of human decency that even though she is the protagonist I truly hoped that she would be diced up in a wood chipper but I felt the same way about everyone else in the movie by the end as well. This movie simply reveals that there are even lower levels of human decency than previously thought possible by normal everyday people. This movie LITERALLY is more useless than a pile of dung!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS VILE PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!Negative - Infinity Stars",

Melissa was her usual hilarious self but also the great supporting cast not only stood out and were memorable, they were funny as well. In a lot of her roles, McCarthy plays a dumb women who's laughs come from her being stupid and clumsy, in this film she is very smart and most of the jokes are witty and well thought out. The action parts were very entertaining and contained what you would expect in any normal spy movie, car chases, gun fights and hand to hand combat. The storyline was intriguing and had some nice twists, although some of it was very predictable. This film was fun in many aspects and was very well done overall. If you want a really good action, comedy with some James Bond type stuff thrown in, you can't go wrong with Spy.",

    "review": "  A redefined wonderful spy movie.I know Melissa McCarthy since 'Gilmore Girls', but never thought she would rise this far, especially to dominate in a movie with the presence of the big names around her, that too in an action film equivalent to top quality. She's one of my favourite actresses, even I enjoyed thoroughly her under-appreciated 'Tammy'. So this is where the action stars become comedians and comedians action stars. Indeed, it worked out so well.It shames comedy-spy flicks like 'The Pink Panther', 'Johnny English' etc. From the director of 'The Heat', helmed another perfect female oriented comedy. Jude Law was a decent as usual, but Jason Statham was unbelievably awesome in his tiny part. I had plenty of good laughs, the loud ones after a long time. I still remember the unicorn joke and I can't stop laughing. And roof over a bike, gadgets and so on... I find Melissa McCarthy's line deliverance are so funny and I enjoy her films specially for that reason.I know they used a stunt double and blue/green screens in the crucial segments for a better result. But still she excelled in all stunt sequences that required physically herself in front of the camera. One of the trivia says, after the end of each day shooting, she looked like fell down an elevator shaft. Her hard work definitely paid off very well.There are lots of adult oriented comedy, so strictly it is for grownups only and may be matured teens. I'll be definitely disappointed if they won't make a sequel for this. If they do, I hope they retain all the cast, especially Statham along the lead actress. And finally I'm looking forward the director-actress's the third collaboration, 'Ghostbusters'.7 1/2/10",

    "review": "  A parody of all super-spy movies from James Bond to Mission Impossible, Spy is a refreshing, shining, funny and energizing action-comedy. A fine example of the outstanding co-operation between Melissa McCarthy and director Paul Feig, the movie is further bolstered by the solid presence of Jason Statham, Jude Law and Bobby Cannavale who further spice-up the story and bring in a much needed \"spy flavor\". Spy never takes itself too seriously, but at the same time manages to keep up its balanced level or parody in order not to annoy the fans of established franchises. It actually works as a funny version of what would happen if top spies such as James Bond or Ethan Hunt are not operative and have to be replaced by the people who used to assist them from the back-office. Such premises are certainly familiar to the movie audiences, but with her energetic performance and excellent pacing, Spy succeeds to be highly entertaining not only by having McCarthy the leading role, but also by providing the chance to Statham, Law and Cannavale to shine on their own with their characters.In conclusion, Spy may not become an all-time action-comedy classic, but in terms of entertainment, fun and humor it is certainly among the best deliveries of 2015. Definitely worth seeing it !",

Unfortunately, this poor movie gets lost in viewers' apathy. Directed by \"Bridesmaids\" helmer, Paul Feig, who is also running the female reboot of \"Ghostbusters\" with McCarthy, hits it out of the park with this spy-centric (duh) comedy about...well, uhm...a spy. Actually, a spy's assistant who gets pushed into field work to avenge the death of her partner, played by Jude Law. This movie is a true comedy. The jokes are plentiful, consistent, strong and does not rely, like previous McCarthy movies, on her physical comedy. Sure, there are a couple, but this movie is superbly written, and that makes it so much better than the generic McCarthy movies that kept audiences out of this one. I hope it picks up steam in DVD/Online sales to where there might be a sequel. It just might deserve one. Jason Statham is the surprise hit in this movie as well, even with Rose Byrne playing the best bitch.",

    "review": "  Melissa McCarthy has proven herself to be very worthy of entertaining a new generation of moviegoers with her hilarious antics. Like such greats as Leslie Nielsen and Robin Williams, she proves that absurd comedy can really work. Her latest film, Spy, lets a lot of her talent shine, and rightfully so.In the film, McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, a desk-bound CIA agent guiding her partner Bradley Fine (Jude Law) on a mission in Bulgaria from her office in CIA Headquarters to find a nuke bomb. From then on, as Fine is presumed dead, Cooper now has to travel around the world. With the numerous identities she's supposed to disguise herself as, and of course the many European destinations she has to travel to, she will need to all she can to retrieve the bomb and stop the villain responsible for setting it off - Sergio de Luca (Bobby Cannavalle). The result is a huge combination of hilarious hijinks and some action scenes that will put you on the edge of your seat. Jason Statham plays Cooper's reluctant CIA co-worker, Rick Ford. Now, Ford basically is all serious in this role just like he was in many of the trailers for the film where I first heard about him (2006's Crank). He delivers his lines in a way that makes the film even more hilarious, but don't take my word for it. You're going to have to see the movie yourself.Directed by the seemingly-unstoppable Paul Feig, who also directed the comedy hit Brisdesmaids (also starring McCarthy) and is set to produce Blue Sky Studios' animated film The Peanuts Movie (featuring good ol' Charlie Brown), Spy does not know how to stop entertaining. The action scenes are fantastic, the comedy works, the cast was incredibly talented, and the film is just really good. Yes, there are scenes with blood, but when the scene gets grizzly, there's always comedy to balance the lighten up the tone. For that alone, Spy is definitely the go-to Summer film of 2015.",

This movie had a perfect cast - everyone fit their characters perfectly. The jokes were rapid-fire, getting a new joke every 10-20 seconds. Suprisingly, almost all of their jokes were hits. Maybe it was because the audience of the theater I went to laughed at parts that weren't even supposed to be jokes, especially the guy sitting next to me (seriously - if your laugh sounds like a dying goat, please don't watch a comedy at the movie theaters). Nonetheless, the movie was filled with laugh-out-loud moments, the story was entertaining, and the cast played their parts very well..This is easily a 5-star film for me. Even though the story was a bit weak, the constant jokes made it incredibly entertaining.",

She had a few hilarious lines sure, yet the other 80% of the time she was straight out of all her other movies. Jason Satham however, was hilarious. At the end it went over the line to the point where they made his character clearly the one jeopardizing the mission. He was funniest when he was legit but ridiculous. Also, a classic, McCarthy's character just becomes too badass. Her \"training in the field\" covers up some of these moments but they say it has been ten years since she's trained so it gets out of hand. Especially when it reaches the end and she starts doing some Black Widow type flips. I'm not going to pick at it though. This movie was a fine waste of time, decent entertainment, and funnier then most movies that use this formula. All I want is for Paul Feig to really branch out on his next film. Step away from this recurring cast and use his comedic talent on something more fresh.",

    "review": "  Just when I was ready to give up on Melissa McCarthy for running her shtick into the ground, she surprises me this gem of a comedy. Melissa McCarthy stars as Susan Cooper, a single woman who works behind a desk for the CIA. When the identities of all active agents are compromised, she enters the field to track down an arms dealer looking to sell a nuclear bomb. Spy movies don't really rank high among my favorite genres (although Daniel Craig as Bond is definitely changing that), but this SPY's main selling point (among many) is that it knows how silly it is and just plays along. If one were to critique SPY on its plot, of course one would conclude that it's convoluted and nonsensical. However, the comedic writing and performances are all top-notch here, making considerations of plot almost irrelevant. My main issue with McCarthy before was her excessively profane, loud and obnoxious screen persona. Thankfully, she tones it down a lot here and goes for a more subtle approach. Her character does kind of become more outre as the film progresses, but it was organic to the central theme of a woman coming into her own in a male-dominated profession. In terms of exploring that, Rose Byrne (NEIGHBORS) plays very well opposite McCarthy as the arms dealer that Cooper is after. Even though they're on opposite sides of the law, they share a bond over being taking seriously as professionals in their respective fields, so to speak. There was even great comic work from non-comic actors like Jude Law and Jason Statham, who is essentially parodying his action star roles. It was over-the-top, but oh so funny. I also liked Alison Janney as Susan Cooper's CIA boss. Outside of the writing and acting, all of the technical bits were well-done, if unspectacular, and the action was well-choreographed. There were a few moments where the CGI didn't look so great, but the cheesy nature of the effects kind of fit with the overblown satirical comedy that film was going for. Finally, there was some pacing issues towards the end of the second act, and the beginning of the third. Maybe 5-10 minutes could have trimmed, but I was laughing so much I barely noticed. Overall, SPY is perhaps the second best comedy I've seen this year (behind KINGSMAN). It was able to take a comedian who I was beginning to tire of, and make her funny again. It also was just plain hilarious the whole way through, and definitely worth your time/money.",

    "review": "  Spy is a very cool tongue in cheek romp the britts obviously carried on with. A lot of swearing as only the Americans can.. feature and an empowering, overweight, feministic comedian enlightened us upon the accomplishment requirement of an international spy, whom i haven't strayed hilarity compliance from, since the *had me in tears 'Bridesmaids' From the position of comms assistant to the hero, to, full blown field agent in a matter of personal vendetta *to the death, to the laymen assassins out there. To enhance the demise of the beauty handicap of the lead role, the cast provide both; arguably one of the male lead heart throbs of the rom-com and drama romance genre 'Jude Law to the unrealistically gorgeous 'awarded most beautiful silverscreen actress' -'Morena Baccarin'The stella cast thow in Jasen Stathem in bulk, and Rose Byrne in cold European elegance. The comedic bouncy board for Malissa Mcarthy with Meranda Hart. really the cast is what this film had going hence the name dropping so enjoy the throws of a spoof action",

The plot is just as convoluted and nonsensical as any summer spy blockbuster, but it does it all with a wink and sense of humor. It also flips the usual script, with McCarthy proving to be a pretty badass spy and typically suave actors like Jason Statham bumbling things up. Fun stuff!Grade: A-",

Fortunately, with McCarthy, it's very easy to have plenty of great quips, and both Statham & Serafinowicz are great as her comedic back-up. Byrne & Law are OK and it's probably a little long, but it always keeps moving and has laughs most scenes.",

Melissa McCarthy is brilliant as were Jason Statham, Rose Byrne and British comedic actress Miranda Hart. If you get a chance watch, all of the end credits all the way through, as they have a bunch of other possible scenarios of future \"Susan Cooper\" adventures. I smiled through almost the entire film and even laughed out loud several time. It's very entertaining and a huge improvement over \"Tammy\", which may be one of McCarthy's worst films.",

It's not as memorable or intelligent as Austin Powers, but possesses the same wit and charm that made it a hit. Melissa McCarthy, an actress I've honestly never been fond of, is actually very likable here as the reluctant hero who comes to embrace and even relish in her deepening situation. The film works because the humour is kept consistent, the sentiment is never overdone and our central character is constantly developing to adapt to her environment, and discovers abilities she never knew she had along the way. It may lean too heavily on fat jokes and rapid-fire profanity at times, but for the most part it's engaging, fun, and above all, downright hilarious.",

Unlike \"Ted 2,\" it was original, witty, and featured some actual storytelling as opposed to constant one-liners. Melissa McCarthy and Paul Feig are proving their working relationship is better than the speed bump they hit last year with \"Tammy.\" Throughout the entire film, McCarthy is consistently funny, and not always in that shticky way that has characterized her other major roles, like \"Bridesmaids\" and \"Mike & Molly.\" Not only is McCarthy funny, but Feig manages to make Jason Statham a genuine comedic goldmine, something I never would have thought possible. His comedic timing was probably the best part of the entire film. And finally, unlike most comedies, this seemed to have real stakes- it felt like a real spy thriller, on par with the likes of \"Mission Impossible\" and \"James Bond,\" but with more hilarity that any spy film I've ever seen.I hope to see more from Feig and McCarthy in the future- hopefully the \"Ghostbusters\" reboot will prove fruitful.",

I have not until I saw this film and she still remains hilarious with so much charisma. Spy is once again directed and written by Paul Feig the man behind Bridesmaids and The Heat comes to direct the funniest movie I have seen since the first Ted. Not just Melissa McCarthy stole the show, but surprisingly Jason Statham is also really funny by giving this monologue on how tough he is when I just enjoyed it. This movie is just so much fun and hilarious in every possible way by giving the characters so much excitement, to do and more. Lot's of the movie's humor is really mean spirited but just so hilarious.Something surprising about this film is that it's also a violent film with lot's of f-bombs. There really is not much to say about Spy only that it's a hilarious film from start to finish. Melissa McCarthy shines like always and just want's the audience to have a fun time. Jason Statham is funny, the writing is hysterical but I bet that you have seen it all when it comes to this film.

    "review": "  The Family Guy of Spy movies. A sneeze joke, a bat poop joke, awkward unrequited love jokes, a pink-eye joke and fart jokes all within the first 35 minutes. Also, like all of Paul Feig's films, you have Melissa McCarthy being humiliated for over 2 hours. What's new about this one? We get to see Jude Law play an infallible character while Jason Statham completely debases himself in his most embarrassing role to-date. Then there's Peter Serafinowicz as Aldo, a sexual deviant who spends every moment he has on-screen trying to molest McCarthy.What about the action? There's isn't any shaky camera effects but it's filled with quick cuts and terrible special effects. Even worse, Feig randomly uses slow-motion during action stunts, which becomes annoyingly repetitive and is completely pointless. Unlike the The Wachowskis, Zack Snyder and Matthew Vaughn, who have mastered this effect, making it a part of their style, Paul Feig makes it clear he has no idea what he's doing. Truly, a terrible writer and director with bad taste and no style of his own.Can Paul Feig degrade women on-screen any further? As bottom of the barrel as the jokes are through-out this atrocity, the only thing that isn't made fun of is McCarthy's weight. Yet, every other aspect about her appearance and personality is targeted for cheap laughs.So, what can we learn from Spy? You can humiliate a woman in every way possible, even sexual assault, as long as you don't mention her weight. Also, we're all going to need to come together and boycott the new Ghostbusters because Paul Feig should never be allowed to make another film again. Ever.",

    "review": "  What were you on, Mr. Travers?I watched Spy only because it had a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Also, Peter Travers called it irresistible. And Peter Travers doesn't do that unless a movie is truly irresistible. After watching Spy (which included skipping through half of it, except for Jason Statham's portions) I kept wondering if he was talking about the same movie. So, what were you on, Mr. Travers?Melissa McCarthy is arguably the best comedian at work right now (The Heat was just incredible!), but with Spy she had nothing to work with apart from a bunch of contrived jokes and situations that probably escaped from Dane Cook's stand-up material and took refuge in Paul Feig's mind. God knows, the entire cast did their best to salvage some form of comedy from a juvenile script that felt like it was written by a 11-year old brat with a laptop, half a brain and no sense of humor. (You know a film's trying too hard when it pulls out the 'puke on dead body' card. Oh yeah, Spoiler Alert!)Feig's probably a good director but going by what I saw, he's also probably a stinky writer. What a waste of a killer cast! Statham was good, but maybe that's because we've never seen him like this. His performance merits a comedy movie of his own (hopefully not written by Feig). So, Mr. Travers. WTF did you watch? What were you on? Did you trip into a chamber full of laughing gas while watching the movie? Yeah, I know what I'm saying is subjective. Maybe I just didn't get the humor, for which, I'm actually thankful. But still, what were you on, sir? Whatever it is, I hope you're on it when you're watching my movie (if I end up making one). And how on earth did you not like Horrible Bosses? Did you run out of your pile or something? I'm worried about you. To the reader: If you haven't seen Spy, I'd suggest you don't. But 93%, 240 million dollars and one of the world's most respected movie critics say that you just might. (It'll probably help if you sneeze into a giant pile of cocaine before you pop the DVD)",

    "review": "  great movie. It has some comedic moments, there are some curse words in the whole movie.Rose byryne,Jason Statham, Melissa MCCarthy star in this movie. Mellssa MCCarthy is the CIA spy after Jude law is killed by Rina who Rose Byrne plays in the movie but he faked his own death, deep undercover with rina as boyfriend but loves susan cooper but her boss gave her identity as carol jenkins/ penny morgan. with nancy helping also. 50 Cent is also in the movie. He plays a small role in the movie. Mostly set in Italy, partial scenes in France. The movie is a blockbuster did well on rotten tomatoes. Melissa role as susan cooper is badass in the fight scenes, shooting guns, take down De Luca, throw his diamonds, nuke bomb in the ocean. with the help of a british man named danny. She thought he was Aldo. nope she thought wrong.",

    "review": "  I grew to like Melissa McCarthy when I first saw her in Bridesmaids (which I liked a lot) and if like me you liked her in that then you will probably like this. Spy is from the same stable and is therefore a similar kind of humour. A couple of belly laughs in this for me also along with very funny comic turns from Jason Statham and \"50 cent piece\" as he is referred to. I like it when celebrities send themselves up and people like P Diddy went up in my estimations when I watched him in Get Him To The Greek. Susan (McCarthy) works in a deskbound role in the vermin infested brain centre of the CIA. Her job is to support agents in the field and her partner is Bradley Fine (Jude Law). Circumstances conspire that leads to Susan being sent into the field with her friend Nancy (Miranda Hart) as her support. Susan is given a series of identities that conform to the stereotype of her personal circumstances and usually involves cats, cakes, knitting and wigs that put another 20 years on her age. Her spy kit also contains various things that adhere to this including stool softening pills which are anti poison tablets. She is assigned to gather intelligence on the daughter of an arms dealer the pompous and stuck up Raina (Rose Byrne). Things inevitably go awry and usually involves rouge agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham). Ford resigns in protest at Susan's deployment to the field but takes it upon himself to finish the assignment without the assistance of the agency. Instead he is nothing but a hindrance and there is a funny scene where he inadvertently picks up a bomb and Susan tries to warn him of this.The cast is good but as is often the case in comedies it's going to hinge upon your opinion of McCarthy and writer Feig's humour. McCarthy's interactions with Byrne are particularly funny and Statham is very good at sending himself up. I liked the fact that it played on stereotypes and laughed at them without being too much to bear. For example there isn't a character called \"Fat Amy\" in a lame, unfunny attempt at satire. There is some quality backbiting and two faced moments that we can all related to and all tend to do in our day to day lives (whether we admit to it or not). Of course it's a ridiculous concept but it all gels together very nicely, not everything hits the target but what does hit scores very highly.",

I forgive the much \"swearing\" in some parts (some people think that's funny and it should be in all comedies but I honestly think here was used as it should...coz it was meant to be). Anyway, Melissa was brilliant as always, Jude Law was stunning! Rose Byrne surprised me coz I have never seen her as an evil villain on a film (my fave role of her will always be the one with Cillian Murphy on the movie SUNSHINE). She should try to be evil on more movies from now on really! Oh, and another one who I have not seen since the TV series HARDWARE with Martin Freeman (that show is so awesome+hilarious!) & yes, Shaun of the Dead is: ALDO! Peter Serafinowicz was just amazing as italian spy (how he nailed that accent was priceless! Loved his role so much here!). For real, I recommend this movie, it's soundtrack, all of it!

    "review": "  Spy will have you laughing and cheering. It is smart and funny - a deft combination that will have you anticipating the inevitable sequel. An uproarious blast of globe-trotting action-comedy delirium that doesn't spoof the espionage-thriller genre so much as drop a series of banana peels in its path. Paul Feig, who guided McCarthy to an Oscar nomination for Bridesmaids, does her an even bigger favor here: He's given her the movie and the role for which she'll be remembered. Feig, who wrote the Spy screenplay, encouraging his actors to improvise along the way, has his own stealth mission. For all the over-the-top comedy, zigzagging chases, and choreographed fight scenes, Spy is very much a tale of female empowerment. McCarthy is the star of the film, but her willingness to let her fellow actors shine when an opportunity knocks to give the audience a belly-laugh is clear, and it's the undeniable strength of the supporting cast that makes Spy a strong a film. This isn't one of those run-of-the-mill sitcoms stretched to an unendurable length, but a very sharp and pointed espionage romp that allows its ensemble of actors to deliver the material with a fresh sense of gusto. Simultaneously broad and progressive, Spy offers further proof that Melissa McCarthy and writer-director Paul Feig bring out the best in one another -- and delivers scores of belly laughs along the way.VERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

Melissa McCarthy held her own and demanded attention. Her weight was not the funniest thing in the movie, which is typically how comedies treat heavier women. Also Jason Statham is unbelievably attractive and fun to watch. At the same time it's not 2003 anymore, no one gives a shit about Jude Law.

    "review": "  It's another Paul Feig/Melissa McCarthy comedy. Have you ever wondered what makes the superspy so invincible? It's actually because they have backup in their ear, giving them the extra edge they need. This focuses on a duo (McCarthy/Jude Law), but when she is forced to go into the field, she's got a lot to learn in a very short amount of time if she wants to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of terrorists. Now I know I may be in the minority here, but I've been over Melissa McCarthy for a long time now. Everybody loves Bridesmaids, but I wasn't impressed. The majority of people I have talked to like The Heat, but I absolutely deplore it. Everybody was raving about this, critics included, so I had to check it out, and I can't say that I'm surprised: it's the same old song that McCarthy has been singing for her entire career. I don't like being the odd one out, and I really don't know if it's just me, but comedy is subjective, and I don't find McCarthy's shtick funny. To be fair, I will say that I didn't watch this in a crowd environment, so that might be a part of the issue, but I am fairly confident that even if I watched this in a theater, I would have had my arms folded and would have enjoyed it at the same level as I did at home, by myself. I just don't enjoy the repeated punchline; there's always some joke about how she's fat and/or unappealing, and it is followed up with her improvising something crass. It's all she does, and the only time I've ever seen her deviate was in St. Vincent. I will say that this could have been worse; I got a few chuckles out of this, but they were all small, and I was largely unamused. A few positives: I like Jude Law in this, and I don't think he would make a bad James Bond. I also liked Jason Statham's rants, as he is largely poking fun at the rest of his career, making jokes about defibrillating himself like he does in Crank. With the exception of the opening scene, I don't think many of the jokes or set-ups are all that creative, and they try to get you to laugh by just cutting away, which is a lazy at its core. I do realize that I'm in the minority, but I rate movies for myself, and this was exactly what I expected to be: as lame as its title. Sorry.",

Para grande surpresa, Spy manteve-me viciado desde o in�cio .. a rir! �s vezes literalmente sentando em grande moda ROFL! Escrita incr�vel e grande di�logo torna as mais de 2 horas de filme nunca se tornarem chatas .. bem, �s vezes um pouco l� para o meio. Melissa McCarthy � grande neste papel .. uma secret�ria que se tornou espi�o numa grande conspira��o mundial. Sim, tem todos os ingredientes e clich�s t�picos de um filme de ac��o de espionagem: persegui��es de carro, casinos, um avi�o fora de controle, helic�pteros, cidades europeias ic�nicas, veneno, um vil�i, arma destrui��o maci�a, diamantes, cadeira de interrogat�rio, combate corpo a corpo , etc. Falando disso .. eles s�o todos muito bem executado e por vezes violentos! N�o se esque�am.. este � um filme de com�dia com elementos de um filme cl�ssico 007! Certamente recomendo este filme, um dos melhores que vi este ano.O Bom: Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne e Jason Statham, que por sinal tem um papel fant�stico. Quem imaginava que Statham consegue te fazer rir daquela maneira?! O Mau: a dura��o .. pode ficar um pouco chato no meio. Misture-se a��o com com�dia em mais de 2 horas ... � um risco.O Feio: O Aldo!! Adorei aquele maluco!!",

    "review": "  Many of us aren't yet sure about Melissa McCarthy. But one thing we all know is that she shines gloriously in any film directed by Paul Feig (a la \"Bridesmaids\" and \"The Heat\"). He knows her strengths and weaknesses, and allows her to play the straight-man.In Spy, she plays Susan Cooper, a CIA analyst who spends all of her time behind a computer monitor, acting as the eye-in-the-sky for lead agent, Bradley Fine (Jude Law), as he goes out in the field. But after Fine is compromised and a terrorist group hacks into a list of the CIA's agents, Cooper's director (Allison Janney) assigns her to go out into the field since she is unrecognizable. Susan is an overweight, bubbly, cat-lady-looking lady with no fieldwork experience, and everyone doubts her abilities--including agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham) who doesn't get nearly enough screen time as he provides us with some of the film's best scenes. Of course, one of the main themes here is \"proving everyone wrong\"--a subtext that comes off as a little too forceful at times. Everyone in the film mocks McCarthy's character and makes fun of her weight and her looks. This is effective to an extent if done properly, but the characters exploit every chance they have to belittle her, and the constant defamation really starts to get old about halfway through the movie.But this film gives us an almost perfect blend of comedy and action, and doesn't sacrifice one for the other. There seems to be so much effort placed in making sure that the action sequences are well-done, and it shows.On the comedy side of things, Feig often seems to go for a little more disorder that it comes off as inconsistent, but it's just evident of his range. And as seamless as the film is, perhaps its biggest downfall is that every time a protagonist is about to die, someone on their team conveniently shows up to save them. It's expected to happen, but not to the extent that it is in this film. It's not a perfect film, but it's just about there. It may not break into new territory, however it's a very solid movie in both genres. The cast is excellent. McCarthy is superb. Spy has definitely moved into her top 3 films. And guess what the other two are.Twizard Rating: 88",

If this upstart director can do such a fine job with suck a hackneyed premise, then what will he do with the beloved Ghostbusters franchise? Anyway, that's neither here nor there. This movie stands wonderfully on its own, and a great supporting cast bookended by Jude Law and a Chuck Norris-esque Jason Statham keep the fun rolling. My only gripe is the final third act, where things get a bit TOO on-the-nose, and border on ridiculous, but no matter: Spy is THE action comedy of the year none of us knew we wanted! Watch it now!",

The character development is also inconsistent with characters appearing menacing and too serious in some parts and nothing more than a clown in other parts. Still, a very entertaining, enjoyable, and somehow creative film that succeeded to be more than just a simply spy spoof, mostly thanks to the excellent performance by not only McCarthy herself (hope that she can escape from being type-cast like this in the future, though), but also from other cast members. The coherent tone and solid film-making also help \"Spy\" a better film than the \"Jump Street\" series, which have the same premise, good cast, and spoof tone but suffer from lazier film-making. Watching this, I think that the reboot of \"Ghostbusters\" may still have hope with Feig and McCarthy.",

    "review": "  Thanks to a decent script that plays strongly to an A-grade Funny Girl and a cast given a License to Kill it, Melissa McCarthy's latest offers up a smart espionage send-up that boasts some winning Spy Game-manship all its own. Even when saddled with a script smartly conceived, but stupidly written like Tammy, McCarthy makes Limoncello out of lemons (the fast food hold-up remains a great comic moment despite the other 90 minutes of white noise surrounding it). When she possesses the right material, however, this comedienne easily earns not just a place as one of the best funny people working today but also in the last 25 years.In this R-rated comedy, a desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and prevent diabolical global disaster. Cerebral and physical, she turns phrases full-out funny with only a slight innately honed tweak and then pratfalls as convincingly as Buster Keaton and Chevy Chase. Jason Statham, however, nearly steals the show by dialing up his tough guy persona to brilliant comic proportions (while kicking ass in The Expendables often ends up being unintentionally funny, kicking his own ass in Spy ends up being hilarious). From the Bond-aping opening sequence to the M:I-unworthy disguises (wigs play an appropriately silly role) to Jude Law's dashing and clueless Harry Palmer-type rogue, writer-director Paul Feig has fun with the genre but puts forth enough rousing adventure to establish a brand of his own. Granted, not all of the broad jokes and gags make a kill shot, but enough come damn close to the target.Bottom line: The Bourne Idiocy",

Are the critics insane? None of them mention this in their reviews. Ask a bunch of parents of 15 year old's whether they would be happy to see their kids watch this ... my guess is you would get around 98% saying no. I'm saddened that the actors and director put their names to this, it's a disgrace to normal society.",

Her character was always involved in the best scenes in the film and all the laughs she brings isn't from stupid physical comedy (for the most part). Like I said though, it's alright at best. I don't know if it's worth watching the entire thing for maybe 2 laugh out loud scenes. Everything in between that is really forgettable and boring. Overall I would say this was by no means bad, but could have certainly been much, much better. If you really, really like action comedies, you'll probably have a blast with it.

I mean; Mission Impossible, Kingsman, Bond and other smaller original flicks like The Man From U.N.C.L.E, or in this case; Spy. Yes it's a comedy, but does that make the film forced to be funny? Some of the humorous moments are flat and doesn't come as great as they could have come. But I still had a good time with its unpredictable storyline and random & hilarious jokes. But some moments are just slow and non-interesting and the movie lacks heart, especially when it comes to remembreble humorous scenes. Sure there are some of them but there aren't that many. The greatest aspect is on the other hand the well chosen actors and it's the personalities of the main characters that totally steals the show! The comedy-genre is a risky business; jokes will always grow old and Spy is no exception. It's an okay movie for the first-timer, but not more than that. I saw Spy yesterday, and yes I had a great time with it but I've already forgotten it, it's just a one-timer.But it's really enjoyable to watch, even though it lacks heart of a Mission Impossible-alike and less messier spy flick.6.5/10",

Cuando falla la misi�n, y Fine es asesinado, Susan decide postularse para capturar a la responsable del crimen. Spy es una pel�cula dirigida por Paul Feig, uno de los escritores de Bridesmaids, por lo tanto es garant�a de que los personajes femeninos van a estar bien representados. En las comed�as hasta hace pocos a�os los papeles principales estaban exclusivamente reservados a actores, entonces es refrescante ver a alguien como McCarthy en un papel de esta envergadura, y que su apariencia no sea parte del humor. De hecho si se burlan de Susan, pero s�lo porque no pareciera ser el prototipo de esp�a, pero a la final, les prueba a todos que estaba equivocados, y el p�blico termina estando de su lado. McCarthy a pesar de tener bajo su manga papeles fallidos, es una actriz con la cual es f�cil identificarse, y por eso ha tenido �xito en el cine. Spy tiene momentos muy graciosos, y otros que no funcionan, pero en general el humor funciona. Rose Byrne como Rayna tambi�n se destaca, y es de las mejores partes de Spy. Byrne es una actriz que la comedia le sale naturalmente. En el intercambio que sucede en el avi�n entre Rayna y Susan es la mejor escena de toda la pel�cula. La naturalidad con la cual se insultan es incre�ble, y no se como lograron decir ese di�logo con cara seria. Jason Statham, quien interpreta una parodia de si mismo, tambi�n logra destacarse. Es basicamente Jason burl�ndose de el tipo de papeles que interpreta normalmente, quien logra haza�as imposibles, pero ac� falla en todo lo que se propone, y me pareci� genial que le dieran esta nueva dimensi�n a este actor. Qui�n hubiese pensado que Statham fuera gracioso?Spy es una pel�cula entretenida, como momentos que te hacen re�r. Es una obra de arte? claro que no, pero es una comedia distinta y su premisa funciona.",

    "review": "  I Spy with my Pink Eye, lol, a very fun, and pretty funny movie. Melissa McCarthy proves that she has the power to carry a film even if she's not always successful (i.e. Tammy) but here, she succeeds with ease, 1 because the writing was very good (even if all the jokes didn't work) and 2 because she had a strong cast around her. This is a definite change for Jason Statham especially because he doesn't usually do comedies and he usually plays the tough rugged guy, here, he's just a klutz and kind of an idiot, but he's hilarious. Also, for a comedy, there is quite a bit of action, violence and blood, and one very gruesome murder with a glass of wine (or whatever it was). I was not expecting much out of this and I thoroughly enjoyed it so I guess the would make this a definite RECOMMENDATION, for McCarthy's likability and Statham's comedy and pretty much the whole experience.",

    "review": "  Unoriginal, flatly executed, and overblown, Spy is the sort of comedy that thinks it's hilarious and assumes you do as well, without earning it. The very set-up of a heavy-set and mild mannered Melissa McCarthy being put in a James-bond esque role sounds perhaps mildly amusing, and it is, but its novelty wears off quickly. The gags are heavily exaggerated and much too drawn out, the plot absurdly nonsensical, and the humor much too one-note. The movie thinks constant fat/ugly jokes about McCarthy is simply hysterical, and thinks it's even more hysterical when she turns the tables by having an \"f bomb\" tirade. It's not. The film feels like an SNL skit stretched way too far.Disappointing.1.5/5 Stars",

    "review": "  Summer's here, it's hot as hell, what is there to do? In America, we know the answer to that. Go to the movies. If you go anytime this week or next Spy will be one of the many summer flicks jockeying for your attention, (along with the much louder and CGI heavier Jurassic Park IV which just hit theaters today) but is it worth your ten bucks? I think it might be. If you think you'll be satisfied with no more than a few laughs and very few infuriating \"comedy\" movie moments (no needless dick punches, out of touch racists jokes, or babies puking on people in this movie).If you've seen the trailers then you know that this is a spy spoof. It's more in the vein of Kingsman than Austin Powers, though it is no way as good as either of those films. There are times when Spy goes too far with its mocking of its lead, Melissa McCarthy, but it isn't to the extreme as other movies she's starred in. No one points out her weight, it's more of about her being an outcast, almost \"just because,\" though the unspoken understanding of these jokes is because she's overweight. These jokes don't come off funny, they feel over worn more than anything, and unfortunately they happen a lot in the first 30 minutes or so of the movie. After we get past that point though, it does pick up. Once Melissa's character goes rogue and starts spying it up (a.k.a beating the shit out of people in well choreographed fights scenes) it is actually pretty fun. It's also a relief to see Melissa hanging up her Chris Farley persona for this movie. She plays a regular person, not someone who takes pleasure in reminding the audience how loudly she can fart, which is a nice treat, because she is a fine actor, but like so many others she's found a niche that works, and she's been driving that persona home.Speaking of personas, Jason Statham plays an exaggerated version of his action star persona. He pops in the film every so often to throw a few more fucks into the dialogue along with some pretty funny jokes about the extremes he's gone in the past to prove just how much of a bad ass he is (pouring shards of broken glass into his eye, driving a car onto a moving train while he was on fire, ext.).As much as Spy would like to believe it's a genre mashup that transcends the goofy comedy genre, it really isn't. It's essentially just another run of the mill goofy comedy, but this one is trying harder, and does have some charm. Check it out if you're Avengered out, Jurassiced out, as well as Maxed out.",

The emphasis though is on the ladies, both as protagonist and antagonist, and so w/o peddling WOMEN'S LIB it manages to do so more or less.

    "review": "  Today i will be writing my review for the Paul Feig directed movie Spy starring Melissa McCarthy and Jason Statham.The film started out brilliantly and set a good tone for which I had hoped would last throughout the entire film. Jude law was an absolute bad ass early on, reminiscent of the Dr Watson roll he played in Sherlock Holmes, which totally had me thinking i was in for an amazing action movie.Oddly enough, Statham was mostly used for comedy relief, which is strange because almost every movie he is in (with the exception of snatch) he is usually wrecking shit and kicking ass, but they ended up making him an overly pissed off version of Mr. Bean.Melissa McCarthy basically plays the same \"character\" that she usually plays. You can expect a lot of \"come on's\" and a bevy of classic Mike and Molly anecdotes we have become WAY to accustomed to. That's not to say that she didn't have a couple of funny moments, but its more in the vein of like when you go and see a band like U2 live and they just put out a shitty album on your iPhone (which nobody asked for by the way) and you wish they would just play the classics from Joshua Tree but instead you get a whole concert of Songs of Innocence with Where the streets have no name and Bullet the Blue Sky peppered in to the act so the true fans don't completely revolt.Paul Feig once again surprised me with his amazing directing skills. The action scenes were fucking amazing and the way he shoots comedy has me a little more excited to see how he pulls of Ghostbusters.I was skeptical going into this movie especially after seeing The Heat (which i wish i could of unseen) but with a little optimism seeing how Feig also directed Bridesmaids which is the funniest comedy with an all female cast that i have ever seen.As decent as this movie was, it seems like the handjob (test) the girl your dating (the studio) gives you to check out your package (directing skills) before she decides if your big enough (money at the box-office) for her to want to allow you inside of her \"box\" (Big Name Movie Franchise).While the studio felt confident enough to give Feig a franchise as big as Ghostbusters, (which is the equivalent of getting access to the back door in terms of iconic comedies) i feel this movie was at least worth a blow job at best( a B list action comedy reboot with a famous enough name like Get Smart or Naked Gun).While this movie wasn't the best, it surely wasn't the worst movie i have seen this year, and while i don't heavily endorse it, its still good enough for a Redbox rental or a purchase on VOD (video on demand)",

Sure the film is too long and they really don't know how to use Jason Statham but the rest of the cast is totally game and the filthy script actually very funny. A terrific time at the movies. A good summer flick.",

He sneezes, accidently pulls the trigger, and kills the man. This is one of the funniest and most ridiculous opening scenes I've seen in awhile. Melissa McCarthy is usually over the top and annoying in most of her movies. They really force the lines and the comedy with her. She's a brilliant actress. I think she's just been subject to a lot of strange scripts and directing. She is absolutely hilarious in Spy. She's not over the top. She isn't annoying. She's clever and goofy and that girl can work a black dress. Her characters been stuck behind a desk assisting Jude Law on missions for her entire career. She's finally given the opportunity to get into the field and help locate a dangerous nuclear weapon. She's an amazing spy that hasn't been able to use her talents over the years. I laughed the entire time. It felt fresh and witty. The action was great. The entire movie was enjoyable and made me want to watch it again.",

Loved the performances of Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, Jason Statham, Jude Law, Allison Janney and especially Miranda Hart. She was truly the heart and soul of this movie and she killed it in all of her scenes, love when an actress can be naturally funny without trying too hard. The script and dialogue are both hilarious, there is a surprise amount of action and violence and the soundtrack is nice. I've seen better comedies before, but 'Spy' did not fail to make laugh a lot. I consider Bridesmaids, The Heat and Spy as a sort of ''Melissa McCarthy - Paul Feig'' trilogy. Highly recommend this movie!",

    "review": "  I waited until there was literally nothing else that I hadn't seen to go see this one and even then, it was just to pass a couple of hours between errands. Turns out it wasn't at all what I expected. It started out like a James Bond film with the music and action in the opening. So I figured I would at least stay awake.As the movie progressed and Melissa McCarthy's 'mousy' character became more involved, I began to perk up. The action increased and so did McCarthy's skill as first time field agent. She played a semi-serious and accidentally comic Jane Bond with a filthy mouth. I actually laughed out loud a few times (which I rarely do, even in a comedy) but was continually enthralled by the action sequences. It was also very funny to watch Jason Statham, the usually flawless main character, play a bumbling, agent out of control.Thanks to McCarthy, the language is out of control and I wouldn't recommend it for younger viewers but truthfully, that is what made her character so funny. I wish I hadn't waited so long to see this. I might have seen it again before it finds its way to video. Very good job.",

    "review": "  Paul Feig's third (and certainly not last) collaboration with Melissa McCarthy is their best yet with a perfect blend of spoof and a surprisingly decent spy plot that never pushes the jokes too far and is also pretty kick-ass at times. Melissa McCarthy is nowhere near my favourite actress and some of her ad-libbing is torture to me, but she shocked me in this film with her physicality and ability to totally kick ass and hold her own with some great mean-spirited humour. The supporting cast is EXCELLENT with Jude Law playing the James Bond-type, Allison Janney playing the bitter commander, Rose Byrne playing the UBER BITCH villain, and Jason Statham completely stealing the show as an over-the-top agent with anger and ego issues that never stopped making me laugh. Rose Byrne, also a Feig collaborator killed it as the seductress villain and her snobby attitude led to some of the funniest dialogue in the movie and an exchange between her and McCarthy was so harsh I was almost in tears! As said before, while it parodies the spy genre, by the third act it is knee-deep in a perfectly functional spy plot which was impressive to see. It is definitely not for the faint-hearted as there is a fair bit of R-rated violence and pretty much non-stop swearing (mostly from Statham) but it's all in good fun. Greatest comedy of all time? Definitely not, but McCarthy proved here that she's more than a one-trick pony who is more than capable of doing both action and absurd comedy.",

A lack of creativity behind the camera, and what's expected to be funny is dialogue that is rude and mean spirited that goes on for too long. The reason I feel this got so many positive review is because we all find it empowering to see a woman like Melissa McCarthy kicking ass, but to compare it to a better spy comedy like Kingsman, it just doesn't compare. And why are there so many goddamn Brits working in the CIA in this film? I understand this is supposed to be a Bond spoof but maybe make up an international spy organization if you want something like that to work.",

    "review": "  Melissa McCarthy is a comedy giant; there is no denying that. She exploded first with a supporting role in Bridesmaids, which earned her an Oscar nomination. She went on to champion in TV as well, earning an Emmy for her role in Mike & Molly. She's also been a box-office assurance with Bridesmaids and The Heat each generating more than $150 million. So there is no denying that McCarthy is funny. A great amount of her hilarity comes from improvised scenes where one finds her spurting out rapid insults and one-liners that have the audience rolling on the ground laughing. Her newest comedy film: Spy only confirms her stance as the go to comedy actor of today.  Spy (surprisingly no movie before in history has had this title) tells the story of a CIA operative, Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) who helps field agents navigate when on a mission, she is the \"voice in the ear\" for her assigned agent: Bradley Fine (Jude Law) whom she also happens to have a crush on. However, after the covers of all field CIA agents are blown, CIA chief Elaine Crocker (Allison Janney) is forced to send a fresh face into the field, thus Cooper is sent to Paris. In Paris, Cooper must track the oily-haired Mafioso Sergio De Luca (Bobby Cannavale) in order to figure out the location of a missing nuke. The majority of the film is planned to generate laughs from physical comedy, but thankfully the arguments between McCarthy and Jason Stantham, who plays hardcore rogue agent, fill in gaps between the action scenes in an equally entertaining way. In the end however the big supporting cast (which also includes Rose Byrne as the main villainess) seems to not be fully taken advantage of. McCarthy holds her own, but the screen does end up hogging her. The film could have used more Jason Stantham and a surprising Miranda Hart who plays Cooper's best friend at the CIA. Director Paul Feig (who previously worked with McCarthy on Bridesmaids and The Heat) does a good job at distracting the audience, so much that we forget how clich�d the film is with spy and 007 jokes. Even halfway through the film the audience doesn't notice that the story has been going nowhere for over an hour. I think that that is an incredible achievement: to have the audience so entertained they don't focus on the little details and cracks in an artist's work. In the end the move is a good laugh. Some jokes fall flat, but the majority makes it through to your smile thanks to an amazing supporting cast and a more than capable star.",

Susan Cooper (mccarthy) is a desk bound cia analyst who daily tends to the needs of cia active operatives. However when her partner goes off the grid and another agent is compromised she volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate a deadly arms dealer. The question is, is she good enough to cope with it being her first field operation. Loved this moved, nothing too tiresome and full of quirky cast appearances. Bradley Fine (law) is the love of Coopers life and after learning he was off the map that was Coopers decision made to offer her services. Very quirky clever comedy showcase movie does exactly what he says on the tin. A very decent comedy espionage movie. Enjoy.",

    "review": "  \"Spy\" is a comedic-female version of James Bond with a lot more hilarious trash-talk and more failed missions than one would expect from a so-called \"Spy\" movie.Melissa McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, a stereotypical shy genius who works in a secret CIA underground facility. She is the right-hand man to Bradley Fine, portrayed by pretty boy actor Jude Law. Cooper's role was to help support Fine from behind the scenes by assisting him via Bluetooth in which she lets him know where enemies are approaching, how many people are surrounding him, and ordering missiles to shoot at precise locations she provides when the time calls for it. Cooper had a one-sided love with Fine and when she thought Fine had died at the hands of an arms dealer, she began the plan to avenge his death. The aforementioned arms dealer goes by the name of Raina. She is played by the devilishly beautiful Rose Byrne. Right after Raina supposedly killed Fine, she revealed that she knows all the true identities of the CIA agents in the field. This, along with her plot to avenge the man she loves' death, caused Cooper to volunteer to go out into the field to find Raina and track down a stolen nuclear bomb. \"Spy\" isn't only about capturing the bad guys. This movie shows the evolution of a woman who was invisible to both her peers and the man that she loved, to becoming a spy who kicks butt in the field and saves the day. Cooper was unknown to the villains of this movie because she kept her head down in the CIA and operated in the background. Now, she calls her own shots and leads others into battle. She developed confidence in her line of work and has a newfound sense of respect for herself by loving who she is and not being ashamed of it. The only questionable part about this movie was the director's casting choice of Bradley Fine. Jude Law certainly had the looks for the part, but Ryan Gosling would have made a better Fine. Gosling would have put more of a charm towards Fine's personality, which would have made more sense seeing as how Cooper fell for him. Gosling would have made a more convincing character as Fine and would have overall made the movie blend better together. Throughout the movie is a series of endless laughs and witty comebacks. This movie is a mix between James Bond and Paul Blart: Mall Cop. Although this movie shows these spies having some amazing skills in kicking the bad guy's butts, this movie also shows idiotic failings a 10 year old could figure out (like not storming into a black market bomb deal and knocking yourself out, Ford). If you want to see a successful and witty hero in an action packed movie, then go watch TNT movies on the television. However, if you want a good laugh see things get blown up, then this is the movie for you.",

This is the best I've seen Jason Statham and I'm already a fan. He and Jude Law were up for this challenge and Rose Byrne was fantastic. There was a moment in the middle I thought this might lose momentum but it quickly picked up and remained through the film. The best I can say about the film making is that I didn't notice it. I did notice the writing. In addition to the fine acting, the script deserves credit. I especially liked the long dialogue segments by Statham and Janney. They were so perfectly delivered I want to watch outtakes to know how long it took to get each one right. Being from the Midwest originally, I'm going to pick on the crafty, dowdy characterizations while still recognizing they're not wholly wrong.",

    "review": "  Melissa McCarthy has been America's finest comedienne ever since she knocked us all out with her all-hands-on-deck supporting performance in 2011's \"Bridesmaids\". Not a Lucy nor a Rosalind, McCarthy has always gone down and dirty, packing her yearly schedule with comedy parts built around her foul mouthed persona. But after a few too many misses, such as inexplicably high-grossing \"Identity Thief\" or critical disaster \"Tammy\", one has begun to associate McCarthy with a wig and a greasy part, embodying a character better equipped for a Saturday Night Live skit than a full length movie.  Finally, we have a vehicle worthy of her talents: \"Spy\" is the best comedy of the year. One shouldn't be saying such things until December, I know, but I doubt I'll find another romp as packed with belly laughs as this one. I haven't laughed this hard, or this uninterruptedly, for months. And I'm not being overly dramatic - with increasing embarrassment, I found tears streaming down my face quite often, doing everything possible to quiet down potentially obnoxious laughing fits. It's been a month since the film was released - the theater was hardly packed - but it was clear that the people around me were in similar states of shock. This is a comedy worth celebrating. As soon as I left the theater, I wanted to see it again. (Pardon the clich�: there's a reason we have them.) In \"Spy\", McCarthy portrays Susan Cooper, a CIA analyst who spends her days acting as the well-trained ear to 007-esque field agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). She's been stuck at her desk for years, aiding him on each and every mission - it's only inevitable that she, a lonely heart who hasn't been in a relationship for a while - fall for his charming ways. But after an incident leaves him out of the picture, Susan realizes that she would make for a good spy: she is knowledgeable when it comes to the field and knows quite a bit of self defense. Reluctantly, her supervisor (Alison Janney) agrees with her suggestion, sending her to Paris to thwart a terrorism plot involving powerful criminals Sergio De Luca (Bobby Cannavale) and Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne). Constantly interrupting the mission is Rick Ford (Jason Statham), a rogue agent who lets his ego get in the way of successful plotting. Though initially nervous, Susan finds herself thrilled by her new job - she might even be, dare she say it, better than Fine.  Paul Feig, the man behind \"Bridesmaids\" and \"The Heat\", mixes action and comedy with such skill that we almost forget that seeing McCarthy convincingly fist fight with a baddie should seem strange - but McCarthy, thanks to a terrific comedic performance and Feig's screenplay, is never anything less than a wrecking ball of laughs. She can sell a barbed insult as well as she can make the most of her initially mousy fa�ade - McCarthy is one of the greatest comedy actors of the 2010s. It's easy to forget that fact when she heads bombs, but when films like \"Spy\" come along, we begin to realize just how wrong we were to ever underestimate her.  For once, though, McCarthy is not the only actor providing the majority of our abdominal pain. The responsibility is shared by a fantastic, sometimes surprisingly so, ensemble: Byrne, an under-appreciated straight woman, murders her role as the big-haired villainous; Miranda Hart, as McCarthy's ear, is a fine combination of bumbling and shrill; Janney's no-nonsense portrayal provides for some of the most hard-hitting laughs in the film. But best is, shockingly, Statham, who lampoons his image so hilariously one can only wonder what's been keeping him out of the comedy world all these years. I loved \"Spy\". I don't go to the theaters often - money, you see, is too sacred to constantly spend on entertainment - but I haven't had this much fun in the cinema chair for what feels like years. Sometimes, it's good to laugh until you cry; sometimes, it's good to want to turn around and see the movie all over again. Netflix is cheaper, I know, but don't wait to see \"Spy\". Go out on the town with your friends, ending your night with it. I guarantee you'll still be laughing for the next few days.",

    "review": "  The large cast of Spy works impressively from Melissa's witty, fumbling \"Susan Cooper\", Jude Law's egotistical \"Bradley Fine\", Rose Byrne's uptight villainous \"Rayna\", and Jason Statham's hilarious, over the top \"Rick Ford\".Spy's genre is action, comedy and it does both brilliantly. The action set pieces are put together with style and many of the more intense, up close action sequences feel extremely fluid. The knife fight were \"Coop\" tries to fend off an enemy by use of various kitchen equipment is funny and very impressive to watch.The comedic aspect of this film is also perfectly captured through character dialogue and visual gags, the cast chemistry also adds to some truly laugh out loud moments.Statham's \"Rick Ford\" proved one of my favorite characters. His crazy tales are used to improve upon his super spy status and are gut wrenching throughout as he always seems to pop up to ruin Susan's plans. As for negatives with Spy other than Rose Byrne's character \"Rayna\" the villains are very one note and quite forgettable. Also the plot gets a little too convoluted towards the end and the few twists are extremely clich�.Overall I had a very enjoyable time watching Spy and at times it had me bursting out with laughter.",

    "review": "  This film motivated me to create an account on Rotten Tomatoes and write a review. I can't remember the last time I disliked a movie as much as this one.Framed in the style of Bond flicks, but thrown off the deep end with slapstick, this movie reeks of repetitiveness and ridiculous unrealism. This is the kind of comedy McCarthy usually excels at, but with Feig trying to replicate the dynamic presence McCarthy had on \"The Heat\", this comedy falls short in every way.McCarthy is brilliant in this film, but she simply isn't able to carry the whole movie on her back. Stratham adds some spontaneity to the mix with his brash and brazen, over the top character who seems to have a fish story for everything, but his role seems a bit second fiddle, and he's not able to contribute as much as he should. I would have liked to have seen him and McCarthy in a more amicable partnership rather than the jaded spy being an idiot while the no-experience analyst/sort-of spy saves his ass all the time.This movie didn't rise to the level of a spoof, and so people are left to categorize it in the action-comedy genre, and it just doesn't cut the cake. Don't get me wrong, the bathroom humor and bats flying out of the ceiling are funny in a Jim Carrey sort of way, but if you're over eleven it gets old fast.",

    "review": "  I'm definitely in the minority of people who did not really like \"Bridesmaids\" all that much. Perhaps by the time I saw it, the movie had gotten so much praise that there was no way it was going to live up to the expectation that I had set for it to achieve. It's not like I went into it with a negative attitude like \"I've heard lots of good things so you better not disappoint me,\" but rather an excited attitude of \"everyone says this movie is amazing, I can't believe I'm finally going to get to see it!\" The reason I didn't like it is probably a combination of unrealistic expectations and simply not finding it to be all that funny. I never ended up seeing \"The Heat\" but I had heard good things. When my roommate excitedly suggested we see \"Spy,\" I was well aware it had a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes but for some reason I just wasn't interested and actually fought against us going to see it. I was in for a surprise when I begrudgingly tagged along and found myself laughing far more often and much harder than my roommate who suggested we see it in the first place. It's interesting that Melissa McCarthy has blown up so much since \"Bridesmaids\" but just about every movie she's headlined since then, that isn't Paul Feig-directed, has been a huge critical disaster. There have been box office hits but nothing well received from critics. For some reason, Feig has the great ability to write and direct McCarthy better than anyone else (better than her own husband did in last year's \"Tammy\"). He is somehow uniquely able to channel her specific energy into performances that remind us why she is a modern comedy staple (that and the fact that she always has solid stints hosting SNL). While I am not sure what to make of this, it probably just means that Feig is a more adept writer-director than his contemporaries that have directed McCarthy. \"Spy\" takes a while to pick up some steam. Going in, I was not excited at the idea of Jude Law being funny. I'm fine with serious actors taking a stab at comedy but something about Law always just strikes me as bland. So the first bit of the movie was only reaffirming my want to not be in the theater. It is not until Jason Statham appears on screen that I really started to laugh, and boy did I start. He steals just about every scene he enters and one of my biggest complaints about the film is that he isn't in it enough. Some might argue that's a good thing, it's better to leave the audience wanting more rather than leave them feeling like they got way too much. While this is normally true, I genuinely believe the movie would have greatly benefitted by giving him a few more standout moments. About halfway through the movie, McCarthy's character hits a turning point and we get to see that aggressive side of her that (under Feig's direction) leaves you rolling with laughter in your seat. She riffs off line after line of great, gruesome and off-the-wall insults to the characters surrounding her. Rose Byrne reaffirms that she is a comedy force to be reckoned with after her turns in \"Get Him to the Greek,\" Bridesmaids\" and \"Neighbors.\" She effectively plays the villain but there is a clever plot device that allows her to spend some buddy-buddy time with McCarthy and they play off each other so well. \"Spy\" is a little too long and it wears on you by the end. There is also a cameo from 50 Cent that didn't really play that well with me or my theater and perhaps that is mostly due to his somewhat recent decline in cultural relevance. I can't help but think his cameo would have been a huge deal in 2005, but realistically, he wouldn't have wanted to do a comedy cameo at the height of his career in 2005 anyway. The movie is far from perfect but it has plenty of laughs to justify seeing it in theaters.",

She had to deal with a lot of agency sexism which is nonsense since this isn't 1950. It portrayed male spouse as rude, stupid, and sexist and she put them in their places as she went. The female villainess was equally stupid and gullible. It has funny stuff in it but I think the social messages were overboard, and I am not a big fan of preachy movies.",

    "review": "  Spy is essentially a Melissa McCarthy action-comedy vehicle. Among her comedic peers, McCarthy is currently the reigning box-office draw. And it isn't hard to see why as she infuses the film with impressive physical and obvious verbal comedy. The most attractive part of Spy for audiences is the cast: McCarthy is clearly the star, but her supporting cast is strong as well. (1) Rose Byrne plays the Bulgarian villainess; Byrne is currently doing many comedic/silly films in order to soften her image (which is a result from the Damages TV Series) and she seems to be achieving success. (2) Jason Statham plays an over-the-top rogue who is as intense as he is clueless; it is a nice change of pace for the action film vet. (3) Finally, long-time character actress Allison Janney virtually steals the show from her co-stars as the wise-cracking CIA boss. Due to the strong script from writer-director Paul Feig, Spy is a character-driven comedy first and a plot driven comedy second. In other words, the comedy comes before the action and the result is lots of laughs.",

Embarrassed because Melissa McCarthy has been very funny in other movies I've seen and enjoyed. I should not have been reluctant to see Spy but I was. Maybe I'm a little sexist but it looks like I'll be seeing whatever movies she's in for the foreseeable future. I feel like I owe her that for how much I enjoyed Spy.That said Spy is the funniest movie I've seen in years. Not ha ha humor or chuckle humor but belly laugh falling out of your chair laughter. I would put this movie with the best of Mel Brooks, the Naked Gun movies and Airplane. That's right, I said it. Melissa McCarthy plays her part absolutely perfectly. She never descends into buffoonery and she's always able to laugh at herself but her character is always able to rise above.I know no one's going to read this but if one person does and goes to see Spy because of my review then you're welcome.",

    "review": "  Melissa McCarthy is comedic gold and she once again proves that she is best suited to Paul Feig's direction. Spy is an outrageously funny spy thriller. Jason Statham also returns to his comedic roots and is a surprisingly welcome addition to the screen. The pairing of Rose Byrne and Melissa McCarthy is a match made in heaven. Spy is certainly the funniest movie of the summer.",

She is agent Bradley Fine's (Law's) eyes and ears. Think James Bond - and she has a wild crush on him. He doesn't know it.An atomic bomb has been stolen and Fine is sent to retrieve it. But, it's a set up and Fine is killed - as Cooper watches helpless from the main office. Their boss (Allison Janney) knows that the top agents' identities have all been compromised. She needs an unknown. Cooper asks for the assignment - Ford (Jason Statham), a hot-headed agent refuses to hide, and goes rogue, seeking revenge.Cooper ends up with the assignment \"to watch and track\" only. Ford hinders her movements while Cooper tries to find the woman who killed Fine. What she gets mixed up seems over her head: spies, double agents, and weapon sellers (bitchy and witchy played by Rose Byrne).Brilliant comedy. We continued laughing long after the joke was told. This is a must see.Fieg is well known in Hollywood.

    "review": "  Entertaining, enjoyable and highly unpredictable, \"Spy\" is a rare comedy that offers consistent laughs from start to finish. Although the plot may seem familiar on paper, it is filled with enough twists and turns that keep the audience at the edge of their seat. When it comes to acting, each and every star is perfectly cast in their role. Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham and Rose Byrne are all hilarious to watch, simply irreplaceable in their roles. Statham, in particular, proves to have a gift and knack for comedy. An actor mostly known for action blockbusters, he reveals unique talents in this film that prove he's more than just an action-hero. McCarthy, on the other hand, carries the film with her sharp humor and perfect sense of comedic timing. Despite these unforgettable performances, however, the film is let down by nonsensical twists towards the second half. Also, some jokes fall flat mainly due to their 'disgust' factor. Nevertheless, this is a comedy that's worth watching alone for one of the funniest performances that Melissa McCarthy has ever given.",

If your still reading I'l continue, the characters meshed well together, the connection between them was realistic and engaging, the special effects were on point and the simmered down slower \"matrix\" type fight scenes were exciting and somewhat realistic. The screen play was also exceptional and surprisingly interesting. I look forward to seeing this movie again and even more, I'm waiting for a series of these movies with the same cast with guest appearances by other funny and not usually funny actors like Jason to appear. He was fantastic and so were the other players. While your watching try and catch some of the remarks that Melissa is making, that was the icing on the cake, pardon the pun regarding baked sweets.",

While Miranda Hart, playing a version of herself (no stretch there), doesn't make you wince watching her \"act\", it is more surprising to find Jason Statham and Rose Bryne being able to not only make fun of themselves but also to deliver comedic lines with great timing . But MVP here is writer-director, Paul Feig, who balances action with comedy with skills aplomb. The narrative is not exactly original or unpredictable but played straight as a Bond spoof, it dissects the genre and plays up its pomposity and ridiculousness with plenty of details and nuances that would impress any Bond or spy film aficionados. It certainly gives me great hopes that the female Ghostbusters reboot might stand a chance in succeeding in Feig and McCarthy's hands.",

    "review": "  THE WOMAN WITH THE GOLDEN CHARM - My Review of SPY (3 1/2 Stars)Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy are kind of having a moment right now. Perfectly matched as director/writer and actor respectively, this Dream Team delivered big laughs in both BRIDESMAIDS and THE HEAT. With SPY, the don't disappoint, in fact, they've added some terrific filmmaking to their repertoire. SPY plays like a Bond film, but with McCarthy's brand of outrageous, fearless and funny underdog added to the recipe. What I love about all three films are those extended diversions from the main story, where characters get stuck on a minor detail, effectively stopping the plot for a few delicious moments. It's something Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder excelled at in the 70s and it's in almost every scene in SPY. The opening sequence is a killer, with McCarthy's Agent Susan Cooper talking into Bond substitute Bradley Fine's ear. He's played by a very game Jude Law, who clearly enjoys towing the line between suave and douchey, sometimes within a single line of dialogue. I could have watched McCarthy be his office bound eyes and ears for the entire film, but there's that pesky thing called a story to tell. After a crazy inciting incident, the plot mechanics dictate that poor, put-upon Susan needs to get out into the field to help solve a crime. With her assistant Nancy in place, played by the extremely entertaining Miranda Hart, Susan receives a dumpy undercover assignment from her tough-as-nails boss, the always reliable Allison Janney. After a very funny gadget scene in which Susan and Nancy geek out hilariously over the oddly disappointing tools at their disposal, off we jet to Paris. It's the dark, seedy underbelly of Paris, so don't expect glamour. Besides, McCarthy settling into her \"crime scene\" hotel room is better than a tour of the Louvre. Feig's script does a wonderful job setting up Susan's character, with McCarthy bringing just the right amount of pathos and confidence to the material. It's so easy to fall in love with her, because she clearly has great detective skills and refuses to let anybody box her into a corner. At some point, a spy thriller needs its super-villain, and Rose Byrne fills those 6-inch stilettos perfectly as Rayna Boyanov, a condescending, rude, big-haired monster. Byrne has become a bit of a comedy secret weapon after years of honing her dramatic skills, and here she steals every scene she's in, sometimes with just a sneer. Watch for her response to a toast, and you'll feel you've gotten your money's worth from that moment alone. With BRIDESMAIDS, THE NEIGHBORS and now this film, Byrne has proven she can take a stock role and turn it into gold. Also along for the ride is a surprisingly funny Jason Statham as a shadow agent who continuously insinuates himself into McCarthy's investigation. His lines aren't the funniest, and truth be told, it becomes a little one note, but I enjoyed how much he threw himself into it, especially the end credits tag. Sure, SPY brings the laughs, although I could have done without 50 Cent's awkward, unfunny extended cameo, but the surprise here is the thrill of the action sequences. Feig directs these with such muscle and gusto, I wanted to applaud. Whether it's a chase scene through the streets or an epic kitchen fight using knives and pots and pans, Feig understands kinetics and momentum, which is rare in a comedy director. It's exciting to see a writer/director with one type of talent stretch and excel at another. Underneath this 007 splendor is a message of female empowerment and bonding, something usually lacking in Bond's universe. SPY takes back the night and makes you root for women in a way that feels exhilarating. That's no small feat for a dopey comedy.",

    "review": "  Melissa McCarthy's meteoric comedic rise hasn't been without its missteps, mainly the complaint that she seems stuck in a rut playing aggressively weird and foul-mouthed characters that are growing tiresome. McCarthy is never better than when teamed with her Bridesmaids' director Paul Feig, and Spy is a welcomed return to form for a great comic actress who relishes being outlandish. The best part of the film is that it's a character-centric comedy, with McCarthy as Susan Cooper, a CIA agent who works as a handler, the voice on the other end of the earpiece, guiding her partner the handsome Agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). When Fine is compromised on a mission, Susan unexpectedly finds herself in the field to track down some very bad people. McCarthy does get to be vulgar, but fortunately it's only one persona she adopts as a mask, and it's cleverly utilized. Feig's screenplay makes sure to find different comic beats as it goes, rarely repeating itself and, like any good action movie, finding twists to further develop conflicts. Part of what's so enjoyable about Spy is how comic scenarios will evolve while staying true to the characters and the central conflict. Also, Feig acquits himself more than well with the film's semi-slick action photography. The supporting cast is nicely tied into the story and matter and each actor has material to cut loose, none more than Jason Statham (The Expendables) as a hilariously boastful and incredulous agent. His boisterous chest-beating about his past deeds are some of the film's funniest moments. Consistently funny, witty, and mildly progressive with its heroine, Spy is a vehicle that makes perfect use of McCarthy's talents and then some. Nate's Grade: B+",

    "review": "  Movie SpyI don't believe that it would be a spoiler alert if I said the violence was gratuitous, graphic, and realistic. The fights were like watching replays of sports injury plays, in close up slow motion. . All the violence in the movie added much entertainment value to those who find bone crushing entertaining or the entry of bullets and knifes into the human body educational, strictly from a medical standpoint of course. Three stooges fans will recognize and maybe enjoy the many stooges routines used in the fight scenes. The only difference is the fight scene was the last scene for many of the performers.I think it's ok if I reveal that the writers we're going for a record number of \"F\" bombs in the movie, and they succeeded. You might enjoy counting them to see if I'm right. you may find the volume of them unnecessary to the plot as I do, and counting them could add to the entertainment value of the movie.But the line in the movie that disturbed me the most, and this may be considered a spoiler alert, was a scene where the main character ask one of the villains of the movie if she was texting while they were talking. The response was: \"no, I'm playing candy crush and I made it to level 75\". This line didn't scared me because adults watching the movie understood the humor of the line but that they identified with the speaker of the line. It brought chills to my spine. Why \"horror\" wasn't added to the movie classification is beyond me.",

Don't get me wrong, it was funny and downright hilarious when it was on, but the movie focused a bit too heavily on the action for me when comparing it to other comedies in its calibur (most notably 22 Jump Street), but jumping back and taking it in in the big picture, it is a very well done film! The action is done very, very well and is comparable to other action films of recent. McCarthy also showcases her acting talents tenfold by playing such a dynamic character! We see the McCarthy that made us fall in love with her in Mike & Molly, the McCarthy that shocked us all in Bridesmaids, and the McCarthy that badmouthed her way alongside the sweetheart Sandra Bullock in The Heat all in one film! And her transitions between the three types of characters was done so well, it was almost scary! McCarthy isn't the only actor/actress on her A-game in this movie. Jason Statham, Rose Byrne, and Miranda Hart steal the scenes more often than not. The plot is nothing incredibly new, but it has heart to it. Definitely worth seeing!",

    "review": "  Just saw this today. It starts out a little slow, had me worried, but then it picks up steam, and it gets gets really good and very funny. The cast is right on! McCarthy is at her best! I likes her in The Heat with Bullock, but I would say this is her best movie to date that she was the lead in. She was great in her supporting roll in bridesmaid, but she is the star and carries the movie with no problems. The rest of the cast is great as well. Great story, with twist and turns, well written. Hoping that there will be a sequel! Rated R for good reasons, although a very funny movie, don't take your kids to see it. Adult humor only!",

In fact,I watched the movie between my fingers while simultaneously hiding behind the seat infront of me. So with the new movie choices last weekend of \"Jurassic World\" and \"Spy\", it wasa no-brainer that I was heading to the latter starring Melissa McCarthy.It was mindless fun but boy is she getting type-cast as this oversized, rough around the edgescomedic tough girl. It really worked in \"Heat\" with Sandra Bullock, but now is really starting toget tiring the 3rd/4th time around. Actually, was quite refreshing seeing her as a sincere,single Mom in \"St. Vincent\" last year.Hey the movie was fun and forgettable. Maybe more shocked by the pretty course language whichdrove the movie to R. Not sure the strategy behind that move, yet the theatre was decently full(probably because Jurassic World was sold out). Small character actor pieces played by Jude Law, JasonStatham, Allison Janney and Bobby Cannavale was impressive in terms of A- list actors.I'm sure this movie will do fine in the box office but this young lady needs to recast herself.Also the 1st 10 minutes was so \"James Bond-ish\"...I'm thinking ..hello lawsuit.No need to tell the story. If you need to escape to the theaters while chuckling and yawning duringthe same film, \"Spy\" will work for you on the big screen or Netflix or streamed",

    "review": "  Spy is an action comedy starring Melissa McCarthy and Jason Statham and it does a pretty damn good job at blending comedy with action. The action scenes were entertaining and accompanied with some subtle comedy as well as some over the top comedy it really made the last 3/4 of this film fun. The first 15-20 minutes wasn't that great, it was setting up characters and the main plot, and although it had a few laughs, it was quickly losing my interest. And there were one or two more times where it was showing signs of losing it but in comes Jason Statham to save the day because he was by far the highlight of this film. Who knew an action star would be the funniest aspect of a Melissa McCarthy led comedy film. I personally am not a giant fan of her but she has proved to be able to carry a film with her comedy before, so i was surprised when Statham completely stole the show time and time again. As for the plot it was a fun ride, there were times where it got a little silly but overall i was engaged in what was going and they did a good job. One issue with the plot is that similar to 'Focus' there were just too many twists, they were doing a good job at keeping me interested without the twists and the constant surprises got a little dumb but it's just a fairly minor flaw.The performances were, almost, all good and although the characters were a little cartoony the film was aware of that so it made it ok. Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham, Rose Byrne, they all did a good job and were pretty funny but man, Miranda Hart's her character was just not good at all. Whenever she was in the film i wanted her out as soon as possible, and she kept on showing up making me sigh every time, her character was way too over the top and not funny at all, could have definitely done without her, in terms of comedy. In the end it has its fair share of action and comedy and an interesting plot after the first 15 minutes, so you can have a pretty fun time watching this film. - 7.6",

I don't think the movie would of been half as effective or funny if it was PG-13, the language and dirty sexual references never get old and made me laugh. Obviously that humour is a personal preference and acquired taste. Melissa shined in this movie. I would say it's right up there with \"Identity Thief\" and \"Bridesmaids\" as one of her best. Rose Byrne, Jude Law, Allison Janney and Jason Statham (looking hot as usual) are all great additions. I liked that they used Melissa's character as a woman empowering role. Normally the men are the hero's, she really turns it around. I laughed out loud many times throughout it.

    "review": "  Spy is a very entertaining and slightly original take on spies in a humorous way that isn't Austin Powers-y.Spy stars Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham and Rose Byrne and is directed by Paul Feig, This movie stands out in more than just its comedy, but also its action and plot. The plot focuses on McCarthy's character Susan Cooper who is a CIA computer scientists that aids agents in the field from her desk. She is then called to action to track down an arms deal where Rose Byrne's character, Raina Boyanov, is selling a nuclear bomb to De Luca, a wealthy businessman. The great thing about this film is Melissa McCarthy, which is honestly a surprise since audiences have grown less and less fond of the same old character that McCarthy plays, but in this movie she shines as an accomplished comedian that really makes your stomach hurt from laughter. Her improv is absolutely fantastic in this movie when her character grows from being a timid desk worker to a much more confident and ruthless agent that really brings home the insults. Jason Statham also shines in the movie and really steals the scenes that he is in. His character, Rick Ford, is very much a spoof of the multiple badass characters that Statham plays in his other action movies. This is really really well done and Statham shows that even he can make fun of how outlandishly unrealistic some of his action movies are when Rick Ford goes on his long monologue about all the insane and dangerous things he has done in the field, such as reattaching a limb to his body. But the real star of this film is Paul Feig. Feig really presents his well-done action scenes really well, and this could even be seen as an audition tape for Feig to do action movies, because the guy can really do action well. His timing for shots for comedy are also spot on and with the help of McCarthy's wonderful improv lines, they are really able to work off each other in a very fun and entertaining way. The homages and winks to other spy films, namely James Bond, are also a great addition to this movie that makes the movie that much more of what it is, a spy movie.The only reason I tick off a star for this movie is that the plot points and storyline of this film are very much taken from other spy films. The timid computer analyst that is suddenly brought into the field is reminiscent of Get Smart, and the whole nuclear bomb mission scenario is very generic and almost uninteresting, but the way the movie presents the problem and the road to the end of the mission is very fun and interesting, and leaves room for a sequel which I am looking forward to.",

Great supporting performances by Jude Law, Jason Statham and Rose Byrne. A little bit bizarre but you can cry laughing the whole movie. One of my favorite comedies. 5/5",

Melissa McCarthy plays the comedic timing of this movie perfectly with nuance and finesse. Miranda Hart and Jason Statham serve as almost the devil and angel on her shoulders, whispering the extremes of her potential character so that Melissa can find the middle ground effortlessly. The plot seems strangely fresh for a story told so many times before. The final act takes a bit of a dip but it's such a fun ride getting to that point that it doesn't seem to matter. I would highly recommend watching this movie.",

Forget Bridesmaids and The Heat. This is Paul Feig's most entertaining film to this date. It's full of broad yet smart jokes, has a wonderful cast, and is packed with pretty cool action sequences. Watch out for Jason Statham. He is killer funny. Spy is a crowd-pleaser at its best. It's brisk, well-paced, and offers a ton of belly laughs. It's one of the better mainstream films of 2015.",

But was surprised that this was very very funny! One of my biggest pet peeves in films is how the trailer always gives away the best parts of the action, plot points or in comedy, the funniest parts of the film. Luckily enough the trailer does not give away the funniest scenes. For me Jason Statham steals the film, he is hilarious in almost every scene, his over the top performance sits perfect in the film. McCarthy is brilliant and makes a decent action star, albeit a little awkward, the kitchen fight is highly enjoyable, as is her high speed 'chase' on a moped. One to definitely watch again and again.",

    "review": "  Melissa McCarthy is very funny. Given room to work has been both freeing and constricting for her career. In last year's Tammy, she was given plenty of room to work, with her husband behind the camera, but the results were frustrating to say the least. In Spy, she reteams with Bridesmaids director Paul Feig. Feig utilizes McCarty to the best of his abilities, as a dowdy CIA desk jockey, Susan Cooper. McCarthy plays awkward and unsure with uncanny timing.  As the film moves along, active CIA agents are uncovered by a spoiled rich girl with a mean streak named Raina (A coldly hilarious Rose Byrne). This forces Cooper into the field, armed with a dart-gun rape whistle, kitty sweater and a cavalcade of old lady wigs. The banter between McCarthy and Byrne is both a great strength and weakness. Many of the insane tangents McCarthy goes on, as she gains confidence as an agent, and the return quips from Byrne seem improvised and many are hilarious. As we progress through the action, those tangents begin to wear on you, until the hilariously outrageous becomes ok, let's move on. The same can be said at first for the hilarious tangents of Agent Ford (Jason Statham skewering his tough guy persona).  Spy picks up the slack with its physical humor. This is where McCarthy really excels. There are three great fight scenes/slapstick show cases that bring the belly laughs. Feig makes sure that the action, while hilarious, is still technically impressive. The plot is pretty standard action movie fare. The heroes are in pursuit of villains, who have stolen a nuclear bomb. The streamlined plot, is just enough to keep the audience interested, while giving McCarthy plenty of room to flex her comedy muscles. Along the way, Susan Cooper bursts out of the box her peers and society put her in. This plot point runs parallel with the actress who plays her. In Spy, McCarthy frees herself from her supporting actress role to full-fledged star. She brings the laughs. Feig supplies the thrills. With Spy, this winning duo has churned out a continuously funny and exiting piece of summer entertainment.",

    "review": "  I went to see this movie based almost entirely on the very positive reviews that riddle this website. The conclusion I reached as the credits mercifully rolled was that someone either in Melissa McCarthy's family or a group of Paul Feig's minions must have spent hours writing these reviews. This movie missed on almost every single level from beginning to end. The only genuine laugh it evoked was by a small and questionable cameo by rapper 50 Cent at the very end. The jokes were cliche and played out with the same, tired McCarthy \"fat girl\" spin that had everyone peeing their pants over Bridesmaids and somehow keeps her in starring roles. The overwhelming feeling that you had seen and heard everything from this movie before was too much to handle for most of this film and if it wasn't for Jason Statham acting as some much needed relief from McCarthy's whining I may have taken a prolonged trip to the bathroom. What caught my eye most of all was the complete over use of profanities by everybody in the cast. The only person that sounded remotely comfortable dropping strings of F-Bombs was Statham who really can be funny when he wants to be. Rose Byrne, McCarthy and Miranda Hart (who was DREADFUL) frequently utilized cringe-worthy tyrades of cursing in exchange for actual comedic dialogue. The bottom-line is the movie had potential to be funny in so many ways with a cast that had everyone in the theater ready to laugh and it fell flat on it's convoluted face. Not the face of the dashing Jude Law who was insignificant to not only the story but simply seemed disinterested in what was going on. I will now question very sincerely the reviews on this website as they are usually dependable. Something is either very wrong with the rating system or enough people are on the take because this movie shares very, very little redeeming qualities.  I don't even want my money back I think I just need to stay away from movie theaters for awhile.",

Just seeing Jason Statham make fun of his normal tough guy action hero role is worth the price of admission. This is one of those non stop hilarity movies that is somehow more fun to see in a theater where you can share laughs with an audience. Somehow suspending your disbelief at seeing Melissa McCarthy kick some dude's ass with her 200 lb body is not that much harder than it is for seeing Angelina Jolie do it with her 110 lb body.",

    "review": "  Easily the best headlining outing for Melissa McCarthy to date, Spy is an enjoyable, diverting romp. Its true strength is that it manages to avoid the low-brow depths one could expect in such a venture and turns out to be quite clever and sharply written. McCarthy herself surprised me in with some great deadpan humor and aptly timed crass, ridiculous, and quotable dialogue. Jude Law and Rose Byrne succeed in their self-concerned \"straight man\" roles and Jason Statham largely plays a caricature of himself to great effect. Most of the set pieces work and the violence is satisfyingly gory. Spy is similar to another R-rated espionage spoof that came out in 2015 - Kingsman: The Secret Service. But as where Kingsman was a brilliant, dark, and cruel send up of Roger Moore-era Bond movies, Spy is more warm-hearted and cute, once you get past the F-bombs and bloody head shots. There are few, if any true villains. We are here to watch idiots fight and curse at one another, and then laugh about it later. I am sure there is some context about the protagonist defying the expectations of her gender, weight, and lack of attractiveness, but I honestly didn't care. The fact that this movie wasn't a trainwreck was quite impressive and the fact that it's actually pretty fun is a miracle.",

    "review": "  Chris Rock flawlessly transitioned from years of stand-up television comedy to instant, overnight leading movie star in 2014's hilarious movie \"Top Five\". Could funny woman Melissa McCarthy make a similar move from television (\"Gilmore Girls\" and \"Mike & Molly\") to big screen headliner? We saw a glimpse of McCarthy's serious acting chops in last year's dramedy \"St Vincent\", a smashing movie performance opposite Bill Murray's eccentric character. Introduced to most of us in 2011's hilarious \"Bridesmaids\", the former high school cheerleader has since co-starred, but never held, the top billing in a comedy of her own. Until now. For \"Spy\", McCarthy carries this movie on her back using perfectly timed slapstick comedy and never taking herself or the film's lightweight plot too seriously. Teamed up once again with director Paul Feig (\"Bridesmaids\", \"The Heat\"), McCarthy returns to her comedy roots in this whimsical spoof on our Central Intelligence Agency's clandestine operations. As CIA analyst Susan Cooper, McCarthy ventures out into the undercover spook world in an attempt to thwart rogue arms dealers and protect her Langley associates. Nicely complimenting McCarthy's tongue-and-cheek humor is a tuxedoed Jude Law in a passable tribute to Her Majesty's 007. Fellow \"Bridesmaids\" cast member Rose Byrne ably rejoins McCarthy in \"Spy\" as the deadly daughter of a mob boss. But its former martial artist James Statham who easily earns the most laughs behind McCarthy once the final scorecard is tallied. Other crowd pleasers who bring smiles to viewers include former \"West Wing\" TV series' spokeswoman Allison Janney as the CIA's deputy director while Morena Baccarin, from Showtime's \"Homeland\" series (Mrs Jessica Brody), stars as a seductive CIA operative.Is \"Spy\" the funniest movie I've ever seen? No. Not by a longshot. But it does provide hysterical comparisons to the three stealthiest JB's in the undercover biz: James Bond, Jason Bourne and Jack Bauer. If you've enjoyed the Austin Powers' trilogy of spy parodies and can handle F-bombs tossed in every direction throughout, you'll find this film's physical comedy and witty presentation also agreeable. No one in Hollywood has a better comedic game right now than Melissa McCarthy. \"Spy\" works because McCarthy can deliver laughs with a simple look, deadpan line or uncomfortable run/walk. The \"Bridesmaids\" alumnus has effortlessly transformed herself from Emmy winning television comedian into a bona fide motion picture headliner. While her cousin Jenny McCarthy may get the most double-takes from magazine photos, it's this McCarthy that is sure-fire bet at the box office. Look for Melissa to continue her meteoric rise on the big screen well into 2016. Grade: B+",

    "review": "  \"Spy\" is the funniest film I've seen in a long time. It does to spy films what \"Shrek\" did to fairy tales. It turns conventions upside down, yet retains an entertaining and funny story. It starts by taking us down the conventional spy genre from the start. The first few minutes could easily be a James Bond movie with Jude Law in the role, but soon we are taken on a different path. When Melissa McCarthy is thrust into the field, we get surprised and delighted as she ends up being effective despite (or perhaps because of) her non-conformity to role expectations. The rest of the cast is also fantastic. Rose Byrne is great with her constant put downs. Miranda Hart is also terrific, especially in the second half of the film I could not take my eyes off her and found that she stole scenes with great one liners or even just funny mannerisms. Jason Statham was also delivering great lines in a comically dead pan voice. The most plaudits must however go to Paul Feig for managing to create a film that was hilarious yet also riveting through its many plot twists and action sequences. His writing was so brilliantly specific to each character, something that only heightened the comedy. There were also many occasions during the film when lines became inaudible due to the laughter of myself and the audience at a previous line or action. This is the kind of comedy you can watch over and over again because you probably missed many jokes during the movie. It also manages even to argue feminism while being hilarious! The dialogues are sharp and smart and the comedic timing is quite perfect. There characters have real chemistry. It is a bit predictable at some point, but that doesn't harm the movie. It's a movie that really works.",

    "review": "  Though it's not as much as a hoot as I hoped it would be, the swell performances from a great cast and solid jokes make Spy an entertaining and funny enough mainstream comedy. The entire cast is solid and flawlessly picked. Each character has a distinct and loud personality that allows for fun interactions between characters. They make the film very entertaining, each distinct and a welcome sight whenever they come on screen. Melissa McCarthy carries the film very well, creating someone who is as easy to care for as she is to laugh at/with. If I were to pick characters who I found to be highlights it would be difficult not to mention everyone.Spy's funnies are usually clever and well-thought out, never resorting to dumb gags and typical jokes. This means that even when the jokes aren't hilarious they don't fall on their faces, and when they work they work nicely. Funny scenes to me where one where McCarthy and Law's characters are having dinner together, as well as a scene where McCarthy and Hart's characters are at a table just talking. These scenes feature smart, witty dialogue, with the actors enhancing it through character and sometimes complex expressions and tones.Another highlight for me was when Statham's character listed the badass things he's done as a professional. He's surprisingly funny in the role.Most of the funnies also happened to be in the first half, which seems to be a trend in many comedies. After a while, the film recycles the kind of jokes it's making, and they become familiar and less effective. For example, the amount of \"You look like a ____\" jokes, despite often being clever, is excessive. One small character in the film plays off of the same joke the entire time. McCarthy and Byrne's characters develop a chemistry that didn't totally make sense to me based purely on insults. Paul Feig seems to have a thing with insults. He's not bad at them, but there's so many that the humor is less dynamic. Feig's action directing is given slightly more care than you might expect from the comedy director, mostly in that the action is very coherent and doesn't feel very cheated. The action includes a good number of funny scenes, but I'd say that overall the calmer scenes are the funnier ones. By the end, the film gets too wrapped up in its surprisingly complex plot. I actually didn't know what was going on, and was questioning why a comedy like this contained such a hard to understand story. There are so many traitors and sides that it's hard to who is fighting who and why. While this is going on, the movie contains less laughs than other parts, and I wasn't enjoying it all that much.In the end, the movie gets by nicely thanks to genuine laughs, consistent entertainment value, and a fun cast despite the oddly complex plot and sometimes repetitive jokes. A mostly satisfying comedy that will mostly satisfy audiences.",

    "review": "  Spy is one of the best comedies of 2015 so far. The film is just a giant spoof on spy films. This is probably one of the best performances that Melissa McCarthy has given since Bridesmaids. One person that I was surprised to see in this film was Jason Statham. This is something new for Jason Statham and once he was on screen he would steal every scene because his character was very funny. Paul Feig is starting to become one of my favorite comedy directors because he's probably the only one in Hollywood who makes great comedy films. I think everyone played there part well and the whole film wasn't just about Melissa McCarthy's character because when she's on screen in most of her movies she always steals the show but when there are different characters and are actually funny you actually have a great comedy film. Now in near the end of the film it started to lose some laughs which is the only negative part of the film. If your a fan of spy action films this is a film that you should check out or if your a fan of Melissa McCarthy you won't be disappointed. After seeing this film I'm really excited to see what Paul Feig will bring us with Ghostbusters 3.",

We've seen too many films that revolve around the same plot with A-List actors embarrassing themselves as brainless superspies that try to save the world. With this in mind, I was initially turned off by \"Spy\" and I honestly had no intention of seeing it, let alone spend the money to catch it in theatres. When the film debuted and it was met with stellar reviews, I changed my mind and gave it a shot. It was a worthwhile decision: Melissa McCarthy breaks away from the loud and obnoxious typecast just enough to present a hero who is strong, badass, and hilarious. Jude Law and Jason Statham back her up with witty humor and solid gags that give this film a refreshing charge. It is also wonderfully directed by Paul Feig, who really nails the action sequences while simultaneously maintaining good humor that doesn't wear out. I know that the success of this film will draw forward many other attempts to join the already dragging bandwagon, but I find it hard to believe that any of them will trump this one.",

    "review": "  Spy is everything this year's Hot Pursuit wished it was: a giant, female-centric, laugh-out-loud action comedy that's sprawling in its set-pieces, yet shining in its silliness. Through its physical comedy and unexpectedly cool combat scenes, it still manages to feel like a screwball comedy throwback with stellar verbal sparring between the great actors. So it's not groundbreaking like Mad Max: Fury Road, or mind-boggling like Ex Machina, but those aren't the goals. Spy will simply make you happy, nothing more, nothing less; and sometimes that's really enough.Much of that pure joy comes directly from the cast. From top to bottom, these gals and guys propel Spy to higher levels than movies of its kind often get. Everyone just seems to be having an absolute blast and that fun is contagious. Janney and Byrne stand out as solid and strong comedic presences. Hart and Statham steal every scene they are in, each playing with their own Hollywood identities to great effect. At the center of it all, McCarthy and Feig steer the ship swimmingly, often managing heartbreaking honesty and side-splitting hilarity all at once.This mixture can, at times, make the proceedings feel more \"cute\" than LOL funny, especially as the movie's somewhat-long runtime feels its length. However, as you settle into the world, you can't help but love the ways in which it takes the self-righteousness out of spy thrillers by highlighting the hilariously mundane minutiae. Will it change your world or even really challenge you intellectually? Not in the least, but it will undoubtedly make you laugh...a lot.",

There in nothing that happens in the spy part of the movie that you haven't already seen 1,000 times before, but the cast is superb, their comedic timing is flawless, and the action sequences are terrific and, in the case of McCarthy's fight scene in the kitchen with a young assassin, top-notch!",

This time the queen of comedy serve up a raucous riff on all things Bond as McCarthy dives into high stakes espionage and hilarity. McCarthy can be hit or miss lately. While Bridesmaids earned her a rare Oscar nomination for a comedic performance and Heat with Sandra Bullock struck gold at the Cineplex, her next outings - Identity Thief and Tammy - were reviled by critics and audiences alike. But back in Feig's hands, she is once again at the top of her game. As Susan Cooper, a bored analyst who watches the back of her dreamboat agent Jude Law, McCarthy pines for romance and adventure. She gets it when Law runs into trouble and her superiors send her in undercover. The laughs are plentiful and not just from McCarthy. Rose Byrne (Bridesmaids; Neighbors) crushes it as the evil arms dealing nemesis, Rayna Boyanov; Jason Statham sends up his tough guy image to great effect (has he ever acted better than this?); and Miranda Hart as McCarthy's eyes and ears is destined for a lot of plum supporting roles. With her English accent and drool timing, she is a blast and gets some of the best lines. It's a hard R-rated funfest with even Allison Janney getting to utter lines like \"Thanks for the through intel on Rayna, Susan. But in the future could you refrain from using the phrase 'thunder c**t' in official reports?\" Looking forward to Feig's next effort, the all-girl re-launch of Ghostbusters with McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and SNL's Kate McKinnon and Cecily Strong.",

As CIA agent Susan Cooper, finally getting a chance to wade into the danger zone after years at Langley assisting a handsome spy (a lovably goofy Jude Law), McCarthy nails every laugh, and she does by not being a cheap idiot for laughs. Susan is fully capable of taking down bad guys (including a supremely droll and outrageously funny Rose Byrne as a Bulgarian nuclear arms dealer) and make converts of ultra macho agents like Jason Statham. Susan, who looks like 'someone's homophobic aunt' has long been sold short by her boss (Allison Janney). And McCarthy, who doesn't fit into the typical narrow idea of Hollywood glamour, knows from what she's playing, and she has the last laugh on her critics.In Spy, McCarthy is reunited with the great Paul Feig, who directed her to an Oscar nomination in 2011's Bridesmaids and box-office gold in 2013's The Heat. They make a dynamite combo, with Feig's script bursting with tasty zingers and feminist subtext. As Susan hops all over the globe---Paris, Rome, Budapest--to spy on Al Qaeda-linked terrorist Sergio De Luca (Bobby Cannavale), you get to see her let loose. She's on her own until her office BFF, the excellent Miranda Hart of tv's Call The Midwife, joins up with her to be the Bond girl to her Bond.None of the jokes or the plot should be spoiled, except to say it's filled with hot R-rated action and great raunch. All of it is incredibly entertaining, from Susan's makeovers (going frumpy to fab), to the wickedly fun weapons she has disguised as stool softeners and hemorrhoid patches. And the supporting cast meets her every move. The byplay between McCarthy and Byrne is pure deliciousness. Both have pitch-perfect comic timing. But overall, it's pure pleasure watching McCarthy come out blazing with a hilarious character that cuts to the heart. She's irresistible and unforgettable. As is the movie.",

It does give good laughs Id say abit less than Bridesmaids and I also expected more Jason Statham and actually expect him to kick some ass instead of McCarthy, never the less this was a very good of what seems to be the first of a few \"Spy\" movies",

    "review": "  Spy isn't just a funny movie, it's good. Melissa McCarthy leads a powerhouse cast in a comedic take on CIA spies. Every one of these actors worked so well together and with stand-out performances by supporting cast members like Jason Statham, Bobby Cannavale, and the little known Miranda Hart, Spy was over-the-top hilarious. This is easily Paul Feig, and Melissa McCarthy's best pairing, and possibly McCarthy's best movie to date. The movie allowed McCarthy to be two take on two different personalities, which she did well. Make no mistake, I'm not saying she showed \"range,\" just that she was the best of two different characters she does in most movies. Honestly, if Spy could have been a touch shorter, I think it would have packed that much more punch, but that's the most I can criticize it. It's not often I see a movie and don't want to wait for it to come out on DVD to watch again. If you're a fan of McCarthy, a fan of comedies, this is a must see.",

    "review": "  Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy bringing their third comedy film together is another awesome combo of laughs and action. Feig's previous films were also surprisingly funny from Bridesmaids and The Heat, which McCarthy was in both of them. Spy is kind of a satire to the James Bond films; it even has a flashy montage of an opening credit sequence. Spy has enough humor and action to make it worth watching. Melissa McCarthy does have some fair comedy movies out there with some hit and misses. When she is teamed with director Paul Feig, they manage to bring enough humor for every scene. Jason Statham, Rose Byrne, Miranda Hart, and Jude Law all managed to have fun as well. Jason Statham also was funny, with his cocky arrogant attitude as one of the top agents Rick Ford. Statham has been stereotyped in most of his movies; this movie does show he would not disappoint doing a comedy movie. Spy is a good action comedy film that is vulgar, entertaining and has a great cast together.",

Jason Statham is a stand out but everyone is terrific, especially the writers..",
