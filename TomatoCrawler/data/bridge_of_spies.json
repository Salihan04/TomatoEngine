All the tubes and wires are impeccably arranged and placed, the science intact, but the feeling? Where is the dandelion pushing through the concrete of Spielberg's relentless planning? Only the scene of the spy plane shot down invigorates. I have to see Munich as I have heard he shines therein.",

    "review": "  If you have been waiting for Spielberg to make yet another fantastic film, look no further. \"Bridge of Spies\" delivers an extremely powerful (albeit straightforward) story following James Donovan (Tom Hanks), an attorney sent to dispatch a plane to Russia to take photographs. After it is shot down in mid air, the survivor of the plane is then in negotiations to be traded for a supposed Russian Spy they have in custody. With a few more complexions, this film is the perfect amount of smart, witty, and serious. Written by the Coen Brother, Steven Spielberg was able to get quite a bit of comedy out of these actors, while they simultaneously deliver sharp dialogue. Terrific performances, brilliant direction, a story definitely Spielberg worthy, and beautiful cinematography work. If you are a fan of this genre, it is not one to miss. I loved every second of \"Bridge of Spies\" and I cannot recommend it more. Although, it is definitely not for everyone. It is a bit lengthy, but the pace was perfect in my opinion. After thinking long and hard about what could have been a flaw or issue with this picture, I simply could not think of anything. \"Bridge of Spies\" is what filmmaking is all about.",

    "review": "  Bridge of Spies is a masterfully crafted Cold War drama from Steven Spielberg, one that perfectly blends thrills and a brilliant performance from Tom Hanks. The script is top notch and gives us characters we can cling to. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance steal the show with their brilliant performances. I was fully captivated by their performances. Spielberg also continues his legacy of being one of the greatest directors of all time. His work is simply a gift to always behold.",

    "review": "  Although it is a charm to watch given the Spielberg-Hanks reunion as well as a script which co-credits the Coen Brothers, BRIDGE OF SPIES proves to be an all-in-all solidly-made film that is entertaining and more or less satisfying, but unfortunately a piece that plays too safe to transcend. SPIES features some smart and masterful filmmaking - as evident in its strong visual storytelling, well-crafted one-on-one exchanges, and clever editing (some amazing match cuts as well as Spielberg and DP Kaminsky's usual soft, glowy lighting amidst beautiful end frames to precise camera moves) - in addition to a steady yet immersive performance by both Hanks and Rylance. However, the film lacks the much-desired impact upon its delivery of turning points; the narrative is fancied with surprisingly funny moments and pleasurable scenes but the plot becomes a bit too easy - the grip never holds on, the sense of danger never reaches its potential, and likewise the end result is not as powerful as it was building up to be (Hanks' character appears to negotiate his ways through obstruction that operates more on its bark than its bite; there is a Cold War level of fear that tags along as opposed to being imposed and infused - with a Spielberg staple, trademark sentimental music, that does little to help). In the end, taking into account the genre of Cold War spy drama/thrillers, Spielberg's latest is simply a solid entry that services quite well but falls short of greatness.",

    "review": "  T. HANKS FOR THE MEMORIES - My Review of BRIDGE OF SPIES (4 1/2 Stars)Due to poor marketing, a generic poster and forgettable title, I initially had no interest in seeing BRIDGE OF SPIES. It reeked of sup-bar Tom Clancy with dime store espionage. Little did I know it was based on a remarkably true Cold War story about an ordinary lawyer who brokered a hostage deal with the Soviets and East Germans. Additionally, when I discovered the Coen Brothers did a polish on the script, my interest was piqued just a little. Now that I've seen it, I can say it's one of Steven Spielberg's greatest accomplishments, a quietly suspenseful, beautifully acted and shot, twisting, turning yarn with quirky, specific characters and acute relevancy to current international politics. Tom Hanks, in full Jimmy Stewart Everyman mode and knocking it out of the park, plays James B. Donovan, an insurance attorney who is quietly asked by the Feds to perfunctorily represent a Soviet spy they've captured. The film opens on said spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance, giving an Oscar caliber performance) as he paints a self-portrait. It's a terrific opening shot, loaded with a wry sense of humor and multiple angles on the man to convey the layers to his character. There's no doubt from the outset that he is indeed a Russian spy, but it's the richness that follows which surprises. Soon, agents are pursuing him through the New York subway system in a bravura sequence of mounting tension, disorientation and stellar sound design. When Spielberg and his longtime collaborator, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, become engaged with material as rich as this, it's a pleasure to watch. Once captured, Donovan is asked to give the appearance of caring just enough so that the American Justice System looks good, but not enough to prevent Abel from the electric chair. Donovan, however, has more compassion than they expected. What follows is a story which stresses the importance of maintaining who we are or would love to be as a country by how we treat our prisoners. It's so easy in times of terrorism to go the way of Guantanamo Bay and torture our captives, but perhaps more important to maintain our ideals of justice rather than surrender to barbarism. Ultimately, the story involves a more well-known hostage, Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), an American pilot commissioned by the CIA to spy on Russia. His capture provides another thrilling sequence, this one in mid-air. Without spoiling too much, Donovan travels to East Berlin to quietly swap hostages without any official U.S. backing. Complicating matters is the fact that another American is captures by the East Germans just as the Berlin Wall is being erected.It's in the passage that I saw something new, and clearly Spielberg is all in as we witness the wall going up brick by brick as desperate people attempt to escape the oncoming horrors of life in the other side of that border. It's stunning and told with such assuredness and clarity. Another unexpected bonus is the humor in this film. Matt Charman, along with the Coens, keeps each character grounded in reality and adds such wonderful touches as Abel's cousin joyfully coming to beg for his release, Donovan's nagging cold throughout, and Abel's fantastically dry response of \"Would it help?\" whenever Donovan asks him to present himself a certain way. The relationship between Donovan and Abel is the heart of this film, and both actors rise to the occasion. Abel is deceptively still and on-the-surface, an enigma. Rylance, however, brings such quiet heart to Abel, that it's easy to see this potentially dangerous spy as just a man serving his country. This is a no-brainer supporting actor Oscar nominee if there ever was one, and deservedly so. Amy Ryan as Donovan's wife is straddled with the \"meanwhile back in the States scenes\" but she meshes really well with Hanks, giving such a vivid portrait of a late 50s/early 60s housewife on the verge of asserting herself more and more. The film is not without its flaws. Clearly scenes were cut between Donovan's assistant and daughter, whose secret affair must have meant something to a story about sneaking around, but obvious not enough to matter. There's enough there to leave one hanging, perhaps because their scenes carry a lot of the early exposition of the story. Also, even Spielberg at his best can turn syrupy and obvious at the end of his films, and this is no exception. SCHINDLER'S LIST, which I consider a masterpiece, suffered from Liam Neeson's breakdown scene. Here, we get a way-too-obvious comparison between the lives of wall-hopping East Germans and free Americans. It's not enough to derail the exceptional film that precedes it, and Spielberg and Co. are wise enough to provide a crawl of what happened to each character over this scene....so the on-the-nose nature of it is slightly diffused...a minor step in this nostalgic, uplifting, classically told, perfectly written film.",

    "review": "  A feel-good movie about unsung heroes in the 50s espionage Cold War. Tom Hanks is magical once again and Mark Rylance is thoroughly and quietly charming. Unfortunately roles for women are quite thin as Amy Ryan shares five minutes of screen time with not much to do. Overall, however, Bridge of Spies is a great story that recognizes these men who may not have had a chance to have their story told. Spielberg has fashioned a comfortably old-fashioned yarn that one can snuggle up with a pot of tea on a cold evening. Rating: 84",

    "review": "  An entertaining Bridge to the H'Wood studio days, this Spies game exemplifies Steven Spielberg at his treacly but satisfying best. The golden age of H'Wood are alive and well in the oeuvre of the maestro behind Jaws, E.T., and Jurassic Park, most noticeably in his latest brush with history, Bridge of Spies. Oh, this is not to say that his latest true story unintentionally comes across as old fashioned. Rather, the legendary director purposely exhibits an old-school approach to storytelling and workmanship that brings to mind the days of John Ford (The Grapes of Wrath, The Searchers), William Wyler (The Best Years of Our Lives, Ben-Hur), and - most of all - Frank Capra (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. It's a Wonderful Life). There's his assured use of Steadicam sweeps and close-ups, as well as a celebrated leading man who radiates both trustworthiness and nationalism. Just look at the film's poster: the giant mug of American hero Hanks caught between the stars and stripes and hammer and sickle, grandstanding the values of life and liberty before the opening credits have even rolled. This process serves him well with a Cold War tale such as this but it also plays it a little too safe. As beautiful and striking as this sentimental film looks, it plays out too predictably, which takes some of the punch out of the more suspenseful moments.In this PG-13-rated thriller based on true events, an American lawyer (Hanks) gets recruited by the CIA during the Cold War to help rescue a pilot (Austin Stowell) detained in the Soviet Union. Calculatedly, the film feels like a family friendly product of the era that it represents, which is laudable on many fronts save for the multiple somewhat heavy-handed endings. For the auteur who chose to chronicle such a specific warts and all bent in the life of the 16th U.S. president with Lincoln, however, his Bridge of Spies ultimately comes across as lighter fare. With a reliably stalwart performance by Hanks, a knock-out turn by stage veteran Rylance as a captured Soviet spy, and quotable dialogue provided by the Coen Brothers, this throwback boasts enough winning moments of distinction that make it stand tall even in a familiar line-up. Bottom line: Spies Like U.S.",

    "review": "  Steven Spielberg once again proves he can do no wrong, especially with real world material. Following the grand traditions of Amistad and Munich, Bridge of Spies is an incredibly fine, concise and versatile Cold War drama/thriller. With an impressively written script contributed oddly by the two and only Cohen Brothers, add to that under Spielberg's bold direction the film shines as one of his most finest films to date. Another big credit added towards the casting, with another impressive collaboration with Tom Hanks (making this their third collaboration), alongside the likes of other incredibly talented actors, particularly Mark Rylance (soon to be in Spielberg's BFG next year), and the gorgeously looking cinematography. The film itself, also tells it's story really well with minimal music by Thomas Newman, making this the third Spielberg film to be scored without John Williams. Overall, the film really challenges the rights of prisoners and country's laws and constitution in a time of great conflict where almost anything could happen. Lastly, it's a highly recommended film in which it's Oscar changes might be big.",

    "review": "  Bridge of Spies is a Cold War thriller that is as subtle and understated as most of its characters. The narrative tells the little known backstory of Soviet KGB spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and his defense by American lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) against the wishes of an unforgiving public mood. Later, we see Donovan in East Berlin successfully negotiating his exchange with captured U2 pilot Gary Powers and an American student imprisoned by the East German Stasi. Bridge has fairly average direction and Tom Hanks largely plays himself as is his habit, but then again that's the advantage of being a national treasure. Spielberg and Hanks can give in rather perfunctory work and it will stand out above many others simply by default. I'd argue that Mark Rylance is the true gem of the picture and his simple, quotable dialogue, weary but observant expressions, and stoic demeanor make him the most memorable element. That and it features a fairly strong script written by the Coen Brothers. In summation, Bridge of Spies fails to reinvent the genre but it didn't need to - it tells a story more Americans and Russians need to learn and it tells it well.",

Some of his usual sentimentalism is on display but it's mostly kept in check by the screenplay (no doubt due to the Coen's involvement) and the tight pacing that never lingers too long on emotional moments. If this performance doesn't solidify Hanks as our generations Henry Fonda than I don't know what will.",

    "review": "  \"Aren't you worried?\" \"Would it help?\"Gripping, thrilling and enjoyable, Bridge of Spies is a brilliant old-school Cold War spy thriller which benefits from powerful direction, top-notch performances and a story of friendship, personal values and determination. With a fascinating story and an overall visual style that brings back the classical spy-thriller film-making of previous decades, the movie is a most welcome return to the genre roots while it remains incredibly up-to-date despite a topic which could be considered nowadays far from being modern. Based on the true story of James Donovan (Tom Hanks) and his memoirs, Bridge of Spies tells the most curious events surrounding the conviction of the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and the following negotiations exchange which take place in East Berlin. It is not only a story of incredibly interesting events, but also a clash of values, of personal integrity and reflection of a period when values and constitutional rights were challenged. To the great delight of all viewers Steven Spielberg has returned with a flawless delivery that combines convincing cinematography, sober, but impactful visuals, amazingly convincing performances and of course a story that even though it is well know, still contains enough twists to keep you fully engaged. Without further spoiling what is all about, I would only say that Bridge of Spies has \"Oscar Awards\" written all over it. With 6 nominations, among which for Best Motion Picture, for Best Supporting Actor of Mark Rylance and Best Screenplay of the Ethan and Joel Cohen, this spy-thriller might not be a big winner (due to its earlier release date), but it could already be considered a contemporary classic ! A must see movie !",

Questo lungometraggio ricade in questa categoria che di anno in anno diventa sempre pi� lunga. La prima parte � incentrata solo sul processo e serve a contornare i personaggi, peccato che duri il doppio di quanto servirebbe. Il resto � un po' meglio ma rimane sempre un po' moscio.",

    "review": "  No other American director has made more movies audiences have billed as \"just plain good\" more often than Steven Spielberg, who, for his decades long career, has managed to warm our hearts, move our souls, make our eyes misty, thrill us, tease us, like a storyteller who can transport us into a different dimension with the snap of a finger. Like Hitchcock, simply hearing his name is enough to evoke a certain emotion, which, in most cases, is a feeling of home, of sentimentality, at least when putting such classics as \"Jaws,\" \"E.T.,\" \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" and \"Jurassic Park\" into perspective.  But more recently has he begun to focus on more humanistic issues, covering and bringing to life (sometimes more vividly than we'd like) such issues as the Holocaust (\"Schindler's List\"), war (\"Saving Private Ryan\"), and even the Munich massacre (\"Munich\"). Clearly, Spielberg is one enamored with the idea of making a movie out of dramatic events of days past - some stories are meant to be told and heard on an international level, but deserve to be helmed in a way that provides them with the justice they so unmistakably warrant. Spielberg, time and time again, does a magnificent job of retelling real life events with theatric suppleness while still making a certain story more than just a story: a miraculous sense of importance is left intact. So I was surprised by \"Bridge of Spies,\" which is well-made, well-acted, well-directed, and well-shot, but is ultimately more textbook interesting than it is cinematically engaging. With a lack of dramatic haul, it has the wow factor of a documentary but not the heart-thumping majesty of \"Argo.\" Everything told is so inevitable, so unsurprising, that we are left notably impressed by the bravery of its central figure but never moved by the story. It's a tale of heroism without any twists and turns. As suggested earlier, \"Bridge of Spies's\" events would, perhaps, be more investing when captured within the walls of a documentary setting, where things are supposed to be predictable (though compelling) from the beginning. The film, set in 1957 at the height of the Cold War, stars Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan, a relatively small-time lawyer (he mostly specializes in insurance settlements) given the difficult task of defending Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), a Soviet accused by the American government of being a KGB spy. Donovan isn't so convinced that this is necessarily the truth - everyone involved in the case is predisposed from the beginning - and so he fights to at least get the man out from under the umbrella of death row, which he successfully (though controversially) does. But the plot thickens when Francis Powers (Austin Stowell), a CIA pilot, is shot down by the Soviet Union mid-flight and is soon captured, and when Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), an American student studying in Germany, is arrested for espionage by government officials after causing a tumult during the building of the Berlin Wall. In response, Donovan is proposed with the unthinkable - what if a trade is made, America giving Abel back to his home country, Powers back to the U.S.? It is an interesting proposition only to increase dramatically in its intensity after Pryor becomes part of the deal. Sent to negotiate with East German and USSR officials, Donovan overcomes his humble roots and does the extraordinary. At a time where most Oscar nominees seem to be relatively feral and imaginative (just look at \"The Revenant\" and \"Mad Max: Fury Road\"), \"Bridge of Spies\" seems conventional and safe, told with a traditional and old-fashioned flair that leaves it easy to look at and understand but sometimes insipid to watch due to its lack of any real suspense or stylistic risk. It is beautiful to gaze upon, though: the camerawork is glossy, reminiscent of Old Hollywood, and Spielberg conjures the iconic allure of a forgotten era. Hanks is a dependable leading man, trustworthy and strong, and Rylance is very good as the quirky Abel. But \"Bridge of Spies\" languishes from the fact that it never packs any punches - we wait for something jaw-dropping to occur to leave us emotionally stunted, but nothing ever does. We're affected by its story yet never dazzled by it; it sits there flatly as we wonder if it will ever become larger-than-life. A striking true story it is. I'm just not so sure big-budget, Hollywood treatment was necessarily the right place to go.",

I'm always interested in films that are based on a historical event and I like getting the idea of what it was like during that time, which is how you're supposed to feel. Everyone delivered fantastic performances, but Mark Rylance was absolutely phenomenal. He made you feel for that character and what he was going through, which makes it even more effective when you realize that he's portraying a real person. The film is also wonderfully shot. Steven Spielberg really wants you to feel like you're in the scene, as he does with a lot of his other films. My overall enjoyment of the film was not what I wanted it to be. Negotiations that are portrayed in film does not interest me that much, and this film is all about that subject matter, though I acknowledge that it is done very well. There is also a lot of political dialogue that made it a little difficult to follow, at least for a first viewing. If you can get the plot of the film, you will follow it better. I expect that some people would be really bored by this film, which is understandable, it's not for everyone. Bridge of Spies is not one of my favorite Spielberg movies, or even one of my favorite movies of the year. But Spielberg's directing and the actors' performances made me enjoy it enough. It's one of those movies where I liked it, but I wouldn't really want to see it again.",

Post WWII/Early Cold War espionage is brought dazzlingly back to life as New York insurance attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is elected by US Government officials to defend a captured Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). A gesture made more for illusion of justice in a time of fear and propaganda. A move that comes at a personal cost to Donovan and soon finds him drawn into larger events that pull him from the heated halls of American justice into the freezing streets of a Berlin embroiled in political strife at the inception of the Berlin Wall.Steven Spielberg recalls for us his ability to wring tension out of what might have passed quietly below our radars in less capable hands. Making momentous of the minuscule. Tom Hanks turns a performance that should surprise no one, with Mark Rylance filling in the gaps with disarming quirk and poignance. Matt Charman's scripting is as tight as a drum, likely due in part to the involvement of Joel and Ethan Coen working beside him. Regardless of palate, \"Bridge of Spies\" is not to be missed.",

Slow-moving, inattentive, and insignificant, Bridge of Spies doesn't live up to any of the excitement or intrigue that was promised. I do not wish to imply it was a poorly made movie, it was just very beige. Hanks did what Hanks does. Spielberg did what Spielberg was. It was a decent film but it will quickly be forgotten.",

Great acting, great settings, some great dialogue, but stilted pacing and storytelling.

    "review": "  'Bridge of Spies' illustrates how emotions, in a realistic way, can overrun basic moral & human rights. It's much more than a drama. It got a nuanced story where both characters & nations are told from different perspectives. It might even be one of Spielberg's finest -- and it got a clever way of presenting the never ending theme of morality. Basic values of human life(s) & the everlasting stagnation of war through \"growing walls rather than people\", are present traits of Spielberg. Tom Hanks continues to outperform, he deliver a very relatable James Donovan. He could have had more maturing, & it's not a film for the drama-hater, but there isn't that much more to criticize about. Well written dialogs are on the other side shockingly character fitting, & the metaphoric images throughout the film only strengthens Spielberg's position among today's filmmakers.Personal rating: 78/100Critical rating: 96/100",

    "review": "  ***** ExcellentMaster auteur Steven Spielberg's latest movie \"Bridge of Spies\" is not falling down, not falling down, not falling down. OK, I think my Bridge of Puns is nearly extinguishing you from further reading. But please continue to read for puns' sake. This 1950's true story film adaptation stars the splendiferous Tom Hanks as insurance lawyer James Donovan who inexplicably is delegated to defend arraigned Russian spy Rudolf Abel, exceptionally & subtlety played by Mark Rylance. Donovan is conflicted on defending a Russian spy and all the negative publicity it will receive; and not to mention how it will affect his family. Spielberg once again puts on the genius directorial cap with his intelligent direction of a Steven flick; and there are no bridge of lies with that statement. Another truth you have to handle is that Tom Hanks keeps on putting up strong work; he captivates with his starring performance as Donovan. But it is Rylance here who is the master thespian of the movie, and you can rely on that. Would you want me to add more on the movie? Would it help? But a few tidbits I will add: loved Thomas Newman's score of the picture and the solid screenplay from Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman. That's all I have to say about this movie. In other words, I would rather not be a spoiler spy and let you cross the rest of the \"Bridge of Spies\".",

    "review": "  Steven Spielberg's 2015 effort, Bridge of Spies, displays the veteran director's best film in a decade. Written by Mark Charman and the Coen Brothers, the plot depicts the United States' frosty relationship with the prominent nations that (unofficially) participated in The Cold War and when spies from both opposing countries are caught, we see efforts to go about the diplomatic way to solve things. Part drama, part thriller-the script has the perfect tone to be light-hearted enough when it needs to, while also packing a very humane level of drama. The skill on display from a technical standpoint is one of the films many strong suits-be it the cinematography from Janusz Kaminski or the production design from Adam Stockhausen-that will have the film stick with you like a spy following a target. In a story featuring spies and courtroom bias, Spielberg alum Tom Hanks (on their fourth collaboration) evokes the good-natured enthusiasm the filmmaker is known for. Spielberg-famous (or infamous)-for being able to make even the darkest subject matter have an optimistic outlook directs the film with the perfect balance of intrigue, gravitas and entertainment, crafting a very acquainted, yet fulfilling film experience",

    "review": "  Spy thrillers. You're either going to dig them, or you aren't. They can be stuffy, they're usually long, often set in the 50's and often revel in themselves speaking above the viewer's head. I had to watch Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy three times before I felt I had a grasp at what exactly was going on in that beast. Trying your damnedest just to keep up with the plot can suck some of the enjoyment out of watching the thing in the first place. Bridge of Spies doesn't speak in as many riddles as TTSS, but it is a spy flick set, when else, at the height of the cold war. Tom Hanks plays Tom Hanks essentially, it doesn't matter what his character's name is, and this time around he is an upstanding insurance lawyer. You know, the type that would do whatever it takes to ensure a high moral parameter is set. And as unrealistic as his character can seem, he does happen to be based on a real person. In Tom Hanks' capable hands though, he just becomes Tom Hanks. In this movie Tom Hanks is tasked with providing a reliable defence to a man suspected of being a Russian spy, on trial for his life. Hanks does a good job, too good for some, and when one of America's own spies is caught and held, Hanks is appointed to facilitate the exchange of bodies. That's about it. There isn't a great deal of suspense in the movie until the actual exchange is to take place and at over two hours, it takes its sweet time getting anywhere in the plot. But despite occasionally dragging and suffering an overabundance of dry talky talk, the film kept my interest well enough. Of course, there aren't two more reliable men making movies these days than Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. With Hanks in front and Spiel behind the camera, at the very least you know you will be getting something that's well made and well acted. And it is that. It looks very pretty, thank in no small part to the lighting capabilities of frequent Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski. And while Hanks' performance is reliably good, it's also, on the downside, overly reliable. There isn't much adventure in it. You don't sense that things could go sideways at any moment or doubt a proper outcome because Hanks is at the helm and even when he isn't playing it safe, he's still Hanks and that's safe enough. Actually, the standout performance in this film for me was Mark Rylance (who?) playing the Soviet spy. I found myself wanting to see more of him and less of Hanks as the movie wore on. So, Bridge of Spies is a spy flick. It's very well made, very well acted. It's based on a true story, one I don't know much about so I can't comment on how close to the page Spielberg stuck, but he can't have run too wild with it as the story itself is really rather simple, predictably so at times. I don't doubt it will win a bevy of awards season nominations when the ballots are cast, but outside of Rylance and Kaminski, I don't think it deserves to win any of them. At the end of the day, I'd say Bridge is closer to a War Horse, or Lincoln Spielberg, rather than a Munich, Saving Private Ryan or even Empire of the Sun Spielberg. Which doesn't equal someone crapping in your Cheerios by any means. But it doesn't equal someone crapping gold in your Cheerios either.",

    "review": "  Oh how I wish Mark Rylance had taken more to screen acting earlier in his career. With this film we have Spielberg performing at his usual reliable level (excluding the baggy last 10 minutes, which is arguably Spielberg at his lowest). Tom Hanks and his famed 'everyman' quality also make an appearance, this film serving as just another reminder that he is quickly approaching Jimmy Stewart levels of relatability. The screenplay by Matt Charman is quite straightforward in its narrative structure, but in terms of story does get deliberately tricky at times (but always understandable) as Donovan's (Hanks) enemies try to befuddle him.The true star of the show is of course, Mark Rylance, who gives a performance that is laced with dry wit and irony, which only at the end does he break and let us know is all for show. His performance is one that speaks volumes by doing very little, but it is not understated, as it outshines Hanks' performance often.The only real problem I have with this film is that once the actual story ends and everything stops moving forward (which it does with a decent pace throughout) there are a sequence of scenes at the end that seem to be Spielberg letting his sentimental side shine through too much, evidenced by my whole cinema laughing at the obviousness of it all when Donovan sees children jumping fences and has flashbacks to people being killed at the Berlin Wall. Oh, and not to mention the fact that Amy Ryan has been gven a thankless role as a housewife who's only real job is to encourage the main character. Can we not do that anymore, please?",

It could be easy to label this as Oscar-bait; however, doing so would undermine the purpose and heart of the film, which is enormous.The more the internal conflict heightens and distresses the protagonist, the more the audience is glued to the screen. Spielberg is an expert here at managing conflict. The question of sympathizing with the alleged \"enemy\" is a powerful plot device if conflict is consistent throughout the script, and thankfully, the interplay between characters is fresh and forward. Mark Ryland has perhaps the most challenging character to portray since it requires an understated vulnerability to relate to foreign sympathy, and he knocks it out of the park.

It transcends a superficial, by-the-numbers film through period detail and focus on the background politics and juggling act that was the Cold War. Definitely a success due to the two old masters at the helm.",

Spielberg provides some moments of excellence and Tom Hanks is always a strong and consistent lead, but this is far from their best work and many of the other characters feel entirely two-dimensional. 7.5/10",

    "review": "  'Bridge of Spies'.. A Drama/Spy Thriller Biopic.. Directed by Steven Spielberg.. Written by the Coen Brothers.. Starring Tom Hanks.. Seriously, this film deserves WAY more love and attention than it got. This film told the story of James Donovan, a lawyer who defended a captured Soviet spy and was then thrown into the middle of the Cold War where he was responsible for organising an exchange: a captured US pilot for a Soviet spy. This was an incredible movie all across the board, Spielberg as usual has done a fantastic job at directing this film and Tom Hanks puts in one of the performances of his career (It seems as though everything he does is 'one of the performances of his career') as they tell this story in the most captivating way possible. One thing you must know about this film and the thing i loved the most about it is that this is, from start to finish, is a dialogue driven film with fantastic visuals to make you feel like you are in East Berlin. You don't get any high stakes action scenes, and no fast paced violent depictions of the Cold War, this is a very focused story about one man and his mission to organise a trade between two opposing governments. And at first it may seem rather boring, you may ask; How are they going to fill 2 hours and 20 minutes with conversations and discussions about a trade for two men in a 'Spy Thriller'? Well by utilising amazing and incredible dialogue, they manage to capture your attention at every moment and you are fully engaged the whole time so that the film goes by really quickly. I cannot express enough, how amazing the dialogue is to be able to carry the film all the way through without needing any big exciting events. The dialogue is so smart that you start picking up on the little hints that tie in to things said an hour prior and start noticing moments of foreshadowing and it only goes to show the amount of attention and thought from the Coen Brothers that went into crafting the dialogue in the film. There are a few scenes in the film where Spielberg creates the feeling of tension extremely well without using any dialogue or little music, just visuals. These relatively quiet moments were so powerful and managed to get the message across without any exposition, that it is another testament to Spielberg's incredibly diverse directing abilities. Tom Hanks was just absolutely amazing in this film as James Donovan. This film showed why he remains as one of my favourite actors of all time. Especially in these dramatic roles, the way he embodies the character and their traits and personality, you never feel like he is just playing the same character over and over. The dialogue alone isn't enough to captivate an audience, you need a top tier actor to put in a stellar performance and make it all seem believable, imagine Adam Sandler delivering the same lines, it simply would not work, and would just turn into a shitty comedy. Tom Hanks it seems can be anyone, need a Captain Phillips? Walt Disney? James Donovan? Hanks is your go-to guy. If i was to pick out anything i think could have been done better i would be nit-picking because it is a variation of minor stuff. But there is a brief moment around a third of the way into the film where there is a shift in the overall focus of the film and i thought it happened a little too quick and would liked to have seen it drawn out a little, but seriously, just a fairly minor thing. So in the end, this is a film you should definitely check out, a Dramatic, Suspenseful Spy Thriller that takes out the big action set-pieces and replaces them with interesting and captivating dialogue delivered by Tom Hanks to perfection. - 8.2/10",

Tom Hanks is great in this and Spielberg directs a very realistic and authentic recreation of the period. One thing i noticed is that for a movie that spends over half of its run-time focusing on the trial of the Russian spy we don't get a lot of court room drama which may be a disappointment for some. We get a lot of cuts past moments that I would have liked to see more time spent on. It also has its slow moments and really can't see anyone watching this more than once but it is quite good for a single viewing at least once.",

It is liberal agitprop, reenacting the pivotal manoeuvre of Cold War liberalism: train the spotlight on one's staunch and self-righteous support for liberal values while accommodating conservative forces and conjuring up humanitarian reasons for expanding Washington's imperial clout.",

During this age of paranoia an actual spy was caught. To ensure him 'due process' an insurance lawyer was chosen as the defense attorney. As an attorney Jim Donovan does his job quite well and ensures that the spy actually gets a valid defense but at a great personal cost.

I just wasn't able to dig in the way I wanted to.(Food analogies, I must be hungry). 'Bridge of Spies' finds Spielberg at his most classical. The man is a master at his craft and there isn't a frame that seems out of place - but the whole thing feels too polished, too controled. Too positively American.What's on offer is a lot of shady conversations in stylishly lit rooms between impeccably dressed men. And while that may be truthful to the spy-game in reality - vague legal banter doesn't exactly make for exhilerating viewing.Spielberg manages to sneak in tiny sparks of tension throughout (without them really catching on fire) and Hanks delivers solid work as could be expected. It's just more of a sizzle than a bang.But to be fair, a screenplay like this (however well written) would've been disastrous in lesser hands.",

The script is quite authentic but Hollywood has avoided portraying attorneys and judges as they are - self-regulating, self-legislating and greedy. The Federal Courts determined that they must hear cases \"per fact\" just to generate income. I want to see attorneys talking to the judge over the phone on a Sunday deciding on unlawful tactics. Judges are immune and attorneys have no liability associated with their conduct. The judicial Review Committee is made primarily of attorneys, which justices declared \"unregulated\" due to \"trust.\" Back in the days the courts sufficed with regulations of attorneys which are extremely long, tiresome and prone to abuse. But as people get educated and enjoy the benefits of the media, the courts have resorted to increasingly distorted rulings. They don't need separation of authorities; an attorney's only duty is to declare their own interests in a case - if the client doesn't object they have entered an oral agreement to pursue the same in court. If the client objects the other party will keep that attorney on the record anyway. Can't begin to tell you. Watch out for \"mercy killings\" and \"gun laws.\" They mean mafia and extermination of the disabled and of political enemies. Please distribute this so I don't get to be executed..... mercy....",

    "review": "  As is the case with any period piece, if it historically accurate, then there's not much to tel. If it is not historically accurate, well, then it's not historically accurate. Nevertheless, movies in this genre can at least be counted on to offer some insight into a time or a situation that may have evaded the general public and as such are enlightening if not always entertaining. Bridge of Spies offers nothing much in the way of enlightenment nor entertainment. It is bore fest beyond belief that feels as though, Spielberg and Hanks were fulfilling some sort of studio requirement rather than attempting to make a compelling movie. Laziness is the word that comes to mind after seeing this film. Lazy acting, lazy directing and lazy execution. Surely this film was made on an Xbox using the \"Director Hero\" game. Oh, that game doesn't exist? I couldn't tell. Spielberg and Hanks are so much better than this. So much so that I can easily give the a pass on this yawner. You can't hit a grand slam every time you step up to bat. Who doesn't get a pass, however, are the legions of critics that propagandized this film as one of the top releases of the year. Are there guest passes to the Academy Awards being handed out for being Hollywood yes men? To bad I'm not on the list. Unfortunately, thanks to the ineptitude of critics to either comprehend a movie's merit properly or their ineptitude to let Spielberg know when he's served up a stinker. We're probably going to have endure endless clips of this non event during award season. If only viewers were able to discern between good and bad movies in today's market they might lobby the Academy to not rob Sicario of it's rightful award haul in favor of this uninspired effort. But then again...\"Will it Help?\", probably not.",

There was little real suspense within the plot, which seemed disappointing since that was its main marketing point. Tom Hanks was the all American Hero, which we have seen a number of times before. However, for me, the film was rescued by Mark Rylance who squeezed every last drop of humour from his role with classic understatement. A more unlikely spy you could hardly wish to find. His appearances in the film are completely believable.",

    "review": "  Surprisingly funny and light for what appears to be, at first glance, a heavy political drama. This cold war-era thriller succeeds on all marks. Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, in their 4th collaboration, prove themselves to be a productive team in terms of cinematic quality. The sharp script, cast, and directing are all commendable. But what really hit it out of the ball park, was Mark Rylance, who plays the spy with astonishing realism, as Rudolf Abel. It strikes me perhaps the most, and I can't stress enough how well Spielberg pulls this off, is that we feel a touch of sympathy for the \"traitor\". Bridge of Spies succeeds on many layers. The actors all did a fantastic job, Tom Hanks and Marc Rylance had incredible chemistry. The script is sharp, the dialogues are witty and the visuals are of high quality. The movie is filled to the brim with intensity and emotion. Whilst the film had spectacular sequences, it never forgot its place in remaining as realistic and character driven as possible, something that has been missing in Spielberg's recent films. Although the Music Department did a good job I particularly miss John Williams here.Despite the rather shady title, this is not the flamboyant gunslinger action ala James Bond or the intense operation like Argo. It is, strangely and also effectively, a light foray into the otherwise dark world of espionage. The pace is utterly calm and I absolutely loved that! Capturing the weight and gloom of an era, Bridge of Spies is equally a biopic and an unexpected light drama. Rather than using typical war buildup, the movie gives faces to each party, thus humanizing them in incredibly identifiable way. There's a lingering intensity, especially concerning the world of secrecy, yet it's a fascinatingly accessible story with subtle refined humor. This is meant to inspire instead of evaluation of ideologies, showcasing that humanity still resides beyond the other side of border or wall. This is Spielberg's best move in quite a long time. He didn't do anything bad, I like most of his movies, but Bridge of Spies is the first in a long time to remind me what I love about him and what a passionate artist he is: his fine instinct for transporting emotions through the screen to the audience.Anyway, the unexpected result is a reason why this film scores on every level. I highly recommend everyone to see it.",

I'll be very surprised if he is not at least nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The movie is full of classic Spielberg-isms, like the one shots and the gorgeous long shots. There are parts of the movie that feel a bit too goofy though, And I was very disappointed in the writing of the wife's character. It also doesn't pass the bechdel test.

Kudos to a thoughtful and well thought out script that manages to interweave and juxtapose contrasting strands of narrative in a cinematically fluent manner and also wring tension even out of a story where we could easily guessed the ending. As for Tom Hanks, his Attitus Finch-like principled and fair-minded Everyman, was put to great effect in a film which starts off as a legal drama and ends up more political and soul-searching. In the end, however, it is Mark Rylance, in an understating role, who stands out in the film, with a quietly exquisite performance which is not only memorable but also very moving.",

Whether it's ET calling home or a lawyer negotiating with Russians during the cold war, the story is presented in an absolutely epic way, like depeche mode use increased decibels to power up their music.The first part of the movie is a courtroom drama featuring the story of a professional lawyer with some strong personal ethics defending the \"evil\" Russian spy and it reminded me of \"Philadephia\" (also starring Tom Hanks). ?he second (and longest) part of the film is the espionage/film-noir one, featuring the negotiations of the lawyer with East Germany and Russia to the exchange of the Russian spy with Americans. The story is largely based on true events but of course there is always room for some subtle American propaganda and epic dramaturgy, Spielberg's specialty. Tom Hanks plays his role with great maturity and efficiency and the story is compact, despite the long duration of the film (141 mins). I guess the point of the film is that ethics and common sense are rare qualities that can really change the world. Still, the fact that the film is after all a strongly presented biography doesn't allow it to be a really classic film-noir film. Nevertheless it's worth watching.",

Some of his usual sentimentalism is on display but it's mostly kept in check by the screenplay (no doubt due to the Coen's involvement) and the tight pacing that never lingers too long on emotional moments.

    "review": "  Bridge of Spies is a tremendous cold war thriller and a welcome return collaboration between Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. Hanks is phenomenal as ever in this Coen Bros. penned script who never puts a foot wrong in his straight turn as James Donovan while Mark Rylance as Rudolph Abel is equally impressive giving a subtle performance as the accused spy. Spielberg has managed to craft a film that feels like it's come straight out of the \"Golden Era\" of American filmmaking where not a minute of screen time is wasted and where images show you all you need to know thanks to clever editing combined with bold cinematography. While the film's back and forth plot can get a little tedious towards the end, the film's biggest fault I found was that it's guilty of having its cake and eating it. The overarching themes of the film are just and true however Spielberg patriotically goes against the film's morality to what can only be seen as a move to woo the Academy and American audiences. It's bound to be nominated come awards season so give it a watch if you have the chance!",

    "review": "  -Bridge of Spies is een 2015 Amerikaans historisch drama-thriller film geregisseerd door Steven Spielberg uit een screenplay geschreven door Matt Charman en Ethan Coen en Joel Coen. De film sterren Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, en Alan Alda. Op basis van de 1960 U-2 incident tijdens de koude oorlog, de film vertelt het verhaal van advocaat James B. Donovan die is belast met de onderhandelingen over de vrijlating van Francis Gary Powers-een piloot waarvan de U-2 spionage vliegtuig werd neergeschoten boven de Sovjet-Unie in ruil voor Rudolf Abel, een gevangene Sovjet KGB spion vastgehouden onder de voogdij van de Verenigde Staten.-Bridge of Spies werd geschoten onder de werktitel van St. James Place. Principiele fotographie begon op 8 september 2014 in Brooklyn, New York City en tot produktie overgegaan in de Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam. De film werd uitgebracht door Touchstone Pictures op 16 oktober 2015 in Noord-Amerika en gedistribueerd door 20th Century Fox in andere gebieden. De naam van de film verwijst naar de Glienicke Bridge waarmee Potsdam, het vroegere Oost-Duitsland, verbonden werd met het westen van Berlijn, tot 1990 de enclave West-berlijn.--Kritische ontvangst:  -Bridge of Spies heeft lovende kritieken ontvangen, met name lof voor Hanks' en Rylance's prestaties, evenals Spielberg's richting. Op Rotten Tomatoes, de film heeft een score van 92%, gebaseerd op 225 reviews, met een gemiddelde score van 7.8/10 -. De site's kritische consensus luidt: \"Brug van spionnen zoekt nieuwe leven in Hollywood's klassieke Koude Oorlog spionagethriller formule, dankzij betrouwbaar uitmuntend werk van Steven Spielberg en Tom Hanks.\" Op Metacritic, heeft de film een score van 81 uit 100, gebaseerd op 48 critici, met vermelding \"succes\". Op CinemaScore, publiek heeft de film een gemiddelde cijfer van \"A\" op een A+ tot F-schaal.-Een positieve recensie kwam van Steve Pulaski van Influx Magazine, gaf de film een B en verklaarde dat de meer meditatieve structuur van de film \"vermengd met enkele subtiele periode cinematografie en een sterke Hanks performance (is) een fascinerende volwassen drama dat, hoewel niet zo gelaagd als het zou kunnen, is een verrijkende ervaring.\" De A.V. Club's Ignatiy Vishnevetsky beschreef het als \"��n van de mooiste films van Spielberg's laatste dagen fase, en misschien wel de meest welluidende...Bridge of Spies verandert een geheime gevangene uitwisseling tussen de CIA en de KGB in een gespannen en vaak ontwapenend grappig kat-en-muisspelletje,\" besluitend: \"Een ode aan vasthoudendheid aan morele principes, geopolitiek wees vervloekt, een uitbarsting van ouderwetse big-screen verhaal vertelling.\"",

    "review": "  1957, it's the height of the Cold War and anyone could be a spy, especially if you're Senator McCarthy.There was good reason for Red Paranoia - there genuinely were spies lurking in the depths of idealised America. Bridge of Spies is based on the true story of lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) and how he, firstly, defended Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and then exchanged him for CIA recon pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). Rave reviews have followed since the release of Bridge of Spies. If you want to know why then look no further than the acting. Tom Hanks does what Tom Hanks does best. But Hanks's acting is standard compared to Mark Rylance's Abel, who is the true star of the show. Praise to the Coen Brothers (the scriptwriters of the film) for making a Soviet spy one of the heroes of an American film - that's a massive cultural step forward. The rest of the cast are on point, though I will scrutinise Scott Shephard, who plays spy 'Hoffman'. He exaggerates his character when there's no need - he's playing a spy. Spies are meant to be inconspicuous individuals that DON'T GET TANTRUMS IN THE MIDDLE OF GODDAMN BERLIN DURING THE COLD WAR. Realism can go a long way sometimes. Spielberg has created a film with little to no flaws - it's a technical masterpiece that tells a story well. However, you get the feeling this is very 'run of the mill' Spielberg: basic metaphors flushed out by acting talent. You get the sense the Cold War isn't taken seriously - the scenes that intentionally contrast Soviet territory and America are a little clich�d. It's a very 'Hollywood' film in that regard. Anyone and everyone will enjoy the film, but just expect to see it doing the rounds on TV during Easter or Christmas in five years. Standard Spielberg: go and see it.(*)(*)(*)(*)CLICK HERE TO SEE THE TRAILERFor more film and music gossip, follow @TheHECReview on TwitterAlso check out my blog at the Huffington Post and the HEC Review!",

    "review": "  There are certain combination of film makers & actors that make you confident, before watching a film, that you are not going to be disappointed. With Steven Spielberg directing; Tom Hanks taking the lead (worked together on Saving Private Ryan, The Terminal, Catch Me If You Can) & written by the Coen Brothers (Fargo, Burn After Reading, No Country for Old Men), such a combination was without doubt destined to succeed. And guess what? They do, marvelously! By presenting an absolutely riveting and edge-of-your seat Cold War story. While there are no car chases and no gun-fire exchanges, the story is as compelling and suspenseful as any by Spielberg and the Cohen brothers. They are masters of the well-paced scene in which we the audience are never sure how the events will resolve. Even during the final climactic event of the film, which is largely understated, not much actually happens, but our anticipation of what might and might not occur keeps us glued to every gesture and expression & remains utterly captivating. Working from a screenplay by Matt Charman, rewritten by Joel and Ethan Cohen, Spielberg makes largely minor departures from the actual occurrences as they unfolded and recreates history with atmospheric spontaneity. While it may seem anachronistic to make a film about the Cold War, the points made in Steven Spielberg's film are just as relevant today. Like Spielberg's Lincoln, it is a film about values, about standing up for what you know to be right instead of succumbing to your fears, not an examination of the rights and wrongs of international intrigue or the merits or demerits of the Cold War. The Cold War is of course the perfect time period for any political thriller story (a real one at that). There are moments of manipulations, lies, and deceit. Yet through all that a trust has to be built to have any movement in the talks. How the characters try to build that relation for mutual benefit is what intrigued me the most. The story follows Brooklyn insurance claims attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks), who is selected by the New York Bar Association wants him to serve as a defense attorney to Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) so nobody can impugn the American justice. Abel had maintained a low-profile as one of the top Soviet spies in America. Masquerading as an artist, he collected sensitive information without calling attention to himself. The Soviets relied on what are known as dead letter mail boxes. Information could be stashed and retrieved, without it being apparent to most people, in innocuous places. Even Donovan's wife, Mary (Amy Ryan), nor his children share his principles of going about by the book & representing the 'Most Hated Man' of America. Even though everyone is convinced Abel is going to receive the death penalty, Donovan convinces Judge Byers (Dakin Matthews) to display some compassion and sentence the Soviet to prison rather than the electric chair. Byers heeds Donovan's advice despite frenzied public opinion after he delivers his verdict. In the meantime, the CIA recruits U.S.A.F. pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) to fly a high altitude jet to conduct aerial reconnaissance over the U.S.S.R. A Soviet SA-2 surface-to-air missile cripples Power's plane. He bails out, but fails to obliterate his U2 plane. Of course, the Soviet capture Powers, convict him as a spy, and sentence him to prison. Not long afterward, Donovan receives a letter from the Soviets and finds himself flying to Berlin as a private citizen to negotiate a prisoner exchange: Abel for Powers. Donovan gets the royal runaround between the Soviets as well as the East Berlin authorities. Nonetheless, he proves himself to be a shrewd man with a bargain, and he pits the Soviets against East Berlin. Ultimately, he never gives ground during these complicated negotiations. The catch is he must negotiate between the superpowers as a private individual rather than an official American envoy. However, as events play out, the two men's destinies will become intertwined. Eventually, Donovan travels to Berlin where he'll see first-hand the creation of the infamous Berlin Wall. While the first half is a legal drama, the second half is a political thriller & director Spielberg does an exceptional job of condensing and cross-cutting these events with utmost consistency. The film also looks authentic with its multiple locations in American and Europe. Steven Spielberg is the type of director you never know what you're going to get and I'm talking about the type of film making he uses. Steven Spielberg's direction here is absolutely superb, because every scene is so perfectly crafted and Spielberg knows when to cut to a emotional reaction with the characters. The Coen brothers, I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also a certain style; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and other actors at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance. In terms of the performances, everybody was flawless. Tom Hanks is one of the most lovable and respected actors of are times, as in every role he dose, he never disappoints. This is he's fourth collaboration with Spielberg & Hanks once again deliverers a magnificent and believable performance. This is an Oscar worthy performance as he made his character so relatable, funny and very likable. The character Donovan is unwavering when it comes to his duty as a lawyer, even when he has to defend an enemy of his country. He believes in the importance of unbiased justice, so strongly that at first it may come off as naive. However, there are understated moments where we can see clearly his resolve being tested to the limits. Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy, is a man of few words but with that limitation he is able to convey so much about the character. He is defeated and fearful for his life, but when Donovan shows that there is still hope he will crack a joke. The key here is subtlety, that brings the power into the more dramatic moments without it feeling forced. I didn't feel like I was watching actors, I felt like I was watching real people. Amy Ryan & Austin Stowell play their parts well. On the whole, 'Bridge of Spies' is a well crafted espionage drama with excellent performances, fantastic direction and great writing. Bridge of Spies is the best Cold War thriller I've ever seen & is one of the best films of the year!",

    "review": "  With Steven Spielberg returning to both historical storytelling and collaborating with Tom Hanks, Bridge of Spies sounded like an intense collaboration of strong acting and directing.The Cold War espionage thriller is a genre which has not been in its heyday for decades so the timeliness in Bridge of Spies is not precisely as relevant. As a result, it makes it easier to pick up on the less entertaining elements of the film There is no denying that the dialogue is very intelligent, but there is just so much talking that the film can drag on. The thing about Bridge of Spies is that when you consider everything closely, not all that much happens in the story. The relevance lies not so much in what has happened but rather in the political and historical context that it occured in as well as how the characters decide to deal with the situations in such a context. As a result, those who cannot find themselves embalmed in the screenplay and acting are more likely to find themselves bored than others. For me, I could see both sides of the spectrum because the story develops based on a lot of little things that happen with the characters which is conveyed almost entirely through the dialogue of the film, yet at the same time the language in the screenplay was certainly well-crafted. There is a balance between focus on the events consistently moving forward and elements of the character's individual perspectives on what is happening ensuring that the film is faithful to both the real historical events and the people involved in it all. There are minimal subplots in Bridge of Spies. Though the characters all have their own personal lives, they are used simply to contribute to characterization as supporting blocks to the more major themes of the story. In that sense, Bridge of Spies keeps clearly focused on its goal of getting its characters to safety without messing around all the time. In all essence, Bridge of Spies serves as a well-written collaboration between the legendary Coen Brothers and Steven Spielberg.Even though the film is very much driven by script, this does not interfere with Steven Spielberg's ambition to ensure that Bridge of Spies is still a spectacle of some kind. There are some scenes which boast top notch production values such as the sequence in which Francis Gary Powers is shot down over the Soviet Union, but the majority of the film boasts a visual style in other ways. For one thing, the film easily conveys an effective production design which is able to grasp the historical context of the story with stylish appeal thanks to the appearances of the characters' costumes and their vehicles. But as well as that, I found myself intrigued by the fact that even though there was very much a lot of monochromatic colour in the visual field it never felt dull. There was a wide variety of monochrome so that the film was both colourful enough to be visually creative yet dank enough to be realistic and grim, reflecting the general mood of the film. The cinematography also works to ensure that there is strong imagery captured in everything, carefully working to emphasize the facial expressions of the actors to convey their state of mind or capturing the violent events happening at the Berlin wall. Whether the scenes are small or large in scale, there is always a beautiful sense of imagery in Bridge of Spies and you could expect no less from Steven Spielberg.Like I said, Bridge of Spies is a very talkative film and so it requires a truly talented actor to carry it as the lead. Predictably, with someone as skilled as Tom Hanks in the lead role there are no complaints to be made. Tom Hanks has proven many times to work brilliantly with Steven Spielberg, and Bridge of Spies is of course no exception. Tom Hanks takes on the role of James B. Donovan, a lawyer determined to do right for the world in every way. Neglecting social pressures, James B. Donovan follows his own conscience as a human being and Tom Hanks is able to convey this easily. His sophistication carries him through all the material with intelligent understanding of the material while his charms allow viewers to see into the human side of him. He grasps the determined edge of James B. Donovan with dedication, fearlessly wading through the material with a strong sense of consistent development and grasp over his emotions. Tom Hanks never drops out of the role and keeps focused during every conversation, never losing sight of what he is talking about or failing to keep audiences engaged through his charismatic interpretation of the language, so he ultimately reminds us that his dramatic flair has not decreased one iota in his years of acting.Yet it is Mark Rylance who truly deserves critical praise for his acting more than anyone. As a convicted Soviet Spy, Rudolf Abel should be seen as the villain of the story. Yet there is nothing antagonistic about him. From the first moment, he conveys a sense of human frailty which makes him easily sympathetic, yet contrasts it with a strong spirit not to succumb to the pressures of the US. He is vulnerable, but he is a man who cannot be broken which makes him both sympathetic and admirable. Mark Rylance's restrained line delivery allows him to have an impeccable chemistry with Tom Hanks in which the two are able to strip away their personas and simply converse as human beings, giving an impressive sense of feeling to the film. As the story progresses, we see more of Mark Rylance's vulnerabilities as he becomes more emotional bit by bit. It gets to the point where Rudolf Abel is no longer a spy but simply a human being, and the film depicts how the people of the US were so quick to forget that in times of Cold War paranoia. Rudolf Abel becomes the most human part of Bridge of Spies which is unexpected considering its subject matter, so Mark Rylance's performance is clearly one of the greatest assets to the film.Amy Ryan is a friendly presence, and it's nice to see Alan Alda return to dramatic form.So Bridge of Spies relies on a dated genre and is packed full of more talking than anything, but with Steven Spielberg's eye for imagery, an intelligent screenplay and brilliant performances from Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance.",

    "review": "  One of the best films of 2015, Bridge of Spies has all of the Spielberg staples in their best incarnations so far: One-takes, saccharine melodrama, an eye for historical detail, incredible frame depth and rich worldbuilding. It also has a masterful, engaging script that crafts tense moments and complex, believable characters even in the ethereal affectations of Spielbergian worldbuilding. Most importantly it has a great cast, helmed by a Tom Hanks at peak form, an unbelievable scene-stealing, career-(re-)launching performance by Mark Rylance, who I'm ashamed to say I had never heard of before and with a large array of wholly believable, impeccably cast 'those guys' playing off Hanks' everyman with skill. The story, co written by the Coens, creates a dispassionate image of America during some of its darkest times and wrings out patriotism and nobility from Hanks' Insurance Lawyer while giving us an even-handed account of espionage games from an outsider's perspective without any of the us/them excesses, both story and action-wise that makes every aspiring writer giddy at the very mention of spies.It is safe to say that Bridge of Spies would have been my favourite spy-movie in a world devoid of Tomas Alfredsson's masterful's Tinker, Tailor which is perfect in every way and one of my favourite movies of all time. It is still one of the very best spy movies I've seen and one of the best movies to come out this year. Also, possibly my favourite Tom Hanks performance.Highly Recommended.",

    "review": "  Tom Hanks delivers a masterful performance in this Cold War thriller directed by Steven Spielberg.Hanks plays James Donovan an insurance lawyer assigned the duty of defending Rudolf Abel, a man charged with being a Russian spy, played wonderfully by British stage actor Mark Rylance. Mark Rylance's portrayal manages to be both evoke sympathy and likability as well as being able to steal every scene that he's in and when you're in the same room as Tom Hanks that's hard to do. Rylance makes his character seem like he's not got a care in the world even though he could face the death penalty for his crimes and is brilliant when Tom Hanks repeatedly ponders why Able does not look worried and all he replies with is, \"would it help?\"However the film is not a straight forward court case and Hanks is soon drawn into a cat and mouse game with both the Russian and East German officials over the release of a captive American pilot and a student accused of being a communist. What follows isn't high on action but the dialogue manages to ramp up the tension and you'll be on tenterhooks right up until the end.",

    "review": "  Bridge of Spies. Steven Spielberg's new Cold War Thriller follows the story of James Donovan, a Lawyer responsible for the transfer between Rudolph Abel, an alleged USSR spy, and an American pilot. The cast includes Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance as our protagonists, and a host of supporting characters.It is abundantly clear that this is an Oscar film. It doesn't attempt to hide this in any way, the actors, script, directing, cinematography, styling and music are all clearly designed to win awards. I don't have a problem with this, as long as the film is good.The performances in the film are pretty good, honestly not terribly exceptional however. Hanks, who looks way more like Hooch than Turner nowadays, is fittingly witty and sturdy. His character is immediately likeable, reflecting our modern attitudes towards the legal system and social morality. Hanks brings a warmth to the role, and his confident and strong presence goes along way when the audience need to sympathise during his hardships. The golden rule, however, is that only he could play this character, and I think others could. As Long as that actor has the same warmth that benefits from a beloved actor like Hanks. The rest of the cast again is good, but not great. Donovan's wife and children, fairly standard, the CIA and KGB Agents all standard (yet not stereotyped, which I respect) and the American military all square jawed heroes.The one exception is Mark Rylance. as supporting actors go this performance is certainly Oscar worthy. The Rudolph Abel character never actually reveals he is a spy to Donovan, and I suspect there was supposed to be an element of mystery as to his innocence, however we do quite clearly see him taking part in espionage activities, and the soviets do actively seek to get him back. Unless not even the soviets new who their spies were? This was lost on me personally. Rylance is a shorter man, not elderly but older and as far as imagery goes he is the whole package; frail, physically weak. But it is in the characters emotional and mental strength that he absolutely shines, and I couldn't replace Rylance personally.As for the direction, it can't be faulted. Working from a brilliant and meaningful script (Kudos to Matt Charman and the Coen's) every scene is shot beautifully, and Spielberg uses colour, weather, imagery and characters in perfect harmony. The framing is very close for the most part, keeping us in Donovan's vicinity. Smooth pans and zooms are used constantly, to the extent that by the last few scenes I had started to count them. It does add drama and the movement gives a progressive feel to Donovan's endeavour, but this is Oscar styling at its most annoying, despite the obvious quality poured into it.The film is essentially a series of negotiations, from Abel's Trial to the final transfer on the, all together now, bridge of spies. Again the use of location and distancing perfectly matches the delivery of the actors and I don't think I could fault a single scene, the tension mounts to the climax in each scene very naturally, and it is always apparent who is in control, even behind the smoke and mirrors.This is where my first gripe is. The plot doesn't even try to not be obvious, we know exactly how the whole scenario will play out. There's no mystery. No red herrings. As the credits rolled I found that I'd seen exactly what id expected. This sucked to be honest. It is a true story so I can't really complain that there was no twist ending, but there was no underlying tension. Throughout the film we know the end result and essentially just go through the motions and back-and-forth's it takes to get there. There isn't really a problem with this and again the film is enjoyable on a scene by scene basis. Just a little bit of actual thriller may have been nice though, instead of basically a really great biopic.In fact, if the film was marketed as a biopic I would definitely say it was best picture worthy. Alas, they said thriller, and I wasn't particularly thrilled.The other big problem is that there seems to be a need to add these scenes that just don't fit. The one I will mention is the scene where the plane gets shot down (this is in the trailers and you see it coming from the start). It's an action scene. It doesn't suit the courthouse, suspenseful drama underneath. And this continues throughout the whole film. The biggest fraction of this is the American's pilots story, which is unnecessary. There's a whole message about how we should treat POW's there but the film is Donovan and Abel's story. It shouldn't have to be cut up by this whole other plot.The complaint I'm seeing a lot around the internet is that it's too much of a legal drama. This really isn't a complaint. I'd say about a quarter of the film is full on legal battle, but it's really well done. It fits fluently into the story and is a catalyst for the themes of the film. Also its wonderfully accurate. As a law student I'm a stickler for improper portrayals of courtrooms and statute. But frankly Bridge of Spies was really nice in this regard, despite being a little glamorised.Finally, a short word about the soundtrack. There's not really a huge amount to say. The horns and strings make for a regimental, reverent and hopeful soundtrack, but sometimes in feels out of place. My feeling in the last scene was thoroughly opposed by the soundtrack, but musically was very atmospheric and enjoyableOverall Bridge of Spies is a great film. I would recommend it to any film fan as an exemplar work of film. In short is elegant, mature and smart, though more mainstream fans may find it a bit of a slog. As far as Oscars go I'm expecting supporting actor, original screenplay and director nominations. This is one Spielberg's better films.",

Focusing on the trial of an accused Russian spy in an American court room, it quickly becomes a case which could have serious ramifications on the paranoid relationship between America and Russia. This is brilliantly directed by Speilberg, who in recent years has made some very bad films. Tom Hanks is always perfectly cast and does a tremendous job. I was also surprised at how much humour there was in this, being about the cold war, you don't expect to be giggling and laughing at all. Well made, acted and directed. A must see and will more then likely be nominated for a few awards.",

We got few shy loughs with badly written dramedy with flat characters and bad jokes. The only thing remains is Tom Hanks talent, which on the other hand doesn't help at all to save this peace of meaningless cheap entertainment. Moreover, it is sad to see how many critics praise this work and it makes me wonder what kind of people are writing about cinema today - the only logical answer, people without a taste or any prior knowledge to good cinema, including Mr. Spielberg here who used to make at least decent films for kids back in days.

Indeed, criticism of Messrs Speilberg, Hanks and the Brothers Cohen is tantamount to questioning the actions of a top surgeon under the operating lights. Everything works here as it should, although there are times when we wonder when the Cold War will heat up. That said, Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance bounce off each other so well that they are perfectly capable of creating several masterful moments. This is a film about understatement. Hanks proves once more that he is one of the best actors in the world, in that he, to quote Tony Curtis: Does Not Act! Mark Rylance is the same, hence we get a wonderful scene about the Standing Man - one amongst many - concluding with the Bridge in question. This is the third of three great films this year (Carol and Sicario being the other two). It does not disappoint, making this is a bridge worth crossing for any genuine lover of great films.",

    "review": "  I love anything to do with the Cold War and I gobble up espionage thrillers like they're delicious tubs of hummus, so I was excited to see this after I saw the trailer. It's a good film, plain and simple. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg are probably the most trustworthy cinematic partnership around and have proved that for the last couple of decades. This is brilliantly acted and directed for the most part. The story is engaging, or at least it was to me because of my previously mentioned Cold War fetish, and it's inspired by true events so that makes it doubly interesting. Now, \"inspired by\" true events can have many definitions, but nothing ridiculous or unrealistic happens in this that makes you question the believably of the story, but I wouldn't be surprised if I find a few inaccuracies after doing some research of my own. It's set in 1957 so if you enjoy that sort of aesthetic you'll definitely get a boner when watching the first half which is set in the USA. Things are a stark contrast in the second half as the story moves to East Berlin during the construction of the Berlin wall, and you really do feel a shared sense of culture shock with Tom Hank's character after leaving the fuzzy warm colours of 50's America in exchange for the biting cold and monochrome portrayal of Soviet controlled Germany. If I had some criticisms they would be the following. I think the first 15-20 minutes are a little slow. Now I don't mind slow films but it just felt like a while for things to really click into gear. The CIA and Russian negotiators have a hint of \"mustache-twirling villain\" about them, which cheapens some scenes a little. Finally, Spielberg can't help but inject some cheesy sentimentality in places which I'm never thankful for, but the majority of the film plays it straight down the middle and it's only really noticeable towards the end. Overall this is a well made thriller with an interesting story and an immersive setting. It's not for everyone (I saw a few people nodding off during the 2 hours run time) but if you have an interest in the source material you'll get a lot out of it.",

I walked out of the theatre having felt a range of emotions and a real sense of fulfillment from the experience.I have to admit that these days when a movie has all the ingredients to be great there is always some skepticism that it will disappoint. Maybe this deep seeded pessimism is what helped makes this movie such a thrill rather than just satisfactory.The story is gripping, fascinating, entertaining and even educational. The acting is top-notch both by Tom Hanks and his supporting cast. While BRIDGE OF SPIES will be a strong contender for various Oscar categories I feel strongly that Mark Rylance as the Russian spy deserves serious consideration for Best Supporting Actor. He perfectly manages to convey a sense of wise calmness without ever misunderstanding the larger things going on around him. His chemistry with Tom Hanks also works splendidly.Beyond tension and intrigue, this movie delivers humor, historical significance and even some unexpected emotional moments (for me at least).Finally, the message in the first 1/3 of the movie about how the USA owes it to itself to stick to its values even when faced with terrible events resonates strongly in today's geo-political context.BRIDGE OF SPIES is a must-see 2015 movie.",

    "review": "  Steven Speilberg usually goes in two different directions when making a new film. the first direction are epic fantasy/adventure films that anyone can enjoy at any age such as Jaws, E.T., Jurassic Park and the Indiana Jones movies. The other direction which was started with 1993's Schindler's List are war-time bipocs or fictional stories revolved around war whcih are usually a lot more sodre in tone. Bridge of Spies falls into thw latter catergory although it isn't as instese as those other films.Based on the true events of the 1957 prisoner exchange during the Cold War, this screenplay written by the Coen Brothers is very well excuted thanks to the preformaces of Tom Hanks as James Donovan and Mark Rylance as the Russian prisoner Rudolf Abel. Although thery have great chesmisty, the film itself, does take a more episodic sturcture, as after the trail is over, James has to deal with an American getting captured by the Russians, which unlike the snore-inducing Lincoln film of 2012, is actually vvery entertaining and tense to watch.The cinematography and costume design are also outstanding,capturing the look and feel of Berlin, America and Russia during this tense time period and Thomas Newman's score is really emotinal as alwasy in his presvious works on Finding Nemo and Saving Mr Banks.Overall, Bridge of Spies is another gem to add to Steven's ever-growing classic pile and I look forward to see what he and Mark Rylance can bring to the world of Roald Dahl next July",

What makes the film a Spielberg great is the ability he has to produce a period piece that makes you feel as though you were there at that time even if you did not know the authenticity of the sights and sounds of the film. A story well told, well acted, well written and presented in a dramatic historical perspective. The two hours will pass quickly.",

Telling that his character in this film doesn't care whether the Russian Spy is guilty or not (he obviously is). He is more interested in getting him off via a technicality.

However, you've ordered a rare steak and what comes out is a medium steak. It's the same food, and you'll eat it, but it's not what you ordered. Bridge Of Spies just feels too cautious in it's approach. The trailers were extremely misleading (tho I don't judge the film on that) and nothing really happens. Instead of the suspense and highly intense story I was believing I was going to get, I got a courtroom drama with a clich� side story instead.Bridge Of Spies is underwhelming, tho if you deal with it, the middle portion of the film is quite fast paced and well filmed. However, if you look at the two sides of the middle, you'll find a slow paced, uneventful, clich� riddled, classic Spielberg film and a classic Tom Hanks performance.

    "review": "  This was a diplomatic thriller, when I expected it center more on espionage. I was OK with that. Really engaging. Finest performance Tom Hanks has had a long time. Witty dialogue (The Coen Brothers co-wrote this). My main gripe is Janusz Kaminski's tired use of the \"bleeding light\" coming in through each and every window, no matter where the characters are (even on a train in East Germany). Its distracting, and he needs to either change his style, or Spielberg needs to find another cinematographer (he yo-yo'd between a few before he found Kaminski for Schindler's List).",

    "review": "  An entertaining Bridge to the H'Wood studio days, this Spies game exemplifies Steven Spielberg at his treacly but satisfying best. The golden age of H'Wood are alive and well in the oeuvre of the maestro behind Jaws, E.T., and Jurassic Park, most noticeably in his latest brush with history, Bridge of Spies. Oh, this is not to say that his latest true story unintentionally comes across as old fashioned. Rather, the legendary director purposely exhibits an old-school approach to storytelling and workmanship that brings to mind the days of John Ford (The Grapes of Wrath, The Searchers), William Wyler (The Best Years of Our Lives, Ben-Hur), and - most of all - Frank Capra (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. It's a Wonderful Life). There's his assured use of Steadicam sweeps and close-ups, as well as a celebrated leading man who radiates both trustworthiness and nationalism. Just look at the film's poster: the giant mug of American hero Hanks caught between the stars and stripes and hammer and sickle, grandstanding the values of life and liberty before the opening credits have even rolled. This process serves him well with a Cold War tale such as this but it also plays it a little too safe. As beautiful and striking as this sentimental film looks, it plays out too predictably, which takes some of the punch out of the more suspenseful moments.In this PG-13-rated thriller based on true events, an American lawyer (Hanks) gets recruited by the CIA during the Cold War to help rescue a pilot (Austin Stowell) detained in the Soviet Union. Calculatedly, the film feels like a family friendly product of the era that it represents, which is laudable on many fronts save for the multiple somewhat heavy-handed endings. For the auteur who chose to chronicle such a specific warts and all bent in the life of the 16th U.S. president with Lincoln, however, his Bridge of Spies ultimately comes across as lighter fare. With a reliably stalwart performance by Hanks, a knock-out turn by stage veteran Rylance as a captured Soviet spy, and quotable dialogue provided by the Coen Brothers, this throwback boasts enough winning moments of distinction that make it stand tall even in a familiar line-up. Bottom line: Spies Like U.S.",

BRIDGE OF SPIES is ultimately a well-crafted procedural whose central theme is that diplomacy is driven by human relationships. The film's most pleasant surprise is one of those relationships, between Hanks's attorney and the alleged Soviet spy he is assigned to represent, played by Mark Rylance.

    "review": "  ??????? ????? aka James Donovan as played by Tom Hanks is an insurance lawyer turned international diplomat in this brilliant real world cold war story about spies, the CIA, the GDR, the KGB and all the other sinister organizations that you'd want in a suspense thriller.We can certainly say Steven Spielberg has not lost his touch for bringing war stories to life on the silver screen. What a brilliant performance all around from everyone involved. I had absolutely no idea what this movie was about and randomly picked it based on Rotten Tomatoes rating and I wasn't in the least disappointed. Now, I'm more interested than ever to read the real story on which this is based.Tom Hanks really harks back to his \"Wilson\" days with this performance. Singularly lifts and moves the entire plot and does it with aplomb. Not a single scene was misplaced or felt like it was over done. He was pitch-perfect. The supporting cast is no slouch either. Mark Rylance as the alleged Soviet spy is not only steadfast in his performance but his timing and delivery are wonderfully satisfying. Alan Alda (as Tom's boss), John Scott Shepherd (as the CIA agent), Dakin Matthews (as the trial judge), Mikhail Gorevoy (as the KGB chief), and Sebastien Koch (as GDR attorney) all turn in impeccable performances and hold their own in every scene with Tom Hanks. Such powerful acting by the supporting cast makes the lead actor look even better.The story is inspired by true events and if you're into that kind of thing (which I am) you'll be inspired to go investigate more for yourself. It's a slice of history that everyone should be aware of certainly and Steven Spielberg's storytelling is compelling and entertaining throughout. The cinematography, the costumes, the background score, and script really are some of the most satisfying things you'll see on screen this year. This is high-caliber movie-making. Worth every cent of the $12 I spent to see this movie in the theater.If you liked \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" you will absolutely love this movie.",

But each side continues to want their politics to come out on top, instead of considering the other side may have some \"right\" in their ideas too.So, in a great instance where art imitates life, I recommend Steven Spielberg's \"Bridge of Spies\" movie, now playing in theaters. It is one of the year's best, featuring some great performances from Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, and dares to believe patriotic duty and humanitarianism don't have to make strange bedfellows.",

    "review": "  Spielberg can be action packed, like Jurassic Park, or he can be slow and methodical, like Lincoln or Terminal, or even A.I. There is also some middle ground, with balls to the wall action and then moments of character development (see Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan). Bridge of Spies falls somewhere in between the two categories. Yes, it has action, but its mostly a drama where things move at a slower pace. That sometimes can hurt a film. The film spends the first half dealing with a Russian Spy who is captured in the U.S. and everyone believes Hanks can defend him in a court of law. Then we shift to Berlin, after the U2 is shot down over Russia. Hanks is brought on board to negotiate a transfer of prisoners, the American shot down over Russia for the spy living in NYC. The film picks up speed in Berlin and it stays until pretty much the end, which is a nice change in pace. Honestly, I had problems with the pacing, but they were minor. Some of the acting wasn't the greatest either, and I think this isn't Hanks' best film, nor is it even Spielberg's. SPR, E.T., and Jurassic Park still hold the title as my favorites (with E.T. being #1). Hanks is looking old, and worn out. He reminds me of my dad minus the mustache. The setting is ok. Cold War U.S. looks as it should. We explore the beginnings of the Berlin Wall which I thought was awesome, plus the sequence with the U2 was probably the best in the film. Overall it was slow, but still worth it. We saw it in the VIP seats at Marcus Theaters which means this film is probably not going to be showing much longer - this may even be the last week. The issue I had with the VIP seats was that they stick up too high, cutting into the screen as you look forward. Plus everybody and their brother always has to sit in front of us. Bridge of Spies is worth a shot though. As I said, Spielberg has better films, and so does Hanks. Look out for a cast member from Band of Brothers in the film as well. He plays a German kid. Next to see... Spectre of Flatulence.",

Some would like to have them waterboarded then shot...or hung, or dropped in acid. In the interest of acquiring a poker chip amid the Cold War, Tom's character lawyers a deal so that a Russian spy gets 30 years instead of the Electric Chair. Came in handy when it was time to trade for Francis Gary Powers, our downed U-2 pilot shot down over Russia in 1960, right about the time when the Berlin Wall was going up. Watch one gentle man's harrowing experience as he leaves his cushy comfort zone in America and ventures into a play-for-keeps game of cloak and dagger intrigue in East Germany, at the risk of his own life and reputation. 5 Stars.",

    "review": "  Although it is a charm to watch given the Spielberg-Hanks reunion as well as a script which co-credits the Coen Brothers, BRIDGE OF SPIES proves to be an all-in-all solidly-made film that is entertaining and more or less satisfying, but unfortunately a piece that plays too safe to transcend. SPIES features some smart and masterful filmmaking - as evident in its strong visual storytelling, well-crafted one-on-one exchanges, and clever editing (some amazing match cuts as well as Spielberg and DP Kaminsky's usual soft, glowy lighting amidst beautiful end frames to precise camera moves) - in addition to a steady yet immersive performance by both Hanks and Rylance. However, the film lacks the much-desired impact upon its delivery of turning points; the narrative is fancied with surprisingly funny moments and pleasurable scenes but the plot becomes a bit too easy - the grip never holds on, the sense of danger never reaches its potential, and likewise the end result is not as powerful as it was building up to be (Hanks' character appears to negotiate his ways through obstruction that operates more on its bark than its bite; there is a Cold War level of fear that tags along as opposed to being imposed and infused - with a Spielberg staple, trademark sentimental music, that does little to help). In the end, taking into account the genre of Cold War spy drama/thrillers, Spielberg's latest is simply a solid entry that services quite well but falls short of greatness.",

    "review": "  Steven Spielberg once again proves he can do no wrong, especially with real world material. Following the grand traditions of Amistad and Munich, Bridge of Spies is an incredibly fine, concise and versatile Cold War drama/thriller. With an impressively written script contributed oddly by the two and only Cohen Brothers, add to that under Spielberg's bold direction the film shines as one of his most finest films to date. Another big credit added towards the casting, with another impressive collaboration with Tom Hanks (making this their third collaboration), alongside the likes of other incredibly talented actors, particularly Mark Rylance (soon to be in Spielberg's BFG next year), and the gorgeously looking cinematography. The film itself, also tells it's story really well with minimal music by Thomas Newman, making this the third Spielberg film to be scored without John Williams. Overall, the film really challenges the rights of prisoners and country's laws and constitution in a time of great conflict where almost anything could happen. Lastly, it's a highly recommended film in which it's Oscar changes might be big.",

    "review": "  In a year, FILLED with over-blown, action-oriented secret agent films, Bridge of Spies comes along to remind us that films about espionage can be just as entertaining with crackling dialogue, brilliant acting, and tense scenes and don't require explosions and car chases to keep you invested. Steven Spielberg helms this true story about a Brooklyn lawyer who's tasked with defending a Soviet Spy in court and negotiating his safe passage home in exchange for an American P.O.W. and it is simply EXCELLENT! The script was co-written by the Coen Brothers and their snappy/hilarious dialogue was a joy to listen to, perfectly delivered by a talented ensemble cast with the always-outstanding, Tom Hanks leading the charge. The film is broken up into two distinctive parts with the first half being the court case and the second half taking place in Berlin with Hanks negotiating the swap of prisoners on the aptly named: \"Bridge of Spies\" and it was so refreshing to see a film so evenly balanced. Hanks' calm, collected performance as a man who truly believes everyone deserves a fair judgement, whether an immigrant or not, was captivating to say the least and the verbal chess he plays with many opposing parties were easily the highlights of the film. Another stand-out actor is the Soviet Spy, played by an actor I've never heard of named, Mark Rylance, and this guy had some of the best line delivery in the entire film and his acting seemed effortless. Unlike Spielberg's last historical drama, Lincoln, which bored me to death, this film keeps the pace going with fantastic editing between the numerous characters and also manages to make the history come across highly interesting! The two hours and twenty minute run-time flew by and I have to hand it to Spielberg for keeping me completely invested in an action-less film (save for one incredible plane crash sequence) and though it is a dialogue-driven film; boy does it drive!",

So I finally just watch Bridge of Spies and it was pretty damn good. Steven Spielberg once again made a great movie, and just like I said about Ridley Scott about how great it is that we still can go to the cinema today and see a new movie directed by an icon. Steven Spielberg is the type of director you never know what you're going to get and I'm talking about the type of film making he uses. Spielberg will always make a well directed movie even when some of his movie are not great or something you'll never watch again, it will be well directed. Steven Spielberg's directing in Bridge of Spies was absolutely superb, because every scene is so perfectly crafted and Spielberg knows when to cut to a emotional reaction with the characters. These a couple of scenes in this movie that I didn't notice was all in one long wide take with no breaks, and that's because I was so locked in on what was going on with the characters and the scene itself. Spielberg brilliance is still present today as he's masterful style of film making is still alive today. If you love that kind of film making that's so masterful, perfect and old school directing, then Bridge of Spies might be the movie for you. This is one of the best directed films I've seen so far this year.  Tom Hanks is one of the most lovable and respected actors of are times, as in every role he dose, he never disappoints. This is he's fourth collaboration with Spielberg after: Catch Me If You Can, Saving Private Ryan and The Terminal, and in Bridge of Spies Hanks once again deliverers a magnificent and believable performance. This is an Oscar worthy performance as he made his character so relatable, funny and very likable. Without spoiling anything, there's a scene in this movie where Tom Hanks character (James Donovan) gets followed by this unknown figure and at one point Donovan goes to sit at this restaurant to confront this man and the scene itself is just amazing, because Donovan knocks this guy to the ground with no action, just dialogue. Tom Hanks was amazing in this movie. Another performance that blow me away was Mark Rylance as the soviet spy. I have seen this actor before in the hit TV show \"Wolf Hall\", and he was great in that show, but he impressed the hell out of me in this movie, because Mark Rylance was absolutely fantastic. This guy deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor and I hope he dose, because it would be a huge sub if he doesn't get nominated. Mark Rylance was fan-freaking-tastic in this movie.The cinematography was excellent, the score was great, the dialogue is outstanding and the story was really good.Now for the problems: These a couple of scenes around the second act that wasn't that interesting to me.If you don't like talky movies then you may not enjoy Bridge of Spies, because this whole movie is nothing but talking and I know some people may not find that enjoyable. I'm the kind of person who likes dialogue driven movies and that's why I enjoyed this movie, because of the movies excellent dialogue and I how locked in I was while watching it, but I know it's not going to be for everyone and if you think this movie is boring because it's a talky movie then that's fine.Overall Bridge of Spies isn't Spielberg's greatest movie compared to his other ones, but it is a well crafted movie with excellent performances, fantastic directing and great writing. Bridge of Spies is the best Cold War thriller I've ever seen.",

Tom Hanks gives a great performance and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. His role of an insurance lawyer thrust into defending a known Russian spy and then brokering his exchange for Gary Powers is sometimes surreal, sometimes emotional but always with a touch of presence not often seen these days. Surprisingly little blood and what there is is very well done. All of the characters are pretty fully realized since they are based on real people, some of whom are probably still living. That's the thing about this film. While some of it is stylized for dramatic effect, most of it really happened...it's history you want to watch! An amazing film with terrific acting, sets, and a riveting, plausible story-line especially to those who remember those times. If it doesn't sweep the Oscars there is no integrity in cinema IMHO.",

    "review": "  I thought this film looked like your typical Spielberg/Hanks Oscar film so I wasn't in a huge hurry to rush out to see it (don't think I'm alone as it is doing okay at the box office, but didn't start out amazing or anything). But I did end up liking this film quite a bit and it wasn't 100% predictable (only like 80%). Tom Hanks is great in this and I loved some of the old shots of Germany and the Berlin wall, but it was Mark Rylance, who really stole the show for me as I felt like pulling for the Russian spy more than anyone else. I haven't heard his name out there for Oscar nominations just yet (maybe it's too early), but he would definitely have my vote as of right now. Overall, Bridge of Spies was a very good film that exceeded my expectations.",

The best parts of the movie are the scenes between Mark Rylance and Tom Hanks with the exception of their final scene which is a bit heartbreaking but also a bit nauseating because of the forced Spielberg sentimentality which normally works but not so much here. However, I would still strongly recommend this movie.",

A lot of people know about when Francis Gary Powers was shot down and released for some russian spy. Few if any of us know the details. Beyond that this movie is about our system of justice, and lack thereof at the highest levels. It shows the end of the 50's with wonderful detail, and sense of political sentiments at the time. The production is first rate. the acting is top notch. I won't say anymore other than this was one of the best Spielberg movies, with writing that excelled by the Joel and Ethan Coen. At some point, this movie should be required viewing for all Social Studies students.",

    "review": "  With BRIDGE OF SPIES, Steven Spielberg has crafted an effortlessly engrossing drama of human interaction, backroom dealing, and moral fortitude on the geopolitical stage. Far from being a dry account of events, the movie is a vital and engaging work of cinema, showcasing Spielberg still at the height of his powers and in full command of the cinematic form. Anchoring the story is Tom Hanks' work, and it's an incredibly inspiring performance, one that presents the character as a man of remarkable integrity; there's nothing splashy about it, simply a decency and moral authority that few (if any) other actors could convey as well as Hanks does. Like Atticus Finch or Jefferson Smith before him, Hanks' Donovan is a true believer in the American process and fights for it, even as he knows that he might not emerge truly victorious. Mark Rylance also makes a very strong impression in a performance that I consider a masterclass in understatement; so much of what Rylance does is deeply internalized, and that makes him a fascinating presence to watch. The production design - which is Oscar worthy - completely puts the audience in the time and place, and the presentation of East Berlin is particularly striking. The screenplay rather deftly weaves together its plot strands, and the second half of the film, which details the various intertwined and entangled agendas that Hanks' character must navigate, is absolutely enthralling; the script is also not without humor (of the very charming sort), which grounds the movie - which is otherwise about spycraft and the confrontations between the United States and the Soviet Union - with a degree of warmth and humanity. Some may see the movie as being lesser Spielberg; I would disagree, but even if that were the case, \"lesser\" Spielberg still tends to be pretty damn great, and BRIDGE OF SPIES is one of 2015's best films.",

The cast is fine though Mark Rylance is definitely the stand out in this political thriller. Tom Hanks is likable as always and does the job. Now i found the film fair and square that's unquestionable. Spielberg does know how to shoot a movie but somehow the film unraveled without any surprises or deep suspense. Some of the scenes were over the top and quite cliches but overall the film had its moments. The soundtrack was also very plain and unsurprising... a more tensed score would have maybe lifted a little bit the movie towards something more Hitchcock-ian. It's a well made film without much surprises but it will appeal to a broad audience.",

    "review": "  ??????? ????? aka James Donovan as played by Tom Hanks is an insurance lawyer turned international diplomat in this brilliant real world cold war story about spies, the CIA, the GDR, the KGB and all the other sinister organizations that you'd want in a suspense thriller.We can certainly say Steven Spielberg has not lost his touch for bringing war stories to life on the silver screen. What a brilliant performance all around from everyone involved. I had absolutely no idea what this movie was about and randomly picked it based on Rotten Tomatoes rating and I wasn't in the least disappointed. Now, I'm more interested than ever to read the real story on which this is based.Tom Hanks really harks back to his \"Wilson\" days with this performance. Singularly lifts and moves the entire plot and does it with aplomb. Not a single scene was misplaced or felt like it was over done. He was pitch-perfect. The supporting cast is no slouch either. Mark Rylance as the alleged Soviet spy is not only steadfast in his performance but his timing and delivery are wonderfully satisfying. Alan Alda (as Tom's boss), John Scott Shepherd (as the CIA agent), Dakin Matthews (as the trial judge), Mikhail Gorevoy (as the KGB chief), and Sebastien Koch (as GDR attorney) all turn in impeccable performances and hold their own in every scene with Tom Hanks. Such powerful acting by the supporting cast makes the lead actor look even better.The story is inspired by true events and if you're into that kind of thing (which I am) you'll be inspired to go investigate more for yourself. It's a slice of history that everyone should be aware of certainly and Steven Spielberg's storytelling is compelling and entertaining throughout. The cinematography, the costumes, the background score, and script really are some of the most satisfying things you'll see on screen this year. This is high-caliber movie-making. Worth every cent of the $12 I spent to see this movie in the theater.If you liked \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" you will absolutely love this movie.",

    "review": "  Bridge of Spies is the latest in a long line of Spielberg movies. It tells the story of Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) an insurance lawyer who is hired by the government to represent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) an accused Soviet spy during the cold war in the 50s. And afterward that case, Donovan is recruited by the United States government again to negotiate a prisoner trade of Abel, for american's held in the U.S.S.R.Things I Liked:Tom Hanks. Hanks is continuing to be one of my favorite actors. His work in this has great moments and they feel both like things you love about a Tom Hanks performance but also new things that show his growth as a performer and really make him stand out. He carries the movie well and really has a good sense of how big what he is doing is but also lighthearted moments that make us keep our eyes with him the entire film.Mark Rylance. Rylance is a virtual unknown in the movie world, but if you look at this stage credits you understand why this guy is so good. Rylance has this charm and calm demeanor that allows him to steal the scene. He can win your attention without saying a word, and when he does speak he take control of your attention and steals the movie. Rylance is brilliant in this movie.Things I Didn't Like:The Plot. The story of this movie is a little split focus and a bit cliched. The first half is Donovan defending Abel and it has all of the person does a thing no one likes and is forced to deal with the consequences moments that you see in other movies. The second half is the exchange and you don't spend enough time with the Americans Donovan is trying to win back, to care about them. The movie needed more time or needed to cut half of it's premise out and really focus on one part or another.Overall:Overall, the movie is a performance driven movie. All the cast is strong and the characters are all really well done. But the plot suffers from a number of issues that keep the film from really being a powerhouse. If the plot had just been about the relationship between Donovan and Abel this movie could have been spectacular but the way they split that with this second plot moment detracts and if not for the strong lead performances, particularly Hanks and Rylance, the movie would suffer.",

    "review": "  The notion that Spielberg is \"too sentimental\" is a claim that critics fall back on far too often, to the point that it's become an empty clich� in and of itself. Spielberg's films are rarely ever sentimental to the point of feeling cheesy or maudlin, simply settling comfortably in the realm of the old-fashioned, almost always to excellent results; Bridge of Spies fits into this niche well.There is legitimate craft to this work that people will intentionally overlook in order to write it off as \"just another biopic\" or as \"Oscar-bait\", both claims banal in their erroneousness. Spielberg utilizes mirrors as a subtle visual flourish to nod at the nature of perception, a theme that a film about spies and nations engaged in a battle of presentation through bluffs and propaganda would deal with extensively. He makes a poignant statement about the indoctrination of children in regards to their internalized fear and hatred of whomever is considered to be \"the enemy\" at the time, a relevant idea given the current political climate and the fact that one of the most popular candidates in the race for president in the Republican party has largely staked his campaign on demonizing the other to great success. It's absolutely gorgeous to look at. To put it bluntly, there are nuances and a depth to this film that need to be acknowledged as opposed to the trite trading of hackneyed, stock criticisms.This said, there are a couple of flaws that keep it from achieving perfection, namely its four endings that, while all well-done and intelligent in regards to the screenplay's construction, feel unnecessary and hokey in a way that the film as a whole had successfully avoided. The length is also a problem, not because it ever feels dull, but because there are some sequences that could be excluded in order for the production as a whole to feel tighter and more economic. However, these are minor, and given the fact that Hanks turns in an excellent performance and the direction is uniformly intelligent in every other regard, they can certainly be overlooked.",

    "review": "  During the height of the Cold War in the late '50s, insurance lawyer Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks, in his most casual, least \"actor-y\" performance in years) is enlisted to defend a Soviet agent apprehended in the US (Mark Rylance), and finds himself brokering a spy trade for two captive Americans in Eastern Europe. Jarringly low-key outing from Steven Spielberg is compelling and gets the period detail dead right, but at 141 minutes the film moves at a glacial pace, which isn't exactly thrilling, and lacks the emotional thrust of Spielberg's other \"grown-up\" pictures (particularly \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Schindler's List\"). Nevertheless, it's a well-made drama that offers fine acting all around and some dry humor around the periphery (likely courtesy of co-writers Ethan and Joel Coen).",

Going into his movie, I thought it would be better because it got a 92% critics review, 90% audience review, and because it was a Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg film. About 90% of this film were conversations between Tom Hanks' character and another character. There were only about 10 minutes of action, which were all presented in the trailer. This movie is not worth seeing.",

    "review": "  With the exception of a few Spielberg movies that I adore (\"Jaws\" being one), I run from cold to lukewarm on his films. He's undeniably an incredibly gifted director, but I dislike his instincts. He has a marked tendency to make any story drift to a comfortable middle ground that's palatable to the largest audience possible. He often compromises the central themes of his story to work back to a nice, comfortable ending. This film is a very clear instance of this tendency. It's not a bad film, but I found it to be a fundamentally disappointing film.",

Based on a true story of an unlikely prisoner exchange during the early 60s, Steve Spielberg evokes that period very well, as the contrasts between main land United States and cold war era Berlin are striking.Tom Hanks gives a tremendous performance as the attorney brow beat into defending a known Russian spy (played by Mark Rylance). Rylance's performance is equally as well done as the hapless old-hand Russian spy who provides both a resignation and nobility to the role.The only real knock on Bridge of Spies is the pacing, which is somewhat slow but between Hanks and Rylance, makes the valleys bearable.This is a really well done piece by a director who has brought a great story to the big screen and the kind of story telling that I'd love to see more from Hollywood. I fully expect to see this film on the short list for Oscar noms this year.",

    "review": "  What's Spielberg without war? He continues pushing out film after film involving some war story and somehow we can never get tired of it. We never feel like he's beating a dead horse. It's because the man encapsulates the classic ideals of cinema, and one of the last of his kind to do so.Spielberg's way of directing is the kind that invites you to come aboard, but never forces you to. He doesn't beg for your attention--you just can't help but give it to him--sometimes without even realizing.Bridge of Spies is a story about espionage, human rights, societal opinion, understanding your enemy, and American pride all wrapped up into one. It's at its very best when themes conflict and contradict with one another--which happens all throughout. Taking place in New York in the 1950s during the Cold War, it stars Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer chosen to represent captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Obviously, Donovan becomes one of America's most hated men, meanwhile developing a friendship with Abel and truly understanding his life and choices. Then tables are turned as now the Soviets have captured one of our own spies and Donovan must use Abel as leverage to trade back what is ours.Bridge of Spies constantly reminds us that at our worst we are still better than the Soviet Union. It acts as a good reminder of our humanity, even during the times that are most bereft of it. Perhaps it even satirizes our willingness to change our minds. While our viewpoints may be skewed at times by the media or even the government, it reminds us that we never quite know the whole story--although we're wholly convinced that we do at times. The first third takes place in America--presumably on purpose. It's a little darker than many other period pieces may depict it as--say even this year's The Man from U.N.C.L.E.--obviously a very specific perspective of the era. Then the last chunk of the film features the most depraved East Berlin. But the thing is, here we don't see it as any exaggeration. It's exactly how we've always envisioned it during that time. That's how it was--glum and depressing--another reminder.Spielberg uses juxtaposition to its finest potential, transitioning between scenes of Americans and Soviets--an American spy going to sleep in his cell after being tortured by Soviet soldiers cuts to Abel, the most hated man in America, being woken up respectfully by American prison guards.I will say, however, that there is something missing with the absence of a John Williams score in the film, but Thomas Newman's style fits nicely with the project adding the right amounts of emotion.The film adequately captures the misinformed fears of the early Cold War and uses them to get its points across. It's last reminder, and perhaps its strongest, is that you never know the whole story. When you stop thinking independently you begin allowing others to control you--much like the Soviets tried doing. It's crazy. Our fear was inadvertently becoming what it so desperately tried to avoid. How can you not love Spielberg? He brings magic back into the movies when we feel, at times, it may be gone forever. Bridge of Spies is superb--one of the year's best. This is why I go to the movies.Twizard Rating: 100",

    "review": "  Bridge of Spies is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks as a US attorney who is tasked with negotiating the release of a US spy in exchange for a Russian spy. Except for one sequence, the whole movie features Tom Hanks talking to various people and thanks to a compelling story and sharp writing the movie is extremely engaging from start to finish. For a 2h 15min movie its perfectly paced and there isn't a single scene that feels boring. The direction by Spielberg is terrific as he turns such a straightforward story into something so interesting and the script by the Coen Bros surprisingly has quite a bit of humour that works really well. Tom Hanks delivers a fantastic performance as always and his character is extremely likeable. Mark Rylance who plays the Russian spy is also great in the film. My issue with Bridge of Spies is that the scenes showing the american spy being captured in Russia wasn't as good as the ones with the Russian Spy. The character of the american spy wasn't really fleshed out and there was a particular scene which showed the Russians torturing the US prisoner before cutting to the US prison officials treating the Russian spy prisoner nicely. I am sure in real life both sides treated the prisoners harshly. However, these are minor flaws in an otherwise near perfect film. Bridge of Spies is one 2015's best films and is definitely a must watch. A",

But it started with a rather legal drama flavour and proceeded to the second half as thriller and ended with .. Well I don't know what to call the ending. I was so confused about what is going on in James Donovan's mind or what is his code of conduct which is making him make odd choices. That part is for writer. Now what I missed the most was John Williams, a movie like this could have worked a lot better with a progressive score to compliment it's pace but Thomas Newman's work is highly mediocre. On the bright side, Tom Hanks was very good with the performance. His best since Charlie Wilson's War (resemblance between both characters as negotiators and involvement of Russia). Costumes, Editing and Sets were worth praising too.Biggest thumb down towards Mr. Speilberg for using very old tactics of basing the humour between two key characters, in this case James Danavon and Rudolf Abel (both contender for Oscar), did not work. Same joke too many times. And movie also lacked intensity. There was not a single moment we felt that James' plan would not fall through.Overall, movie is watchable for it's not mater much departments, which makes it not much enjoyable.",

    "review": "  The marketing force behind Spielberg's recent work labels \"Bridge of Spies\" as a cold war thriller. There is an argument to be made that this label might be slightly misleading (perhaps in line with the trailers that turn the 2 hr and 15 minute full future in to a fast paced two minute summary... which in itself is somewhat ironic given that Spielberg has fused the 5 years that exists between arrest and exchange of the American/Soviet spies in to a conveniently brisk narrative). In truth the film is less thriller and more of a social commentary (of the cold war era) and patient character film. There is not much in the way of action (the narrative itself is almost entirely dialogue driven), rather the film moves forward primarily through the development of the relationship between Abel (Rylance) and Donovan (Hanks). With possible mixed expectations aside, Bridge of Spies as a commentary and as a character film, Bridge of Spies is a very good film.  The reality of the Cold War was less about military force and more about competing ideologies. Spielberg deftly navigates this particular dynamic with a sharp and intentional examination of American patriotism (or patriotism in general) that moves beyond flag waving to the heart of what it means to be truly free (which, as Donovan points out in the role of Abel's criminal defence lawyer, is about erasing the lines that divide our Irish, German, Russian backgrounds and learning to live on equal ground with equal rights).The most interesting part of the film (for me) is the relationship between Abel and Donovan. There is a scene at the end that finds Hank's character returning to his homeland and looking out at a few kids who are jumping a fence in their backyard. The scene is intended to bring us back to the horrifying picture that he is leaving behind of the concrete fence of Berlin. For all that this scene conjures emotionally, Spielberg has assured that we are able to interpret it through the lens of the Abel/Donovan relationship. It is interesting to note that the film has no real villain, reminding us that in the ideological battles of the cold war that there are no real winners, no real sides to take when human lives are the ultimate causalities. In the end there are only the ideals themselves, the things that hold us together as a Country and as a world. This is what Abel and Donovan represent. What makes these two characters so interesting is their competing performances. On their journey towards a mutual understanding and respect, their respective paths are expressed uniquely. In both cases they are faced with the complicated questions of loyalty (in respect to the ideologies they are protecting), and in both cases they must carry the weight that appears to hangs in the balance of their particular case. For Donovan, on the surface this is the unsettling of his job, his family and his life/safety. His character remains fairly transparent, and he wears his concern on his sleeve. The character of Abel is much more complicated, offering a counter to Donovan's emotional clarity. In many ways Abel is the one who embodies the tension that moves the discussion of patriotism forward. He reminds us that what is on the surface (a British accent and a mysterious background) is not always the most accurate picture of what lies underneath. His seeming lack of concern for his own life hides some deep set emotional response to Donovan's compassion. This is meant to remind us that for all that we do to erect the walls that divide us in this world, there is nothing more penetrating than acts of compassion. On a purely historical level, the film does a wonderful job of bringing to stark realism of watching the wall go up brick by brick. While the story of the American spy ultimately sits in the background (as a less interesting subplot), the trajectory of the narrative itself manages to bring us in on the tension of the era. There is a wonderful scene between Donovan and his son in which his son is desperately preparing for the eventual nuclear attack. It is this sort of fear that seems to persist in modern day terrorism and nuclear pacts. It is this sort of fear that sits behind our tendency to stereotype demographics and cultural groups in to victims and enemies, heroes and villains. Spielberg represents a timely and timeless dialogue on what it means to exist together in a complicated landscape. For as dark and important as all of this is, the Coen Brothers credit as screenwriters deserves mention. They keep the film light hearted and humorous as it moves through some heavy history and themes. They bring a knack for humorous dialogue that makes the film (dare I say) fun. Combined with Spielberg's visual vision, Bridge of Spies is understated in many ways in terms of how smart it actually is. It deserves multiple viewings (I think... I have only seen it once to date) to allow some expertly crafted scenes and clever and fast moving dialogue to fully sink in. The film resonates, but behind the film are many memorable scenes. And what pulls it all together is the transparent nature of Hank's acting skills and his likeable nature. It is easy to believe in what he stands for, and he is in great form in this return to a Spielberg/Hanks partnership. Rylance likewise fills in the counter balance with a wonderfully intriguing performance that makes (what is less screen time than Hanks) every moment count. Bridge of Spies reminds me less of some of Spielberg's older works, and more of something along the lines of Monument Men, or maybe even something like Catch Me if You Can. Important but fun, patiently paced but fast moving dialogue. Dark but illuminating in terms of historical drama. Interpreting an event or era through its dominating theme (in the case of Monument Men, exposing what hangs in the balance of the destruction of our world's art; and in the case of Bridge of Spies, interpreting the affect of the Cold War on our ideological divisions). Most importantly though, the film is memorable, and is a nice addition to Spielberg's long list of successful films.",

    "review": "  This is a very well directed movie. The production design is very good, the cinematography is also very good and the actors are great in their respective roles. But if you are not the slightest bit interested in the Cold War and the espionage between the United States and the U.S.S.R during this time, then you will be bored out of your mind. Luckily for me, I do like history and enjoyed this movie for what it is. I realize that I am not the demographic for this. After the screening I attended, a bunch of elderly ladies stood up in front of me and said, \"It's an amazing film because we were alive when it happened. Weren't we Susan?\" That shows you that this is a historical drama, not an action war film. So don't go into this expecting Saving Private Ryan. Also, Steven Spielberg's signature magic was not front and centre. You don't realize you're watching a Steven Spielberg film until the credits roll. You just think you are watching a well-made historical drama. If negotiation dialogue is your forte, then this film is for you. As for me, I'm glad I saw it, but doubt I will see it again.",

    "review": "  Cry yourself a river because Spielberg hasn't been there lately, watch this movie, and get over it.Bridge of Spies is an incredibly well shot, well directed, and well told film about James Donovan an american attorney asked with defending and later on negotiating a trade between two spies from separate parts of the world. Steven Spielberg does an incredible job behind the camera with truly breathe taking visuals. Hanks as well as Rylance, both give fantastic performances. The story telling and structure is great except for some slow scenes near the middle with rather dull dialogue. Bridge of Spies reminds us that movies about spies don't have to be action packed.",

Respects to these two great veterans.Though the film was carried in a quite steady pace--nothing too dramatic, a few scenes remained in my mind. The first, of course, being the choice of ending, and the full of contrasts: New York Subway vs. S-Bahn, the attitudes of the passengers and those of the news, children crossing the wall/fence...of course, Coen Brothers participated in the script.Another one being the great performance of both Mr. Hanks and Mark Rylance. Rudolf Abel is really full in characters. Again, nothing too dramatic, but the power such these actors flow like water. Mr. Hanks was without doubt the best candidate for this character.Oh, BTW, bad choice of title.20151103 @ Village East.",

Yeah Spielberg, we get that East Germany was a failed and brutal state. Did you really have to rub it in by having Donovan witness people actually being shot while trying to climb the wall? I doubt Donovan did witness that. It seems too perfect to be true. Did you really have to include those scenes of people reading the newspaper in the train? Or the kids climbing the fence?

Set during the climax of the Cold War, Tom Hanks convincingly portrays an insurance lawyer caught between two ferns. As we have come to expect from Hanks, he is outstanding whilst paired with Steven Spielberg. Mark Rylance is particularly noticeable as the Soviet agent. He is able to conceal his emotions but at the same time he evokes a strong sense of empathy within the viewer. One of the only faults with the film is that there isn't an abundance of suspense. The plot follows a straight-forward path, but the spectacular acting and definitive direction cover up any other flaws that the film has.",

    "review": "  Steven Spielberg is by far one of the most prolific filmmakers in modern history, from suspenseful adventures like the Indiana Jones franchise and Jurassic Park to heartwarming classics like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and Schindler's List. The list goes on and on. Tom Hanks on the other hand is known for films such as Big, Forrest Gump, and Apollo 13. He also played the voice of Sheriff Woody in the Toy Story films. Both men are committed liberals, but what differentiates them from others in their ilk are they're Americans first, and lift-wingers later. That's one of the reasons why their latest film together, Bridge of Spies, puts political posturing aside to focus on an exchange of a Russian spy named Rudolph Abel for American soldier Francis Gary Powers.Hanks plays James B. Donovan, an attorney who in real life mainly did not work on defense cases. That all changed during the cold war. In 1957, KGB spy Rudolph Ablel was arrested in Brooklyn by the FBI after retrieving a secret message from a park bench. Now, it's up to Donovan to defend him at all costs. You might think that Spielberg is sympathizing with the enemy here (since he made the Russian Czars the enemy of the Jews in the 1986 animated film An American Tail, only the Czars were cats and the Jews were mice who want to move to America), but that really isn't the case. The film's goal is to show the risks lawyers have to take. Defense lawyers have to do whatever it takes to defend their clients in the most controversial of instances, even if it means having to exchange a Russian spy for an American soldier. Eventually he successfully gets his wish, and consider that a spoiler alert, because history always spoils itself - even in film).No doubt, this film proves Steven Spielberg still has the skill and the ambition that made him a huge star in the 70's and 80's. The script was a great fit for him, and I don't know anyone other than Spielberg who can. This is by far the best film out of this year's Oscar contenders. With Spielberg's name on it though, it's more than just a crowd pleaser - it's a film any adult can enjoy instead of just arthouse elitists.",

Yes, Tom Hanks does an amazing job, but Mark Rylance (who played the accused Russian spy Rudolph Abel) owned every scene he was in. Bridge of Spies shoots straight into Spielberg's collection of great films. I wouldn't say it's his best (if you don't know Spielberg's directorial library, I don't know what to tell you), but if almost any other director did this, it would immediately become their greatest film ever. The script, casting, cinematography, and acting were all top-notch. Tom Hanks brings his character, James Donovan, to life. If the supporting cast, especially Mark Rylance, weren't up to par, Hanks may have stood out more, but everyone involved was fantastic. The only things for me was that there was a lot going on and as the story jumped from one idea to the next, and it took a few seconds to process and fit these scenes into the story. There were also a couple of times where it seemed to get a little long, but the scenes were all necessary to get ideas across and make the ending work the way it did.

In fact both of them were spectacular and they had to be after all we had Coen brothers and Hanks backing it. However , what causes the disappointment is soporific tone of story-telling. The perspectives that Spielberg wanted to portray are fragile and not convincing enough to captivate the audience. What stood out was the portrayal of Donovan's character in upholding the values of justice despite a contraindicating public opinions and pressure from highly powerful authorities. But that seemed to be the single most motive of that movie. That seemed to narrow as a scope , the Berlin wall incident and the Russian Spying incident felt like appendices to the long drawn legal and diplomatic battle. Also the facts were pretty misleading and differ from reality.",

Spielberg remains as confident as ever and the cast, lead by a great Tom Hanks, if uniformly great. Still, Bridge Of Spies is too run of the mill to call truly excellent even if the story if fascinating and compelling. Spielberg continues to be risk-averse but at this point is his career, he's earned the right to make whatever film he'd like. So it's nice that he's still able to make quality films.",

    "review": "  Brian Tallerico's review in the Chicago Sun Times best captures the essence of BRIDGE OF SPIES in his keen observations on the first scene: \"Steven Spielberg's 'Bridge of Spies' opens with a shot of a man looking in a mirror as he paints a nearly-complete self-portrait. The man is shot from behind. We are not really seeing 'him.' We are looking at two reflections, one in glass and one in watercolors. The truth is in the middle. This duality of perception vs. reality and, eventually, the concept of those three triangular points of interest (reflection, man, painting)-which look similar but aren't quite-will resurface in 'Bridge of Spies,' a daring, studied, mannered true story that is at once remarkably genuine and deeply cinematic at the same time.\" Spielberg's newest historical film does a remarkable job of capturing the tensions of the cold war by using a case study of a covert prisoner exchange. The writing talents of the Coen Brothers combined with brilliant acting (especially from Mark Rylance), editing/pacing, and cinematography make BRIDGE OF SPIES one of the most well constructed movies of the year as well. The story is about an American attorney (Hanks) secretly employed by the FBI to negotiate a prisoner exchange with Russia that neither government wishes to publicize. All along the way, political dialogue that may be relevant to contemporary affairs is surfaced. Spielberg's resume proves he is definitely in the \"if you don't learn from history, you are doomed to repeat it\" camp. While sometimes the messages feel perhaps a little too overt or are maybe a bit too much of a slap on the back for good old 'Merica, there are also great moments that are both acknowledging of United States' flaws and hopeful that people will ultimately try and do good. The concept of \"good\" is a bit complicated in this movie about spies, but the complication makes things interesting. On one hand, the protagonist is adamant that rule of law be the ultimate marker of righteousness and fairness, whereas, on the other, he is a bit deceptive, often insubordinate, and has a tendency to do what he thinks is right whether that matches well with the authorities' opinions or not. Sometimes he is a bit like modern superheroes, who bend rules while avoiding explicitly breaking them. The kicker for this narrative is that the protagonist's rule bending is always out of sympathy for his fellow man - no matter where they are from or who they represent. In short, he wins battles in a war with virtually no weapon except kindness. This reminder is sorely needed and every audience can benefit from ruminating on it.",

I think we all know that I'm going to say the story is re-told very well, the cinematography is just phenomenal, and the characters are relatable with fantastic casting consisting of Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, as well as a great director like Steven Speilberg, but what makes this movie so fantastic, is that it had one thing that most movies that are based on history nowadays don't usually have... the feeling of reality. Throughout this movie, I felt like I was going with Donovan on his trips to defend soviet spy Rudolph Abel and get him back to Berlin. This is one of Speilberg's best movies to this day and I can't wait to get this on DVD!!! Another one of the must watch films of 2015!!!!",

You can see and hear Joel and Ethan Coen's work here. In truth, I did miss John Williams score on this SS piece, but Thomas Newman captures the mood pretty well especially in the Berlin scenes.The cast too, especially Hanks in yet another every guy role that he just nails with toughness and common sense while still showing a little bit of concern yet still throwing himself right into the fire.A stand out is Mark Rylance as the captured Russian spy, he sounds a bit Scottish from time to time but as an actor, he shines.and for fans of Trailer Park Matt Damon Breaking Bad-bad guy, Jesse Plemons, he is in it as well.Lots of throw backs all through this film and that adds to the humor.see it, damn good movie.This and The Martian for sure Oscar contenders",

Well, I'm happy to say that Bridge of Spies is a fantastic thriller with amazing dialogue and directing.Tom Hanks is amazing, as always. I didn't see him as Tom Hanks. He pulled off the dialogue perfectly. The rest of the supporting cast were excellent as well, mainly Mark Rylance. I'm expecting a best supporting actor nomination for him.I was really invested in the story. Though it there is very little action, the superb dialogue and intriguing story make up for it. I loved the progression of the story and the finale. Steven Spielberg's direction is nearly flawless and utterly gorgeous.The editing, musical score, cinematography and lighting were all fantastic. My only problem with the film is that it seemed a little \"Hollywood-like\" and predictable.Overall, Bridge of Spies is fantastic. It has great dialogue, excellent acting and amazing directing.

I wouldn't classify this as a great film whatsoever, but I enjoyed it. I mean I was hoping for a little more suspense and intrigue, but this one is laid out in a straight-forward manner. The good here is certainly the acting, set pieces are top notch and really the relationship between Hanks and his the spy he is defending Mark Rylance. What this isn't is a tense thriller but more of a relationship drama and a story of a guy who won't let his morals be compromised. Not one of the great Spielberg works, but certainly a good movie.",

More minimalist and space compared to other Spielberg films in keeping with his milennial look and technique, Master Steven hold the tension well and Hanks holds the screen well as the idealistic Jimmy Stewart type fighting for the little guys against the big Governmental cogs,and what is most remarkable is that Thomas Newmans score ducks into the proceedings without skipping a beat as if he had always been the composer for Spielberg and not John Williams.

Nikita and Ike spy on one another's nuclear arsenals. Colonel Abel is a chain- smoking Russian mastermind communication expert who is \"ratted\" out by an incompetent Russian agent who defects. The FBI nabs the Colonel --dressed only in his undershorts--who resembles your Uncle Herman in the Bronx.  James Donovan (Tom Hanks)is assigned to defend the laconic Colonel.Despite a decent defense, the Colonel Abel is found guilty and awaits sentencing--quite possible execution. \"Aren't you ever worried ?\" asks Donovan who is perplexed by Colonel Abel's mild demeanor. \"Why be worried\" --answers Colonel Abel, \"Would it do any good?\" Donovan has a strategy that may spare the Colonel--why not spare him for a swap. This brilliant cold war chess move keeps both sides from checkmating g each other and ends in a draw. He is eventually swapped for our civilian weather pilot who strays into Russian territory with three brownie cameras scotch- taped to his piper cub who mistakingly thinks he's in Kansas.  StevenSpielberg directs so nicely that we forget we are watching a film. The Coen Brothers helped script the irony of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction).",

Its a political drama, which you would think would probably bore most, but I promise, this movie will have you sucked into the story from the beginning to the end.",

    "review": "  Bond of men in the coldest of times.Capturing the weight and gloom of an era, Bridge of Spies is equally a biopic and an unexpected light drama. There's a lingering intensity, especially concerning the world of secrecy, yet it's a fascinatingly accessible story with subtle refined humor. This is meant to inspire instead of evaluation of ideologies, showcasing that humanity still resides beyond the other side of border or wall.Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is an alleged Soviet spy, he's caught and set for a trial. For his defense James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is unceremoniously selected, mainly for the purpose of procedure. After a while Donovan becomes invested on defending his client despite the unusual circumstance, it then takes him on a journey to help CIA save their own agent.Despite the rather shady title, this is not the flamboyant gunslinger action ala James Bond or the intense operation like Argo. It is, strangely and also effectively, a light foray into the otherwise dark world of espionage. The pace is utterly calm, credit goes to Mark Rylance as Abel, who occasionally shows the pettiness of worrying.He and Tom Hanks have incredible chemistry, both of the characters practically have nothing in common aside from the mutual respect towards each other. Donovan himself is avid negotiator, he pushes his objective with verbal aggression, yet the movie almost never resorts to violence and even on few occasions that it does venture to bleak territory, it does so with sophistication.Rather than using typical war buildup, the movie gives faces to each party, thus humanizing them in incredibly identifiable way. It also deals with the issues of the era head-on while maintaining composure and suspending judgment. Lastly, it offers a soft touch of comedy along the way. The unexpected banters lighten the mood with timely cynical quip, it doesn't undermine the theme and still gives polished interaction between the supposed stoic personalities.Bridge of Spies is perhaps one of the most accessible depictions of a war. It might set in Cold War and showcase the grim reality of it, yet it never falters on presenting honor, duty and the best side of humanity in less than favorable time.",

The cold war is not at the top of my list in terms of most interesting time periods but that's personal preference as this half century or so of the 20th century is chock-full of stories from the neighborhood to the warzone. In this film, the neighborhood is the war zone, or at least it could have been. That was the interesting and exciting thing to me - watching a man fight for what he believes, fight for great principles even when the country he's fighting for doesn't understand, his family doesn't understand, his bosses don't understand, even his client doesn't understand. In an era of fear, he rose above it to dispense justice. But the film moves on from the trial of the spy to the prisoner exchange which isn't as interesting to me as the defense of the spy was. This was 2 movies put into one and even the master, Spielberg, whom I still believe can do no wrong, can't make it thrilling and heart-pounding all the way through. I look back and think that there aren't many scenes where I was feeling the tension. This movie could have racked up the suspense and the uncertainty a LOT. Having said this, it's still a well made film and none of the performances will leave you wanting more. It's simply the story that will and the experience. More of a slice of history than a full blown piece of drama.",

Hanks is the perfect acting multi-tool, properly slotting himself into a role and becoming that role as well as (or better than) anyone in Hollywood. The problem with this film and with Spielberg as a whole is that flawless execution simply doesn't, in and of itself, make a classic, all-time film. And that is all that Bridge of Spies has going for it. The movie is 100% risk free. It is a politically correct (as of just recently), all-American film that properly serves to appease white upper class Americans with visions of an imaginary utopia of traditional families and American values. There was no way this couldn't sit well with critics or financiers and that attitude has defined Spielberg ever since he attempted to finish A.I. for Kubrick. The fact of the matter is that there is nothing to define his latest film from the rest of crowd this year. Bridge of Spies is dull, by-the-book and an ultimately disappointing entry from a director that used to be among the great innovators in Hollywood.",

    "review": "  BRIDGE OF SPIES is a solid Cold War period drama with interesting characters, but what it isn't is exciting. It acts like it wants to be a great political spy thriller, but it's all politics and no thrill. It sets itself up to be a great courtroom drama, but then skips all that to get to the politics. And while the characters are interesting, the most engaging part of the movie is the setting, which is masterfully done. The set design alone is a work of art. Where Spielberg is normally a master at emotional manipulation, in this case, I feel he falls a little short of his usual genius. For all it's potential drama, it's a very quiet movie about men doing their jobs. Donovan does his job in New York. He goes to Berlin to do another job. He meets men there who are doing their jobs. There's a little intrigue involved in the manipulation of the events, but in the end, it's all very matter-of-fact, and Spielberg seemed to direct it with that same sort of approach. Honestly, had I not known Spielberg was behind this one, I wouldn't have been able to tell it was one of his movies.BRIDGE OF SPIES gets a \"Netflix It\" on Talon's Movie Scale.",

    "review": "  [10/25/15] Steven Spielberg proves once again that he is a master at his craft. His efforts, apart from being some of the most famous and influential, are always easy to appreciate, and \"Bridge of Spies\" is no exception. I almost made the mistake of not seeing this in theaters; I was supposed to see \"The Martian\" (and I will at some point later) but I'm glad I got see Spielberg's latest masterpiece. It's damn near flawless, of course, I may be biased when I say that since I'm somewhat fond of the Cold War. As usual, no spoilers. And I'm not going to summarize the plot (I never do anyways). But I will say this, for a movie with scene after scene of dialogue and more dialogue, I was totally into the film. Tom Hanks is, god, he's amazing. I mean, if there were ever a Church of Tom Hanks, you'd find me praying there. All kidding aside, yeah, \"Bridge of Spies\" is a political thriller that gets done what it needs to get done. There is no filler in this movie, every scene plays a role in getting us to the pivotal point of the film. Spielberg somehow knew what to show us and what to leave out. There is a great, Great scene between Hanks and his character's son in that it represents the fears and concerns of the country (U.S) as a whole. It's not that long but, again, Spielberg knew that all we needed was a short scene. And speaking of Hanks, the first time we're introduced to his character--there is a long take where Hanks talks for about a full minute, uninterrupted, and it was just a great shot. Everything he says in that one take tells us almost everything we need to know about him. Talk about making an entrance. Also worth mentioning is that one of Spielberg's long-time collaborators, composer John Williams, was unable to score the film due to a minor health issue. So, Thomas Newman stepped onto the plate and provided a score that has a touch of Williams while tending to his own style. It's not a detriment or anything like that, but it was something that showed up in various articles when first announced because the Spielberg/Williams train has been rolling without a break since 1985. Interestingly, there's not a whole lot of music to be found here, I mean, the first 20 minutes or so have no music. Overall: \"Bridge of Spies\" is one of the year's best films and that's really all that needs to be said.",

    "review": "  Spielberg, Hanks, Coen Brothers. Rarely have there been so many members of the Hollywood royal family working together on a single motion picture. With this calibre of talent involved the expectations are unsurprisingly sky high; unfortunately this Cold War true story lands in the 'good, but not good enough' category and subsequently feels like a missed opportunity. At first it's difficult to pinpoint why the spark is missing as all the ingredients for an old-school espionage yarn are present, but after careful contemplation it seems to me that Spielberg may be going through the motions. His direction is purposely understated to be sure, although there is a distinct lack of oomph in his narrative propulsion that is strangely un-Spielbergian. There's also never any real sense of Hanks' American attorney being in danger, despite spending large chunks of time in war-torn Berlin liaising with shadowy Russian diplomats and volatile German soldiers. Nevertheless, this thriller predominantly satisfies thanks to another heartfelt performance from main man Hanks. His put upon lawyer is righteous but grounded, intelligent but humble, fearful but optimistic, all with a welcome dash of wit. In fact it's the Brooklyn-set first act that proves the most entertaining, when it's mostly a two-hander between Hanks and Mark Rylance's dryly-humorous Russian spy, the latter damn near stealing the show right from under Hanks' nose. With regular Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski on hand as director of photography, the movie looks utterly spectacular too, the glowing courtrooms of New York just as impressive as the snowy streets of a war-ravaged Germany. Bridge of Spies is a solid Cold War thriller with a compelling protagonist, yet with the Tinseltown heavyweights involved I can't help but think it's also somewhat of a disappointment.",

The excellent cast gives great performances across the board, particularly Hanks in the lead (doing his best Jimmy Stewart) and Mark Rylance as the accused Soviet spy he must defend. The script, co-written by Joel and Ethan Coen, shows a surprising degree of their influence mixed with Spielberg's trademarks, resulting in a story that's as surprisingly funny as it is earnestly inspiring. This is a film that can easily be recommended to just about anyone, showcasing one of our biggest (and greatest) directors continuing to work at his A-game.",

Hanks is note-perfect in this role, and not a wrong note is sounded throughout the entire film. A wonderful experience.",

    "review": "  Saw Bridge of Spies tonight. Technically flawless, writing, acting, direction; all lush and inviting. I think the way Spielberg tells the story, almost from a perspective of a misty-eyed innocence is the most compelling aspect of the film for me. From the lavish use of diffused, almost dream-like lighting to the film-maker's nods and winks to us like graphically including the audience in circles of conversation and an almost pedantic use of diegesis of both lighting and sound, Spielberg creates a world of spies that almost certainly did not exist in anything other than movies, a world that he captures perfectly in a capsule of rich detail and short, concise phrases that move rapidly along through a time soon to be all but forgotten. Spielberg almost never offers us the taste of the actual poison at the center of the capsule except for a brief pas-de-deux depicting the raw brutality of The Wall, and a man's memory of an event there who's power has diminished with time. I am not sure what the film will mean to me over time, but I suspect that it is another of Spielberg's museum pieces designed to capture forever in one of his magical snow-globes, a gift to those of us that will never truly understand what our fathers and mothers had to go through to give us what we may take for granted from time to time. 9 out of 10 Hankses.",

    "review": "  4/5 With any Spielberg film, one can expect impeccable craft in all areas, and Bridge of Spies certainly has that. I can't say, however, that the film measures up to Spielberg's best, or even comes all that close. It's a good film for sure because of the witty screenplay from the Coen brothers, and the craftsmanship makes for an entertaining thriller. But the story is flawed and it lacks the kind of spark you get from Spielberg's best. The film starts out great with a thrilling music-less chase sequence. Mark Rylance as the captured soviet spy, Abel, is excellent, embodying a mysteriously compelling character whose presence dominates the film's first act. Tom Hanks will meet your expectations as the American lawyer hired to defend the soviet spy. The conflict between Tom Hanks and the rest of America as Hanks tries to give Abel a fair, constitutional trial in the first act is very engaging. Not only that, but the film's beginning also features a tension between the quiet and observant Mark Rylance and Tom Hanks that we hope to see develop in the rest of the film. Abel is so mysterious that we naturally want to find out more about his character and watch a relationship between him and Hanks unfold. Unfortunately, the film's second act almost entirely abandons Abel and the initial storyline when Hanks goes overseas to try to swap captured spies with Russia. While still entertaining, the story lost the promise of digging into Abel and has a less compelling story that feels oddly disconnected from the first. Sure, in both Tom Hanks is working for justice, but the difference is that he initially fights for constitutional justice and later just wants to bring home two Americans instead of one by being persistent, a less complex thing to honor. Throughout, the film is kept afloat through the screenplay, the final draft of which was edited by the Coen brothers, and it really shows. I loved the way that humor was woven throughout the film. The dialogue was consistently witty, and the jokes were surprisingly funny. Had the dialogue not been so fun, the film may have been boring, but thankfully it never was. It's also great that we have Tom Hanks in the lead because he nails the comedy. As usual, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg create splendid visuals with full compositions and lots of backlighting (some of which felt excessive and purposeless). The art direction and music everything was great, but none of it felt used in an original way, or a way that hasn't been done better in Spielberg films before. Abel comes back in the end of the film, but it's hard not to feel that we didn't know him as much as we could have. It's also hard to pinpoint exactly what about Hanks' character we should celebrate. It's clear that he's a hero, but there are two different things that he does that are heroic and they don't connect that well. You'll leave the film with an approving eyebrow raise followed by a shrug. It's not a particularly heartfelt film and doesn't have much Spielberg magic, but it's definitely good, and that doesn't quite cut it for Spielberg. Hopefully The BFG will be more magical.",

    "review": "  Bridge of Spies is quite simply a masterpiece. I suppose a movie directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Tom Hanks and written by the Coen brothers was always going to be masterfully crafted but this goes well beyond that. It literally reeks of authenticity and tells an extremely complex story in a very simple way. Mark Rylance, so brilliant as Thomas Cromwell in BBC mini-series Wolf Hall, steals the picture in my opinion as soviet spy Rudolf Abel and the scenes of an about to be split-down-the-middle Berlin are almost newsreel like in their realism. If you are only going to see one movie this year I urge you to see this one because you will see nothing better.",

    "review": "  An old-school spy thriller from Steven Spielberg where he employs his skills at building tension? Sign me up. Bridge of Spies won't exactly win over the Transformers crowd, but it's a potent historical drama crafted by experts. Start with director Steven Spielberg and star Tom Hanks, working from a script by Matt Charman that was polished by no less than the Coen brothers. The subject is the pivotal moment in the Cold War when an American U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960 and the U.S. had to negotiate the release of its captured pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). The only way to do it, according to lawyer James B. Donovan (Hanks), is to exchange Powers for Col. Rudolf Abel (the terrific Mark Rylance), a British-born Russian spy working undercover in Brooklyn until he's caught by the FBI and jailed on conspiracy charges in 1957. His capture, excitingly staged by Spielberg, begins the movie on a high note.Then things get a bit harder to sell. Start with the insistent score by Thomas Newman in for Spielberg regular John Williams. Even the trailer does the film a disservice ('In the shadow of war, one man showed the world what we stand for.')That one man is Hanks, an actor with infinite gifts for understatement (just check Spielberg's own Saving Private Ryan). So really that rah-rah and trumpets are highly unnecessary. Donovan works as an insurance lawyer with a wife (Amy Ryan) and children. When his boss (Alan Alda) volunteers him to represent Abel, Donovan is suddenly reviled as the man trying to free a traitor. Hanks expresses Donovan's quiet heroism with amazing restraint. The script does him no favors by pushing for more cheer, with Abel dubbing him 'the standing man' who gets back up to do right when knocked down.Bridge of Spies is best when it steps more into the gray areas, such when Donovan sees Abel and Powers as patriots simply doing the bidding of their respective countries. It resonates best when Spielberg delivers on action that defines character, as in Donovan's Berlin trip where he's nearly killed as a result of conspiracies. During the climactic prisoner exchange on the Glienicke Bridge there are moments when we cannot tell good from bad, and the cliches of spy movies suddenly become potent and provocative.",

    "review": "  When you team up the Cohen brothers as writers with the masterful storyteller and director Steven Spielberg, you expect to get something special. And BRIDGE OF SPIES is just that - something special. It's the true story of James B Donovan (Tom Hanks), a lawyer with no criminal trial experience, who is asked by the US government to defend a Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance). It's a great story of a great man who served his country with integrity, despite the personal costs to himself. It's gratifying to see a true hero on screen in contrast to all the fantasy heroes we are used to seeing of late. The pace of the movie is subdued, but it is engaging and finishes with us on the edge of our seats. The cinematography is excellent and portrays the Cold War period well along with the story that breathes new life into this genre. Hanks is excellent in the starring role and all supporting cast are good. A solid spy drama that tells an important story. Go see it!",

    "review": "  Bridge of Spies is a Cold War thriller that is as subtle and understated as most of its characters. The narrative tells the little known backstory of Soviet KGB spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and his defense by American lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) against the wishes of an unforgiving public mood. Later, we see Donovan in East Berlin successfully negotiating his exchange with captured U2 pilot Gary Powers and an American student imprisoned by the East German Stasi. Bridge has fairly average direction and Tom Hanks largely plays himself as is his habit, but then again that's the advantage of being a national treasure. Spielberg and Hanks can give in rather perfunctory work and it will stand out above many others simply by default. I'd argue that Mark Rylance is the true gem of the picture and his simple, quotable dialogue, weary but observant expressions, and stoic demeanor make him the most memorable element. That and it features a fairly strong script written by the Coen Brothers. In summation, Bridge of Spies fails to reinvent the genre but it didn't need to - it tells a story more Americans and Russians need to learn and it tells it well.",

    "review": "  Spielberg delivers again with the excellent Cold War thriller, BRIDGE OF SPIES. The direction and performances make BRIDGE OF SPIES another Hanks/Spielberg success. Hanks's turn as Jim Donovan, insurance-lawyer-turned-prisoner-negotiator, was truly riveting to watch. Hanks once again shows why he is the most likable actor in the business by showing the motivation and courage to do what he believes to be right, while also adding wit and charm to help the audience relate to the character. Hanks displays one the best performances of his career. The biggest suprise in the film was the performance by Mark Rylance. As good as Hank's performance was, in my opinion, Rylance stole almost every scene he was in. Rylance portrayed accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel, with such heart-warming emotion and charm that he made the audience feel sympathetic for a SOVIET SPY during the Cold War. While the story is gripping, I left the theater wanting a little bit more. I guess I expected a Spielberg directed, Coen Brothers written, and Hanks starring movie to blow my expectations. I feel that the strongest parts of the film were when it was focused on the trial and defense of Abel, but this only lasted for the first 40 minutes. It felt like there wasn't enough in the movie to make me fear for Donovan and his family in America. Overall, BRIDGE OF SPIES is an excellent film that is defined by its wonderful direction and performances. Spielberg and Hanks do not disappoint and create yet another success. (3.9/5)",

That's why it saddens me to observe that Bridge of Spies is, nonetheless, hypocritical and patriotic entertainment that never really enlightens or lives up to the message it tries to uphold. Skating in the thinness of its message - which intends to be of duality and reasonable thought-process-, the movie is quick to remind Americans of the constitution and even quicker to showcase Russians and East Berliners as evil figures and a threat to the American way of life. Considering the potential depth and impact of such story to the unification of beliefs, Bridge of Spies feels like a missed opportunity.",

    "review": "  T. HANKS FOR THE MEMORIES - My Review of BRIDGE OF SPIES (4 1/2 Stars)Due to poor marketing, a generic poster and forgettable title, I initially had no interest in seeing BRIDGE OF SPIES. It reeked of sup-bar Tom Clancy with dime store espionage. Little did I know it was based on a remarkably true Cold War story about an ordinary lawyer who brokered a hostage deal with the Soviets and East Germans. Additionally, when I discovered the Coen Brothers did a polish on the script, my interest was piqued just a little. Now that I've seen it, I can say it's one of Steven Spielberg's greatest accomplishments, a quietly suspenseful, beautifully acted and shot, twisting, turning yarn with quirky, specific characters and acute relevancy to current international politics. Tom Hanks, in full Jimmy Stewart Everyman mode and knocking it out of the park, plays James B. Donovan, an insurance attorney who is quietly asked by the Feds to perfunctorily represent a Soviet spy they've captured. The film opens on said spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance, giving an Oscar caliber performance) as he paints a self-portrait. It's a terrific opening shot, loaded with a wry sense of humor and multiple angles on the man to convey the layers to his character. There's no doubt from the outset that he is indeed a Russian spy, but it's the richness that follows which surprises. Soon, agents are pursuing him through the New York subway system in a bravura sequence of mounting tension, disorientation and stellar sound design. When Spielberg and his longtime collaborator, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, become engaged with material as rich as this, it's a pleasure to watch. Once captured, Donovan is asked to give the appearance of caring just enough so that the American Justice System looks good, but not enough to prevent Abel from the electric chair. Donovan, however, has more compassion than they expected. What follows is a story which stresses the importance of maintaining who we are or would love to be as a country by how we treat our prisoners. It's so easy in times of terrorism to go the way of Guantanamo Bay and torture our captives, but perhaps more important to maintain our ideals of justice rather than surrender to barbarism. Ultimately, the story involves a more well-known hostage, Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), an American pilot commissioned by the CIA to spy on Russia. His capture provides another thrilling sequence, this one in mid-air. Without spoiling too much, Donovan travels to East Berlin to quietly swap hostages without any official U.S. backing. Complicating matters is the fact that another American is captures by the East Germans just as the Berlin Wall is being erected.It's in the passage that I saw something new, and clearly Spielberg is all in as we witness the wall going up brick by brick as desperate people attempt to escape the oncoming horrors of life in the other side of that border. It's stunning and told with such assuredness and clarity. Another unexpected bonus is the humor in this film. Matt Charman, along with the Coens, keeps each character grounded in reality and adds such wonderful touches as Abel's cousin joyfully coming to beg for his release, Donovan's nagging cold throughout, and Abel's fantastically dry response of \"Would it help?\" whenever Donovan asks him to present himself a certain way. The relationship between Donovan and Abel is the heart of this film, and both actors rise to the occasion. Abel is deceptively still and on-the-surface, an enigma. Rylance, however, brings such quiet heart to Abel, that it's easy to see this potentially dangerous spy as just a man serving his country. This is a no-brainer supporting actor Oscar nominee if there ever was one, and deservedly so. Amy Ryan as Donovan's wife is straddled with the \"meanwhile back in the States scenes\" but she meshes really well with Hanks, giving such a vivid portrait of a late 50s/early 60s housewife on the verge of asserting herself more and more. The film is not without its flaws. Clearly scenes were cut between Donovan's assistant and daughter, whose secret affair must have meant something to a story about sneaking around, but obvious not enough to matter. There's enough there to leave one hanging, perhaps because their scenes carry a lot of the early exposition of the story. Also, even Spielberg at his best can turn syrupy and obvious at the end of his films, and this is no exception. SCHINDLER'S LIST, which I consider a masterpiece, suffered from Liam Neeson's breakdown scene. Here, we get a way-too-obvious comparison between the lives of wall-hopping East Germans and free Americans. It's not enough to derail the exceptional film that precedes it, and Spielberg and Co. are wise enough to provide a crawl of what happened to each character over this scene....so the on-the-nose nature of it is slightly diffused...a minor step in this nostalgic, uplifting, classically told, perfectly written film.",

    "review": "  Brilliant adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg. Bridge Of Spies is a cold and intense movie that brings us close to the Cold War and how an American lawyer tried to help two hostages by trading him with a soviet spy. But much more than that, the script shows us how close Hanks and Rylance's characters get closer and respect each other's jobs and how much such likely USA and Russia can be regarding spies, even though they are near to start a dangerous war in the world because of their differences. We don't have a lot of depth on Donovan's personal life but the focus on his relationship with Abel is deep and moving, especially in the end. Fortunately, we don't have an over patriotic analysis on the fact, which makes the film easier to relate to and not annoying like previous films about American heroes. Well done, amazing performances by the two leading men!",

    "review": "  'Bridge of Spies' is an espionage thriller at its finest. It's set in the late 50s & early 60s and certainly looks the part - I always love seeing the old cars driving around New York, looking classy. Starts off like any classic spy film, but then Abel (Rylance) is caught. In comes Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer who is asked to defend Abel, so he can receive due legal practice. The first 45min or so is a good courtroom drama and moves along fast enough, with Hanks giving a few great speeches and making some solid points about what's right and what's best.The movie really captures well the Cold War tension in America and what families would've gone through. It helps that this is the best film Spielberg has made in a few years and the best film Hanks has been in for a while. Once the movie turns into political chess, with an exchange of Abel for Powers (Stowell) in Berlin, the stakes are raised and there's plenty of great subterfuge.Hanks basically owns the film, with everyone having some good moments (especially Rylance, with his \"would it help?\"s), but he really plays a great everyman who stands up to both Germany, Russia & his own country (mostly portrayed by the CIA/Shepherd) for what is morally right and just, not just what is politically acceptable at the current time.",

Essentially from the films: FANTASTIC opening scene that adds no dialogue, Oscar worthy performance from Tom Hanks, beautiful cinematography and sets that use great attention to detail, well made and (of course) funny writing from my favorite duo: The Coen Brothers, and overall is definitely worth seeing for its veteran writers, admirable director, and everyone's favorite actor that make it enjoyable to watch from start to finish (even if the pacing does tend to drag from time to time.)

    "review": "  \"Bridge of Spies\" is a fascinating behind-the-scenes walk into the Cold War era. This is not the Fabulous Fifties of \"American Bandstand\". It's behind-the-scenes political maneuvers involving Russia, Germany and the United States. While young Baby Boomers hid beneath school desks during air raids, the real intrigue was far more subtle. Spies didn't drink martinis and wear black tie...they wore glasses. created oil paintings and listened to classical music.Thanks to masterful direction from Steven Spielberg, stunning cinematography by Janusz Kaminski, and the writing of the Cohen Brothers and Mat Charman, \"Bridge of Spies\" embodies a 1950s' attorney and family man portrayed by Tom Hanks. High-level international intrigue unfolds amid mundane bureaucracies.Yet Hanks' insurance lawyer maintains an unflinching desire to do the right thing, even when it's hard to know the difference in a gray, cold world as frigid as its politics. Mark Rylance gives a solid, nuanced performance as the spy caught between countries. He is torn by his art, his wife, and political loyalties. The friendship that evolves between Hank's attorney Jim Donovan and Rylance's Rudolph Abel serves as a metaphor for the confusion and fear that Americans and Russians must have experienced during the Cold War era. That's the funny thing about common ground. It does bring clarity...even in the cold. Oscar nominations are likely for Actor, Director, Cinematography and possibly Best Supporting Actor.",

Bridge of Spies tells the true story of a Cold War spy swap, during the height of tension between the U.S. and Russia. The time period was so tense that when films can capture that tone it's usually special, that being said the film doesn't quite capture that tone, but it comes close. Tom Hanks performance, and Spielberg's seasoned direction manage to save the film. When the film could have been slow, they save it by using either humor, or great acting, Acting that will most likely get Hanks an Oscar nomination. In the end Bridge of Spies isn't as good as it could have been, but is still admittedly a great film that will undoubtedly get plenty of recognition at the 2015 Academy Awards.",

    "review": "  It's an interesting turn of events that I would see \"Sicario\" (2015), a movie for which I had no expectations, a week before seeing Steven Spielberg's historically based \"Bridge of Spies,\" a movie for which I had plenty.Indeed, anyone going into the film after seeing the trailers could reasonably expect a well-acted, well-directed, humanistic period piece with some gorgeous sets - and \"Bridge of Spies\" is pretty much exactly that.Classic Hollywood good guy Tom Hanks plays good guy James B. Donovan, a lawyer tasked with defending Rudolf Ivanovich Abel (Mark Rylance), a Soviet intelligence officer with the KGB. Abel has been recently arrested and is to be tried for espionage.While many around Donovan (read: his family, coworkers, the CIA, and pretty much everyone else) pity him his thankless task of defending an enemy of the state, their opinion begins to shift as - what do you know? - he actually tries to do his job and get Abel a fair trial.An unknown amount of time later, the Soviets capture a downed U-2 spy plane pilot in Russian territory. Donovan is asked once more to step in to negotiate a prisoner swap in East Berlin: Abel for the pilot, one Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell).It's easy to see one of this movie's problems early on, as the first half or so is positively lethargic. We already know what will happen in Abel's trial, but we still have to sit through it to see lawyer Tom Hanks - er, Donovan - go to East Germany.This is true aside from the opening scene that tracks Abel as he paints, answers a phone, picks up a secret nickel, paints some more, and is ultimately captured by the CIA. As we follow Abel through the subway, the camera glides back and forth between him and the CIA agents in hot pursuit, and we're treated to probably the tensest scene in the film.With this opening scene, we also get to see relative-unknown actor Mark Rylance at work. Acting opposite Tom Hanks for any amount of time can't be easy, but Rylance pulls it off throughout in superb style, making a man who's supposed to be the enemy rather sympathetic and normal.That, I think, is the biggest achievement between Rylance, Spielberg, and the Coen brothers, who wrote the film alongside Matt Charman - humanizing the enemy and making it clear that things weren't always simple as \"good vs. evil.\"But despite a message that said things aren't always simple, the plot was very straightforward. Events unfolded in a logical manner, with nothing getting too twisted up or surprising, and viewers can feel pretty good about the ending.What may come as a surprise is the film's humor, which actually shows up more often than you might think. While laughs aren't usually a problem (and can be necessary in heavier films), it's hard to see their purpose in \"Bridge of Spies,\" which already carries so little tension.\"Bridge of Spies\" also takes a few turns for the heavy-handed, such as when it cuts to a class of young students being shown a nuclear scare film (and tearing up for some reason), or when, from his train window, Donovan sees a delayed parallel between the Berlin Wall and children jumping a fence in Brooklyn.The film's aesthetics, though, are very solid, which is something of the norm for period pieces. The vibrant, bustling streets of Brooklyn and the derelict, crumbling buildings of East Berlin provide the movie's starkest contrast between the powers of the Cold War, and Thomas Newman's subdued score is a suitable backdrop.Overall, \"Bridge of Spies\" is good. The harshest critique I can level at the film is that it's fairly unspectacular, but that doesn't make it bad; indeed, its solid performances, direction, and general prettiness leave me wondering how anyone could thoroughly dislike it, even if they're not blown away.Like my reviews?

    "review": "  VIEWS ON FILM review by Jesse BurlesonSpielberg and Hanks. Hanks and Spielberg. Their collaborations have become legend. You've got 1998's Saving Private Ryan which I never went gaga over. Then there's The Terminal, not an awful film just meh. Finally, we have Catch Me If You Can, the duo's entertaining masterpiece (this is just my opinion). Bridge of Spies (my latest review) is the current synergy between these two celebrated, Hollywood giants. It's cinematic hot chocolate recommendable because of historical significance. \"Bridge\" with its darkly-lit scenes and bloated two hour-plus running time, falls into Steven's two categories of movies being hyperactive, action adventures and historical sagas. It hightails into the latter meaning it's talky, draggy, and mostly devoid of anything compelling. I felt as if I was watching Lincoln again minus the circa range of 1865. Translation: No second viewing for this camper.Taking place during the Cold War via 1957, featuring a cast of virtual unknowns (a Spielberg emblem), and written by none other than the Cohen brothers (Ethan and Joel Cohen of course), Bridge of Spies chronicles real-life insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan (Hanks). He's a family man, a dude bent on doing the right thing. When he gets saddled with defending a Russian spy (Rudolf Abel played uniquely by Mark Rylance), Donovan helps said spy avoid the death penalty while attempting to trade him for two American refugees (a fighter pilot and a graduate student who are both detained by way of espionage). The flick then involves globetrotting within the territories of Germany, Russia, and you guessed it, Brooklyn, New York. Scenes build to a slow creep combining negotiation dialogue that spews mannerisms at verbatim (Tom's James B. has the flu, we get it). I sensed that I'd been in the theater for ten hours and sat through three drawn-out endings (the final sequence is reminiscent of 1985's White Nights. It looks like a soundstage which is uncharacteristic of the mighty Steven Spielberg).In retrospect, the acting (as expected) is solid with Tom Hanks being well, Tom Hanks. We all know he's the quintessential everyman. Will he get a nomination from the Academy? Maybe but this is October so there's sixty days left in the fiscal year. Bottom line: The World's most socko director provides us with admirable storytelling, technical skill, and period detail of the highest order. Does he entertain the moviegoer in the process? Not entirely. Be sure to bring heightened intelligence and an attention span (the size of Texas) to actually feel immersed. This is a \"bridge\" too far if you ask me. Rating: 3 stars.",

    "review": "  Bridge of Spies is Steven Spielberg's latest film, based on true stories of spy-swap negotiations during the Cold War. The story is intriguing and with Spielberg directing, the Coen Brothers co-writing the script and Tom Hanks starring in the lead role, this looks like one of the most exciting film projects in recent memory. Spielberg's filmography is fascinating; he is mostly known for his Hollywood blockbusters, but every now and then, he tackles a more serious subject in his direction. For every Indiana Jones, Jaws and Jurassic Park, we get Schindler's List, Munich and Lincoln. This is an admirable and diverse choice of direction by one of the most reliable film directors with a solid resume. This latest film, is full of his unique touches and while it will not be regarded as one of his best, it is certainly a solid and watchable piece of cinema.The story opens in Brooklyn, N.Y. during the late 1950s with the arrest by American authorities of suspected Soviet agent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Concerned that the man receives top-notch representation, the government approaches attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks) to defend Abel. Although initially reluctant, Donovan warms to the idea after meeting his would-be client. Although unable to secure a \"Not Guilty\" verdict, Donovan's arguments spare Abel the death penalty. However, his vociferous defense of such an anti-American criminal earns Donovan the ire of his fellow citizens. In a parallel storyline, the film introduces CIA pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), who commands a US spy plane on a mission high over Soviet territory. He is given strict instructions that, if the aircraft is compromised and in danger of falling into enemy hands, he is to hit the self-destruct. He is also given orders about the conditions under which he is to end his own life. He fails in both regards and is captured by the Soviets. The CIA, concerned about the top secret information Powers might divulge, asks Donovan to broker a prisoner exchange: Powers for Abel. This requires the lawyer, who is sick with a cold, to travel to Berlin and meet with KGB and East German officials in circumstances that could best be described as precarious.The film doesn't waste any time and starts the main plot right away. This is a film with little to no action and is full of scenes with people talking, but it is never boring. Spielberg's direction mixed with fantastic performances from a solid cast keeps our interest throughout its somewhat long running time. Part of our interest grows from the period, when security is an obsessive concern. In the U.S. and the Soviet Union alike, an accelerating arms race has bred a not-unreasonable fear of nuclear war. Washington wants to give Abel, an enemy agent, the semblance of a fair trial, though only the semblance, and the judge in the case agrees: \"He'll receive due process and, God willing, he'll be convicted.\" But Donovan believes that a fair trial means the best defense he can provide for his despised client. The film is shot well (with plenty of Spielbergian touches) and thoroughly American. One reason why Spielberg's dramas are such crown pleasures is that he never addresses the current events, preferring instead to mine the past. Sure, it is a politically safe approach, but it also makes his films more universal and timeless. He also never shies away from sentimentality and subtlety is something that can rarely be found in his direction. That is probably the biggest flaw in Bridge of Spies, which makes the whole experience feel safe and by the numbers. It still works for sure, but a riskier take and a less sentimental ending could have made the film stronger.The performances are fantastic across the board. Tom Hanks is great as always in the lead role, playing the paragon with stirring conviction leavened by enjoyable zest. His negotiation scenes are so entertaining and his deliveries are so spot on that we as the audience never get tired of the story getting unfolded. Amy Smart (as Donovan's wife) and Sebastian Koch (as the East German lawyer who becomes involved in the negotiations) provide solid support. But the real standout is Mark Rylance whose turn as the meek, composed Abel compels the viewer's attention. His performance is a minimalist wonder and he manages to steal scenes from Hanks and everyone else. His character is a principled man with a philosophical spirit that manages to create some of the film's best moments. The story is straightforward and easy to follow with small moments of quirkiness often associated with the Coens. Their off-killer sense of humor comes across in some of Hanks' lines, but the finished project seems to lean more towards Matt Charman's involvement in penning the script.All in all, Bridge of Spies is yet another win for Spielberg, Hanks and everyone involved who seem to be at the top of their game. This is a movie that fans of good cinema and general movie going audience members can easily enjoy equally. Yes, it is a safely made by the numbers movie with plenty of over-sentimentality, but it works and never talks down to its audience and that's what ultimately matters. It might not become a memorable experience, but it surely is a worth-while one.",

I feel it plays things a bit too safe, and things are not as tense or dramatic as they could have been. The cinematography at the beginning was atrocious, but definitely got way better, like the Russian courtroom scene and the Berlin Wall sequences. Featuring solid everything, from acting, set design, and story, Bridge of Spies is a solid movie but not the next masterpiece.",

Tom Hanks turns in a good performance as the well-intentioned insurance attorney turned defense attorney/ negotiator James Donovan, but it is Mark Rylance who steals the show as Rudolf Abel, the extremely calm and even-keeled yet captivating captured Soviet spy who lies at the center of the films plot.

    "review": "  Another solid Steven Spielberg drama with his golden boy Tom Hanks. Bridge of Spies is about the true story of a lawyer named Jim Donovan (Hanks) who in 1957 is tasked with representing a Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Abel is caught in the U.S. under suspicions of spying for the Soviets and Jim is chosen by his firm to represent Abel. It's suppose to be a one and done deal with Jim at least showing that the U.S. used Due Process and gave Abel a chance. Things go South and soon enough Jim has himself questioning whats wrong and whats right regardless of being a US Citizen. Meanwhile a spy plane is shot over Russia and U.S. Pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is captured by the Soviets. Also during this time period U.S. student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) is taken into custody by the German Republic for suspicion of spying. The CIA takes charge and tasks Jim to secretly go into East Berlin and negotiate a trade between Powers and possibly Pryor for Abel. What unfolds is a mind game between Jim, the KGB and the German Republic. Overall, it's an entertaining movie if and only if the subject matter seems interesting to you. History buffs and war enthusiasts will appreciate the accuracy of the story. The movie is a slow paced thriller and drama. Its 2 and a half hours long and at times it feels like its been going on. Hanks is solid though and has a fantastic performance here. The movie itself I would say isn't a \"you have to see this while it's still in theaters!\" kinda film I would say it would be a nice Friday night rental! Overall, i enjoyed it, but like I said it won't be for everyone!",

In the end, it wasn't a grandiose war movie with high powered action sequences or overdone battle scenes that made this one of the greats... it was the humanity. One man, standing alone, trying to do what he felt was right and damn what the authorities said should be done.

    "review": "  \"Bridge of Spies\" is an espionage thriller starring Tom Hanks as an insurance lawyer who is commissioned by the CIA to defend an accused Soviet Spy. In a subsequent deal he is asked to unofficially negotiate a trade with the Soviet Union for two Americans being detained as suspected spies themselves. I thought this film authentically captured the atmosphere of the Cold War and all the paranoia associated with it. Tom Hanks also does fine work and may be headed for another Oscar nomination. Spielbergs direction is spectacular as well as the genuine set pieces, making this a legitimate period piece. The cinematography is also exemplary ------------------------------------------ A-",

But where this movie succeeds and American Hustle didn't (IMHO), is that you have incredible screenwriting and editing teams who crafted the story so well that the audience is able to easily follow along and also remains invested and drawn into the story. Also great directing, acting, and a solid score.",

    "review": "  A quick quiz to exercise your vision on patriotism and betrayal: let's say there's this RAW agent who is embedded in Pakistan, carrying out espionage on India's behalf. Completely dedicated to our country's cause, he's a thorough gentleman in every sense, a well-behaved citizen in Pakistan, but stealing information from there to pass on to our agents here. Would you call him a patriot? Hang on to that answer. Now, imagine his counterpart from Pakistan, operating in India, following the same decorum and dignity, and completely true to his country's cause. Would he meet your rigorous specifications of a patriot? Another sub-question - imagine both these agents get caught while carrying out service to their respective countries. How would you want Pakistan to deal with our RAW agent? And how would you want the agent from Pakistan to be handled? Would you wear the same lens for both situations? Or, is it myopia in one eye and hypermetropia in the other?This is the blurring dilemma that director Steven Spielberg handles in his latest venture from behind the lens, \"Bridge Of Spies\". Based on the amazing true story of James B. Donovan (played by Tom Hanks) in 1957, and written by Matt Charman and the Coen brothers (Ethan and Joel), this is fine drama, handled with dignified maturity and finesse by the director and his band of high-class writers. Donovan is a successful insurance lawyer, a partner in a top insurance litigation firm. He's roped in to represent Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance), a Russian spy operating in Brooklyn, to show the world that the United States gives a fair trial and chance to one and all, and to ensure that the USSR does not capitalize on this incident. Donovan, initially hesitant, is egged on by the senior partner in his firm, Thomas Watters Jr. (Alan Alda), to take on the case for the country's sake. Donovan plunges into the case in right earnest, meeting up with Abel, getting to know him, and even going to the judge for a mistrial because there wasn't a proper arrest warrant. As the case progresses, the American public, the judge, Donovan's wife, Mary (Amy Ryan), his children, partners, and the folks on the subway he travels on, all look at him in askance, at best questioning his trenchant pursuit for justice, at worst attacking his home and accusing him of betrayal.In tandem unfolds the story of pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), who's one of four pilots picked for a secret mission to fly the U-2 aircraft from the American airbase in Islamabad over Russian skies, and take photographs. As luck and true story would have it, his plane is shot down, he's captured, and taken in for interrogation by the Russians. This sets in motion a mission kicked off by the CIA to exchange Abel and Powers, and Donovan is asked if he'd carry out the negotiations with the Russians. Donovan agrees, but the talks must take place in East Berlin (the wall is being built as the story progresses). Add to this mix some mysterious messages from Abel's family, the arrest of American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) in East Berlin, and Donovan's insistence on getting back both Powers and Pryor for handing over Abel, and what you have a miasma of drama and engaging storytelling that keeps you hooked till the last frame.Director Spielberg is in fine form, capturing the gloom and gloam of Brooklyn and Germany, even as he nuances out beautiful scenes in the movie. He bathes the movie with gentle humor and underplayed drama, even as he moves it along at a pace that's steady, firm, and gripping, shorn of any bathetic pretensions or jingoism. The film is nicely atmospheric, and Spielberg is helped by his keen and able editor Michael Kahn, who is in superb form as he places the Abel and Powers track side-by-side, beautifully seguing from one to the other in the most unaffected way. Note the scene where the judge comes into the courtroom and the bailiff announces \"All rise\", and Kahn and Spielberg show you children getting up in their classroom. This is classy stuff. Spielberg also makes the exchange scene an unforgettable one. This is the most humorous and moving exchange scenes I have ever seen. It makes you smile, laugh in relief, and fight back tears, all at the same time.\"Bridge of Spies\" has a commendable star cast, right from the officer who arrests Abel in the beginning, Agent Blasco, played by the superb Domenick Lombardozzi (from the fantastic TV show, \"The Wire\"). Amy Ryan as Donovan's wife is quietly effective, not aiming to bamboozle, but conveying her worry and angst beautifully. And it is such an effusive pleasure to watch Alan Alda, as always. In the few scenes he is up there, he's smooth as single malt, happy to be supportive and critical of Donovan, as required. Dakin Mathews as Judge Byers is superb, stupefied by Donovan's persistence, and then delivering a judgment that makes the exchange possible at all.But the movie belongs to Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. They complement each other brilliantly, playing off each other in scenes with dialogues that are gentle word plays, yet agile and nimble footed, meaningful, yet humorous. As Donovan, Tom Hanks nails it deep and proper. He's superb, a submarine of assertiveness, while showing a calm and almost fastidious surface. His is a performance that comes along and simply guides you by the hand into beautiful cinema. As in the scene where he realizes he's being followed one rainy night; or the scene where his house is attacked; or when he tries to explain to his son why defending Abel isn't the wrong thing; his horror at the murders on the Berlin wall, and the beautiful moving end scene on the subway train. Tom Hanks makes you want shake his hand and say, \"Well done, Donovan!\" , even as you're worried you'll catch his cold and sniffles.Mark Rylance is equally brilliant as the reticent, eyebrows-raised, poker-faced, soft-spoken Russian spy. He's so good, your heart goes out to him, as does Donovan's. Rylance conveys his story and his expressions softly, with a beautiful feather-like touch that moves you, makes you laugh, and go along with him for the exchange. There's this beautiful scene between Hanks and Rylance in the jail, when the latter's telling a story of his childhood, and talks of a man who he came to call \"The standing man.\" That scene is so well directed and acted, it goes from humor to a gentle-tug-at-your-heart in a twirl.And there's the background score by Thomas Newman that's as good as the lead actors. Newman rustles up his orchestra 20 minutes into the movie, and that's for the scene where Hanks is being followed. That's some beautiful horns, the piano tinkling like raindrops, and the violins halting and faltering, like Hanks himself. Also the \"Standing Man\" theme in the aforementioned scene in the jail - when the violins glide in gently into the scene, they bring with them a gentle gush of emotions that you simply flow into, such a beautiful piece that is. Then, there's the negotiation scene between the Russian official and Hanks. Thomas Newman ushers in male chorals that are haunting, unnerving, and make you shiver at the hostile environs you find Donovan in. Equally moving is the music for the climactic exchange, as Newman gets you engaged and into it. Or the beautiful violins and horns for the homecoming scene, the piano so lovely and gracefully moving with the violins.As the credits roll, and Spielberg superbly rings out a comparison between the Berlin wall horror and schoolkids in the US jumping over a wall, playing, you know there's much that humanity has suffered in wars, cold or otherwise. And having the freedom for kids to play out in the open is just one of the privileges that you cannot and should not take for granted. It's a gift that you don't realize you're lucky to have even as wars continue to ravage countries, and you look for an exchange program in this madness that'll bring back a semblance of humane behavior. A tall order that, even for Donovan.",

    "review": "  Bridge of Spies is a flat, anemic telling of the Gary Powers spy swap of the early 60's. The narrative has few dramatic points, and relies too much on Spielberg's rose-colored historical gaze, from dining room scenes to ridiculous over-the-head symbolic moments. No time is given to the political issues that surrounded the development of the U-2 spy plane program, and little is learned about \"Rudolf Abel,\" the Soviet spy in the swap. The negotiations have little dramatic substance; apart from Power's plane being hit, there is almost no dynamic range to this film, save some witty quips offered by the Coen brothers. A sleepy, thin story that would better serve as a tv movie.",

What a Journey!So any time Hanks has a film coming out, most movie buffs mark it on their calendar as a must. Then you add in that the film is directly bythe iconic Steven Spielberg, you knew the film had to be top shelf.I had no idea of this story (except I knew of U-2 pilotGary Powers in history). Hard to explain how clean and tighta movie this is...just so well crafted, scripted and presented.Visually, the screen image is so crisp like an uber Hi-Def lookwhich is really engaging. Simply the thought of an insurancelawyer can become one of the most important, under the radarheroes, hostage negotiators in US history is captivating.In this film, he works his magic in the old Soviet Union whichis a bloody miracle and subsequently in Cuba.Hanks paints a picture of a very professional, driven, eye onthe prize lawyer who fully understands the law, his job andthe right thing to do.Again, this is such a well made film...just need to see if yourespect terrific movie making and US history.

    "review": "  I don't know what it is about 2015, but I think this year has been full of films that don't entirely meet your expectations. I don't necessarily mean that those films are bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it seems like film after film end up making me feel a bit letdown. Bridge of Spies is the new Steven Spielberg directed film based on true events during the cold war. It focuses on James B. Donovan, played by Tom Hanks, who is thrust into representing a supposed Soviet spy in court and Donovan's further involvement in executing an exchange of prisoners with Russia.Much like Crimson Peak, this film is not really what the trailers make it out to be. The trailers heavily focused on the relationship between Donovan and his client, Rudolf Abel. The film gives us maybe 20 minutes between them in the beginning, but really that's all. To me, their relationship and the scenes between Hanks and Mark Rylance, who plays Abel, are easily the best the film has to offer. Even though it's never truly clear as to why Donovan backs this man so much and his motivations behind continuing the negotiations, I really bought into their dynamic. In fact, it's the only true payoff you get in the end is their relationship and its outcome.By no means is Bridge of Spies a bad film, it's not. It doesn't help that it's directed by perhaps the greatest director of all time, in Steven Spielberg. Expectations are sometimes far too high for his films. But I think the problem here is that there's just not a ton of meat to this story and it's one of Spielberg's weaker films in recent memory, but really he doesn't make any bad films. Some things did bother me about his directing here though. For example, there is a character introduced within the first 10 minutes as Donovan's associate and partner. He attends Donovan's family dinner and seems to be set up as help to Donovan and a slight possible romance is hinted at with this character and Donovan's daughter. Well, after one scene we don't see this character ever again.Amy Ryan plays Donovan's wife, who I absolutely adore as an actress, is also incredibly underused. I guess what I'm trying to get across here is that there is no flow to the movie. Or rather, no arc. It's very predictable, being a true story, but the tension isn't there either. It's a slow moving picture with a great climax but not a ton of build to get to that great climax. Surprisingly, this could be contributed to Spielberg. Spielberg does do a great job of taking us to the time of the Cold War. He certainly gives us the feeling that at any moment war could have been truly started by either side. The performances are all really good. Mark Rylance who plays Abel does a magnificent job in his limited screen-time and rightfully never gives one way or another in terms of his innocence. Tom Hanks is, well, Tom Hanks. And Thomas Newman replaces John Williams as the composer and does a wonderful job as he always does. There's a lot to really like about Bridge of Spies, more than not. But for me, it was just a bit of a letdown in its lack of intensity and pay off. I wouldn't have known it was the Coen Bros script and Spielberg's directing if it wasn't for the trailers and marketing.+Rylance & Hanks togther+Spielberg transports you to the Cold War+Newman's score+Climax-Lack of intensity-Didn't get enough of Donovan and Abel together7.0/10",

    "review": "  Despite the title, there's actually very little spy in the film; there's some, but mostly this is a film about negotiations and perceptions, and how in particular one man battles for what he sees as the right thing to do regardless of said perceptions. The film looks beautiful, ranging from nice long shots, to close ups, to dark and shadowy. Interestingly, I found it was often close-up shots that were used to frame those who had the wider view of the situation, while wider shots were used on those whose view was narrower. Interesting choice. The acting is stellar all around, with Hanks being particularly good, and Rylance being phenomenal. The story, if I'm honest, dragged a bit at first as it set up the various pieces, and as such there's practical no time spent on the trial itself. However, once the various plot elements are set up, it becomes fascinating watching Hanks' Donovan work to do what he sees as right, against both what his own government wants, and the partially unknown desires of the USSR and GDR. The final scene, which mirrors two prior scenes, I don't think was completely necessary but it is understandable why it's there. Fairly minor quibbles to an enjoyable film.",

And it is beautiful on the screen. I don't know if people see that any more, when they are looking for the movement of the superheros of dinosaurs (but I digress).

    "review": "  October 16, 2016At its beginning, \"Bridge of Spies\" leads us to believe it's going to be a traditional courtroom drama about a level-headed lawyer who must defend a man whom everybody automatically assumes is guilty--everyone except the lawyer, that is. Through reasons of conscious and due process, he's determined to operate under the guiding principle that anyone accused of a crime is \"innocent until proven guilty,\" despite the repercussions such a stance will have on him, his family and his career. And while the film is about this to a degree, it's not all it's about, and around the one-third mark, \"Bridge of Spies\" begins to add unexpected developments to its story. Even though it's based on fact, director Steven Spielberg and the three screenwriters still could have chosen to play things safe and simply glossed over or rushed through the less \"Hollywood\" events, but they take their time with it and really delve into the thickness of the situation. As a result, the film informs and challenges us just as the plot simultaneously intensifies.The story recounts a well-known case mandated to James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), a New York City lawyer who began his career as a criminal attorney but who eventually segued into insurance. In 1957, amidst the Cold War, Donovan's law partners, Thomas Watters Jr. (Alan Alda) and John Rue (Lynn Goodnough), ask him to defend Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), a seemingly gentle old man whom the FBI has been watching for some time on suspicions he's a Soviet spy and whom they've recently arrested based on questionable evidence. The Federal Government asks Watters and Rue to take his case and they accept it because they feel it's their patriotic duty, although it's obvious their real motivation is they think the notoriety will be a good PR move because it will be their organization that helps convict a Soviet spy, who was America's sworn enemy at the time. Watters and Rue, along Judge Byers (Dakin Matthews), believe the matter will essentially be open and shut, and indeed the judge flippantly says to Donovan, \"Let's just get this over with.\"But Donovan isn't about to compromise his integrity just to expedite the proceedings or to merely get in good with the public. He rightly sees Abel as an \"alleged\" criminal and not as an automatic enemy, and he vows to defend him as a man who has the same rights as any other client. Of course, no one else shares Donovan's perspective, including his wife Mary (Amy Ryan), who's nervous about the effect the case will have on her family since her husband will now be viewed as a Soviet sympathizer and traitor.Still, Donovan sticks to his guns and convinces the judge that, despite his convicting Abel for conspiracy, keeping him alive could prove to be in the best interest of the country because Donovan knows there are American spies just like Abel in the Soviet Union and if one of them was to be captured, the U.S. treating Abel civilly and with honor could persuade the Soviets to do the same to their guys. Plus, Abel could also become a potential bargaining chip.As it turns out, in a parallel plot, the U.S. military recruits a group of air force pilots for a mission to fly custom jets over the Soviet Union and take pictures using highly sophisticated cameras. One of these pilots is Francis Powers (Austin Stowell) and during his endeavor, the Soviets shoot him down, but rather than self-sacrifice like he was told, Powers ejects himself and is subsequently captured. Later on, in an unrelated case that will eventually relate to both Powers' and Abel's, an American graduate student named Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) is arrested in East Germany on suspicions of being a spy just as the German Democratic Republic is erecting the Berlin Wall. Because of Donovan's personal connection with Abel, the Federal Governments asks him to go to East Germany as a \"private citizen,\" and not as a representative of the government, to speak with the Soviet ambassador. His objective: strike a deal that would exchange Abel for Powers. But upon hearing about Pryor, Donovan takes it upon himself to take the deal even further and, in separate negotiations, asks that the Germans release Pryor as well. So he makes it own mission to have the Soviets release Powers and the Germans release Pryor, both in exchange for Abel, whom both Germany and the Soviet Union have a vested interest.History aside, the drama and suspense of \"Bridge of Spies\" stems from Donovan's sheer will and whether or not his convictions will survive the odds and stakes that are pitted against him. The film paints him as an obvious hero and good guy, and Hanks, as usual, lends the character an everyman, down-to-earth quality. Naturally, we like and admire him, which is one of the reasons it's so easy to get involved in this story. But in addition to that, \"Bridge of Spies\" shares the same kind of storytelling as Ridley Scott's \"The Martian\" in that the plot continually adds hurdles for its characters to deal with and attempt to overcome. Just when we think things are going to play out smoothly and in their favor, new dilemmas arise and we're honestly not fully convinced Donovan's determination and strategy will win out, which makes it all the more engaging. Of course, there's the lingering notion that because this is, in fact, a mainstream Hollywood movie, the ending will inevitably be a happy one, but Spielberg and his writers don't make it an all-out guarantee, and that's what makes it so watchable right up to a key scene that takes place on two different bridges in Germany. The tension builds and builds until finally...Well I won't reveal what happens, but I will say the film pays off both dramatically and as an intriguing historical document. It's also a crowning technical achievement, with production designer Adam Stockhausen, who won a well deserved Oscar for \"The Grand Budapest Hotel,\" creating a dark, brooding atmosphere and faithfully recreating a 1950s New York City and Berlin that transports us to a different time and world altogether. You wouldn't think a dramatic thriller would be so striking and absorbing on a visual level, but \"Bridge of Spies\" is.I'm not sure how I feel about the film's closing scene, which perhaps goes one step too far with its romance and bookending a previous shot just to bring the story full circle. This is the kind of Hollywood underlining that Spielberg sometimes finds hard to resist just so he can appease and bring comfort to the audience. Luckily, it's more unnecessary than harmful, but I still wish he'd chosen a more subtle approach. Still, the essence of the story remains intact and the film serves as a veritable thriller as well as an intriguing history lesson.",

    "review": "  Great! Films like this are so old school good, so well crafted, and so normal for a master like Spielberg that we almost take it for granted. There wasn't a single thing wrong with it that I could find. It was mature and rock solid filmmaking at it's finest. Mark Rylance was fantastic in it, the Coens brought their wit, and Tom Hanks yet again solidifies his status as an iconic actor, a sure-fire everyman, and the Jimmy Stewart of his generation.",

    "review": "  A solid political thriller that may lack many thrills but enough is happening to keep you until the end. Tom Hanks does a fine job here but he never really sheds Tom Hanks off this character. Hanks is just naturally great that you'll enjoy watching him even if you don't believe him as a different character. Mark Rylance is great as the spy captured in the movie and Alan Alda and Amy Ryan are severely under utilized. Spielberg really hasn't been doing great movies this century besides the amazing Catch Me if You Can and the fun Indiana Jones 4 and solid Adventures of Tin Tin. This movie will be like War Horse (except more interesting. I didn't fall asleep during this one) where it will get nominated for some tech awards and Picture since it is that type of subject matter that the Academy loves but I don't think the actors nor Spielberg will be rewarded. Rylance is the only hope but he may be too subtle to make it in. The writing is good and the Coen Brothers add a nice wit to the screenplay that Hanks is great at delivering. The cinematography is just sloppy and ugly here. This was one of my issues with Lincoln as well where it just is so overexposed at times that it just takes you out of the movie and makes you think you are watching a movie and not a window into these people's lives as movies are supposed to be. The pacing is a little slow and the whole sub plot with Jesse Plemmons and Austin Stowell isn't developed well enough in the beginning to understand the relevance to Hanks' storyline that it just becomes distracting and gets in the way. The movie feels like a 3 part mini series on HBO honestly with the first chapter dealing with Rylance's court case, the second chapter dealing with the two Americans being captured and Hanks having to go reduce them in the final chapter. That would have been a little better and may have added some better explaining of the prisoners to have the audience truly care about them rather than only caring about them getting out of Germany and the Soviet's hands just because they are Americans. The movie just lacks any emotional pull. It's a little boring at times but Hanks makes his parts worthy of your attention even if they run too long. The 50 and over crowd will love this but for the young whipper snappers, you may have your patience tested slightly.",

    "review": "  Movie: Bridge of SpiesRating: PG-13, 2 hours 15 minutesGrade: AIn a Nutshell: \"1957. The height of the Cold War. The United States and the Soviet Union fear each other's nuclear capabilities - and intentions. Both sides deploy spies - and hunt for them.\" And so the movie begins.This is not a bang-bang, shoot 'em up James Bond kind of spy film, but a thinking-man's movie. It's a true story, which gives it all the \"wow factor\" the movie needs. Thank you, Steven Spielberg, for another powerful movie. He and Tom Hanks know how to do it right. Uplifting Theme:� Justice� \"It doesn't matter what other people think. You know what you did.\" - James Donovan� Good vs. Bad vs. something in between...- Patriotism comes in many colors. - Which is more important: the ends or the means?Things I liked:� Written by the Coen brothers. Humor. Tension. Historical drama. Great job!� Good for Amy Ryan for starring in two movies in theaters at the same time! (Goosebumps)- I loved the contrast between the 2 scenes that showed people jumping over a fence.- Some of the most powerful statements were never spoken. Tom Hanks is the master of subtlety.Things I didn't like:� It's a little slow-moving at times. Those who require non-stop action in their movie-going will get a good nap. Funny lines: � \"You don't look worried.\" - James Donovan\"Would it help?\" - Rudolph Abel� \"I'm not afraid to die, Mr. Donovan, although it wouldn't be my first choice.\" - Rudolph Abel (played extremely well by Rudolf Rylance. Best Supporting Actor Oscar?)� Interesting lines:� \"We need to have a conversation our governments can't.\" James Donovan� \"Everyone deserves a defense. Every person matters.\" - DonovanTips for Parents:� 1 F-bomb by Tom Hanks. Aw, doggonit.- Children will snooze and not be interested. Teens might snooze, but will be rewarded if they can stick it out until the end.� You see innocent people being gunned down as they try to get over the East Berlin Wall. Your children may not know about this point in history and the dangers of the Cold War after WWII. I remember watching in utter amazement when the Berlin Wall finally came down. I never thought it would happen. - \"Checkpoint Charlie\" is also shown in the film. Talk to your kids or grandkids about what life was like back then. George Santayana is quoted as saying \"Those who do not read history are doomed to repeat it. Those who fail to learn from the mistakes of their predecessors are destined to repeat them.\"",

    "review": "  Many people are calling this the \"Gary Powers\" movie, but it's not about Gary Powers. In fact, his storyline doesn't even show up until the movie is well underway. The focus of this movie is on the attorney, portrayed by Tom Hanks, who represented the Soviet spy Abel in his criminal trial & later negotiated the release of Powers & a US student held by the East Germans in exchange for Abel. As an attorney, to me this movie demonstrated the difficulties attorneys representing unpopular, demonised clients always face: the obligation to zealously represent their client according to the laws & Constitution of this country vs. popular \"String 'em up\" opinion. It's always sad when those who are doing the right thing are punished & treated poorly for it. As Donovan points out, what makes us \"Americans\" is our belief in the Constitution & the rule of law. Without that, we're just a bunch of immigrants from other countries with nothing in common. Another thing this movie portrayed in vivid detail was the abject fear of nuclear war that was being taught to children in school. \"Duck & Cover\" is laughable today, especially to those growing up in a post-Cold War world, but to those of us who were taught to fear the evil communists, those scenes are very difficult to sit through without having a PTSD-like flashback. The movie is based on actual events, & the story is fascinating. The visuals are beautiful & depictions of post-war Berlin as the Wall goes up are stark reminders of how bleak things were near the height of the Cold War. Mark Rylance is brilliant as the Soviet spy & should expect Supporting Actor nods (& IMO wins) come awards season. Tom Hanks should also expect a Best Actor nod, but although he turns in a great performance, nothing I've seen this year has topped Johnny Depp in \"Black Mass.\" All in all, a great movie, well told, very much worth the price of admission.",

    "review": "  Whenever Spielberg makes a movie, usually it should probably be called one of the best directed films that will come out that year. Spielberg is one of the still working directors who still knows how to tell a story the best way, to stage his scenes the best, to understand filmmaking, and to play an audience like a fiddle. Here is no exception in what is one of his more quiet pictures, Spielberg's presence is still there, but it's also impossible not to admire or watch with the joy of seeing his hand at work again. He's also taken his collaboration with Tom Hanks to yet again to actually take advantage of the actors soft spoken nature and us Hanks' acting to enhance the performance, rather than work against it. Mark Rylance is also very good in a far to small of a role as the Rudolf Abel, the often quiet and closed off Soviet spy taken in by the U.S. It's a beautiful looking film, a fantastically directed one, and a well acted one, and yet if there wasn't one problem: the script. Spielberg is one of the best directors working today, but he also has a weakness for relatively unremarkable screenplays for him to work his incredibly overqualified hands on. The screenplay isn't bad, but it's also clear that it could've gone through another round with the Coens (by the way, I swear they only did one page of this screenplay because it feels nothing like them outside of it), because it's the main writer's first screenplay, and it shows. Not to say the script is bad, it's perfectly serviceable with moments of greatness, but it's by far the weakest link in what would otherwise be a fantastic addition to Spielberg's filmography without it. Despite it, Bridge of Spies is a good film, even a very good one, but it could also have been better, and considering it's Spielberg, it's a bit of a disappointment",

    "review": "  Bridge of Spies was an OKAY film. To the uninitiated who have no expectations from a Spielberg film this was a good educational Cold War period drama. For folks like me who love Spielberg and his almost magical story telling abilities this film felt short on many frontsOne of Spielberg's great abilities is the intrinsic knowledge about the pacing of a film. He has an uncanny ability to delve into the viewer subconscious and understand what exactly the audience would expect and be excited by at different junctures in the film. This film sort of fails to take off. I loved the fact that it juxtaposes two parallels - the capture of a Soviet spy and his trial in the US courts and the tribulations of a United States fighter pilot who is drafted for reconnaissance missions over Soviet territory and whose plane is shot down with him getting captured. The parallels got off the blocks pretty smart but you never got the acceleration you expected to happen. I was not expecting an espionage thriller but half an hour into the film I was expecting a \"Catch me if you can\" playbook to unfold - instead it took the same meandering path it started off with.The acting performances were just fine. Tom Hanks is cr�me de la cr�me of American actors and puts in a fine performance in this one. Here in this film I felt though that he was somehow constrained by the screenplay into playing the justice seeking affable, \"can't do a thing wrong\" American lawyer a little too much. When I think of Tom Hanks I think of Captain Miller in Saving Private Ryan - a formidable actor that can display a wide range of emotions - wry humor, guilt, justified anger, sorrow, resignation. In this film he gets into the conversationalist mode a little too much. The performance I gravitated towards was of the actor who played the Soviet spy - Colonel Abel. You almost seem to root for the guy by the end of the film - In his quiet way he conveys that the spies are nothing but puppets of their governments - same as soldiers in the battlefield - valuable as assets at the time of engagement but frowned upon and neglected once they return to their homeland.The cinematography of the film is stunning. The d�cor and sets are outstanding - reminiscent of the World War II era and the immediate Cold War aftermath that followed it. There are very little action sequences in the film - one of them of the U2 reconnaissance plane shot down over Soviet territory is breath taking. But all in all the film felt like a stage play and long winded. With Spielberg we expect the gold medal, bronze just does not do it...",

    "review": "  For the fourth time in they're respective careers, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have come together to make a movie. This time set during the Cold War, Tom Hanks ( James Donovan) is required to represent Mark Rylance (Rudolf Abel), a Soviet Spy. But when an American spy is captured by the Soviets, it's up to Donovan to negotiate an exchange between two opposing nations.Seeing the trailers and knowing who was involved in this film, it would make one excited (if you know anything about Steven Spielberg or Tom Hanks). Bridge of Spies is a great example of historical story telling done at it's finest. Spielberg is no stranger to this feat. However this is an example of old school hollywood, and it is not for everyone.There are two types of Spielberg history movies, the Saving Private Ryan (action packed, thrilling) and the Lincoln (great performances, talking based). Both are incredible movies for different reasons, and Bridge of Spies falls into the Lincoln category, where there isn't action, it is a film with a lot of talking. But it's those talking scenes where the movie comes to life, and a lot of that is thanks to the masterful directing of Steven Spielberg.Another big part why this movie is great are the performances. You have Tom Hanks, two time oscar winner (Philadelphia 1993 and Forrest Gump 1994) who does amazing. What else can you expect from one of the best actors of all time. Also you have Mark Rylance (Rudolf Abel) who does, maybe just as good or even better than Hanks. Whenever he appeared on screen, he was electrifying. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets a nomination for best supporting actor come the Oscars.This is definitely not Spielberg's best, and has some slight negatives. At times, felt slow and the second act was not as strong as the first or third, but still solid.Overall, Bridge of Spies is a beautifully directed film, with amazing performances, and a great history lesson. It is written by the Coen Brothers, and composed wonderfully by Thomas Newman. This movie is not for everyone, but if your the type that gets goosebumps from watching people talk in a perfectly crafted scene, then this movie is for you.",

    "review": "  This latest collaboration between Academy Award winners Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks offers an engrossing behind-the-scenes flashback into the high-stakes Cold War dynamics of U.S. and Soviet Union relations in 1957. A fascinating legal and political chess match that spotlights each superpower's desperate need to win the information war using spooks and the court of public opinion. \"Bridge of Spies\" takes viewers on a brisk history lesson through a series of true events, all designed around the nuclear distrust and tension leading up the United States vs. Soviet Union stare down during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October of 1962.Tom Hanks is perfectly cast as real-life attorney James Donovan, an affable family man who defends our legal system and a client's right to a fair shake in court--even when his defendant is an accused Soviet spy and the American public is willing, momentarily, to turn its back to our U.S. Constitution.\"Bridge of Spies\" is not an action-packed military affair or even a political suspense thriller. It's a personal story about Jim Donovan (Hanks) and his attorney-client relationship that grows out of a mutual respect and sense of duty. The screenplay's collaborative effort by newcomer Matt Charman and the Oscar-winning Coen brothers (Ethan and Joel), provides an accelerated timeline which blurs collective years in order to give Hanks more screen time as the head-strong legal defender Donovan.As issues with fairness, due process and negotiations slowly unfold over a possible prisoner exchange in Germany, \"Bridge of Spies\" only faintly draws on the escalating geopolitical tension with a military twist. This mistakenly downplays Soviet spy Rudolf Abel's actual 4 years spent in a U.S. prison and American U-2 spy plane pilot Gary Powers' 10-year espionage conviction-along with Powers' nearly 2 years of being jailed outside Moscow.Movie-goers seeking an intriguing legal drama amidst two adversaries holding men with vast knowledge of their homeland's secrets will find \"Bridges of Spies\" a captivating gambit to watch. This Cold War dialogue of mistrust and intelligence gathering offers Hanks' portrayal of James Donovan the opportunity to stack our U.S. Constitution and legal fairness against any other system in the world.Both Hanks and Mark Rylance (as Soviet spy Abel) give standout and convincing performances. Although this film lacks some depth of coverage for certain historic events, it fields early proof of the cooperative ways between the U.S. and Soviet Union when a country's security needs must be met. A dramatic willingness to step away from the ledge--by both nuclear sides. And eight months after these \"Bridge of Spies\" events took place at Berlin's Glienicke Bridge and Checkpoint Charlie, another test of U.S.-Soviet wills ensued in the waters surrounding Cuba. But that's a different story and time.Grade: B+",

    "review": "  Steven Spielberg strikes again with another outstanding movie! Based on a true fascinating story, that you will not want to put on pause or go to the bathroom in a movie theater. Tom Hanks once again gives a masterful performance, so the Academy better nominate him for best actor. Mark Rylance's performance as the spy makes him a possible candidate for best supporting actor. The camera work and cinematography is just astonishing. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat. I predict this will be an Academy award favorite film. I predict 6 to 7 nominations. My grade=97%(A+).",

Donovan, played magnificently by Tom Hanks, he makes a selfless sacrifice out of his sense of patriotic duty, but then is recruited by CIA director Allen Dulles, well-played by Peter McRobbie to secretly negotiate and arranged a prisoner swap of Abel for U.S. pilot Francis Gary Powers who's U2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union by there armed forces. Masterful direction by the great Spielberg, with extraordinary cinematography by Janusz Kaminski. great supporting performances by Alan Alda, Domenick Lombardozzi, Amy Ryan, John Rue, Billy Magussen, and Henny Russell, but its Hank's searing performance of great dignity and total conviction that steals this film completely. A taut thriller and fascination motion picture, one of the year's very best. Highly Recommended.",

The experience behind and in front of the camera really shows on this modern classic. The film was shaky only a few times throughout it's 2 hr. 15 min. runtime, but always managed to reel us back in just in time. We rally with the protagonist throughout the ending, even after when we question the humanistic nature of the exchange versus social atmosphere of the time.

Everything about it was great - the overall story, cinematography, acting, etc., but the most intense scenes were when two people were simply talking to each other - no fanfare, so special effects...just sitting in chairs and planning and negotiating. What was also amazing was Spielberg's ability to move the story along without spending too much time on one scene. You could see the mastery at work in the way he jumped around from scene to scene since in order for the story to move forward three or four things needed to happen first. This could have easily been a boring movie since the subject matter was relatively mundane, but Spielberg elevated it to an artform.",

    "review": "  Director Steven Spielberg is the conscience of American film-makers, delving into the dark places of our history - the morally shaky ground of policymaking in a country that prides itself on its belief in upholding the principles of the U.S.Constitution. In his latest film, BRIDGE OF SPIES, he pokes a stick into the headlines of Cold War events - the 1960 U-2 Spy plane incident, in order to shed air and light into the dark reaches of official myth-making. Aware that this can be done most powerfully through precise direction, detailed sets, soaring soundtracks, and cinematography that echoes the dreary mood of the times - bright sunshine recedes behind the shadows of deception. The audience is always entertained, despite the subject matter's depiction of the murkiness of ethics and morality. Like the great illustrator Norman Rockwell - we are seduced by an \"apple pie\" ethos, except there are worms wriggling around in the crust.Tom Hanks is perfectly cast - an actor who I cannot remember ever playing a \"bad\" guy - as James Donovan, an insurance lawyer conscripted by the CIA in 1957 during the height of the Cold War hysteria to defend the arrested Soviet mole, Rudolf Abel, (an academy award winning performance by Mark Rylance,) and participate in a US government programmed \"kangaroo-court\" trial. Except James Donovan believes in the right of an individual to the best defense as the bedrock of our democracy, not willing to compromise his deeply held integrity.BRIDGE OF SPIES begins with a panning of a dreary Brooklyn street with the Manhattan Bridge in the background looming over the landscape, the camera eventually lands upstairs in a tenement building where Mark Rylance/Rudolf Abel is looking at himself in a mirror painting a quite good traditional self-portrait. This double view is our introduction to the personality of a seemingly Walter Mitty-like individual, his physiognomy imprinted with a haunting and magnetic expressiveness, conveying adversity and conviction. Rylance's sympathetic portrayal of Abel is seductive and thrilling; this spy is a mystery and remains so.Tom Hanks/James Donovan - a reincarnation of Jimmy Stewart (thicker in physique) lives a 1950's dream life in suburbia; three children and a clueless stay-at-home wife and mother (played by Amy Ryan in a thankless part.) Women are just accessories in this movie - indicative of how they were considered at the time. Thank goodness for the Feminist Movement 20 years later! Getting involved with cloak and dagger politics does not change Donovan - he is incorruptible and strongly rooted to the ideals of American values as put forth in the Constitution and Bill of Rights.At the same time as the Abel trial - America is preparing to send a U-2 spy plane equipped with surveillance equipment over Soviet territory and the Central Intelligence Agency recruits a young pilot Francis Gary Powers (a bland, handsome Austin Stowell) to complete the reconnaissance mission. In 1960, the operation is implemented and shortly thereafter the U-2 spy plane is shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air missile and Powers parachutes unto Russian soil still alive and is captured and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment and hard labor. A politically heated issue and an embarrassment for the Eisenhower administration - the incident was vigorously denied by the USA and a cover-up was attempted, but the covert military maneuver was ultimately exposed.Attempts are made to return Gary Francis Power to the USA in order to interrogate him about how much classified information he revealed to the Soviets. The authorities turn again to Attorney James Donovan to negotiate the exchange of spies on Glienicker Bridge in East Germany - Rudolf Abel for Gary Francis Powers; the tension and drama of BRIDGE OF SPIES begins against the backdrop of the Wall being erected in East Berlin - a bleak city in contrast to its counterpart in the Western sector. Pragmatic political behavior by officials in the KGB, CIA and FBI are all stick figures in the chess game of diplomacy and Tom Hanks deftly navigates his way through the labyrinth of innuendo and deceit. Espionage, duplicity, betrayal are at the heart of this film. What makes it palatable is the humanity of both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance's characters who bond with mutual respect, despite their opposing ideological viewpoints. Director Spielberg can be sentimental, but is able to tunnel through the sappiness with humor and affection. He really likes his two leading men and so do we.",

I never \"followed\" his career and I never \"met\" Rudolf Abel before watching this film. All I knew was that this was a Steven Spielberg film starring Tom Hanks based on true events. That's all. I never saw a trailer or a review or whatever kind of teaser. I guess that was just a well because I really paid attention to the film.At first I thought I was going to be bored or confused because it seemed that way during the first part of the film. Little by little my interest in the film grew and after half an hour, I was drawn to it that I even clapped towards the end of the film. The last time I clapped was when I watched Heneral Luna. The rest of the films I watched after that epic paled in comparison, but this period film set during the COLD WAR left a mark in my heart. From an ostracized person to becoming a hero....James B. Donovan was, I mean is, a very inspiring person. My favorite line: It doesn't matter what other people think of you. What matters is knowing you did the right thing.- Jimmy Donovan to a trembling Gary Powers",

The dynamic and slick, calculating and smart approach to a complicated story adds up to a harrowing and thrilling tale of moral ambiguity. The script is sharp and full of memorable lines and philosophies for the audience and characters involved, which Matt Charman and the Coens deserve a hand for. The magnificent direction of Steven Spielberg makes a story which could have been a complicated slog turn into a compelling well-crafted espionage story akin to the 1950s and 1960s spy movies. The two forefront performances of Tom Hanks as Jim Donavan and Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel are enthralling and brilliant. Hanks' Donavan is forced to deal with the true state of his government and people while trying to defend a man no one will give the light of day, while Rylance's Abel appears to be a simple man who understands perfectly what his situation is and accepts it.",

Perhaps its�terribly generic poster pushed my thoughts towards dismissal. That would have been a shame, as�?Bridge of Spies,? poster notwithstanding, is quite a fine espionage thriller. If it gets a bit unfocused in its final act, that doesn't take away from the solid filmmaking of the first two thirds. What's particularly refreshing about the way Spielberg and his screenwriters (two of whom are Ethan and Joel Coen!) present the material is that the government spies�at work within the story are anything but Bondian. Instead, it's an insurance lawyer who saves the day. The film is also a wonderful�meditation on the meaning of ostensible American values: what good is liberty and justice if we ignore them when times get tough?The film opens with a big unknown. A man looks in the mirror, painting his self-portrait. At first, even though a title card had just announced that this was a movie about the Cold War, I thought it might be Norman Rockwell, but when the phone rang and he ran out without a word, jumping into a New York subway car, I thought otherwise. This mystery man is played by�Mark Rylance (?Angels & Insects?), and though he has done more British TV and stage work than Hollywood films, he is an extraordinary presence in front of the camera. Which is good, because it turns out that he is a Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel, and so needs all of the sympathy that a great actor can give him.�In a bit that recalls the great 1953 communist-paranoia thriller�?Pickup on South Street,? Abel is pursued by the FBI on that subway, and then home, where he has taken a secret bit of possibly classified information he surreptitiously picked up on his journey. The G-men bust in, grab him, and that's the end of it.Or not. We then meet James B. Donovan�-�played by Tom Hanks (?Saving Mr. Banks?) with his usual folksy charm�-�a star insurance lawyer whose firm�has been asked by the U.S. government to defend Abel, to show the rest of the world that the Americans offer justice even to those who would destroy us. Donovan gets the short straw, and like a good boy scout is soon annoying those very forces that wanted him to put on a good show. To him, that means offering the best defense possible. To his superiors, that means doing the bare minimum. We sense a showdown.Meanwhile, Spielberg starts cutting back and forth between scenes of Donovan and Abel and scenes of Francis Gary Powers�- stoically played by Austin Stowell (Miles Teller's drum rival in�?Whiplash?) - as he is first selected, and then trained, to fly a high-altitude spy plane over the Soviet Union. As history tells us (kind of hard to ignore it), he is shot down on his first mission�and�taken captive, and soon we have parallel captured-spy scenarios. Before long, we find ourselves in East Berlin, where a new wall is going up, as Donovan - reviled at home for defending a \"Russkie\" but now freelancing for the CIA - tries to negotiate a prisoner exchange. As a cloak and dagger procedural, it's fascinating stuff, until it all gets just a little too long.No matter the length, though, this is good storytelling. The terrific�actress Amy Ryan (?Gone Baby Gone?) may be relegated to the role of \"the wife\" - shame, Hollywood, shame! - and there may be nary a face of color in sight - shame, Hollywood, shame! - but otherwise this is a very fine historical thriller that reminds us of our best moments�as a country. A good lesson for the upcoming election year!",

Fascinating juxtaposition between America and the Soviet Union adds to the intensity. Meanwhile, the Soviets have captured their own spy and that person is Francis Gary Powers. You SHOULD know who that is! Tom Hanks is perfect in the role of James Donovan, a true hero if there ever was a hero during the cold war !",

    "review": "  A friend of mine recently posted on Facebook that his daughter had asked him who played the character called Hawkeye. \"Alan Alda,\" was my friend's reply, thinking of the surgeon on TV's \"M*A*S*H\". But my friend's daughter was asking about the Marvel Comics character in the \"Avengers\" films (played by Jeremy Renner). Besides amusing me, that little story got me thinking about how I was going to write my review of Steven Spielberg's historical drama \"Bridge of Spies\" (PG-13, 2:21). If I'm going to discuss a movie in which \"The U-2 Incident\" plays such a big part, it might be a good idea to point out that this reference has nothing to do with ticket scalping at a rock concert or anything of the sort. In fact, to better appreciate this review and, more importantly, Spielberg's film, you might want to do what I just did - reinforce and add to your historical knowledge of the aforementioned Cold War crisis, the Hollow Nickel Case and Rudolf Abel, Francis Gary Powers and James Donovan. Or... you could just read my review and then go to the film, not just for a great cinematic history lesson but to see one terrific movie.Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, a New York insurance lawyer in the 1950s. Donovan is smart, honest, hard-working and, most importantly, he has principles and integrity - especially when it comes to the law. He has also served his country in uniform and assisted in the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the post-World War II Nuremberg Trials. Donovan's law firm's senior partner (played, coincidentally, by the same Alan Alda mentioned in my previous paragraph) asks him to accept the thankless task of defending accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (multiple Tony Award winner Mark Rylance).Donovan is understandably less than enthusiastic about all of this, but his sincere belief that \"everyone deserves a defense\" leads him to take the case. In spite of (and because of) his patriotism, he represents this obviously guilty spy as zealously and ethically as he represents all his clients. In the vehement and almost universal anti-communism of 1950s America, Donovan runs down every ground ball, making him one of the most hated men in America - and even endangering his family. His wife (Amy Ryan) supports him throughout the case, but she has some trouble understanding the lengths that he goes to for Abel.Fast-forward a few years. Abel is still in prison, and Donovan brings him a letter supposedly from his wife in the U.S.S.R. The letter amounts to a back-channel proposal from the Soviets to discuss trading Abel for recently captured U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). C.I.A. director Allen Dulles personally asks Donovan to negotiate the swap - but as a private citizen, NOT as a representative of the U.S. government. Telling his wife he's going on a business trip to London, Donovan heads to East Berlin, just as the politically divided city is being physically divided by the construction of the Berlin Wall.With a C.I.A. employee (Scott Shepherd) briefing and supporting him, but needing to otherwise keep his distance, Donovan begins his dangerous mission. Navigating check points and a street gang, he walks alone from West to East Berlin for an appointment inside the Soviet embassy. He meets unofficially with another man to, as Donovan says, \"have the conversation that our governments can't\". Further complicating an already tenuous negotiation is Donovan's personal decision to insist that the prisoner swap include an innocent American university student recently detained by East German authorities. Clearly, it's going to take every ounce of Donovan's intelligence, skill and nerve to accomplish his objectives, not the least of which is avoiding getting shot or even detained and put on trial himself.\"Bridge of Spies\" is that rare movie that can make history come to life and give it the immediacy of a first-class cinematic drama/thriller. Of course, there are those (as two people behind me in the theater seemed to do) who will walk out of a movie if it isn't very quickly filled with explosions, murders or at least a good chase scene, but short-sighted individuals like that miss an opportunity to enjoy the artistry of well-crafted stories that, sadly, are not as common as they used to be. This entire cast is exceptional, especially Hanks, who is as at the top of his game in full-on thinking man's \"boy scout\" mode, and Mark Rylance who deserves significant awards season recognition and, of course, the always impressive Ryan.I should mention that the Cold War intrigue highlighted in the film's trailers is all in the second half of the film, but the script, co-written by Matt Charman and none other than Ethan and Joel Coen, is smart and compelling throughout. That story, coupled with Spielberg's expert touch, impressively recalls a time and tone that few Americans still remember, while giving us the twin dramas of a Soviet spy in the U.S. and a downed U.S. pilot in the Soviet Union. These two tales are seamlessly woven together and perfectly edited. The film also reminds us that what makes all of us Americans are not the political or religious beliefs we hold, but the principles we all stand for. \"Bridge of Spies\" is as American as apple pie and about as rewarding an experience as anyone, regardless of nationality, could hope a film to be. \"A\"",

The problem I had with it was how glaringly \"left\" the movie was, which again, coming from Spielberg doesn't surprise me. The movie is very sympathetic to a Soviet spy who was in this country stealing classified information for the Soviets. Spielberg wants us to down right like this character. This plays well in today's society but it loses its base on reality when taken out of context which is the time the activities occurred. There was during the Cold War, and still is for me, a line between providing a competent defense under the Constitution for an agent from a nation who's interests were hostile regarding our nation, and befriending the same.",

    "review": "  This flick is to be compared to \"Saving Ryan Ryan\", which likely will be regarded as the most admired of Spielberg's works. After 36 hours reflection, I liked \"Bridge of Spies\" as much as I did \"Ryan\", but for different reasons. There is a moral ambiguity to Bridge that is largely lacking in Ryan. Any character in Ryan could be killed at any moment; in Bridge, the fear is loss of soul. The protagonist, played by Tom Hanks, is a New York insurance lawyer and former Nuremberg prosecutor recommended by the Bar Association to defend a Soviet spy at the beginning of the Kennedy administration. I lived through that period, and think Spielberg is a bit over the top in illustrating the fear of nuclear destruction from the Soviets. Nonetheless the script, apparently by the Coen brothers, brilliantly demonstrates how our lawyer hero manages to save the Soviet spy from capital punishment, and of course becomes reviled by everyone except his immediate family for saving this nasty \"Russian\". In the end, it is made clear how and why this lawyer, a paragon of American legal virtues, became a much-sought-after negotiator of prisoners, eventually freeing more than 10 thousand.",

But the movie does pick up steam once the negotiations for the exchange of prisoners started. I liked the exotic Cold War locales of West and East Berlin, and some of the scenes were just poster-perfect gorgeous. I also liked how Donovan, Tom Hank's character didn't seem extraordinary except when the negotiations reallys started to bog down and you start to see how smart and shrewd he was in manipulating events. It was shocking to see how much bias the Judge and Policemen were able to get away with in 1950s America, something which isn't likely to happen that often anymore nowadays.

In a role that seems like it was written for James Stewart or Gregory Peck, Tom Hanks flourishes as a man of conviction and high integrity who never wavers in these dark times. Spielberg does a fantastic job dropping the viewer into the late 50s in the U.S. and also the early 60s in Berlin, and does a masterful building tension and keeping the audience thoroughly invested in the fate of the main characters. The only film that I can think of that felt similar to this in recent memory is \"Argo\", but I enjoyed this more!

    "review": "  I am a Historian of WWII, The Cold War and the Space Race. I was excited to see this movie was going to be inspired by historical events. Tom Hanks delivers as the man who stands up no matter times they knock him down. Donovan is a man of clear ethics and deep morality and fights for what he believes is justice under out Constitution. He finds opposition at home, at work, on the train ride to work, in the office and in the courts. Abel is a Soviet spy but Donovan was able to defend him and kept him from facing execution. This sets up the B story about the U2 spy plane being run by the CIA and their recruited pilots sheep-dipped from the USAF. Gary Powers is one of the drivers for these reconnaissance missions over Soviet territory. The U2 was not immune at 70,000+ feet as the Soviets had developed SAMs to take the jet down. Being that it was on May 1st (May Day) really infuriated the Kremlin. Donovan is now called in by the CIA to make the trade with the Soviets to get Powers back. Berlin is in chaos as the Wall had just been erected to stop the hemorrhaging of skilled people crossing the border and moving on to West Germany. The film depicts the tension between the Russians in Moscow versus the East German officials who were demanding to be a power player at the big table. They did a good job of portraying Abel as a man who carried out his mission in an honorable fashion. The reaction to Donovan defending Abel showed how passions aroused by ideology can incite a mob mentality and violence. In the end this film showed how the security state has a different view of how rules and ethics apply to them and their work. This still goes on today but we have replaced the evil Communists with the evil Islamic extremists as our current boogeyman that allows us to violate the values we claim we are defending as Americans. Excellent slice of the tense Cold War world of paranoia, mistrust and intense dislike of the other.",

    "review": "  If you have been waiting for Spielberg to make yet another fantastic film, look no further. \"Bridge of Spies\" delivers an extremely powerful (albeit straightforward) story following James Donovan (Tom Hanks), an attorney sent to dispatch a plane to Russia to take photographs. After it is shot down in mid air, the survivor of the plane is then in negotiations to be traded for a supposed Russian Spy they have in custody. With a few more complexions, this film is the perfect amount of smart, witty, and serious. Written by the Coen Brother, Steven Spielberg was able to get quite a bit of comedy out of these actors, while they simultaneously deliver sharp dialogue. Terrific performances, brilliant direction, a story definitely Spielberg worthy, and beautiful cinematography work. If you are a fan of this genre, it is not one to miss. I loved every second of \"Bridge of Spies\" and I cannot recommend it more. Although, it is definitely not for everyone. It is a bit lengthy, but the pace was perfect in my opinion. After thinking long and hard about what could have been a flaw or issue with this picture, I simply could not think of anything. \"Bridge of Spies\" is what filmmaking is all about.",

    "review": "  This film is nothing other than legendary and an immediate classic. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg are back together again, to make another incredible dramatic and genius film. With historical facts, a heartfelt and dramatic story, this film is not only bound to be an Oscar contender, but I think this film may swoop any other film this year, and win the film of the year award.This is a drama. Although it cracks jokes here and there, it really is primarily mainly a dramatic re-enactment of an historical event. The story itself is a large adventure with action and intense scenes filled with various human emotions and unpredictable actions that keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.The story starts in the middle of the Cold War, in Brooklyn. A man believed to be a Soviet Spy is arrested and, because of American law, he is supposed to get a fair trial. The man responsible for defending him in court starts noticing things and instead of just making it look like a fair trial, he actually tries to help this 'spy' get the right sort of action.I don't know how Steven Spielberg (director) does it but, he makes these stories come to life and helps you connect with the characters so that you cry, laugh and almost fall of your seat because it's so intense! The camera shots explore the scene from a variety of angles and go way beyond just showing one element. With each camera shot, you are prone to say, \"nice shot.\" For example, in one scene, they are on a bridge and, instead of showing a sky high view as you might expect, he shows it from the prospective of the people. It is snowing; you can't see the other side or the people very well. You can just see a few lights and it is just so perfect. If you are a fan of Spielberg's work as I am, you will be happy to see some of his famous wide shots which help scenes seem to float into each other.As for the acting, Tom Hanks has done many roles and this is truly one of his best. He plays a character that does so many dangerous things and does them for a few people that he doesn't even know. He shows extraordinary skill portraying this character, bringing out emotions we can relate to. Full and heartfelt, with each scene his character gets better and better to the point that you are just sitting there with your eyes wide and forgetting to breathe thinking, \"What is he going to do next?\". When he is upset, you're upset. When he is terrified, you're terrified. He is perfect for this role and this is easily one of his best work.For this film, I cannot choose a favorite scene. Each scene is so important in its own way. Each scene is so spectacularly done. Each scene is so entertaining whether it's funny, intense or dramatic One of the scenes that was most impressive is when we see an American spy flying a plane, 70,000 feet over Russian territory. He is gathering intelligence and hoping to get some information about nuclear defenses. His plane is being attacked and the problem is, he was supposed to go down with the plane. The cockpit shatters and he goes into free fall. I love the scene because it looks like he is falling from 70,000 feet at an alarming rate. The execution of this is outstanding. It is clear and intense, which is why I love it so much.The subject of this film is rather mature like the scenes near East Berlin during the time the Berlin Wall was being constructed. A part of Berlin is cut off from food and everything else. There are many other scenes featuring the impact of the Cold War. Because of these, I recommend this for ages 11 to 18. I enthusiastically give it 5 out of 5 stars because this film is legendary. It is mind blowing in so many parts and, I believe it is one of the best films I have ever seen.Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth go to kidsfirst dot orb.",

This might be their best film since \"Saving Private Ryan.\" Even though it's rated \"PG-13\" it may be a bit boring for small children.",

    "review": "  Bridge of Spies achieves the same suspenseful, intense war horror as films that rely on heavily CGI-ed explosions and gunfire, but did so without the explosions and gunfire. The edge of war and overall story is grounded in reality, and the powerful work of Spielberg, Hanks' smart and ethical Jim Donovan (who you can't help but love), and Mark Rylance's stunning performance as Rudolf Abel draw you close, politely ask for your time, and present a story that needs telling.",

    "review": "  Steven Spielberg's latest piece of work, Bridge of Spies, can best be described as \"nice.\" It doesn't ruffle any feathers. It doesn't try any splashy new techniques. And it doesn't seek to make any bold statements about anything. Instead, it is just a well told and beautifully made piece of history that is tense when it wants to be, funny when it needs to be, and leaves you completely satisfied when the end credits start to roll.Set during the height of the Cold War in 1957, the story follows James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), an affable middle-aged lawyer who is asked to do the unthinkable: defend an accused Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in court. Abel's guilt is never truly called into question, which makes him the most hated man in America but Donovan accepts the job just the same out of a sense of duty and patriotism.And although everyone expected Donovan to simply do the bare minimum to defend Abel, he actually gave it his all and took the case all the way to the Supreme Court despite the disapproval of the nation and those who he held most dear. It is only later that he is given a chance to redeem himself to naysayers by acting as the nation's negotiator to trade Abel for a captured CIA pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Sowell), who was shot down over the Soviet Union while on a mission.Donovan obviously accepts the mission and travels to Berlin, Germany in the early days of the Berlin Wall where he faces stiff CIA men, sneaky Russians, angry Germans, street toughs, and some bitterly cold weather. And as if that wasn't enough for the average American man to take on, he also gets word of a young American college student who was recently imprisoned for being a suspected spy and takes it upon himself to free him as well.This is a true story but I'll avoid spoiling any further details other than to say that Spielberg wraps the story up very pleasantly and with the typical swelling of music as titles give us happy anecdotes about what became of the film's main characters in real life. You know, typical Spielberg stuff.And even though the film is rife with traits of Spielberg's films from over the last couple decades, it also feels very much like a film from the era in which it is based. From the cinematography to the sometimes overtly obvious score by Thomas Newman, Bridge of Spies is a sort of tribute to the great films of the 1950s. Hell, it's almost hard not to imagine Jimmy Stewart in the role of James B. Donovan. This isn't the first time that Hanks has been compared to the great Jimmy Stewart and certainly won't be the last, but it continues to speak to his ongoing strength as a leading man unlike any other working today.What I really enjoyed about the film though was how Spielberg surrounded Hanks with a wonderful collection of largely unknown character actors to fill out the supporting roles beyond Amy Ryan and Alan Alda. Other directors might have easily filled any number of these roles with familiar faces simply for the sake of marketability but Spielberg seems genuinely dedicated to showcasing the best possible person for each role and it pays off in spades. Special kudos go to Rylance who plays the Soviet spy with a light twinkle in his eye that makes his relationship with Donovan truly click.As with all Spielberg productions, it is impeccably made on all levels and never feels flat. It just doesn't have that special little something that makes a really good movie into a memorably GREAT movie. People interested in history, espionage, and classic-style filmmaking will find a lot to enjoy here, but this may have trouble finding a wider audience in a world of media consumers seeking something more innovative and more overtly dramatic. But no matter what your viewing preference is, it would be hard for anyone to deny the reliably steady hand of Spielberg to deliver a solidly made film with an impressive cast and a feel-good ending. It may not be the flashiest car on the road, but it'll get there every time.",

However, this story and its execution by Hanks and Mark Rylance is remarkable and often funny (likely the contribution of the Coen Brothers). This movie is unlikely to stand the test of time as a true classic, but as an installment in Spielberg's canon, it does the job!",
