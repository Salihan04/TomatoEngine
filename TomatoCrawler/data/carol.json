    "review": "  Have you ever watched a movie that was so understated you wanted to jump into the onscreen world and push the characters around? That's exactly how I felt with Carol, an unrequited lesbian romance set against the closeted and intolerant era of 1950s America. Carol (Cate Blanchett) is a rich wife who meets Therese (Rooney Mara), a department store employee who assists with her Christmas shopping. They are both drawn to one another in the strange way that love works, and their possible relationship could jeopardize Carol's custody of her young child. Because of the time period, so much of this romantic liaison is internalized and thus we get longing looks, small gestures that are meant to speak volumes, and plenty of starting and stopping, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks. I don't have an issue with unrequited romances but Carol is one that feels like its entire world, painstakingly recreated, has been placed under glass for study. There's no passion evident throughout the movie and I was left wondering what exactly Therese saw in Carol and vice versa. Neither woman has a particularly strong personality, though that could be a side effect of having to live publicly as a different person. I couldn't get into them as characters and so felt little interest in seeing them together, which made the constant circling and nervous indecision even more belabored. Blanchett and Mara are quite good and director Todd Haynes (I'm Not There) handles the material with respectful subtlety, I just wish that Carol could have shaken off some of that subtlety and given me a better reason to care about these women. It's understated to death. Nate's Grade: C+",

    "review": "  To me, with the amount of buzz and praise that \"Carol\" is getting, I was expecting a much more powerful love story, but here we go. \"Carol,\" at its core is about two women, one young and one older, who share similar interests and have a bond unlike ever before. There have been quite a few films over the past ten years that explores this subject, so for me it will take a little more to impress. Throughout the duration of this picture, each of them question if they truly are in love and by the end of the film I had no connection to these characters whatsoever when their minds were finally made up. This is a very drab looking film set in the past, and I felt that aspect alone was only to attract an older audience, in which I really believe this film was intended. \"Carol\" is a very deep story that is not anyone who isn't of age or can buy into a relationship as drastic as this one. \"Carol,\" for me, is the epitome of a story that does what it does in order to attract attention. It's risqu� plot felt risqu� just for the sake. I will say this in favour of this movie however. With performances this good from it's two leads, this should have been a much more interesting story. \"Carol\" is pretty disappointing to say the least. I just can't get myself to recommend it, but the effort shines the whole way through and I will commend it for that. A nice attempt, but it is just not for me.",

    "review": "  2015 has been a terrific year for strong female characters and feminist stories. However, even with the competition, Carol manages to stand out. Terrific performances from Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are heightened by excellent direction from Todd Haynes, who focuses more on visual storytelling here), and a wonderful screenplay that expresses the burden of ordinary lives for women. Women, even today, have been tied down by the fate of their male lovers and societal norms, and the movie expresses this with subtlety and class. Furthermore, it expresses that this is not a story about two lesbians falling in love; it's a story about two good people falling in love. That is the mindset that society needs to get to. That is what this movie is pushing for. What a message, and what a movie. Easily one of the best of 2015.",

    "review": "  FAR FROM HEAVIN' - My Review of CAROL (4 Stars)Somewhat of a sister project to his 2002 film, FAR FROM HEAVEN, Todd Haynes' CAROL, written by Phyllis Nagy, looks at repression in the 1950's through a decidedly queer lens. It's a quiet, deliberately stilted look at the developing love between Carol, a New York suburban divorcee (Cate Blanchett) and Therese (Rooney Mara), a young department store clerk. Still in the throws of a divorce and custody battle with her husband Harge (Kyle Chandler), which has got to be the WASP-iest character name I've heard in ages, Carol meets Therese while Christmas shopping. The film opens, however, later on in the story, when Carol and Therese sit in a fancy restaurant and are interrupted by one of Therese's friends. The remainder of the film flashes back to their meeting and eventually fills us in on the importance of their dinner scene. It's a strange bookend device due to the fact that it's based on an emotional epiphany rather than a plot point. The great mystery of this film is whether or not these characters will ever be truly able to express themselves. Haynes is swimming in very familiar waters again, making another twisted variation of a Douglas Sirk melodrama. Mara is icy, interesting, and otherworldly, giving Therese a wide-eyed vacant stare that deftly hides her true feelings. She's like an eerily quiet Zooey Deschanel. It's a tricky, fill-in-the-blanks role, and Mara, resisting the tough bravado at which she typically excels, stretches herself with this minimalist approach. Chandler gives a galvanizing performance as the jilted, typically patriarchal husband who still manages to sympathetically show the hurt of losing his wife. Jake Lacy plays Mara's boyfriend, and like Chandler, he evokes sympathy due to the fact that society expected alpha male behavior from its men, even if the men weren't fully on board. Sarah Paulson plays Blanchett's ex-girlfriend, and in her very few scenes, she paints a vivid picture of a woman not afraid to be her own person, much like the actress herself. Blanchett, however, has the toughest part, and she's grand and theatrical in a way we haven't seen since the great female stars of the 30s and 40s. The performance factor necessary to conform to 50s society reads loud and clear with every formal gesture and tight smile Blanchett gives. Carol often comes off as a predator in trying to ensnare Therese, lacing her polite conversation with subtle innuendos and not-so-subtle glances. Blanchett and Mara don't so much have chemistry together as they do an odd performance friction and a cohesive dedication to the subject matter. Neither character has the tools for self-expression, and at a time where one could go to jail on morals charges, it's easy to understand why their love story is so clandestine. When Therese requests Carol's address and subsequently mails gloves she left behind, it feels like a suspenseful, sexually charged endeavor. It's a risk that still could lead to jail time, torture and even execution in many parts of the world today. It takes most of the film's running time for these women to even so much as kiss. They circle each other, speak in code, until they finally, FINALLY feel safe. Late in the film, there's a surprising turn of events that drives home the necessity for gay people to be quiet even behind closed doors. CAROL keeps things pretty chaste and at arm's length throughout. It's long been a signature of Haynes' work to play with these formalities and expose what's hidden just under the surface. If you love that style, you'll love it again in CAROL. If not, it's easy to see how some could find this to be a lifeless bore. Quite the opposite, I found the film to be achingly beautiful, sad, and swooningly powerful. The novel was the first of its kind to depict a same sex relationship that didn't end in suicide or some such tragedy. I won't spoil the ending to the film, however, but suffice it to say, Haynes and Nagy seem to delight in bringing all of the subtext usually buried in romantic storylines, and gradually laying it out on the table. This film remains true to its time and is a reminder of how far we've come as an American society, yet how far we need to go as a world community still.Adding greatly to the mood of the film is Edward Lachman's gorgeously windswept, snowy cinematography and Carter Burwell's swirling, quiet yet memorable score. It's highly reminiscent of Philip Glass' work, yet Burwell maintains his own distinct voice. Sandy Powell's costume design adds to the beautiful color palette of this film, giving both Blanchett and Mara vivid, memorable looks. Mara's hat alone feels just right for her curious, observant character. It tells us she's an artist trapped in the social mores of her time. Like its source material, Patricia Highsmith's novel, THE PRICE OF SALT, CAROL is a romance that feels like a mystery thriller. If you don't mind its formal style, stilted chastity and the feeling that Todd Haynes has already made this film before, you're likely to fall for the lushness of the furs, the restaurant smoking, the poached eggs and creamed spinach dishes and the \"love that dare not speak its name\" nature of this little gem.",

    "review": "  Making a forbidden love feel so palpable that it leaves you breathless, Carol whisks you into the early 1950s and a romance so perfectly that snapping back into reality proves challenging. You feel the passion. You feel the performances. Indeed, Blanchett and Mara ground the material to a blush-inducing goose pimply degree. Their attraction breathes authenticity from frame one, building from a simmer due to the mores of the time and slowly putting filmgoers through the paces of wanting something that they cannot touch. Then, however, the kettle boils over as only such a beautifully conveyed adaptation of a groundbreaking book can.In this R-rated romantic drama based on the novel The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith, an aspiring photographer (Mara) develops an intimate relationship with an older woman (Blanchett). Todd Haynes, who excellently emulated the Technicolor H'Wood melodrama of Golden Age director Douglas Sirk with Far from Heaven, chronicles a much more tangible '50s here. So rich in period detail that you begin to interpret social media as a communal payphone in a boarding house, Carol is an immersive period piece in every sense of the word. Bottom line: The Price of Salty",

    "review": "  \"Carol\" is a beautiful work of art. The acting is subtle, the script is simple, and the 1950's culture comes alive in this period piece. It is a shoe-in for Oscar nominations in Production Design, Costumes, and probably Best Picture. But there is one scene that will overshadow all of the other elements. The writing of an adapted screenplay comes with a responsibility to stay true to the source material but less is often more in these sorts of scenes. The human imagination is powerful and some of the most intimate scenes in cinema history have been filmed through tasteful images that do not necessitate graphic nudity. There is a reason that \"50 Shades of Gray\" does not deserve a place in the Oscars. In an artsy film like this, I actually believe that it would have been more artistic to use the powerful musical score and creative cinematography to portray this scene. The score by Carter Burwell is sublime and pulls the subtle acting and time period together into a tapestry of emotion. Its minimalist quality is reminiscent of Philip Glass's Oscar-nominated scoring of \"The Hours.\" The highlight of the film is Rooney Mara. She brings so much innocence to this role and has an amazing classical look. I would have never predicted that after seeing her in \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\" but that's what makes her such a versatile actress. She is physically contrasted by Cate Blanchett, who brings an entirely different set of emotions to the film. The beautiful thing about this film is the self-discovery that these two characters experience together but in different ways. The acting is absolutely wonderful and the film's energy comes directly from the vivid portrayals of these characters. We spend most of the film waiting for something big to happen, only to realize that the \"something big\" is happening inside of Therese and Carol. This film needs to be approached like a painting. Rather than looking for something unexpected, you will experience the beauty of \"Carol\" through the growth of its characters and by absorbing the visually marvelous 1950's atmosphere.",

Taking place in the 1950's the film follows a young lady named Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) who is an inspiring photographer that is working at a toy store in New York when she encounters an older woman named Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett). They both get the vibes off each other and soon enough Carol calls Therese and they go on a lunch date together. Both women are in relationships, but they're not going anywhere, or just not working. Therese has a boyfriend, but doesn't seem to fond of him and Carol is going through a divorce from her husband Harge (Kyle Chandler). Harge takes Carols young daughter away from her and awaits the lawyers for their divorce. During this time a heart broken Carol takes young Therese with her on a road trip where they both realize they have strong feelings for each other. When they get back to New York they both have to make tough decisions. Therese wants to focus on her career while Carol just wants her daughter back in her life. The decisions are what define us and the plot itself gives us an understanding that the two women although divided by age love each other. I would have liked it to show a bit more of how homosexuality was seen during the 50's, but the film barely scratches that surface. The film itself is a bit slow paced and really is just about a road trip that seems to end too soon. The performances are the main reason for this one and overall i'd say its a rent!",

But somehow I couldn't connect 100% emotionally. Cate Blanchett is always seriously good but I don't think this is absolutely her best work. Her character was a little too one dimensional and distant. Maybe that was deliberate but it just kept me a little at arms length. It does finish strongly though and Rooney Mara is quite superb.

The acting was good, but the movie was slow paced and, actually, a bit boring. I did like Rooney Mara's character and performance. Cate was good too, but I believe the movie suffers from a predictable story and was very slow paced. I give it 3 stars because of the superb acting, but I waited to see this after all the other nominated movies. You might consider doing the same.",

    "review": "  Carol touches on the idea that love can be a difficult concept to grasp and may cause confusion to those who aren't certain about their sexuality. It's a great topic to look into; if only certain points of the movie were more subtle about it than having Mara's character try to beat around the bush asking her almost boyfriend if he's ever loved a boy.We begin by seeing Therese and Carol talking in a lobby when Therese is spotted by an old friend who asks her if she is attending a party. Therese goes with the friend while reflecting on Carol, sending us into the past to the events right before Therese and Carol meet. When Therese spots Carol for the first time in the store where she works, it seems very similar to the notion of the male gaze often found in narrative cinema. There is a clear interest in the figure before Therese gets distracted, but they of course meet a few moments later. They aren't necessarily flirting, but they are two people with a connection, and perhaps that's what love is - as long as the connection is strong enough.Kyle Chandler as Carol's husband Harge (his name is Harge?) is the closest thing to an antagonist in this film, and this role is somewhat strange. At first it seems that he feels Carol is evil because she is a lesbian who won't come out and say it, but you have to put into context that he's the father of her child, and by seeing other people (women or not) she is damaging the relationship she has with her husband, a relationship that would affect the child. What seems to be overly dramatic is the fact that he doesn't think she is fit to have joint custody simply due to these lies she is trying to cover up. Carol is a struggling lesbian in a time well before anybody like her would be accepted, and because of this she has to be condemned? This film is partially about the struggles of the LGBT community, but that allegation seems too dramatic considering the actual circumstances within the film.This film is definitely well-acted by both Mara and Blanchett. Both leads have their own internal struggles with who they are and what love really means. Mara's playing her character as shy and fragile is top notch while Blanchett shines as being confident but overwhelmed and sometimes heart-broken by the results of her actions. If you don't mind sex, Carol is not really that heavy with \"bad\" content for an R-rated movie. This film is easy to watch and explores great issues, but at certain points comes across as cheesy or tries too hard to be dramatic.3.0/4.0",

    "review": "  Carol is complicated. Outwardly, it's a retro-drama about forbidden love between two women in the 1950s. Underneath, it's looking at the more complex and intriguing world of human connection. It's sexy yet proper; it's delicate yet strong; it's romantic yet haunting; a picturesquely shot period-piece that stuns with its beauty, both visually and aurally (the score is mesmerizing). So with all the technical perfection, why did I find it to be the most critically overrated movie of 2015? Despite its unendingly admirable skill, it left me unsatisfied and, worse yet, emotionally confused.Mara plays a na�ve young woman spellbound and emotionally seduced by Blanchett's broken and mesmerizing Carol, a woman who seems to have a \"There's-Something-About-Carol\"-esque effect on everyone she meets. Both actresses are as phenomenal as you've probably heard, but our relationship to them is nearly as frustrating as their relationship is to each other. In a terribly confused bit of story framing, we meet them at the end of their relationship before going back to the beginning, as we watch the sheepishly sweet Mara get emotionally destroyed by the almost predatory Blanchett. This would be fine, except the movie itself doesn't seem to be wrongly convinced that Carol is ultimately a \"good\" person, giving her too many chances to plead her selfish case.Herein lies the complication: despite these flaws, it's a visually gorgeous and thematically interesting film. Director Haynes creates a hazy atmosphere in his perfect Christmas setting, highlighting the similarities between its titular character and the holiday season's preposterous promises. Unfortunately these noble positives couldn't mask my overwhelming sense that Carol was less-than-noble in its own messaging.",

It felt like the relationship portrayed, kind of awkward at first, circling around each other just observing, waiting. But gradually and powerfully, I was drawn in and fell under its spell. Seduced. I always felt like I was in expert hands, the cinematography, the non linear direction of the tale and of course the exquisite use of non verbals highlighted in other reviews. A delicate touch here, glance or smile communicates so much more powerfully than the spoken word. I notice that Carol is not nominated for an Academy Award which I find bizarre. If this isn't the finest movie of 15/16 I'd be amazed.

    "review": "  When was the last time you ate a really dry piece of toast??? No butter or jam, no brown sugar or honey, no breakfast protein to compliment it of any kind, and nothing to wash it down with. . . A pretty dry experience, isn't it? Sure, stripped of all the excess, that dry piece of toast may be good under certain circumstances (diet, hangover, quick eat, etc), but it doesn't take away the feeling of utter blandness when attempting to swallow that crusty mouthful. This is the best way I can explain my sentiments for \"Carol\", the new art house romance starring Academy Award darling Cate Blanchett and relative newcomer Rooney Mara (American remake of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo). Adapted from the novel, \"The Price of Salt\", this story details a taboo for its time love affair between two women who meet in a down town Manhattan shopping center one 1950s Christmas night. Therese (Mara) is a mousy young woman still unsure of her sexuality and rather reserved because of it. When she first lays eyes on Carol (Blanchett), albeit subtle, the attraction and the connection is almost instant. It begins innocently enough. Small talk exchanges and little outings. Soon though, things begin to evolve as Therese finds out this may not be Carol's first rodeo. Carol does have a husband who is aware of his wife's true feelings, and they do have a young daughter caught in the web of their marital issues, but this does not deter the way she proceeds with her new relationship with Therese.  It is understood that this film is generally respected by critics and audiences alike, so before I get people chastising me for \"not getting it\" because I didn't think it was as endearing of a romance as most people did, hear me out. . . I fully offer a disclaimer that I was sleep deprived that day and may not have been in the right frame of mind to experience this one. That being said, the film's gentle touch of thematic material proves to be a double edge sword. The soft spoken dialogue, the classical musical score, those hazy while seemingly crisp shots that give the 50s scene a somewhat regal vibe, and plot points that carress more than they slap. A true to its word sleepy \"affair\", this put my minor case of A.D.D. to the toughest of tests. Little things like how many grams of sugar were in my excessively sweetened tea I had to purchase to stay awake did not escape my drifting attention as I stared at the health label. Nor did the amount of times the phone of the woman sitting directly behind me rang three quarters of the way through the film. It was eleven. . . Eleven times, and I'm not even that mad because it was the most my attention peaked through the entire show. There was a longing on my part for legitimate conflict and resolution in the film as much these lovely ladies were longing for one another. Filmmaker Todd Haynes, responsible for other beautifully done yawn-inducers like Far From Heaven, I'm Not There, and the semi recent Mildred Pierce mini-series, stays consistent to say the least. Blanchett does what she typically does to woo the audience and find her occasional dialogue driven moments to wow, while I found Mara to be more morose and a rather weak compliment regardless of the award season buzz she has been getting. While \"Carol\" is sensually shot and contains elements of a classical touch while diving into the depths of feminine desire, it in the end was simply a romantic drama that leads you on like a date going REALLY well, only to conclude with bad sex. Leaving both parties thinking, \"that was it, huh???\"GRADE: C",

    "review": "  -Carol is een 2015 Amerikaans-britse romantisch drama film geregisseerd door Todd Haynes, vanuit een screenplay door Phyllis Nagy, gebaseerd op de roman The Price of Salt (ook bekend als Carol) van Patricia Highsmith. De film sterren Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Sarah Paulson en Kyle Chandler. Afspelend in 1952 in New York City, de film vertelt het verhaal van een jonge ambitieuze fotograaf en haar relatie met een oudere vrouw die een moeilijke echtscheiding doormaakt. Highsmith baseerde het karakter van Therese Belivet op zichzelf, na een ontmoeting die ze had in 1948 met een vrouw terwijl ze werkte bij Bloomingdales in New York City. Deze ontmoeting inspireerde haar tot het schrijven van het verhaal.-Carol was in ontwikkeling voor meer dan 11 jaar door de Britse producenten van Number 9 Films en Film4 Productions. De film is een coproductie van New York-based Killer Films. Principiele fotography begon in maart 2014 in Cincinnati, Ohio, en duurde 34 dagen. De film werd geschoten op Super 16 mm. Carol werd geselecteerd om te strijden voor de Palme d'of op de 2015 Cannes Film Festival, waar Mara gestrikt werd voor beste actrice award. De film heeft lovende kritieken ontvangen. Zij opende in beperkte release op 20 november 2015 in de Verenigde Staten, en werd uitgebracht in het Verenigd Koninkrijk op 27 november 2015.--Kritische ontvangst:-Carol kreeg een uitbundig respons, waaronder een staande ovatie op haar Filmfestival internationale pers screening en premiere. Critici prezen vooral Haynes' richting Blanchett en Mara's voorstellingen, de cinematografie, kostuums en score, en vond het een geduchte concurrent voor een Cannes award. Over de herziening aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, de film heeft een 94% goedkeuringsscore gebaseerd op beoordelingen van 173 critici, met een gemiddelde score van 8,6 uit 10.De site's kritische consensus luidt: \"Gevormd door Todd Haynes' kundige leiding en ondersteund door een sterke cast geleid door Cate Blanchett en Rooney Mara, Carol leeft op tot zijn baanbrekende bronmateriaal.\" met een aangepaste score van 99.76%, Carol vernoemd \"1\" \"Best-Reviewed Romantieke film 2015\" in haar jaarlijkse Golden Tomato Awards. Op Metacritic, de film ontving een gewogen gemiddelde score van 95/100 gebaseerd op 44 critici, met vermelding \"success\".Carol werd Metacritic's best gerievewde film van 2015.",

There are lots of long, loving looks exchanged between the two, but there is never the sense that either of them has the faintest idea who the other really is. So why the deep devotion to each other? The audience is never told. In fact it's never clear why they are attracted to each other to begin with--the \"opposites attract\" thing doesn't work here either, because frankly, there is no clarity whether they are opposite or alike. I had expected to like it, but instead found myself angry with the director for making the audience work so hard for so little payoff.",

    "review": "  Cate Blanchett is my favorite actress, so it is quite painful for me to not like this film. Yes, the cinematography is stunning. The costumes are stunning. Cate is as beautiful as always, but it seemed as though she had too much Botox and cheek fillers before filming. The loooooong slow looks were flat, conveying very little information or too difficult to interpret. A little more dialogue would have helped a tremendously. A few plot tricks would have made the movie much more plausible. For instance, instead of staring blankly at the envelope with the gloves in it, then mailing them, if Rooney Mara's character had taken the train to NJ, mooning all through the ride, then shown up at Carol's door with the gloves, that would have advanced understanding of an attraction between the women a thousand fold. The fights between Carol and her husband sprang up out of nowhere and nothing. They just appeared as though the script writer was following classroom instructions: \"oh, you need to have some conflict here\". Toward the end of the movie, where Carol makes a stand at the lawyer's office is the first time we see Cate Blanchett being the great actress she is. Otherwise, It was just looooooonng, not really smoldering looks. Like pictures in a magazine. And Rooney Mara's constant pout was tiresome by the end of the movie. The scene where she was attending a party she obviously hated, and appeared to stay for HOURS, was too long. Surely she would have come into the realization that that's not where she wanted to be and rushed off to Carol much sooner than she did. And that would have added a touch of emotion to the movie, which it was sorely missing.",

Tensions between society, family and a love that \"should never be\". Tension also makes up the fabric of the musical score with it's the relentless repetition of notation and theme, ebbing and flowing...with a tempo not unlike that of a train \"lurching\" on a track. Everything in this movie appears to be fluid engulfing and enveloping one with a myriad of emotions, juxtaposing tense scenes against seemingly banal ones. But it is this juxtaposition that gives the movie it's power, it's presence, it's passion.Cate Blanchett's performance was beyond words.... stunning! The subtlety of the acting, the ever present nuances are the predominant features that sets this movie apart from any other I have seen, and may ever see again. This film is quite simply a masterpiece. Bravo Todd Haynes and encore.",

    "review": "  Todd Haynes, Rooney Mara, and Cate Blanchett have created an internal romance that speaks deeply through the eyes of the actresses and Haynes' understated direction.Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett are incredible at conveying so much meaning in every subtlety. Watching their faces and eyes alone will tell you so much about the characters, their lives, and their passions. Mara's character is in a relationship with a man she has no passion for that she's fallen into because of her saying \"yes\" to everything. Haynes constructs this \"yes\" society of the time period through the careful crafting of the production elements to look almost like it was filmed during the 50s. It all feels so conventional and structured, which makes it feel more powerful as the characters attempt to venture outside of that. The cinematography helps us to feel how distant Therese feels from society, and Carol becomes her escape from that, her something more. Through Mara's performance, we feel the ignition of sparks in her eyes when she is around Carol, and the emptiness outside of that relationship.Blanchett's Carol is magnetic and carefully composed on the surface, and like Mara, she always allows us to see beneath her exterior. The biggest difference between Therese and Carol is their maturity. Carol understands what happens in relationships like hers and Therese's, but Therese is yet to realize. She also struggles with the custody of her daughter in a divorce that she's making between her and her resistant husband, played by a great Kyle Chandler. Blanchett, like Mara, shows how her character feels distant from society, struggling not to compromise her passions for conformity, but with more understanding of the way the world works than Therese.The way that Mara and Blanchett exchange looks is a miracle of acting, able to communicate so much with so little. They deliver the film's carefully used dialogue with deep understanding of the truth of the material. A phone call that takes place around the midpoint of the film conveys a lifetime of suppressed feeling with only two short lines of dialogue. Technically, the meticulousness of Haynes' craft is undeniable, but it's also all purposeful. The overall style is a less extreme version of the 50s mimicking Haynes did with Far From Heaven, giving the film a distinct feel for its period and a freedom to use more modern techniques. Right down to the colors of the walls, every element is carefully chosen to create precise feeling and moods in a film that relies so heavily on the audience reading them.Carol shows us two women who live for the sparks they get from their passions, but whose passions aren't allowed. Therese and Carol face the turmoil that comes with trying to live a life of love under futile conditions. Like the train sets in the film, the train always comes back to where it started, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth boarding. After watching Carol two times, I can say that it gets better the more one thinks about it, and that not everyone will have the same visceral response. My emotional response was mixed, not as powerful as I wanted it to be, or as others have had, but that's simply how the movie is. Without a doubt, Carol is a great and singular film with a lot of meaning that expertly tells a love story through the insides.",

    "review": "  Let me start with the positives and work my way to the negatives (for me). The acting was certainly good; I don't know if it was great, but it was good. The music was lovely, as was the cinema photography; it's a lovely movie to watch. Still, I found myself squirming in my seat too much; the movie is, at times tasteful to the point of being listless and melancholic. I found myself thinking \"OK, get on with it, whatever 'it' is going to be.\" It takes its sweet time getting there; in the meanwhile there are characters....that I didn't particularly understand or care for. I was not quite sure why the young salesgirl was so enchanted with the ice-queenish Carol. She was meant to be somewhat naive and definitely inexperienced, yet the character of Carol struck me as a female iceberg in fur, all piss elegance and artifice. Perhaps that was all intentional; unfortunately, it made her look predatorial and kind of pompous, all style and no soul. Cate Blanchett certainly played the role to the hilt. I had about the same emotional reaction to this movie as I did Far From Heaven, a sort of \"Okay, I get it; it was bitch being gay in that era.\" Carol has all the ear-marks of a rather too precious art film trying to be a mainstream entertainment. It is a noble achievement in its way, but so was The Passion of Christ and I couldn't bear to watch that one. I will always support Hayne's movies, he is brilliant and I think I've seen them all. I just look forward to his making a film about gay people that flips the coin and tells a happier story, not just fragility, tragedy, and melodrama. So many books I read about gay people ended with the characters hanging themselves, slitting their wrists, or being murdered: ENOUGH. Carol hints at genuine hope so it's not exactly a wallow in tragedy, but can't anyone tell one happy story about gay people, or do I keep my copy of \"Maurice\" ever at hand to remind me that it's possible?",

    "review": "  Writer-Director Todd Haynes film \"Carol\" is not filled with carols of joy, but works very effectively. It centers on a lesbian relationship set in 1950's New York between a chain-smoking socialite named (see title of movie) and a shy shopgirl named Therese. As many of Haynes movies, it has that cinematic aura of the golden era of Hollywood; which he puts his Haynes on for. The character Carol, genuinely played by the great Cate Blanchett, is going through the first phases of a divorce from her alcoholic & abusive husband Harge; and yes, Harge was a bit harsh on Carol. Carol then unexpectedly meets Therese at the department store where Therese works at, and an instant connection develops that consequently develops into a gradual unification. Rooney Mara was astounding as Therese and is very worthy of her Best Supporting Actress nomination; even though \"Carol\" should have really been titled \"Therese\", you get my Therese thrift? Chandler (who is a profoundly underrated) was strong as Harge in his supporting performance. Carter Burwell's soothing score was the best I have heard in a motion picture this year; score that one for an Oscar win in my book. \"Carol\" does move a bit slow (in more ways than one) so please be patient with it, but at the end I am sure you will enjoy the \"Carol\". **** Good",

As for all of the long, conversation less scenes including the many driving scenes, I mean... it's really lacking in content. And also very dry with next to no humor. The trailer caught my attention, but the actual movie was hard to endure. Sorry. Thumbs down. Would have liked to have been surprised by the characters instead of always being shown the same quality of one thing only in their emotions.The movie tries to convince us that all you need is pure \"attraction\" which then eliminates the need to actually \"converse\" with the person. But, come on. This is real life or at least trying to depict that. So overall, not believable.

Her performance is so stagey it almost felt to me like she was trapped in the heady aura of her own perfume - there was not one moment when I believed her, or believed her as a genuine, living breathing human being falling in love with another. Rooney Mara is a much more honest actress and if at times her blank, entranced stare gets a bit annoying its because she is just playing off of what Ms Blanchett is giving her which is a statuesque performance rather than a human connection.

I assume this over cooked performance was encouraged by Mr Haynes. By contrast Rooney Mara is a passive, blank. Cate Blanchette seems like a snake poised to consume a mouse. There is not even one character to care about. Although one might feel sorry for the hapless husband and neglected daughter of Carol. I found myself gobbling up the production design and set decoration just to hang on to this glacial romance. No sparks, no laughs, no surprises. I guess people are hungry for a good lesbian love story, I suggest you look up AIMEE AND JAGUAR ...there needs to be more to recommend a work of art than a happy ending.And the ending isn't that happy",

As far as beige romance films go, it has a very solid pairing at its center, and when Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett share the screen, their chemistry is undeniable. Mara is particularly fantastic throughout, but Blanchett is shockingly a bit hammy. While their chemistry makes their relationship believable, its a stoic sort of chemistry, which renders the film a mild slog. Its fantastic that it comes across as more than a statement film, while not ignoring the realities of its period, but its less than compelling.",

    "review": "  Have you ever watched a movie that was so understated you wanted to jump into the onscreen world and push the characters around? That's exactly how I felt with Carol, an unrequited lesbian romance set against the closeted and intolerant era of 1950s America. Carol (Cate Blanchett) is a rich wife who meets Therese (Rooney Mara), a department store employee who assists with her Christmas shopping. They are both drawn to one another in the strange way that love works, and their possible relationship could jeopardize Carol's custody of her young child. Because of the time period, so much of this romantic liaison is internalized and thus we get longing looks, small gestures that are meant to speak volumes, and plenty of starting and stopping, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks. I don't have an issue with unrequited romances but Carol is one that feels like its entire world, painstakingly recreated, has been placed under glass for study. There's no passion evident throughout the movie and I was left wondering what exactly Therese saw in Carol and vice versa. Neither woman has a particularly strong personality, though that could be a side effect of having to live publicly as a different person. I couldn't get into them as characters and so felt little interest in seeing them together, which made the constant circling and nervous indecision even more belabored. Blanchett and Mara are quite good and director Todd Haynes (I'm Not There) handles the material with respectful subtlety, I just wish that Carol could have shaken off some of that subtlety and given me a better reason to care about these women. It's understated to death. Nate's Grade: C+",

    "review": "  What is love? How does it start, how does it grow? At what point does it blossom from that warm butterfly'd feeling into something more substantial and exclusive? And at what point does it start to fizzle out, and why? Carol, the new film from Todd Haynes, the maestro director of the melodramatic, asks these questions against the stifled and somewhat plastic backdrop of upper and upper-middle class late 40's America. At time when the American dream was measured not in how happy you were on the inside, or even how much stuff you had on the outside, but how you carried these things.There has been a fascination with this juxtaposition of well to do Americans in internal agony in the 50's in the cinema forever. The best examples of this have come from Douglas Sirk, who's plastic pictures about plastic people trying to hide their discontent, and failing, have influenced film and filmmakers since their releases throughout the 50's. A more recent example of this is Sam Mendes' Revolutionary Road from 2008. But the difference between these films and Carol, is that Carol's characters have far more difficulty hiding their struggles, and, in the case of Carol herself, must decide at a point whether it is better to pretend and make things easier in one regard, or be true and make things easier in another regard. Carol is essentially about two women. Carol, who is in a loveless marriage, which is crumbling despite her husband's best efforts to hold the relationship's tattered strings together, and Therese, who seems to be floating aimlessly through life, unsure of what she wants, but sure she wants more out of life than what she has. They meet at a department store where Therese works and sparks fly between them in a mutual attraction that, under the cover of secondary objectives, blossoms into a full fledged affair. The film takes great care in presenting the details of falling in love. When you're falling for someone, every glance, every light touch, everything you say and, more importantly, everything you don't say become novels of passion and waterfalls of emotion that are forever cascading within yourself, but remain hidden from the other person. Carol nails these minutia while adding another layer to the attraction cake it bakes: forbidden love. This is the 1940's remember and same sex love was considered not only morally wrong, but in many ways criminally wrong. At least as far as the character of Carol is concerned, who's husband is suing her for full custody of their only child on the grounds of moral indecency in essence, because he knows she's a lesbian.  It would be easy to film this story in a straightforward, unassuming way, with static camera positions and proper angles. But Haynes and cinematographer Ed Lachman do something brilliant with the material and chooses instead to mimic 1940's photography by shooting it with 16mm film and using expressionistic angles and focal points to create not only an achingly beautiful film to look at, but a emotional visual palette to explain the wants, desires, and tribulations of the characters in lieu of expositional dialogue. This is a film where even the natural grain of the 16mm film tells you something about the story. Watching it is akin to finding a very old book in a library or bookstore that was never opened and flipping through its browned pages, revelling in the smell and the feel of a bygone era, and as such connecting to that era and the people who lived it. 2015 was filled with films with astounding cinematography and Carol is one of the best looking films of the year. On one hand Carol seems to evoke the classic lyric from the classic Buzzcocks song, 'Ever Fallen In Love With Someone (You Shouldn't Have Fallen In Love With)', on the other, it seems to champion not only same sex love, which is no different than opposite sex love (l'amour c'est l'amour, as they say), but the importance of being who you are, even if it sets you apart. It is a beautiful film beautifully done and one of the best of the year.What is love? Go see Carol.",

    "review": "  Making a forbidden love feel so palpable that it leaves you breathless, Carol whisks you into the early 1950s and a romance so perfectly that snapping back into reality proves challenging. You feel the passion. You feel the performances. Indeed, Blanchett and Mara ground the material to a blush-inducing goose pimply degree. Their attraction breathes authenticity from frame one, building from a simmer due to the mores of the time and slowly putting filmgoers through the paces of wanting something that they cannot touch. Then, however, the kettle boils over as only such a beautifully conveyed adaptation of a groundbreaking book can.In this R-rated romantic drama based on the novel The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith, an aspiring photographer (Mara) develops an intimate relationship with an older woman (Blanchett). Todd Haynes, who excellently emulated the Technicolor H'Wood melodrama of Golden Age director Douglas Sirk with Far from Heaven, chronicles a much more tangible '50s here. So rich in period detail that you begin to interpret social media as a communal payphone in a boarding house, Carol is an immersive period piece in every sense of the word. Bottom line: The Price of Salty",

However it also fails to marvel or deliver an exemplary performance that will stick with you for the ages. I never read the novel on which this movie is based on, so it might be a faithful rendition or a terrible adaptation. So at some level I might be missing something critical. From the pure movie perspective, I think Carol does a reasonable job at showcasing the complexities of sexual evolution and crisis, most notably in a period when things were far less understood and accepted than they are today.Sadly I didn't get the feelings I was expecting and the music (not the jazz, but the score) somewhat bored me.

There have been quite a few films over the past ten years that explores this subject, so for me it will take a little more to impress. Throughout the duration of this picture, each of them question if they truly are in love and by the end of the film I had no connection to these characters whatsoever when their minds were finally made up. This is a very drab looking film set in the past, and I felt that aspect alone was only to attract an older audience, in which I really believe this film was intended. \"Carol\" is a very deep story that is not anyone who isn't of age or can buy into a relationship as drastic as this one. \"Carol,\" for me, is the epitome of a story that does what it does in order to attract attention. It's risqu� plot felt risqu� just for the sake. I will say this in favour of this movie however. With performances this good from it's two leads, this should have been a much more interesting story. \"Carol\" is pretty disappointing to say the least.

    "review": "  +\"\"Carol\" is an excellent movie with one major negative aspect and two minor quibbles but more about those later. There is no finding fault with the cast as Cate Blanchett a wealthy married woman seeking a divorce from her husband Kyle Chandler. Blanchett has previously had an affair with Sarah Paulson, a school friend, and is now embarking on an affair with young, not rich, department store clerk, Rooney Mara. The latter is going with a dapper, rich, sort of snobbish boy played by Jake Lacey, though it is Blanchette who buys her the expensive camera she needs to further her pursuit of a career as a photographer. There is also John Magaro a poor, nice guy who works at the New York Times who might be able to help Mara get a job there but he also has feelings for her. Along with the minor figures in \"Carol\" each and every performer gives their best and in the case of Blanchett, Mara and Chandler that is high praise indeed.The director Todd Haynes, the screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, the perfect production design by Judy Becker, the camera work by Ed Lachman along with the costumes by Sandy Powell and the period music by Carter Burwell bring us a perfect picture of the early 1950s. Not only do we see the right cars like Blanchette's Packard and her full length creamy mink coat but the streets of New York, the Oak Room of the Plaza hotel but even more important the morality of that time regarding homosexuality and the blackmail that can ensue even from people who love you. Though wealth and class levels are brought forward they are done in subtle ways still getting the message across.There is nothing salacious or predatory about the older woman/younger woman really drifting into an affair with the older woman being who she is and the younger woman finding out who she is. Blanchett and Mara are completely believable in this journey they are taking together.Now we come to the negative aspect and the quibbles mentioning the latter first. It is very perplexing considering her love for her child that Blanchett would allow her child to be driven by Chandler who is drunk. Another 'driving' incident is that though we know they are wealth there is never any hint, suggestion, showing that they have a chauffeur though we do see the other household staff and yet in another scene we see Chandler stepping into the rear of a car and being driven away. Petty? Quibbling? Possibly but this is part of the negative aspect that found my very disappointing in \"Carol\". I am a sucker for a love story, whether it be between opposite or same sex couples, and yet, in spite of their top rate performances, and even their non-threatening sex scene, I felt nothing for this couple. I didn't, couldn't, find myself rooting for them.It is because of this feeling, this lack of being emotionally involved with what was going on in the film I find myself in a very small minority and would only recommend \"Carol\" if you have a 'thing' for the early 1950s!",

    "review": "  2015 has been a terrific year for strong female characters and feminist stories. However, even with the competition, Carol manages to stand out. Terrific performances from Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are heightened by excellent direction from Todd Haynes, who focuses more on visual storytelling here), and a wonderful screenplay that expresses the burden of ordinary lives for women. Women, even today, have been tied down by the fate of their male lovers and societal norms, and the movie expresses this with subtlety and class. Furthermore, it expresses that this is not a story about two lesbians falling in love; it's a story about two good people falling in love. That is the mindset that society needs to get to. That is what this movie is pushing for. What a message, and what a movie. Easily one of the best of 2015.",

    "review": "  I want that 2 hours of my life back. Carol deals with an important and emotional subject. But unless you find watching grass grow, paint dry, or water boiling fascinating, this movie is a disaster. The pace was so agonizingly slow that I regularly checked my pulse. If there is a hell it would be being forced to watch the slow, endless, ponderous, looks of love and longing between Cate Blanchett and Roony Mara for eternity. The look of the film is wonderful, as in the directors previous Far From Heaven his recreation of the 1950's is award worthy. No doubt a lens has never been crafted that doesn't portray Ms Blanchett as drop dead gorgeous. And yeah, yeah, I know, its going to win tons of awards and the critics love it. But I just wanted to get the hell out of the theater. So, maddeningly, slow. And I sat through a 10-hour marathon of LOTR in the theater no problem. Cate Blanchett's stupid, stupid, choices, Roony Mara's empty and vacant personality, the portrayal of every man as an idiotic interruption, and the young daughter as a victim of a selfish mother who couldn't keep it in her skirt long enough for the divorce to be finalized. Go ahead. Give it the academy award. But that will be politics not cinema. I'm still trying to wake up. 2 yawns way, way, down.",

    "review": "  Critics are raging about CAROL but, in my opinion, is over-hyped. The acting by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara is ok but not the career best (for Blanchett) that many are describing. The story is very simple at its heart - a lesbian affair of an older woman with a younger woman. The film is based on the novel originally published in 1952 under the title The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith (later published as Carol). The story may have been groundbreaking in the 1950s, but I'm not sure it has the same shock value now as it would have then.The cinematography of CAROL is beautiful and the whole thing is almost obsessively perfect in the presentation of the era. The story is presented in very subtle and nuanced terms but doesn't have the intensity or impact I was expecting - it's all very cold and seems to push the viewer into the distance rather than drawing us into the events. Having said that, not knowing how the story is going to unfold evokes a sort of hypnotic fascination waiting for something to happen. The climactic moment, when it comes, is underwhelming. Yes, it's beautiful; but CAROL seems more about atmosphere than substance.",

    "review": "  Two reviews of the film: \"Carol\" (one true, one false)Review #1 (No Spoilers)Todd Haynes' film \"Carol\" is truly the worthiest contender for the Best Picture in this coming Academy Awards ceremony. Breaking new ground with it's incredibly brave portrayal of a loving lesbian relationship, realized by a star of cinema, this film challenges viewers prejudices and sensibilities in new ways never before seen in mainstream cinema. All those who advocate for the LGBTQWXYZ community need to rush out and purchase tickets to this film to translate that support into a meaningful contribution of both time and money! This film is a beautiful and touching celebration of love and respect between two people who, despite having to overcome a great many socio-economic obstacles are both willing to pursue their visions of love and a better world. I heartily recommend this revolutionary film which shatters the pink ceiling and can usher in a new age of tolerance and understanding for not only the Lesbian community, but for all of man and womankind!Review #2 ******* SPOILERS!!!!! *********One of the craftiest (and genuinely best-crafted) films of the year, Todd Hayne's \"Carol\" takes the cake for being the best straight-faced rendition of \"Lolita\" to come on screen this millennium. A tongue-in-cheek paean to the controlling power of the 1%, the film portrays a spoiled, filthy rich woman (\"Carol\") who sets her sights on her desires and whose money and privilege will not let her take \"No\" as any sort of answer. As Carol sets out to seduce and dominate the juvenile and uncertain Therese, her only obstacles are her imagined love for her daughter (a social formality she is unwilling to dispense with but willing to play to the hilt) and her equally rich 1%-er husband. But Carol can and will have it all: in the end she ditches the unwanted husband, gets the girl, and gets the other girl. She uses her money and wiles to accomplish this, setting herself up ultimately as the grand dominatrix of the film - all the characters ultimately bow to her power. Cold, unsympathetic, calculating and feigning, the ultimate freeze frame shows her (false) smile of the triumph of power over those around her who will never be free to operate on their own but will willingly let themselves controlled by the allure of wealth, power, and \"culture\" which Carol symbolizes. This is a wicked trick on Haynes' part whose \"Far From Heaven\" was a sincere protest against the social prejudices of the 1950s; here, in \"Carol\", the film is a celebration of the naked power of wealth and privilege. Don't pay to see it in the theater, however, where swooning audiences seem to utterly miss the dynamics of control and manipulation, but give your money to Netflix, if you have to. Haynes, meanwhile, is surely laughing all the way to the bank as audience members hearts throb with warm-fuzzies of social progressivism while missing the mute but screaming rage of the film which shows the way in which wealth utterly exploits the less fortunate.",

    "review": "  \"Carol\" is a beautiful work of art. The acting is subtle, the script is simple, and the 1950's culture comes alive in this period piece. It is a shoe-in for Oscar nominations in Production Design, Costumes, and probably Best Picture. But there is one scene that will overshadow all of the other elements. The writing of an adapted screenplay comes with a responsibility to stay true to the source material but less is often more in these sorts of scenes. The human imagination is powerful and some of the most intimate scenes in cinema history have been filmed through tasteful images that do not necessitate graphic nudity. There is a reason that \"50 Shades of Gray\" does not deserve a place in the Oscars. In an artsy film like this, I actually believe that it would have been more artistic to use the powerful musical score and creative cinematography to portray this scene. The score by Carter Burwell is sublime and pulls the subtle acting and time period together into a tapestry of emotion. Its minimalist quality is reminiscent of Philip Glass's Oscar-nominated scoring of \"The Hours.\" The highlight of the film is Rooney Mara. She brings so much innocence to this role and has an amazing classical look. I would have never predicted that after seeing her in \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\" but that's what makes her such a versatile actress. She is physically contrasted by Cate Blanchett, who brings an entirely different set of emotions to the film. The beautiful thing about this film is the self-discovery that these two characters experience together but in different ways. The acting is absolutely wonderful and the film's energy comes directly from the vivid portrayals of these characters. We spend most of the film waiting for something big to happen, only to realize that the \"something big\" is happening inside of Therese and Carol. This film needs to be approached like a painting. Rather than looking for something unexpected, you will experience the beauty of \"Carol\" through the growth of its characters and by absorbing the visually marvelous 1950's atmosphere.",

    "review": "  This is a lovely film with beautiful chemistry between Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. Blanchett is not an actress that I will rush out to see in any old movie but this is a really remarkable performance and one her best to date. Just the amount of elegance in her voice, the looks she gives towards different characters, the way she takes a drink, and the power she has when she has to be in a verbal fight with her ex husband all blend together in this remarkable way making this definitely Blanchett's best character she has been able to play that can show so much range. It may not be better personally than her remarkable performance in Truth also from this year but it comes very close. Rooney Mara is an actress that I've really enjoyed these past few years since her breakouts in The Social Network and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo but this has to be the first time she has really played a bubbly warm character. She often times is somewhat type cast in cold but strong women roles but here you get to see her dimples as she gushes and flirts with Blanchett. The whole discussion about Mara being in the Supporting categories at certain award shows in ridiculous because it's just out of the question both are equal leads but to me if they are competing in the same category, Blanchett is the one I would give the award to first. Kyle Chandler is outstanding as Carol's ex husband in a small but powerful part that Chandler can really show off his acting skills commanding the screen in every moment he gets the chance to. It would be a really lovely thing if Chandler could sneak into the awards race coat tailing off the success the movie will have at the Oscars. Sarah Paulson is also great in the small amount she gets to have as well as the always bundle of charm Jake Lacy. The screenplay is really amazing and Todd Haynes' direction is strong too. A beautiful score, lushes art direction and production design, gorgeous costumes, lovely hair and make up, and nice cinematography plus a tremendous ensemble, all the boxes are check marked in terms of how wonderful this movie is. I think the only thing holding me back from going over the moon for it is that I felt the movie should have ended earlier than it did. I didn't think the last 15 or so minutes were very needed as Mara and Blanchett must part ways while the custody battle of Chandler and Blanchett's child finishes up and having them reconnect. I think the movie really could have finished off with the final dinner scene that is bookended as the opening scene as well but take some of the final moments and tack them onto that scene I'm talking about. I don't know it just seemed like after a while I said to myself \"I got it\" and wanted to leave it at that. But it's a near perfect movie that has to be the best romance movie of the year (if you don't count Me and Earl and the Dying Girl and The Diary of a Teenage Girl romances) and one that I'll be rooting for all awards season as most of my favorite movies of the year are either being ignored or only picking up stuff is specific categories. Definitely seek this one out if it isn't near you, it's worth the trip",

She is also known for such works at \"The Talented Mr Ripley\". Cate Blanchett stars as Carol Aird and Rooney Mara as Therese Belivet. Kyle Chandler is Carol's soon to be ex-husband Harge. Sarah Paulson rounds out the cast as Carol's BFF Abby. Everything about this movie is gorgeous The score is compelling. The cinematography is stunning. We see many shots of the characters through windows, windshields, etc. The colors are crisp. The color palette is all pinks and greens. The sets and costuming are beautiful. Everything is quite proper (as it was during that time). Everything except for Carol who can't bear to spend the rest of her life pretending to be a dutiful wife. We see the budding relationship between the two woman as Carol visits a toy store in New York and (accidentally on purpose) leaves her gloves. Therese of course goes out of her way to return them. Carol takes Therese to lunch as a way to thank her... and they fall in love at first sight. Carol is divorcing her husband. He knows she favors the ladies and is going to make her pay by keeping their daughter from her. Carol decides to leave town for a while and asks Therese to join her. And just like that, Therese quits her job and travels cross country with a woman she barely knows. Much is said without words. There are long yearning stares. I won't give away the rest of the story since you really need to see it. Suffice to say, when Carol returns home she tries to lead a \"normal\" life in order to see Rindy. Will she conform or face the consequences?Finally a movie (spoiler alert) that doesnt involve lesbians dying, being carted off to an insane asylum, or being \"cured\". Hallelujah! Phyllis Nagy does an excellent job with the screenplay. She apparently wrote the first draft some 20 years ago. Todd Haynes as the director handles everything to perfection. \"Carol\" deserves all the awards this year.",

For Haynes this is not a virgin territory.

In the film Carol love is forbidden, because is between two women who cannot find themselves around the arms of another man.

The film explore unhappiness in the most happy time of all Christmas, men Misogyny's and also lack of women empower in a time where america was interested in keeping their women's in the kitchen.This film is stunning when it comes to cinematography art direction and costume design.

The director, Todd Haynes, is too much in love with the 1950s period; too fixated on creating pretty pictorial compositions; too fond of lingering shots of Rooney Mara gazing doe-eyed at Cate Blanchett. The result is self-indulgent and soporific. It is not helped by Rooney Mara's slow-motion delivery of her lines. Even the sex scenes are decorative and insipid.",

The cinematography is simply stunning and Cate Blanchett embodies her character with complete beauty and suave, always literally picture perfect in the film itself and the photographs Therese takes of her. While the characters were at least somewhat intriguing, the connection between the two, beyond the possibly of merely a brief affair, was elusive. For a long term relationship, we're left with an incomplete sense of why these two are drawn to each other. Is Carol drawn to Therese for her beauty and youth? Is Therese drawn to Carol because of her lifestyle and glamor? There's never any depth to the conversation and their characters, while intriguing, could be said to be rather stereotyped.I would like to give this film 3 3/4 stars but since there is no 3 3/4 option, it's been raised to 4 for the consistent visual quality in which every moment could be a photograph.",

    "review": "  ***warning, this is more of an interpretation of the movie that should be read only after viewing***I rather liked this movie. More specifically, I was really impressed by Cate Blanchet's portrayal of the title character Carol. But, after reading reviews from critics and users, I'm realizing that I had a completely different interpretation of the story than most. On the surface, Carol can be viewed as a love story. And, that seems to be the overwhelming consensus for interpreting the film. Many have gone as far as to call it the most romantic film of the year. And, there's nothing wrong with viewing the film through this lens. From my point of view, though, if that's all this film was about, there are a lot of qualities about the title character that the viewer is being asked to ignore.I think the viewer is meant to be conflicted about Blanchet's character. I'd like to pose the question: What if Carol is the villain? By the end of the film, I was convinced she was and that's why I found Blanchet's performance so impressive. If you saw the film and disagree, that's okay. But, stay with me for a moment... 1. Carol seduces a girl half her ageI felt Carol and Therese's first meeting was very telling. Therese is presented as a young, pretty, impressionable shop girl while Carol appears as a mature, confident, wealthy woman who gets what she wants. Right from the start, I got the impression that Carol had targeted Therese and was laying on the charm. She was there to buy her young daughter a doll, but ended up buying a train set as a way of gaining favor with Therese. Later, we even see Carol playing with the train set alone, but never actually gifting it to her daughter. And, at the conclusion of that first meeting, it appears that Carol intentionally leaves her gloves behind as a way of creating an opportunity for a future meeting with Therese. We could interpret these events as an innocent first meeting between two potential lovers, but it's also possible that Carol identified a target that she lusted for and set a trap for what would eventually be another sexual conquest. Perhaps the best evidence for this interpretation is a conversation Carol has with Abby. Abby warns Carol to be careful because Therese is 'very young.' Then, Abby reveals that she is pursuing a redhead. The way the two talk, it's pretty clear that the red head is viewed as a sexual conquest and it has the feel of being a common occurrence, maybe even a competition. It's possible that there truly is a \"pattern of behavior\" on Carol's part. 2. Carol had an affair that broke up her marriageWhile it's true that Carol endured many social hardships being a lesbian in the 1950s, the fact remains that she chose to cheat on her husband instead of breaking up with him before pursuing another relationship. I don't think this is the strongest piece of evidence in the film because Carol is attempting to play within the social norms of the time. But, if we look at things from Harge's point of view for a moment, we can empathize with the idea that he's trying to fight for the woman that he loves. And, he wasn't the one that was being unfaithful in the marriage. He just wasn't coping very well with his wife's infidelities. 3. Carol takes advantage of Abby's love for herWe learn that Carol and Abby had an affair, but then, as Abby puts it, \"things changed.\" One interpretation of this is that they grew apart but remained friends. But, another possibility is that Carol used Abby to act out her sexual frustrations and then dumped her. While they appear to be friendly with one another, Abby is still in love and Carol has moved on. The worst part is that Carol appears to be taking advantage of Abby's lingering feelings for her. After Carol finds out about the private investigator filming her sexual encounter with Therese, she disappears on a morning plane and enlists Abby to drive her new lover back home. Carol knows Abby will do anything for her. Poor Therese is left with only a note that explains that she can never see Carol again. Is that how Carol treats people she loves? 4. Carol gives up on her daughter so that she can avoid a messy court caseThroughout the film, we see interactions between Carol and her daughter that basically amount to her daughter begging for more time and attention and Carol giving her reasons why she can't. The biggest evidence of this comes when Therese asks about Carol's daughter during their final conversation. Carol told Harge during their settlement meeting that she wanted regular visits. However, when responding to Therese's question Carol almost dismissively admits to only having seen her \"once or twice.\" Clearly, Carol's focus in that moment is on winning back Therese and part of creating such an opportunity for herself was giving up her daughter. Lastly, I'd like to tie my deeper interpretation of Blanchet's character together with the prevailing view of the film as a love story. The film is framed by two similar scenes involving each of the main characters riding in a car. At the start of the film, Therese is riding in a car looking out the window and sees a women that looks to her like Carol. At the end of the film, Carol is riding in a car and sees a girl that looks to her like Therese. Whether or not they actually saw each other doesn't matter. It represents the state of mind a person is in when they are in love. You try to go about your day, but where ever you look, you are reminded of your love. In the beginning, Therese is the one \"more in love.\" For Carol, maybe it all started as just a sexual conquest, but by the end, she is the one seeing Therese in the crowd wherever she looks.The last scene of the film represents the two women coming together, finally in love with each other at the same time. Still, if you weren't conflicted about Blanchet's character on first viewing, I don't blame you. Maybe you were just as charmed by Carol's beauty and poise as Therese was.",

    "review": "  Todd Haynes understands the 50's. As a child of the movies I loved those epic romances with the swelling music, beautiful camera work, stunning fashions, and actresses that were often the object of adolescent crushes. Who can ever forget movies like On the Terrace with Newman and Woodward, or a Liz Taylor, Monty Cliff film, or?. The list goes on and on. The problem with those films is gay men were portrayed as extremely effeminate while lesbians were portrayed as manly, frequently homely, always wearing tweed. Members of the LGBT community were never the leading characters in a film unless they were completely mentally unstable or killers. So it was an utter pleasure to watch two very feminine, beautiful women fall in love on screen. Carol captures the essence of romantic love between two people and in this case the two people happen to be women. Haynes directing does credit to the Patricia Highsmith classic 1953 novel The Price of Salt, a book she wrote under a pseudo name, and in time became a best seller. The fifties culture was not kind to girls that developed crushes on other girls. Watching The Rooney Mora character, Therese, a burgeoning photographer and store clerk try to fit in to the world around her is as painful to watch as is the joy of watching her connect with Cate Blanchett?s Carol, the upper class soon to be ex-wife and ex-procession of Harge played by Kyle Chandler. As in all movies of the fifties we are rooting for our two heroines to come out on top only to feel the pain of the compromise that must be made in order for them to be whole. Carol, a breakthrough movie, is beautifully acted, directed and produced.",

    "review": "  Indie. Art house film. Limited release. Select cities. Select theaters. (Needle in a haystack). Those first five phrases are associated with movies that many people won't get a chance to see in American movie theaters. That last phrase (in parentheses) is my translation. While movies that hit theaters in ways that can best be described in restrictive terms don't have the mass appeal of films that immediately (or quickly) appear in wide release, there are still plenty of people who are anxious to see those limited releases. For a Movie Fan who doesn't live in or near Los Angeles or New York City, it can be frustrating to wait for (and sometimes never get) an opportunity to see a highly anticipated film on the big screen.Take \"Carol\" (R, 1:58) for example. That film opened in limited release on November 20, 2015 - in four theaters - in L.A. and New York. A week later, it expanded to a few other markets, but was still in less than two dozen theaters nationwide. On December 25, \"Carol\" was showing in the Top 50 U.S. markets (in about 150 theaters) and continued to expand into January, but still topping out at fewer than 1,000 screens across the country. Such is the case with many films which dare to tackle extraordinary topics and use story-telling and cinematic techniques that differ from your average Hollywood blockbuster. Nothing against the average Hollywood blockbuster, but sometimes films that start in limited release are equally eagerly anticipated by certain open-minded Movie Fans and are often equally worth the wait. After 11 years in development (acutally, nearly two decades, if you count from the first draft of the proposed script), \"Carol\" finally brings Patricia Highsmith's semi-autobiographical 1952 novel \"The Price of Salt\" to the big screen. The book, from the author of \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\", was adapted by Highsmith's friend Phyliss Nagy. In spite of the long wait that many Highsmith fans have endured (and the fact that this film was only released a year after its completion in order for it to debut on the festival circuit), its timing is impeccable. At the end of a year in which the U.S. Supreme Court made marriage equality the law of the land and which saw the release of such timely films as \"Freeheld\", \"Do I Sound Gay?\", \"The D Train\", \"Grandma\", \"Stonewall\" and \"The Danish Girl\", \"Carol\" represents a wonderful and creative final act to a big year for the LGBT community and those who care about equal rights for all. \"Carol\" is a love story set in the early 1950s. Oscar winner Cate Blanchett stars as the title character, a wealthy woman living outside New York with her husband, Harge (Kyle Chandler), and their young daughter, Rindy (twins KK and Sadie Heim). When she is in the city to buy a Christmas gift for Rindy, Carol meets Therese (Rooney Mara), a young woman working the counter for the holidays (even though what she really wants to do is become a photographer). Therese has a boyfriend named Richard (Jake Lacy) who loves and wants to marry her, but Therese is hesitating. When Therese finds a pair of gloves that Carol left behind at the store, Therese gets Carol's address off of the sales receipt and mails them to her. (No, this wasn't Radio Shack. It's the 50s, when many stores recorded their customers' addresses.)Carol calls the store and offers to thank Therese for her kindness by taking her to dinner. Although there is a significant age difference between the women (not to mention a big difference in social standing), there is an undeniable attraction between them. They are both very slow to act on their feelings for each other, preferring instead to simply spend time together, first at Carol's house for the holidays, then at Therese's apartment looking at her photography, and later, on a spontaneous cross-country road trip.But nothing will come easily for Carol and Therese. Carol's marriage has been poisoned by her secret attraction to other women, which included a youthful tryst with Carol's childhood friend, Abby (Sarah Paulson), with whom Carol remains friends. Those old wounds are reopened for Harge when Therese shows up in his home. Carol and Harge were already in the process of divorcing, but Therese's presence in Carol's life greatly complicates that situation. Their love is developing at a time and place when same-sex romantic relationships were widely considered immoral - including within the nation's court system. \"Carol\" is a beautiful motion picture in every sense of the word. For Movie Fans ready to accept it, the love story between the two main characters is tender and heartfelt. Although the film clearly shows the difficulties inherent in a lesbian love affair in the early 50s, the social and legal ramifications never take over the story, which remains focused on the relationship between these two women. Their romance plays out as influenced more by who they are as people and what is happening in their lives than by external factors. It makes for a very effective film.Enhancing the sense of time and place, previous Oscar nominee, director Todd Haynes, ensures impeccable set design and costume work, then has his cinematographer use a technique which makes the film appear somewhat grainy, giving it a definite 1950s' feel. (Some may find this off-putting, but you get used to it and it really adds to the film's effectiveness.) Last but certainly not least, Blanchett and Mara each do some of the best work of their careers. \"Carol\" started out as a \"limited release\" and can be called an \"art house film\", but I just call it great storytelling, and definitely worth waiting for. \"A-\"",

    "review": "  In 2015, I made a concerted effort to see as many Oscar contenders as I could in theaters, so I could be \"in the know\" when the Awards season rolled around, unlike previous years in which I hadn't even heard of many of the nominees. \"Carol,\" the story of a naive young department store clerk (Rooney Mara) who falls in love and eventually has an affair with an older married woman (Cate Blanchett), is the latest film I've seen in pursuit of that effort.Technically speaking, \"Carol\" is a beautiful film. The warm, rich lighting, paired with the choice to shoot on 16mm film, adds a textured, authentic feel to to cinematography that really draws you into the world of 1952 New York. The attention to detail in set design and costuming only add to this feeling of authenticity. Yet for all its technical prowess and masterful cinematography, I still felt that something was missing from Carol. As an Oscar contender, it was certainly proficient, but didn't really bring anything new to the table. It lacked the warmth and heart of \"Brooklyn\" (a similar period romantic drama), or the sheer raw energy of \"Spotlight\" and \"Steve Jobs.\" Mara and Blanchett certainly had chemistry and inhabited their roles fully, yet I never quite felt the excitement and connection that comes with the early days of a relationship, leaving me a tad unsatisfied by their romance in the end. In fact, I was much more invested in the drama outside of their relationship--particulary, in Carol's (Blanchett) custody battle over her daughter with her soon-to-be-ex-husband Harge, played with great nuance and empathy by Kyle Chandler. It was in this subplot where I felt the true conflict and emotion of the film lied, rather than in the understated and sometimes tepid romance between Carol and Terese (Mara).Overall, though it is undeniably a masterfully crafted film, and one that is definitely worth seeing (though not necessarily in theaters), in an Oscar season chock full of bold films that unapologetically push the boundaries of traditional narrative and form, \"Carol\" seems a bit bland and old-hat in comparison.3.5/5",

Simple as it may seem, Carol leaves a huge impact that was carefully formulated primarily by the brilliant minds of Ed Lachman, Phyllis Nagy, Carter Burwell, Sandy Powell and of course, Todd Haynes. Lachman, as the cinematographer, guides you in every detail that you need to see. Every glance, every smile, and every gesture were highlighted in a way that makes the camera an observer's eye. That is one of the main goals of this film - to observe, secretly but closely. To observe how love blossomed between the two women while circumstances prevented them from doing so. Lachman further outdoes himself by successfully showing us the 1950's. The people and environment surrounding the two main characters were captured very well, giving us a taste of what it felt like during that particular time.Carol's screenplay was written twenty years ago and there were about two failed attempts of making the film. Phyllis Nagy got cold feet and once decided to not push through with the film anymore. Huge thanks to the people who convinced her to give it a shot again, because otherwise, we would not have witnessed the magnificent adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's The Price of Salt. Nagy's screenplay was faithful to the book and was able to make us feel what Highsmith would really have wanted us to feel. The main thing that made the story richer was adding Carol Aird's point of view. In the novel, everything that happened was shown through Therese's eyes. In the film, Carol was given her own voice thus letting the audience clearly see the differences of their perspectives and the similarity of the weight of their sacrifices. Nagy chose to end Carol similarly to how it ended in the book and that was one of the most heart gripping moments in the film. To say that almost all scenes were heart gripping is not an exaggeration. With Carter Burwell's soundtrack, the film transports you into a place and time which lets you feel the gravity and reality of the situation you are seeing. The effect is not forced, but gradual, leading you on, and satisfying you afterwards. As one critic mentioned, Burwell's soundtrack transformed Carol and Therese's flirtations into sex. Nothing can beat that. Another magic that was put into the film was Sandy Powell's costume design. Carol was breathtaking in every scene, even the ones when she was swearing and crying. The obvious difference between Carol and Therese's way of carrying themselves shows how they came from two worlds apart. They were not the only ones who were shining in their costumes, but also Abby and Harge, Carol's best friend and ex-girlfriend, and her husband, and basically everyone you can see in every frame. Leading this brilliant ensemble is Todd Haynes who once again proved that he is one of the industry's greatest directors. Haynes crafted his masterpiece in a very subtle manner, slowly creating a huge impact that would leave you silently taken by the film for hours, days or even weeks after you've watched it. It's haunting because it was shown in a way that made it so real, which is how it should be. Haynes' direction of Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara was beyond beautiful. Blanchett was consistently magnetic. She could make you fall in love with a stare. Mara's portrayal of Therese effectively showed the character's innocence and her journey towards self-discovery. Haynes' depiction of the two women's love scene was one of the best parts. It was very evident that the director wants the audience to witness something that is full of respect, pure admiration, and love. Haynes obviously wins in this part.Last but definitely not the least, the glorious cast ensemble deserves great recognition. The chemistry between Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara was so natural that it would make you wish you can know for sure that Carol and Therese definitely ended up together. It seems like you grow closer to them as the film progresses. Another thing is the fact that they looked so timeless. They can be imagined in another era together and they would still look as perfect as they are in the 1950's. Sarah Paulson and Cate Blanchett's chemistry was also remarkable. They are the kind of former lovers that you would still want to see as good friends because of the obvious fact that one cannot survive without the other. It was lovely to watch them talk about their personal lives and lovers, without awkwardness or bitterness, but just pure love and acceptance. Carol is a legacy. And the film being a masterpiece is not the only reason behind that. Its underlying message that lets the audience think about the situation sixty three years ago, when there were a lot of women who were like Carol and Therese, loving each other in spite of what the whole world thought of them. Without these women, their voices and struggles, we won't have any amount of freedom and acceptance today. They made sure that our generation would have the liberty to love and for that, they would always be dearly remembered. For a film to achieve greatness in form and in content, Carol absolutely wins.",

    "review": "  Extremely powerful film stars Cate Blanchett as an elegant, wealthy married woman ( soon to divorce) with a very young daughter, and Rooney Mara as a young department store clerk discovering her latent sexuality. What happens between them will simultaneously break your heart, uplift your spirits, and drive home with brutal clarity how utterly difficult it was to be homosexual in early fifties America. There is only one sex scene and it is very beautifully made. There is a scene that repeats itself for extra gravitas but the best scene may be when Carol ( Cate Blanchett) lays it all out, baring her soul to her estranged husband who was about to take strict, sole custody of her daughter ( no visitation rights). If Cate Blanchett goes on to win best actress it will be because of that scene.",

    "review": "  In Todd Haynes' lavish 1950s period piece, Rooney Mara plays a young woman who falls for a married woman played by Cate Blanchett whose marriage is falling apart. Their romance becomes a secret and the two must hide their relationship in a time when it was still taboo. Cate Blanchett is her usual radiant self, but it is Mara who has the more complex role. She is a straight woman who has a boyfriend and good life, but can't understand why she has an attraction to the much older Carol. Not actually Brokeback Mountain when it comes to pushing the envelope, CAROL succeeds in the two leads and great direction from Haynes who really gets the time period. In addition, Kyle Chandler should also get recognition as Carol's husband who knows about Carol's past but still loves her. Grade: A-",

    "review": "  Carol is a story of two people, they happen to be women but they could be anybody, who find each other and find a connection and love. It's the circumstances and timing that makes the conflicts more than anything, the external forces around Carol (Cate Blanchett) and Therese (Rooney Mara) that makes it very difficult to be together; it's the early 1950's and even though it's the North-East (seemingly liberal terrain) it's the world of upper-middle class whiteness where things are simple and plain and heterosexual (on the surface). The core of the movie are these two women, and director Todd Haynes has two of the magnificent actors working, man or woman, working today with Blanchett and (a strikingly beautiful/adorable) Mara, and it's a pleasure to see them with full-blown chemistry. The other question is if it's a great film, or at least one of the best of the year? Well, first of all, it is worth seeing, I'll say that for sure. What it accomplishes that surprised me is that it's not a simple Lesbian-message-love-story screed. We've had plenty of those, albeit not one maybe with some more mainstream appeal outside of the art-house world like this may and should. But I think that the interest in the more intellectual sense is that it's simply a movie about a system that keeps (or kept, maybe it still does) women without power. Case in point, Carol and her ex-husband Harge (Kyle Chandler, kind of the same as Dennis Quaid in Far From Heaven in the sense of uptight masculinity), who can't seem to agree on a custody agreement with their young daughter. Carol may lose her daughter forever because... well, she is in love with another woman? She probably would've lost custody if it was just another man. It seems like a suffocating system in this film. And yet what I think works in terms of the content of the story of showing the trouble of this intimacy being possible - and there is intimacy here, but in a grown-up, compelling way - may not work 100% with the style. This is not to say it's not beautifully photographed; this is different work we normally don't get to see in movies with such big names, and Ed Lachmann makes it seem desaturated but pretty, like a color photograph that's faded over time (and on Super 16mm no less, kind of the same but lo-fi reverse of what Tarantino did this year in 70mm). But I felt like Haynes' direction made what was at times fascinating cinematography to also make a distance with the characters. This may be useful to illustrate a point, about this environment. I found ultimately it took away for me what was the potential to connect with the characters. At the point I should've at least had a lump in my throat, let alone tears, when Carol and Therese have their trials and tribulations, I didn't really feel anything - nor with the ending, which I'll get to in a moment. This may be a fault on my part, and if you feel something deep and powerful here, that's more than fine, I may just be missing something. But I think it felt a little too deliberate at times, everything looks SO perfect here with the costumes and sets and place and time, and it becomes... staid, a little poised, even with the actors. It may sound like I don't like the movie, but I did, at times very much so. There wasn't any one thing through most of the run time that took me out of the movie. I was with the journey of these women (also an interesting supporting role for Sara Paulsen, who has the kind of character detail I really appreciate to see in a story like this), and their rise and fall in such a short period of time is never less than fascinating, and Blanchett and Mara do very well in their realizations of these people as fully 3-dimensional humans. The only ones who sort of suffer character-wise are the men, even for Kyle Chandler who is giving it his all; they were slightly one-dimensional, basically there to set up bullet points or obstacles for the characters. This may also be something I missed on a first viewing, but I think this may be deliberate too: it's very much a feminist film, and that's a wonderful thing, except that it should be something where all the characters have depth, not just the women. One last point I'd like to make is the ending. It's one of those times I'm uncertain how to feel about it; I won't spoil it, though it's more of an emotional point than anything like plot-wise. But there is a point where it should have ended (you see it near the beginning actually) and it would have added a level of mature-tragic dimension, not unlike the ending of Manhattan or something (seeing how one character grows apart from the other, but in a way that makes sense). It's ultimately a kind of happy ending, and yet I'm unsure that was the note to end on - this is 50's melodrama, and for 90% of the time it's successful by updating itself. Let me put it this way: it's a waste of Carrie Brownstein.",

Rooney Mara is also unconvincing as Blanchett's love interest, sadly displaying the range she showed in Prometheus, although her's is far from the only underdeveloped character. Blanchett's estranged husband Kyle Chandler's behaviour makes little sense, and considering the nods the film makes towards the paradox between society's need for public faces and what really want on in private, the length of time the romantic leads take to consummate their relationship is odd. Todd Haynes' film is unquestionably well meaning and is a feast for the senses, and there are certainly both likeable and funny moments. A lesbian romance shot through a very Hollywood lens though was always going to struggle to convince.",

    "review": "  Carol is a remarkably well-done period piece done in such a way that you begin to forget it was filmed in the modern day. In medias ray, the story begins at the end or nearly end of a loving, confusing and bittersweet relationship. Carol, a rich nearing-middle-age lesbian who recently divorced her husband, falls for a shy, young shop girl with a Czech name, Therese. Sounds like a story book romance nearly, if this wasn't a time of harsh repression and when it wasn't \"natural\", so to speak, for such an event to take place. Harge, Carol's ex-husband, is demanding sole custody of their daughter on the grounds of her perceived promiscuous relationship with their daughter's godmother. What ensues is a tale of longing, the forbidden and how relationships can be controlled. Cate Blanchett is stunning as Carol, hitting all the points right on the head as always, bringing a certain grace and class to Carol's playful side, while also fully embodying her motherly and caring side. Rooney Mara as Therese is just as brilliant, coming as a shy bookworm being awakened from her tired existence by a fun loving individual who loves her, and thus must navigate her way through something she never thought was possible.",

    "review": "  A film about two women falling in love could not have had less realistic content about lesbianism. There is minimal affection between the two characters--out of context Carol and Therese could have been two female friends. There is no development in their relationship and the rising action that supposedly suggested they were falling for each other lacked actual emotional and physical contact. All of the characters were rudimentary at best. In fact, Mara's character relied heavily on the trope of a wide-eyed introverted young girl. The lack of depth in the character development seemed to be substituted for a pseudo-indie aesthetic with pano shots of landscapes and sad piano music. The plot itself was disjointed and in some places not explained. I was very disappointed after seeing the TomatoMeter rating.",

    "review": "  Cate Blanchett is pretty much brilliant in every way. She can pull off any character, in any year, for any film. Rooney Mara is nearing that territory as well. Even in a pretty crappy film, Pan, from earlier this year, Mara is still captivating through a rough script. They are simply two of the best actresses working today, and probably locks to get nominated for Oscars this year as well. Carol isn't anywhere near the best film of the year, but it may have two of the best performances.Blanchett plays Carol, a married mother of a little girl who's in the midst of a divorce and custody issues with her daughter, all because she lives in a time period where having an unwarranted relationship with another person of the same sex is viewed as unnatural. She meets Therese, a department store clerk, and the two engage in a relationship which starts out innocent and turns into something romantic. What I really liked about this film was that everything feels very organic and natural. Nothing with their relationship or even the two woman's other relationships with men feel forced. Carol and her husband go through very real arguments, especially for that time period, and Therese is clearly going through an identity crisis, so the film flows very well as they go through their ups and downsIt's a slow watch and the script is good but it also doesn't contain that one particular scene that Oscar voters usually cling towards. But the performances really drive the script towards possible awards level status. The score done by Carter Burwell helped set the mood of every scene and the cinematography by Edward Lachmann is also absolutely gorgeous and does a great job at setting the 1950's New York scene extremely well. The decision to use Super 16mm film was also a nice touch to give it more of a classy and natural vibe.Aside from its slow pace, there's really nothing wrong with Carol. You go to see these two wonderful actresses perform and they delivered in every way. I don't know if they or the film will win come Oscar season, but both deserve a look.+Undeniable chemistry between leads+Natural relationship+Score+Cinematography-Slow moving7.8/10",

    "review": "  \"Carol\" is the sort of romance movie that aches, where yearning is sweeping and a kiss on the cheek lingers like an open wound. Its central love is forbidden, fleeting, and therefore sacred - even the pangs of melancholy seem to be part of what makes it so beautiful, so emotionally stunning. Like \"The Bridges of Madison Counties\" and \"Blue Is The Warmest Colors\" before it, a sense of impending doom romanticizes the qualms of a bittersweet ending waiting in the wings. Its passion glows, but is also hesitant and uneasy - cultural reality is an unwelcome guiding light. The film is an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's (\"Strangers on a Train,\" \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\") seminal novel \"The Price of Salt,\" whose direct inside look at a societally tabooed affair was unlike any work released at the time. It focuses on a romance between two women, Carol Aird and Therese Belivet, played here by an amazing Cate Blanchett and an understated Rooney Mara, respectively. Carol is a high society woman who seems to have it all; Therese is a young, aspiring photographer struggling with her vocational satisfaction and her sexuality. They cross paths during the height of holiday shopping season. Therese, a shopgirl at a busy retail chain, helps Carol with a purchase for her daughter, though the clinical process feels more like flirtation in disguise - dangerous is the atmosphere around them. So when Carol accidentally leaves her gloves at the counter, it gives Therese a reason to continue their attraction, which picks up quickly and sturdily.  Currently, Carol is going through a nasty divorce, her husband (Kyle Chandler) doing everything he can to achieve sole custody of their daughter, using her homosexuality, which has been known to him for years, as a basis for supposed moral corruption. Therese is dating a man (Jake Lacy) with a steady job and marital desire, but lack of physical magnetism leaves her feeling uncomfortable with prospects of a future with him. So an affair acts as an escape, an escape that leads much further than both would ever expect and that allows both to discover what they crave in life, both emotionally and erotically. \"Carol\" is directed by Todd Haynes, whose work ranges from the claustrophobic \"Safe\" (1995) to the eccentric \"I'm Not There\" (2007). \"Carol\" comes closest to his 2002 masterpiece \"Far From Heaven,\" a rich Douglas Sirk homage where seeing cinema as an art form never stops being a focal point in our tenable enjoyment. This is one of Haynes's best films, by far his most intensely romantic and certainly among his most downplayed. Its content suggests melodrama but sidesteps hefty heavy-handedness with luminous fortitude - \"Carol\" gets under our skin and doesn't much care to leave. Most of this staggering fervor is also in response to its leading ladies, who give Oscar caliber performances. Blanchett, binding her status as one of film's most accomplished actresses, overwhelms as the film's titular character. A woman used to being the most sophisticated and eloquent in the room, we find ourselves unhealthily fascinated as her usually glamorous fa�ade extricates in the face of a shaky personal life. Mara's balancing of idolization and palpable love placed on Blanchett hits hard - her fragile facsimile and unsettled sense-of-self make her a China Doll of romance. Unlike Carol, who is familiar with the sought after sensation of love, she isn't much in touch with the notion, making their inevitable separation hurt us more simply because Mara persuades us that Therese might never recover from the heartbreak that becomes her. The ambiguity of the ending, which suggests that Carol and Therese do eventually reconcile and continue on a more lively path of romance, is perfect for a film that bears the feeling of an impending tragedy at every moment. (Unfamiliar with the source material, I was convinced that death would somehow integrate itself as a major part of the story's structuring.) \"Carol\" is so subtle, so chilly, and so romantic, that gratification does not come instantly; it takes its time overcoming our minds and our hearts. When it does, though, our balance becomes unstable and we suddenly are surmounted. Here is one of the finest movies of the year.",

In a way it suffers because it calls to mind Brokeback Mountain, and it is not as great or powerful as Brokeback Mountain. That said, Rooney Mara does some stuff in this movie that... Is there any actress around who is so unlikeable but so clearly great? Mara is cold and distant and looks anorexic, but somehow she is becoming the best young actor around. Just when you think she is posing and removed and inhuman, she does something that blows your mind. The scene towards the end of the movie when she and Blanchett are sitting across from each other and Blanchett is saying she misses Mara, and Mara does this thing where she stares at Blanchett while lifting her head and it seems like she's about to explode. We've all seen someone in that state in real life. So full of love, fear, anger, confusion, yearning, and desire that it looks like they might vomit all over the place. I got vertigo watching her lift her head like that. It was 3D acting. Transmission of trippiness.It's a good movie.",

In many ways, this film echoes many of the \"forbidden relationship in an intolerant time\" movies from years ago with a more upbeat conclusion. It's also reminiscent of director Todd Haynes' earlier far superior work, \"Far From Heaven,\" but he offers precious little that's especially new here. The stylish period production values, while visually opulent, ultimately aren't enough to carry a story based on an inherently thin, predictable narrative.",

It's well directed with terrific writing, beautiful cinematography, nice music and such powerful Oscar worthy performances from Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. The two play extremely well off each other and have a plus chemistry despite the big age difference. The film is also well set in the 1950's and believe it or not is not as intense as some of these other types of films like ''Far From Heaven'' or ''Brokeback Mountain''. This film is a Masterpiece and believe it or not nobody dies or kills themselves and the ending is very nice leaving you hanging but makes you wonder what will happen. This is a huge award contender and I'm predicting a lot of Oscar nominations! This is a must see film. My grade=99%(A+)!",

    "review": "  One of the things this film does so well is that it deliberately takes a lot of time to develop the relationship between the two main characters. Some people might find that excruciating, but it works perfectly for this film and I loved seeing the progression of two women slowly falling in love in a time period, in which people were not too fond of the concept of homosexuality. But this is not a typical, melodramatic lesbian love story in the 1950s. Yes, the forbidden love is one of the main themes, but there is also a hint of mystery, a sense of playfulness (Phyllis Nagy's beautiful script deftly handles the drama and humor), and there is also a bit of road movie element. But it is also about family, motherhood, and sexual rebellion. It is not only visually breathtaking, but also fantastically rich in detail (the gorgeous 16mm cinematography, ravishing costumes, and stunning production design, it is a work of art. And the score. Oh, the score... it's simply terrific.) The year's one of the best films, masterfully brought together by the one and only Todd Haynes, features some of the best acting I've seen all year. Cate Blanchett brilliantly captures the elegance and sadness of a married socialite with everything to lose, and Rooney Mara is near-flawless. Those who prefer entertainment over art would most likely hate this masterpiece with burning passion. Subtlety is the key, and the actors deliver oppressed emotions through the face and eyes. Carol is a great film. I loved it.",

    "review": "  Good Evening Ladies and Gentleman I am movie critic Joe Durante here to inform all of you what is happening at the movies this week. This week, Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Sarah Paulson, and Kyle Chandler star in Director Todd Haynes latest \"Masterpiece\" which the critics are calling \"One of the Year's Very Best Films.\" This film is called Carol. The main question is, is it one of the year's very best films? Is it the film that could end up taking home the gold at the Academy Awards? Lets get to my review.Carol is a story set in the 1950's about a young woman named Therese Belivet, played by Rooney Mara, who happens to be a department clerk who dreams of a better life and is also in a relationship that she is unsure that she could be committed too. One day during the holidays, she meet the affluent Carol Aird played terrifically by Cate Blanchette and I feel like every time I see Ms. Blanchette in a film, I always need to have a cocktail in my hand. After the two meet at the store after Carol forgets her gloves, the two meet up for lunch one afternoon and one thing leads to another, the two girls seem to fall for each other and in the meantime, Carol is in the middle of getting divorced and her future ex-husband seeks to take custody of their children which she does not want.This film reminded me of Brokeback Mountain with all women and however I was not a big fan of this film, I thought both Blanchette and Mara give Oscar Worthy performances. Yes this is once of the most beautiful looking films of the year due to the terrific cinematography but I felt that this film had some cheesy elements and I thought the main problem with this film is that it ran kind of slow for me and I think that this film is one of the most OVERRATED films of the year. I give Carol ?????? and I'm Joe Durante",

For a rather slow paced movie of almost two hours runtime, the lovers did not manage to develope any chemistry or deep connection (at least to me as a viewer) aside from longingly staring at each other. Their fascination for each other is obvious and portrayed well, but \"love\" on a deeper level is not credible and developed enough.

The little gesturesand nuances in this movie, and specifically their mutual courting,that leads down somewhat risky life paths (in terms of career/work forone and family - marriage/child) for the other). Add in the seemingly10-15 years difference in age makes the story line a more complicated.Unlike Brooklyn whom you were definitely rooting for the inevitableoutcome, I think different members of this films audience could berooting for a several different characters and/or outcomes.This is a pretty focused and gently intense film...could have a toughword of mouth pass along.

Set around Christmas in the 50s, it feels like a Christmas card come to life. The sets and costumes are quite lovely. Carter Burwell's score is wonderful, but the film's best quality, well, qualities, are Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara.Cate Blanchett plays the titular Carol, and as she does so frequently, Blanchett knocks it out of the park and into the next state. Her performance is very complex. At first, the film makes you feel like she's a spider about to trap Rooney Mara's fly in a dangerous web, but nothing could be further from the truth. She's warm, caring, and her screen presence is just magnificent. Blanchett's Carol is one of the best performances she's ever given.Rooney Mara is much quieter, though equally as good as Blanchett. The two form an interesting yin and yang. Blanchett being confident and outgoing and Mara being shy and reserved. It's a good performance from Mara that compliments Blanchett perfectly. Though it should be noted Mara's our main character. The film starts and ends with her.If the film has any flaws, it's that it suffers from \"Return of the King Syndrome\" and feels like it ends about half a dozen different times. The last 15 minutes feel very dragged out. Lucky we have two captivating actresses giving amazing performances to make us forget that.",

The film is set in the 1950s, an extremely difficult time to not only be homosexual, but also have children. Cate Blanchett's character is in the middle of a divorce and fighting for custody of her daughter while she tries to stay true to her sexuality. What is particularly appealing about the choice of a storyline is that it is plausible story and stays true to the time period. Sometimes screenplays for gay films can fall into the cliche trap focusing on the societal battle, but this film does not feel forced.Todd Haynes does an excellent job of directing this film, which is evident in the choice of shots, music and color. What I particularly like about this film is that it is hard to distinguish who is the real protagonist. Blanchett and Rooney Mara both play characters with huge character arcs that are not predictable. This film will definitely be on critics' top ten lists and look for it come Oscar talk.",

Highsmith has a way with vivid detail that allows her to plunder the depths of human despair and depravity and make it accessible to those of us not inclined to unleash our inner psychopath. �Given his own creative output, it makes sense that Alfred Hitchcock�would have been attracted to Highsmith's writing, but�though his�screen version of�\"Strangers on a Train\"�is wickedly entertaining�and a worthy homage to the novel, it cannot approach the source text's sharp insights into�the evil motivations that lurk within all of us. Highsmith truly was one of a kind, and a masterful writer of the macabre.But not only of the macabre. In 1952, Highsmith�published \"The Price of Salt,\"�about a lesbian love affair between a young shop clerk (and aspiring artist) and a married sophisticate. Highsmith, herself, was gay, but not�eager to announce this fact, given the times, and so the book came out under a pseudonym, Claire Morgan. Sadly, I�have not (yet) read the work, but imagine that it contains the same vibrant characters as her other books, with an equally powerful understanding of human desires (but�without the violence). It certainly has given�filmmaker Todd Haynes (\"Far from Heaven,\" where he similarly explored 1950s sexual mores) an apparently rich blueprint for his latest film, adapted from the novel by screenwriter Phyllis Nagy (\"Mrs. Harris\"). Starring two fine actresses at the top of their game - Cate Blanchett (\"Blue Jasmine\") and Rooney Mara (\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\") -�\"Carol\" is a brilliant meditation on passion and its repression, and the consequences of both. It's also a beautiful love story. Transgressive�in the 1950s, the tale�it tells is especially timely today, given the recent Supreme Court decision on legalizing gay marriage. Opening nationally on Christmas, it's the perfect carol for the season of peace and joy.When we first we meet Carol (Blanchett) and Therese (Mara), they are sitting in a hotel bar, deep in conversation. A male friend�of Therese's comes up, thinking nothing of interrupting them, and whatever spell they were seemingly under is immediately broken. Carol excuses herself, and Therese leaves with the man. As the taxi drives through the streets of New York, we catch flashes of the past - and Carol's and Therese's first meeting - as the camera holds on the latter's melancholy face. And then, just like that, with no announcement, we ease into that past. This is a film for adults, where nothing is spelled out, and we just have to keep up.�And so the story really begins. Carol is married - soon to be divorced, however - to Haige (Kyle Chandler, \"The Spectacular Now\"), a paragon of masculine virtues. They have a young daughter. Carol, it turns out, can never be made happy by a man, and has a previous history with at least one other female lover, \"Aunt\" Abby (Sarah Paulson,�\"12 Years a Slave\"). One day, she walks into a department store where young Therese is working, and the two women immediately connect, though Therese, completely inexperienced, is unsure of what that spark means. She has a beau (Jake Lacy,�\"Obvious Child\"), but avoids physical contact with him as much as possible. Every moment she spends with Carol awakens something new in her, and when�the older woman leaves her gloves in the store, this allows Therese the chance she needs to further their acquaintance.�As the film progresses, we watch the slow dance of seduction between the two, the one (Carol's) knowing, the other (Therese's) innocent ... but maybe not so much. Mara gives Therese pursed lips and clenched shoulders, until the moment when Carol's attentions finally allow her to be herself. In their first lunch date together, Haynes chooses to compose the over-the-shoulder conversation shots with the women at the extreme edges of the frame, showing not only how marginalized lesbians are in this world, but women, as well. As Carol and Therese each fight for control of their destiny, they more and more claim that center part of the frame. Blanchett is a commanding presence, as always, an actress capable of projecting simultaneous warmth and frigidity (though the latter is here a measure of the repression of that natural warmth). Mara is easily her match, and at the end of the film, after they have battled society's (and men's) expectations, they can finally exchange perfectly balanced gazes, equals in tragedy and love. With beautiful cinematography and top-notch period production design to complement the glorious acting and moving story, \"Carol\" is a marvel, and I highly recommend.",

    "review": "  First things first. Cate Blanchett is the kind of name that makes you think she must be really famous and really good. Actually she is neither. So if you \"recognize\" the name, kinda' and think she's a \"big star\" - you are wrong. She hasn't really done much that is memorable or meaningful and she is dull as dishwater. Having said this, the title of this movie tells you everything. It's about Carol. But there's almost no dialog, certainly no action, no drama . . . it's a moving about nothing (but not in a good way, like Seinfeld). It's HEAVILY stylized, noir, period-piece. Very heavy handed in the acting and cinematography. But no character development and no story. Nothing happens at all and what little does happen is pointless and random. PS The 30 second sex scene with the girls shows the co-star laying on her back, so you don't see her titties, just her nipples and you get a long side shot of the stars tits. Not worth the price of admission, as I had hoped. Kinda' a cross between Kramer vs. Kramer and Sorority Hazing Party 3.",

The normal tropes pop up including the husband putting up obstacles as things progress and Cate and Rooney embarking on a semi Thelma and Louise roadtrip to help grow the relationship. The big thing here about the film is strictly the decent period dress but most notably the performances of Cate and Rooney who hit the tones, style and emotions perfectly. Outside of that hits all the presitige marks for a film that comes out at this time of year and I am sure it will get some recognition from the various award bodies.",

    "review": "  A gorgeously photographed and evocative mood piece, CAROL - on the surface - appears to be something of an acquired taste. It's easy to see why critics would love it: its impeccably crafted, and boasts a pair of superb performances. For me, however, even with those performances, the movie kept me at an emotional arm's length; I'm able to appreciate it very much on an aesthetic level, but it doesn't connect much beyond that. Tonally, the movie's a bit interesting, as - for some of its runtime - it feels as if it wants to play as a mystery a bit, with the suggestion of the illicit, of the criminal, running through the background, which makes it hard to get a handle on just what we're watching. Is this merely a story of two women falling in love, or is there something else at play, and if not, then why does it feel like there is? Cate Blanchett - one of the most reliable actresses working today - is as good as she's ever been here, contributing some powerfully emotional moments, but while Blanchett's Carol is the title character, the movie is equally about Rooney Mara's character, and Mara delivers what might be the performance of her career so far; hers is some lovely work hiding a sense of longing that is handled with great nuance. Additionally, Carter Burwell's score underlines the movie's more enigmatic qualities in ways both subtly beautiful and haunting, and the rendering of the early 1950s period is great, somehow being both lush and austere. Ultimately, it's an esoteric and unusual film, one certainly worth seeing, but it's unclear (to me) exactly how much \"there\" is there after a first viewing.",

    "review": "  I was expecting so much from this movie (for real). So much I end up loving it. It's a great film no doubt, sometimes slow (maybe that is Todd Haynes style), but just that: great.I must admit this movies are not often out on the market. This are the type of films that go to festivals (I believe this one went to a few). If you see it on cinema are for limited time (and that's how I got my chance!).Let's start with the story/script: there are a few things happening here. For a start, we get to know \"Carol\" (Cate Blanchett) and her story. We know she has already a family (husband and daughter). Carol adores her child, and often goes to this store...here we get to know Therese (Rooney Mara). She wants to be a photographer (or thinks she wants too). Also loves to touch piano and hang out with friends (male ones). The thing get's complicated between this 2 main stories when both female roles fell in love behind the back of those they \"love the most\". That's the moment the movie starts to feel alive and you want to see how this relationships can get affected or get better. One of the cast members I didn't know for sure was going to be good or bad (and I just think was a surprise how his role turn out to be *sorry, cannot spoil a thing about it*) it's Cory Michael Smith's character. I was the whole movie asking myself why his role was not out the 1st hour but then I saw the why and loved it. That was in fact the most amazing part of the film.Sarah Paulson (love all of her roles in American Horror Story) was superb here too! Even if it was a small screen time (like Cory's) you could tell that was also a very important character too! (love the fact that all roles here have a meaning for Carol's life & Therese somehow).The music score was lovely and charming. Very much like what the film felt for me. A very nice touch indeed.Anyway, enjoy my short review and hope it get's to some Fine Arts around the world or more (and not for limited time). - December 2015 review.",

    "review": "  One of the best and most emotional 2015 films I have watched so far. The contrast between the depressing mood of the film and its (surprisingly enough) overall uplifting tone is really interesting. The acting is simply top-notch with Cate Blanchett delivering maybe her best performance in the career so far, way more humanistic and charming than her dominant role in \"Blue Jasmine\", whereas Rooney Mara proving again that the discontinuation of the \"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" trilogy (in which she played the lead) is indeed a big mistake. It is really surprise to me that the best romances I have watched these recent years are all about lesbian love, lesbian feelings - with \"Blue Is the Warmest Colour\" and \"Carol\" - their depiction of love, one deeply raw, innocent, and touching (\"Blue\"), one very light (as in \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\"), full of struggles, and heart-warming. But both are even superior than that, both are \"coming-of-age\" stories about how people choose their lives and fight for that choice, about how love and happiness, as well as hear-broken moments and sadness, can form our characteristics, can make us stronger. This is the kind of film, and the kind of performances, that should win the Oscars.",

    "review": "  Therese Belivet: \"I don't know what I want. How could I know what I want if I say yes to everything?\".Carol is set in 1950s New York, a department-store clerk dreams of a better life for himself and finds himself falling for an older, married woman.Before Carol was even release, it had a lot of Oscar talk with the two main leads and the story itself. It's one of those period piece movies that people start talking about how many awards it's going to win (It's mostly Gold Derby predictions) and not actually talking about the movie itself, only the awards and it's quite sad when I think about it. But all that a side, I've been anticipating Carol for awhile now, just because of the two main stars and the beautiful teaser trailer that got me interested in seeing it. And after seeing Carol I am lost with words right now, I mean wow. It's without a doubt the best movie of the year.Cate Blanchett continues to amaze me and I don't think it's going to stop anytime soon. Shes tremendous in everything movie I've seen her in and in Carol she amazed me even more. Blanchett was absolutely phenomenal in this movie as she delivered such a powerful performance. It's by far her best performance and movie (In my personal opinion). I basically ran out of things to say about her, since I always say the same good things about her performance. I think sometimes things are too brilliant to be put into words and it's best to be watched.Rooney Mara has come along way, because if you look at her track record of all the movies shes been in. She can star in a bad movie like the 2010 remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street and then later appear in The Social Network. Same thing can be said this year as she was in \"Pan\" which was a massive piece of crap and she was so bad in that movie, but not here, because Mara gives a stunning and brilliant performance. Mara and Blanchett both deliver a stellar performance and both of them had great chemistry, I mean it was really touching and quite beautiful to watch.With a movie like this you would think the romance between the two would be overly sloppy or repetitive like some romantic movies, but not this one. There's only a few scenes in this movie where one of them say \"I love you\" but that's it and it's never repeated. The thing I love about this movie is that the romance didn't feel force or cliche. The one thing I can't stand in romance movies is where the two lovers talk about how much they love each other and why they love each other, I mean screenwriting like that is just the worse, but Carol avoids all that and goes for a creative way of showing the romance that's best to be seen and felt. There's a scene in this movie that's personally my favorite scene of this year so far, and that's when the two of them are in the car going through a highway tunnel. Then we get to see Rooney Mara character (Therese) point of view as she looks at Carol and you as an audience member get to see what makes Carol so special in Therese's eyes. The scene itself has no dialogue, it was beautifully shot and it's short but wonderful. It may not mean a lot to some people but to me it dose and I wish we had more film making like this, because it's an original and brilliant way of showing human connection, I mean it's much better than the character's repeatedly saying \"I love you\" to each other.Todd Haynes did an excellent job directing this movie. Everything that a good director should do in movies is what Todd Haynes dose here. He's the glue to all of this and he brilliantly crafted such a powerful film.The cinematography in the movie was magnificent as it had the perfect shots that fitted the story really well. The art direction, the costumes, and the writing were flawless.Now for the flaws: My only flaw in this movie has to be that some of the supporting characters were pretty forgettable and could have easily be cut out of the movie.Overall Carol is a beautifully crafted movie that tells an emotional story that's so nailed down to reality. It's a movie worth seeing if you haven't checked it out yet.",

Well, let's just get through this review step-by-step.The acting is the best part of Carol. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara both give Oscar-worthy performances. Mara is very calm and subdued, unlike many characters she has played in the past. This really shows her wide range as an actress. She's also a very likeable character. Cate Blanchett gives yet another emotionally driven performances as the mysterious Carol. This might be one of my favourite performances of hers.The directing and cinematography of Carol is incredible. There were many beautiful shots and it created a very interesting tone. I also ADORED the musical score by Carter Burwell. Definitely one of the best of the year.My main issues with Carol lied in the storytelling. I just wasn't invested in any of the characters or situations. There's barely any plot. I understand that the film relied on other ways to tell the story, but it just didn't work for me. I was waiting for something interesting to happen throughout the entire film, and it just never got very interesting. The pace is also painfully slow. It wasn't very boring, but the pace was just too slow for me to enjoy myself.Carol's writing isn't as good as I hoped for either. Some lines were very effective and beautifully written, but others seemed misplaced and just bizarre. I was also rarely invested in the conversations between characters.Overall, Carol is very difficult film to form an opinion on. It has many admirable things about it such as the musical score, gorgeous direction and superb acting, but I found myself struggling to be invested in the plot or characters. It's worth seeing if you're curious.RATING: 6.75/10",

There was NO character development, the script was utterly vacant and woeful. Oh my God the entire movie was like watching paint dry. What Cate Blanchett saw in this script is utterly beyond me. I was with a friend who wanted to see 'what would happen; (nothing as it turns out), otherwise I'd have walked out of the first movie I've perhaps walked out ever. Utter rubbish. And I LOVE Cate Blanchett and Kyle Chandler and was looking forward to a sensitive portrayal of love in same sex couples. I'm retching. It was dreadful. And if it wins any awards - I'm giving up on Hollywood.",

    "review": "  Carol is a divine, misty and seductive film that captures the essence of infatuation beautifully. Todd Haynes has crafted a film that oozes class where everything from the framing to the production design to the score evokes a palpable romantic atmosphere not only for the period but for the story and characters themselves. Cate Blanchett is flawless and the chemistry between her and Rooney Mara is remarkable and a joy to see grow and evolve through the films steadily paced runtime. While sometimes a touch too melodramatic, Carol truly is a rare treat and a seasonal film to boot! Sooo go see it... QUICK!",

Honestly, the performances here are fine, and it's visually gorgeous, but the soundtrack is overpowering and there's so much time between actual character interactions that it was hard to regain focus when something actually happened. There are so many significant gazes here that at some point it started to seem pretentious. I also figured out one plot point pretty soon after one character was introduced. Again, I did like all the actors here and thought they were very good, especially Rooney and Blanchett, and when they actually interact the movie works, but there's just so much empty space and music telling me to feel that I was bored though most of it and can't give it the full recommendation.",

    "review": "  While many would just slap the 'period lesbian drama' label on this film, it is much more than that. A beautifully touching story of the pains of falling in love when there are so many obstacles in your way. A theme that is pretty universal. For Carol (a radiant Blanchett whose cheekbones were MADE the the 50s look) and Therese (Rooney Mara proving she is more than just 'not-Noomi-Rapace') those barriers are not just the fact they are both women. Indeed, there is no gay panic scene at all! It is the gulf in their wealth and status - society lady and shop girl; the age gap; Carol's ties to her daughter versus Therese's lack of any apparent family.Director Todd Haynes steals Brief Encounter's structure, with an opening scene where a stranger stumbles upon two people in the middle of a goodbye, a scene that only has meaning once we flashback to see how the two women got there. The first encounter has Therese instantly smitten with the stylish and alluring Carol, and pretty much unable to say no to anything she asks - lunch, a visit to her home, presents and road trip etc. However, her puppy dog eagerness for Carol's affection could have made for an uncomfortable inequality in the power of the relationship. That the romance is convincing and not just a cougar taking the innocence of a sweet young thing and sending her crying back to the world of men is a blessed relief! The wonderfully subversive tone continues in the unexpected way Carol is allowed to be a woman first and a mother second. So often on film, women give up their own happiness for the sake of their child. Here there is a much more thoughtful and realistic ending that isn't based on what society expects. Even the stereotypical boorish husband (Kyle Chandler) really isn't a bad guy. He knows about his wife's preferences but is in denial and doesn't understand why she can't love him.The film is pretty languorous and deliberate - possibly too slow for some - but I absolutely loved this film. Beautifully made with fantastic costumes and production design. Perfect acting from Mara and especially Blanchett. Sarah Paulson is also great in a supporting role as Carol's friend and ex-lover. Nice to see a film like this was a relatively positive ending. SPOILER ALERT - no no dies!!",

    "review": "  I'm really enamored by Carol, the first film I've ever seen from top-notch Director Todd Haynes. There's simplicity to it. A boldness and a bravado that comes to any project that's so... fully what it is. This is an exceptionally well crafted film, and so much so that I don't think you'll see another one like it for a while, at least not in this genre. (Which for me is a love story). And this is a FULLY. BLOWN. LOVE STORY. I mean besides our two beautiful starlettes, there's only but a few other characters we come to feel for. So it's a pretty fascinating and big deal for me, that the story is so entrancing. The performances are at center stage here, and these two women deliver. Cate Blanchett, who I've never actually seen in a full-length feature before- is just SO, so much as the character in this. I was completely pulled in by her, and her performance alone is just about half the reason you might believe that it's the 1950's- THAT and a spectacular set and costume designer combing through every single detail. Rooney Mara as you may not have seen her, a complete Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, she's a very curious (pardon the expression) and rosy nosed creature, and to watch her as she's slowly swept away by events, you can't help but feel everything she's feeling and to go along with her. Todd Haynes must be a wonderful guy, because he captures Mara at some of her most vulnerable and heartbreaking moments as perfectly and as picturesquely can be. The aesthetic, and the cinematography, it's just gorgeous. And there's a poetic nature to the camera work that adds layers upon layers to the story telling. The performances, as I mentioned before are... unique, and subtle, and NOTHING is there to jump out at you. You absolutely HAVE to lean forward, you HAVE to put two and two together, and try and work out what the characters are feeling. If it takes an audience member a while to get invested, uhh, it's only because y'know, it's not even trying to convince you of anything. It's simply setting the stage and watching, very closely, how two people fall in love. 6 stars. <3",

But it's not the romantic or sentimental side of Sirk that we get with Haynes -- Carol is a tough version of the story of doomed love, in the case, between an older experienced married woman who also loves women, and a younger naive shopgirl who falls for her. Haynes and his DP use the iconic faces of these two beauties in extreme closeup, allowing us to seemingly enter into each woman's inner life. And, of course, we have the now patented Haynes \"look,\" which in this case is literally and figuratively a million-bucks look from 50's New York City and environs, rivaling the look of The Godfather. The pricey suburban mansion where Carol lives with her angry husband and angelic child is American baronial. Her clothes are meticulous, restrained, and seductive. Mara is doing a bit of channeling of her own, namely Audrey Hepburn, whom she resembles here quite remarkably. Altogether a moving and exquisitely rendered slice of the untold history of ordinary people.",

    "review": "  Some things are a given when you see a Todd 'Far From Heaven' Haynes film: lush cinematography; gorgeous production and costume designs; and a haunting soundtrack for example, not to mention a very distinguished style of directing as if we've never left the golden age of 50s Hollywood moviemaking. A Very Lesbian Christmas or Carol is a simple, elegantly scripted story and even stretched out over 2 hours, it never drags. Much of that is down to the cast's brilliant performances. Cate Blanchett's icy beauty is used to great effect in her portrayal of a strong confident woman born before her times. Initially coming across as slightly creepy and almost predatory, her confidence or the pretence of that confidence comes crashing down only (and only briefly) in the final scene at the lawyers' office when she finds herself painted into a corner. Blanchett's performance was perfectly nuanced, making you understand and feel her character's every internal conflict and desires. However, I feel this is more Rooney Mara's film as her character has the more interesting dramatic arc, and matching Blanchett scene for scene, Mara's Therese blossoms on screen both sexually and intellectually. So was it the hype that has inflated expectations or is it something else that makes the film less than amazing? I remembered fondly the unexpected joys and richness of Far From Heaven moved me more and I was more impressed with the complexity in Blanchett's character in Blue Jasmine. Maybe the point is that at this stage of their careers, both Blanchett and Haynes has acquired so much acclaim and accolades, it is harder for them to surprise us anymore. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film but I didn't love it, even though I was mesmerized for over 2hours. I just wish...",

    "review": "  I'm just going to say it: this is one of the greatest love films of all time.Set in early '50s New York, Carol tells the story of Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), a shopgirl in the toy section of a Manhatten department store with dreams of being a photographer, falling in love with an older woman, Carol (Cate Blanchett), who is going through a difficult divorce. Unassuming as the plot may seem, director Todd Haynes exploits every frame to render a complete sensual embodiment of love. Carol is the height of fetishism. Beauty is idolised, lingered upon with every shot. The mannerisms of each character and the senses they explore: the caress of Carol's hand, the way Therese writes Carol's name and takes obsessive photos of Carol, even the way Therese smells Carol's clothes... the list goes on.  Unfortunately, there's an element of sadness. Remember the context - this is '50s America - where society despised homosexuality. When the two protagonists decide to drive around America, they are free from society and thus experience their passion in its truest form. They are removed from society. It's quite the metaphor, and a deeply sad one. Regardless, the audience can do nothing but witness a rich love between two women; and that's the thing, the relationship between Carol and Therese is there from the start. There's the sexual climax mid-film but the fact remains that their relationship never blossoms - it was always there, from the first instance Therese spies Carol in the department store. Very few films convey such a fetishized spectacle of love as Todd Haynes's Carol. The nod toward Brief Encounter at the start - introducing our main protagonists through a minor-character - may lack originality but thereafter any traces of tradition are left firmly behind. If anything, the allusion to David Lean's classic grounds the basic principles of the movie. You get the sense Haynes merely wanted to say \"This is a love film like any other, don't fucking judge.\" [citation needed] Cinema needs a bit of a wakeup call to the growing realisation that, yeah, gay people are normal too.  Why? Because Carol, shockingly, is a love story between two women *gasp* good grief! LGBTs have been explored, and honoured, briefly in Hollywood (Brokeback Mountain, Dallas Buyers Club, The Kids Are Alright... notice the 21st century theme going on?) but little can be said for explicitly lesbian love stories. Carol may be breaking boundaries, but let's remember that the female leads, Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, are both heterosexual. Whilst they both give outstanding performances (Oscar winning performances, I'll add) it must be said there is a complete lack of disregard for homosexual actresses who could quite easily have made the grade. At least Carol is a step forward; and Haynes is, without question, in unstoppable form. Bring on the Awards season.This is queer cinema at its finest.(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)For more film and music gossip, follow @TheHECReview on TwitterOr follow my blogs at the Huffington Post or The HEC Review",

    "review": "  Carol, writes Patricia Highsmith, \"would be in a thousand cities, a thousand houses, in foreign lands where they would go together, in heaven and in hell.\" Carol, the latest film by Todd Haynes is starting to cause a rousing stir in cinemas around the world. Breath after breath, she will find home in many cities, countries and eventually our homes. She's a ripple whose reach grows stronger with each pulse. An embrace between lovers, reunited?-?ever tighter. A spark set to a fire cracker. A slow burn. She invites us?-?cineastes, casual movie goers, humans from all walks of life?-?to see her, to feel her, to be absorbed, enveloped and be reminded of how movies used to move us, shake us in our cores and make our hearts flutter. In a World where we find ourselves more connected to one another than ever before, and yet even further removed from each other, we can still experience and share the gift of Carol.Today we are flooded with content, especially an endless stream of movies. We consume films differently than we used to. A trip to the cinema is a rare occurrence. However, we still remember films from another time. We may or may not have seen them, but we would at least know what they are. At least someone would have told us at one point or another that it is a masterpiece. It becomes one when the talent, the means and the circumstances involved in the production all fall into place. There are no shortcomings. The acting, the writing, the directing, the production values, music...everything works in concert to achieve a perfect balance. It's a rarity to see this achieved today. We can easily pick up on the shortcomings of most movies. The storytelling can be lazy. An over-reliance on CGI attempts to cover plot holes. The acting is wooden...But Carol makes me want to revisit her as soon as the credits have rolled, and I am about to see her for the fifth time.It was 1952 when Highsmith, the remarkable mastermind behind the novel Strangers on a Train (and later Two Faces of January, The Talented Mr Ripley and many others) finally found a publisher for The Price of Salt?-?her latest work. As The Price of Salt did not fit the crime genre, Highsmith had to resort to publishing it under a nom de plume?-?Claire Morgan. The plot was inspired by a real-life encounter with a beautiful older woman, at a department store, where she worked during the Christmas holidays. Having fallen ill after the incident, she wrote the novel rather quickly, as if in a fever dream. The narrator and heroine is Therese, a young woman who meets the older Carol, under nearly-identical circumstances. The reader is drawn into Therese's mind as she falls in love with Carol. A series of events follow. The two women meet up for lunch, connect and embark upon a road trip together. It is as much a story about Therese finding her way in life. There are differences?-?in age, class, and experience -but there is also their inability to describe something that has no reference point; at a time when love between two women is considered criminal.Phyllis Nagy?-?playwright, screenwriter and close friend of Highsmith's, was gifted with a copy of the book by the author herself, finally re-published under her own name and re-titled Carol, 5 years before her death. Nagy did not read the novel until after Highsmith's death, but when she did, it was a revelation; and so Nagy took up the challenge of adapting it into a film. After over a decade of development hell, the puzzle pieces finally fell into place and the film began shooting in Cincinnati in the Spring of 2014.Todd Haynes is one of the most intriguing directors working today. His output includes the unique biopics Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story and I'm Not There as well as compelling stories about women?-?unsung heroines dealing with social mores and hardship in films like Safe, Far from Heaven (both starring Julianne Moore) and HBO's Mildred Pierce (starring Kate Winslet). After a long career break, Haynes' schedule opened up and he fell hard for Phyllis Nagy's screenplay and Highsmith's novel. The screenplay does not compromise. It does not titillate. Instead, true to Highsmith's novel, Nagy captures the complex nature of falling in love, deeply; and a mind which, akin to a criminal's, is completely obsessed with the other person. While lifting some dialogue off Highsmith's writing, the script is refreshingly spare. Words are carefully weighed. They linger in the air, between the two women amidst the smoke from their cigarettes. A Love that dare not speak Its same. Silences...sighs...glances...pauses yield so much more meaning than any words. And when words are finally spoken, they hit you in your core...When Haynes joined the project, Cate Blanchett was already attached to star as the eponymous Carol . Blanchett is a true chameleon, infinitely watchable in film as well as on stage. She is the epitome of a classic movie star, on par with the greats like Bette Davis, Lauren Bacall or Ingrid Bergman. In Carol, she unearths yet another layer to her talent and range. Acutely aware of the camera's gaze, Blanchett embodies an image of a woman of impeccable beauty, style and poise. She easily sweeps Therese (Rooney Mara) off her feet, when she wanders into a store to purchase a gift for her daughter. But this is just a facade. Underneath is a woman who is slowly unraveling as she is about to exit a marriage which has run its course. But Carol has a daughter?-?Rindy?-?whose future will be deeply affected. Similarly, her sublime mink coat is just a front. On the film set, it was falling apart and had to be re-stitched together, take after take, by the costume designer Sandy Powell. The production made the most out of every cent of the film's budget. As Nagy's script takes us out of the confines of Therese's head space, and does not even consider the use of pretentious voice-over altogether, Blanchett beautifully evokes the emerging cracks in Carol's veneer.We initially find Therese leading a perfectly ordinary life: working at a department store, with a handsome boyfriend by her side, and a hobby?-?street photography?-?a subtle change from in the novel, where she pursued stage design. But she is unfulfilled. Her boyfriend is pressuring her into taking a romantic trip and clearly wants to marry her. Unsure of what to make of her private life, or career, Therese is ambushed by intense feelings she develops towards Carol. As the two women are drawn to each other, everything else in Therese's life falls by the wayside. Rooney Mara, who previously mesmerized audiences in David Fincher's take on The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, is exquisite in her best role to date. She subtly internalizes Therese's thoughts and emotions, speaking volumes by hardly saying anything at all. Both Carol and Therese seek to articulate the feelings that transpire between them. In 1952 there is no example to look up to, but neither woman feels fear or guilt and it is not the heroines but others who find their sexuality to be an issue.It is not just Blanchett and Mara who are luminous, sumptuously playing off each other like partners engaged in committing the perfect crime. The supporting players are excellent. Kyle Chandler welcomes sympathy as Carol's husband Harge who, despite and air of selfishness and concern for his own reputation, tries his utmost to keep his family unit together. Sarah Paulson is unforgettable as Abby, Carol's childhood friend and ex, who chooses to remain in Carol's orbit, to be there as her best friend, at all times, be they joyful or devastating. The rest of the cast, appearing in minor roles or as extras, many from Cincinnati, shed artifice and appear as real people, blending perfectly into the world of the film. Judy Becker's production design supplies post-war austerity, livid colors and authentic detail while Sandy Powell's costumes feel unique, stunning but also timely and lived-in.Shot on Super 16mm and lensed by Ed Lachman, Carol pays homage to great photography of the 50s. Shots through windows, condensation, reflection, light- and shadow-play evoke the work of Saul Leiter. Photographers like Ruth Orkin, Vivian Maier and Helen Levitt, among others, were also major influences. Lachman and Haynes also referenced Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura, L'Eclisse and La Notte for their use of abstract and spatial relationships to enter their characters' minds. George Stevens' A Place in the Sun and David Lean's A Brief Encounter informed the point of view of the most vulnerable lover. Even Carol's editor Affonso Gon�alves shows restraint, lingering on silences, stoking our desire to witness a declaration of love between the heroines, just as Carter Burwell's sublime score swirls around them. It is as if Carol is a revelatory time capsule, drawing us deeper into her mystery and secrets, where a simple act of love comes at a staggering cost.Abandon everything. Right now. See if Carol is playing anywhere near you. See her by yourself, with friends, your family or someone special. Go, watch one of the most beautiful and arresting love stories ever committed to film.You have nearly arrived.",

There is a denouement part way through the film that you think might send the film spiraling into a very dark place - that never transpires, so we are left with a very lovely film - it just could have done with a bit more umpf ... however, you can not deny what an impact Film4 is having on this years film output, with another good co-production.",

That was the case for me with Carol. It is a labour of love, an exercise in perfection on every level. Cate Blanchett (surely she has to be in the reckoning for an Oscar for this), as the woman who knows what she wants but is reluctant to risk everything to get it, and Rooney Mara, as the hesitant rookie to lesbian love, are perfectly cast, complimenting each other throughout. Beautifully scripted, scored, filmed and directed, this film leaves no stone unturned as it trickles through its journey. For those uncomfortable with the premise of lesbian scenes: the film is two hours in length and said scenes - sensitively shot after an agonising wait for ultimate commitment from the two ladies in question - totals no more than three minutes, by which time, we, as the audience, wish them nothing but good will. Ultimately, such is the depth here that a traditional love story may not have resulted in the same impact. This is a total delight!",

With these two films (and his 'Mildred Pierce' miniseries), Todd Haynes has become the master of making the 1950s something other than the idyllic fantasy land of perfect families and white picket fences that we are typically shown in pop culture and the historical record.'Carol' certainly lacks the bigger dramatics seen in the earlier film but it doesn't need them. In many ways it is a film that could function without dialogue. Seeing the way Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara look at each other is enough to know everything you need to know. It really is astounding work from both actresses that is also matched by the stunning costume design, cinematography, and screenplay. A truly wonderful love story.",

    "review": "  FAR FROM HEAVIN' - My Review of CAROL (4 Stars)Somewhat of a sister project to his 2002 film, FAR FROM HEAVEN, Todd Haynes' CAROL, written by Phyllis Nagy, looks at repression in the 1950's through a decidedly queer lens. It's a quiet, deliberately stilted look at the developing love between Carol, a New York suburban divorcee (Cate Blanchett) and Therese (Rooney Mara), a young department store clerk. Still in the throws of a divorce and custody battle with her husband Harge (Kyle Chandler), which has got to be the WASP-iest character name I've heard in ages, Carol meets Therese while Christmas shopping. The film opens, however, later on in the story, when Carol and Therese sit in a fancy restaurant and are interrupted by one of Therese's friends. The remainder of the film flashes back to their meeting and eventually fills us in on the importance of their dinner scene. It's a strange bookend device due to the fact that it's based on an emotional epiphany rather than a plot point. The great mystery of this film is whether or not these characters will ever be truly able to express themselves. Haynes is swimming in very familiar waters again, making another twisted variation of a Douglas Sirk melodrama. Mara is icy, interesting, and otherworldly, giving Therese a wide-eyed vacant stare that deftly hides her true feelings. She's like an eerily quiet Zooey Deschanel. It's a tricky, fill-in-the-blanks role, and Mara, resisting the tough bravado at which she typically excels, stretches herself with this minimalist approach. Chandler gives a galvanizing performance as the jilted, typically patriarchal husband who still manages to sympathetically show the hurt of losing his wife. Jake Lacy plays Mara's boyfriend, and like Chandler, he evokes sympathy due to the fact that society expected alpha male behavior from its men, even if the men weren't fully on board. Sarah Paulson plays Blanchett's ex-girlfriend, and in her very few scenes, she paints a vivid picture of a woman not afraid to be her own person, much like the actress herself. Blanchett, however, has the toughest part, and she's grand and theatrical in a way we haven't seen since the great female stars of the 30s and 40s. The performance factor necessary to conform to 50s society reads loud and clear with every formal gesture and tight smile Blanchett gives. Carol often comes off as a predator in trying to ensnare Therese, lacing her polite conversation with subtle innuendos and not-so-subtle glances. Blanchett and Mara don't so much have chemistry together as they do an odd performance friction and a cohesive dedication to the subject matter. Neither character has the tools for self-expression, and at a time where one could go to jail on morals charges, it's easy to understand why their love story is so clandestine. When Therese requests Carol's address and subsequently mails gloves she left behind, it feels like a suspenseful, sexually charged endeavor. It's a risk that still could lead to jail time, torture and even execution in many parts of the world today. It takes most of the film's running time for these women to even so much as kiss. They circle each other, speak in code, until they finally, FINALLY feel safe. Late in the film, there's a surprising turn of events that drives home the necessity for gay people to be quiet even behind closed doors. CAROL keeps things pretty chaste and at arm's length throughout. It's long been a signature of Haynes' work to play with these formalities and expose what's hidden just under the surface. If you love that style, you'll love it again in CAROL. If not, it's easy to see how some could find this to be a lifeless bore. Quite the opposite, I found the film to be achingly beautiful, sad, and swooningly powerful. The novel was the first of its kind to depict a same sex relationship that didn't end in suicide or some such tragedy. I won't spoil the ending to the film, however, but suffice it to say, Haynes and Nagy seem to delight in bringing all of the subtext usually buried in romantic storylines, and gradually laying it out on the table. This film remains true to its time and is a reminder of how far we've come as an American society, yet how far we need to go as a world community still.Adding greatly to the mood of the film is Edward Lachman's gorgeously windswept, snowy cinematography and Carter Burwell's swirling, quiet yet memorable score. It's highly reminiscent of Philip Glass' work, yet Burwell maintains his own distinct voice. Sandy Powell's costume design adds to the beautiful color palette of this film, giving both Blanchett and Mara vivid, memorable looks. Mara's hat alone feels just right for her curious, observant character. It tells us she's an artist trapped in the social mores of her time. Like its source material, Patricia Highsmith's novel, THE PRICE OF SALT, CAROL is a romance that feels like a mystery thriller. If you don't mind its formal style, stilted chastity and the feeling that Todd Haynes has already made this film before, you're likely to fall for the lushness of the furs, the restaurant smoking, the poached eggs and creamed spinach dishes and the \"love that dare not speak its name\" nature of this little gem.",

This is important as it plays into what Haynes is getting at here; the extremely subtle modes of communication that gay people have had to resort to in order to survive and the constant paranoia they live with as a result of the constant monitoring of society at large. This level of disconnect is exemplified by the repeated use of opaque windows and obtrusive blocking, both unabashedly romantic and brutally realistic and altogether gorgeous to look at. There's so much more going on here (gendered power dynamics, the constant terror of the male presence, age and its inherent dominance, perception versus reality), but at its heart, Carol is a simple love story who's source material was revolutionary upon release due to its refusal to end in tragedy (a sad tendency in LGBT work that persists even today) and who's message rings true all these years later; the payoff is indescribably overwhelming.It's stunning from start to finish, a perfectly paced and impeccably acted piece of filmmaking that proves that profundity can be found in the simple and that honesty can be mined from the melodramatic.",

    "review": "  3 1/2 out of 5 stars. \"Carol\" is a well made, beautiful & stunningly acted film, but its wandering pace for the first hour will make a lot of people regret sitting through it. While the momentum picks up in the 2nd half, director Todd Haynes' love of melodrama will still put off many viewers. As a filmmaker in the Douglas Sirk tradition, he directs actresses to some of their best work. Julianne Moore in \"Far from Heaven,\" Kate Winslet in \"Mildred Pierce\" and now Blanchett, Mara and Sarah Paulson all astound in \"Carol.\" The men in his films are usually less interesting and that's true here as well, although Kyle Chandler is good as Blanchett's husband.Shot in Cincinnati for 1952 New York, the film looks great thanks to top-notch technical work by Haynes' regular camera, costume and production design teams. Cate Blanchett, perhaps the finest actress of her generation, is always fascinating to watch. Rooney Mara, as the shopgirl who begins an affair with wealthy housewife Carol, shows all the incremental emotions of confusion, fear, lust, strength and determination through her eyes and nuanced facial expression, often with little dialogue. The study of lesbian repression 60 years ago is certainly worthy in this new era of gay civil rights and at least it doesn't end with the usual death, murder or suicide as these stories often did. Patricia Highsmith wrote the novel under a pseudonym, which she didn't acknowledge for almost 40 years, even though it sold a million copies.It's really Mara's story since she is the sympathetic one drawn into Carol's web of confused & selfish behavior. She has been winning numerous awards including Cannes Best Actress & may go on to this year's Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her subtly excellent work. All the pretty technical trappings though don't disguise a slender story that is not firming tracking to keep audiences from being kind of bored. If Haynes had spent as much obsession on the script as the costume colors, it might be a better film. His next project will be the Peggy Lee biography with Reese Witherspoon, which sounds like the kind of film he excels at - a period story with a strong central female protagonist and lots of pretty things to look at.",

The obscene sounds of applause from tobacco company boardrooms notwithstanding, the Fifties' ambience is subtlety evoked by superb acting. From the moment department store sales clerk Therese (Rooney Mara) catches sight of Carol (Cate Blanchett) a wealthy divorcee, their fate is sealed.

    "review": "  I loved this film for the subtleties. Lots of lingering, carefully framed shots and closeups. Lots of quiet scenes. Lots conveyed through looks and innuendo.Rooney and Cate captured what it's like to be nervous yet excited while falling in love. It felt real. It felt like two people unsure of themselves, offering up just a bit of their true feelings at a time and waiting for the other person to do the same before revealing more. Kyle Chandler's performance hasn't been commented on as much as the leads, but he was just as excellent. He played the part of tortured husband well without coming off as a mere villain. I sympathized with him and even understood where he was coming from.I thought the film captured the time period in a very unique way. Nothing was overtly flashy or Normal Rockwell 50s, and at times it even felt gritty compared to most depictions of the era, but it was really beautiful.The film stayed with me on the ride home, and I drove in silence while I reflected on it. That's how I judge a movie. If you are the type that loves character driven films, I'd very much recommend it. If you don't handle slow burn movies well, it might not be for you.",

    "review": "  There are people who own the screen. Their face pops up and BAM, you're hooked. Cate Blanchett has an undeniable on-screen presence. Combined with a remarkably restrained performance by Rooney Mara, it turns into cinematic gold.Haynes second loveletter to the fifties feels more genuine than the overly melodramatic 'Far From Heaven' and is beautifully shot and rendered.The lovestory between these two women may not be new or surprising, but it's so elegant, classy and damn believable that I felt myself transported.It's emotional, classic Hollywood and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.",
