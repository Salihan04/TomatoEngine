    "review": "  With the occasional nod to Stanley Kubrick here is bang on social commentary with a surgeon's knife, particularly that bit of social construct that dictates \"proper\" partner choice. Veering from laugh out loud funny to heartbreakingly sad this definite quiet and calm approach echoes veddy English sensibilities and might be difficult for many who appreciate the loud and explosive mainstream American take-it-to-go film aesthetic. Barring that, if taste means as much to one as quantity, this is a rare and unique film experience. Kudos to the superlative cast, writers and director.",

    "review": "  An incredibly dark film and incredibly strange. It's one of those movies you ask yourself, \"what the f**k am I watching?\" I can certainly say it's one of the most original and most offbeat film I've seen in a while. But sometimes this film is a little too dark for my taste as it touches into some grim visuals and characters. Definitely an aquired taste and won't be as accesible to most general audiences.",

    "review": "  I loved the concept and the message of this movie but the execution felt clunky and it loses itself in the second act (but ends strong). Loved the commentary about the arbitrariness of how to be in a relationship vs how to be alone. The idea that not only is your romantic life is meaningless without following the set rules- but the only way to follow those rules is to lie, cheat or literally carve yourself up to fit in. I wish Lanthimos had kept the energy up throughout. The humor drops off fairly dramatically and then never really regains in my opinion. Maybe my opinion on this film will rise over time though.. I really did like the message.",

    "review": "  Yorgos Lanthimos' debut, \"Dogtooth\" was highly praised by both critics and arthouse audiences, it did so well, that is earned an Oscar nomination for \"Best Foreign Film\". Therefore, I decided to see what's the hype all about and I was greatly disappointed. I thought the film had some good ideas here and there, I noticed its director's offbeat sensibilities and his fascination for making the implausible seem real, but the lack of involvement and the misguided aesthetic choices(if I could call them so) made the whole material tedious and silly. Five years later, Lantimos returns to the \"distosyncratic\" grounds of his debut, but this time, he pulls a different approach, a far more effective one. In every aspect. I find \"The Lobster\" to be far superior to its predecessor: unlike \"Dogtooth\", this flick displays great craftsmanship, while, like in \"Dogtooth\", the acting here is rather wooden, mechanical, sometimes deliberately bad, the material is engaging enough for the viewer to see that there's a method behind the \"madness\". In simpler terms, those who are likely to enjoy this kind of flick, will understand that the Orwellian setup demands exactly this type of performances.Again, the fascination for the making the seemingly impossible palpable, is present, but this time Lanthimos' efforts show results, because \"The Lobster\" manages to be tense and convincing enough for the viewer to accept that an ordinary dog is somebody's brother(for example). The use of narration works like a charm again, because it makes the film more believable, it gives the audience the feeling that they are viewing the contents of a novel.\"The Lobster\" is a fairly strong satire against the automatisms and commodities indulged by society, against some deeply rooted, yet silly ideas about \"soul-mates\", the importance of companionship and so forth.There are plenty of funny moments and the overall material is drenched in irony, which makes perfect sense. However, the ending is not exactly the most inspired, but on the other hand, which one would have been, given \"The Lobster\"'s unusual plot? Also, sometimes the \"wooden acting\" goes a bit too far, but it doesn't really matter.Overall, what I admire most at this is the way Yorgos Lanthimos took a highly unusual plot(not only the idea itself, but there are plenty of bizarre moments in the film), a plot that apparently would have demanded and highly surreal approach, and made it work by using a rather traditional one. Because, if you take out the eccentricities, you have a pretty standard narration pattern, the visuals, while great, are quite familiar, and the director doesn't try to confuse the viewers with non-sequiturs. Yet, still, this is not a film made for mainstream audiences, so those unfamiliar with unusual/unconventional plots or movies are best advised to stay away. My two cents: 4/5",

    "review": "  Despite the surrealistic realisation of the story we do not see anything unusual in terms of social patterns. There is one group of people, those inside the hotel seekingly desperately to find a mate in order to avoid being transformed into an animal. And the second group, those that live outside in the woods alone but at the same time among others fighting to keep their individuality. What's happening in reality. In the first group belong those people that thing companionship is the cause of the human. Dualship is what were designed for, finding the other half, the significant other to spent the rest of the life with. Unless you don't do that you are an animal. For animals only mate, stay with the female/male for a while and then move on for the next mate. And that is how the second group is seen in real life. Single people are lonely wolfs, unfit savages who have denied societal norms and move on with their life without the companion of any other. They are the proof that people can survive alone or at least in a broader notion of companionship (friends could be a substitute). Those two groups in the movie (and in reality) act like two separate societies in one world; the one doesn't accept the other, they challenge each other, posing a threat and attacking one another. And in the middle of it a couple that fall in love: not because they had to fall in love with somebody or because they didn't want to be alone but because simply they fell for each other. Love is what brings the complications in a calculated and shaped society.",

    "review": "  The Lobster is the follow-up to Lanthimos' ultra-dark Dogtooth, and sees the Greek filmmaker trying his hand at an English spoken dark comedy. The Lobster is certainly one of the most unique films I've seen, and I thought it was great - albeit very uneven.Set in a dystopian future where single people are taken to a hotel and must find a partner or be transformed into an animal, The Lobster transcends any classification. At times it appears to be an unconventional drama, then a quirky dark comedy, but then it gets REALLY dark. I expected it to be a simple offbeat comedy, and I was very wrong. Lanthimos' twisted sensibilities shine through quite overwhelmingly in certain moments, and just when you think you've figured it out, it subverts your expectations once again - and I think this worked for and against it.I see The Lobster in two very different parts. The first was hilarious. It embodied that extremely dry humour that I love, and was shaping up to be one of my favourite comedies of the year. Colin Farrell was hilarious, and the dialogue and editing perfectly captured that darkly funny, yet awkward spirit. Even in the disturbing moments, I was still on board, as it worked within the movie's twisted charm. But then the second half took an unexpected turn, and the film kinda fell apart. I felt like the film was on a certain path, and then it lost itself and its message got very muddled, sadly throwing off both the pacing and story. The Lobster is a fascinating film with a lot of moments (especially in the first half) but it isn't for everyone. It's depiction of an awkward, sterile world is well crafted and hilarious, with most of its humour stemming from the lack of romance and intimacy in a world obsessed with love and relationships. Its social commentary was timely and refreshing; first poking fun at societal pressure of relationships, and then flipping this by saying that being single isn't necessarily the right thing either - you should do what suits you. With a strong message, unique aesthetic and a playfully twisted and dark spirit, The Lobster is an entertaining experience - I just wish it had sustained its momentum.",

    "review": "  The Lobster is a challenging film to watch. It's part romance, part thriller, and part social commentary, but all in all refreshing to see. The premise is that single adults are taken to a resort where they have 45 days to meet another single, or else, they would be turned into an animal. The story pokes fun at the notion of marriage and looks at how absurd some of the reasons people get married for. They don't leave loners off the list neither. Their characteristics are just as odd. Much of the conversations are uttered in monotone, but by design. The few times true feeling come out, they are really heightened. I am going to think about this film for a long time, and I believe that's how many others will feel about it too.",

Truly Dystopian, more in a Brazil kind of way than Hunger Games. The story's world created more to be poignant than a serious vision of the future. Its a strong cast with the often inconsistent Farrell giving one of his better performances. Everyone else is as solid as you would expect. I guarantee you come will at least come away thinking \"I haven't see a movie quite like that before\".",

This doesn't make it any less impactful, though, the sterile environments and robotic performances working well with the humor in order to communicate the pretty obvious satire of present-day relationships/the dating process/social mores. It explains a little too much, using consistent narration to lay out the subtext in a way that feels unnecessary, and the \"we've got to escape the system, man\" narrative renders it a little simplistic in comparison to Lanthimos' excellent Dogtooth, but it's a fun experience so these shortcomings don't take too much away from the finished work. It's not a masterpiece, nor is it some incredible take-down of societal institutions, but it works as a piece of entertainment and has a lot on its mind in a way that is admirable.",

    "review": "  In what is basically Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) meeting animals and a whacky commentary on postmodern dating culture, writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos' The Lobster stands out like a sore thumb, in the best way possible. Claiming that might be a stretch however, as the film lacks The Grand Budapest Hotel's set pieces and costume design, yet retains the wit, humor and personality one would expect when it comes to - vague or otherwise - avant-garde films such as these.Set in a fictional society that metes out punishment for unmarried individuals, The Lobster is a brilliant genre piece that Lanthimos injects ingenuity into building, both the characters and world. From the moment David registers himself into the hotel after stating his sexual preference, to being briefed on the rules of the hotel by the manager and choosing an animal to be turned into should he fail to find a partner in the hotel barely ten minutes into the film, The Lobster captivates, slowly digging its fingers through the increasingly unsettling series of events and Rachel Weisz's narration as the 'Short Sighted Woman'.Like The Revenant, though not marketed as such, The Lobster was shot in natural light, the benefits of which can be seen in shots throughout sequences in the woods and interior hotel scenes, the natural beauty of which makes up for the film's overall dour color scheme. The dour aesthetics of The Lobster fits Lanthimos' vision for a darkly humorous film, particularly the film's rules that function not only as part of the narrative, but also as a commentary on reality, the meaning of being single, what marriage entails, and the very institutional nature of the latter, each of which - and more - Lanthimos confronts brazenly as a creator of this experimental film, whilst also bringing out the dormant dramatic side of Colin Farrell, an actor with a growing list of terrible roles in equally terrible film.Much of Farrell's awkward comedic delivery in the film could be likened to arguably his last best film, In Bruges (2008), while his nuanced, physical performance is toned down to that of a shrivelled introvert; co-star, and female lead, Weisz shows up relatively late into the film, despite her narration that echoes from the start of The Lobster. And like Weisz, the rest of the cast - John C. Reilly, L�a Seydoux, and Ben Whishaw to name a few - are relatively underplayed, serving as a trampoline for Farrell to bounce his performance off and as a transistor to amplify the film's themes. In a perfect world, The Lobster would've used all of its talents equally to convey the appropriate message due to their myriad of different personalities, but this - naturally and unfortunately - isn't the case.",

The serious, obliviously-ironic performances give it the humanity it needs to transcend being merely a farce. What we have as an end result captures the desperation, emasculation, and utter delusion induced by a relationship-crazed society. And, like Dogtooth, we have a pretty damning critique of any ritualistic society (which, by definition, smothers the \"individual\").",

    "review": "  A nearly perfect film that is now among my most favourite films, ever. The story follows a man who goes to a hotel in which you are given 45 days to find your soulmate, if you do not find your soulmate in the 45 days, you will be transformed into an animal of your choice. You can immediately see why I decided to check this movie out. The story is brilliant, to say the least. It's so strange and unlike anything I've ever seen before. The way its brought on screen is also fantastic! The direction and cinematography are great and I love how at times you hear narration of what is happening. The movie's tone is very difficult to explain as it deals with heavy subjects, but at the same time deals with them in a very funny way. I laughed a lot on this movie, I won't lie, but at the same time I was disturbed by the things I've seen in it, as well. The ending is a bit dissapointing as it's left to the viewer's imagination, which can sometimes be really good, but in this movie's case, it's a bit stupid. Other than that, there really isn't anything I could say was bad about this movie. The acting was amazing! Colin Farrell is great as the main protagonist and I just love how all of the characters are so sincere and awkward to be with. At moments, it feels like some of the characters aren't even human, but are aliens that are trying to act like humans! The soundtrack is awesome and there's this one song that repeats itself throughout the movie and it really adds up to the atmosphere. All in all, a truly different movie with a very unusual and intriguing story, albeit a dissapointing ending, fantastic cast and a unique tone. I highly recommend checking this movie out as it's really something that has to be seen to be experienced, you can't really know how the movie is judging by the trailer.",

This whole project rings true independence and auteur cinema like it is too rarely seen on our screens anymore. The cast is quite good and all the characters manage to be intriguing, mysterious and slightly off, as if their lives were empty of any emotions. The film lost me a few times and i must confess, my well domesticated brain needed to hang on to pull through because i have somehow lost the habit to be surprised, intrigued and lost with films. They have mostly become predictable , but this one is such a unique look at relationships, love, loneliness and the effects of modern society on our relationships, it will inevitably divide the audience. Although the film is a little slow towards the end, i can't deny that all the way through i was fascinated by the technical aspect of the film. shot essentially in natural outdoor lights, with lots of attention put into the framing of the film which is why it looks so engaging , peaceful and beautiful to look at. The music is also a little wonder, bringing a note of sadness or tension, giving to the film it's unique tone of moodiness and suspense. Overall The Lobster is not exactly mainstream material by today's standard but i can't praise enough the work of someone who's willing to say a lot , with very little and still mange to make a huge emotional impact on its audience. Kudos to the everyone involved in this film, cinema still holds wonderful surprises, this film is one brilliant example.",

Comparable in subject to Her by Spike Jonze, it shows us truth about the state and perception of modern relationships to the extreme, while tackling the very much ignored blatant discrimination to singleness. Yorgos Lanthimos asks about boundaries, self, and belongingness in a world were middle ground seems to mature, or maybe, unrealistic.",

The idea that not only is your romantic life is meaningless without following the set rules- but the only way to follow those rules is to lie, cheat or literally carve yourself up to fit in. I wish Lanthimos had kept the energy up throughout. The humor drops off fairly dramatically and then never really regains in my opinion. Maybe my opinion on this film will rise over time though..

It's not because The Lobster is graphic, bleak, and uncomfortable, which it is... It's because it's divisive; you feel like you're supposed to be shocked. Thrust into the story with little explanation (I like that part), the narrative travels from inventive to intolerable very quickly. Director, Yorgos Lanthimos, seems hell-bent on confronting you, than connecting you with his film. Honestly, the ride feels as cheap as a Hollywood Slasher, and as subtle as a Summer Blockbuster, but at least both of those aren't trying to be something clever. A black comedy, even those like this, that attempt to make a commentary on the human condition, need to do so without insulting your intelligence.SPOILER ALER... ahh you're not going to see it: The scene where a woman attempts to commit suicide but doesn't jump from a high enough location, then screams endlessly on the ground as our protagonist tries to continue on a dry conversation - yeah we see what you're trying to achieve there, Lanthimos, it's just it's neither black, funny, or poignant, it's just another scene where you juxtapose graphic experiences with emotionless reactions; believe me, the film is a montage of this.It's a shame, I feel in the right hands that the script and indeed the movie, could have been really creative. It longed to be something akin to 'Her'. If you want a similar experience, see Mood Indigo; it's better all round (and I didn't like it all that much).",

    "review": "  With a talented cast lined up, I didn't know what to expect from The Lobster outside of some talented performances.To say I didn't know what to expect reflects not only what I was thinking before seeing the film, but also throughout the entire feature. For better and for worse, The Lobster is a complicated and extremely unpredictable film, and this is both the beauty of it and its ultimate downfall. It's a difficult thing to explain but that's because the feature as a whole is simply one massively difficult concept to grasp. Set in an odd future, The Lobster sets up a world where people are forced to find a mate or be turned into an animal of their choice. There is also a city of ambiguous meaning and a forest full of those who have escaped the hotel. When all these settings are combined into a singular narrative, viewers are left with an extremely dark comedy film with elements of romance, drama and science fiction. A lot of genre bending goes on in the film, and as a result the narrative at the heart of the material leaves viewers with no way of telling what's going to come next. The mysterious nature of the dystopian society in The Lobster is a fascinating one and its a captivating universe, but the heavy amount of plot dynamics and tonal inconsistencies leave the experience as shaky. There are times in The Lobster where I found myself so confused by what was happening that I didn't know whether to be shocked, surprised or caught in a fit of laughter. Either way, I found myself even confused about how to feel. The Lobster is an overwhelming product of confusion which has a sense of hypnotic beauty to it at the same time, so the viewer is left to determine which of these is the more dominant. And despite the unpredictability of all the material, director Yorgos Lanthimos seems mercilessly bent on pushing through it all at a pace so consistently fast that viewers must work their minds at an extremely fast rate to deconstruct and examine everything that is going on. The Lobster is the kind of film where if you blink, you miss an essential plot point and then suddenly nothing else in the film makes sense. It is an acquired taste of the most complicated sorts, and Yorgos Lanthimos is unapologetic about this.There is no denying that The Lobster is a film deserving of heavy praise for its creative originality, even if it is so original that the minds of many viewers will not be able to comprehend the lack of familiar territory. It provides an entirely new perspective on the concept of love and uses a world where society forces people into it for the sake of existence as a source of social commentary. This seems allegorical to the concept of marriage in contemporary society since it is essentially a way of turning a relationship into a legal matter which complicates things years later when vows are broken. There's probably social commentary in other points of the film which I can't decipher just yet, but either way there are clearly intelligent roots in the material.And as well as boasting a lot of intellectual value, The Lobster boasts a lot of imagery. The scenery for the film sets up a universe which feels empty and isolated, and this feeling leaks over into both the forest and the hotel which dominate the majority of the film. The cinematography that captures all this proves to be very atmospheric as it has smooth movements during sequences of the hotel interior yet it is still and wide during the shots of the forest. Wherever it is there is a lot of beauty to be found in the scenery and both the use of music and the absence of it proves to add to this feeling nicely at times.When it comes to adding the human touch to this wacky feature, the cast of The Lobster have no problem accomplishing effective performances.Colin Farrell is a very accomplished actor who has proven to work in dramatic material of all kinds, yet in The Lobster he strips away everything that seems distinctive about him so that he can maintain the status of an everyman. This causes him to easily blend in and conform with the others around him, and from there he is able to elevate himself with his naturally friendly appeal. In such a violent world, Colin Farrell stands out as the character who reminds us of humanity's existence with his natural talent to channel genuine emotions into any scene that demands heart. Colin Farrell leads The Lobster with a strong balance between a solid understanding of the universe and his character's confusion on how to handle the world, leading the complicated themes of the narrative into a path of humanity.Lea Seydoux is the standout of the cast . Portraying the leader of the hotel escapees, Lea Seydoux takes on her part with a remorselessly blunt nature. Without a flinch in her facial expressions, Lea Seydoux captures the cold edge of a true leader while combining it with an unpredictable killer instinct. Like the rest of the story, there is no predicting what Lea Seydoux will do next as she is very careful with what emotions she channels into her role, allowing herself to oscillate between being bleak and genuinely antagonistic. Lea Seydoux is a powerful addition to The Lobster's ensemble of talent and stands above everybody else without mercy.Rachel Weisz is able to create a likable character also, and John C. Reilly's charms are always an added benefit.So The Lobster has no problem challenging audiences with a heavy collection of convoluted narrative pieces and unpredictable plot twists topped off by a strange blend of dark comedy and thrills, but the creative originality of the universe it depicts coupled with Yorgos Lanthimos' passion to give it neverending fuel crafts a fast-paced and stylish thrill ride with a talented cast to boot.",

    "review": "  Rooted in the familiar elements of modern society, many may stamp The Lobster's world and its characters as a product of Science-Fiction, much like in the vein of Spike Jonze's Her, one where we can lose ourselves in the nature of its characters. However, upon inspection, much of what I have absorbed in Yorgos Lanthimos' artistic stroke is a product of fantasy, a sense of threat in the horizon as unclaimed love in a manner of a miniature time frame, 45 days to be precise, led by a law that places members of single stature in their relationships, whether widowed or unrequited, in admission of a hotel, repressed in their freedom to explore, forced upon a regime that is politically and socially therapeutic, but only towards a certain extent, dooming those seemingly hopeless.The rationale of its newly established future is questionable, raising more curiosity than it resolves, we earn a glimpse of the banal lifestyles and architecture of its contemporary cities, violent criminality buried deeply beneath of the concerns of the law enforcers, instead their agenda primarily seeking those who betray the current policies of romantic status, emphasising the necessity of a significant other as it statistics reveal that it ensures a greater prevention in mortality. The hotel itself, the backdrop of its initial half, recalls the discomforting and un-lively nature of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, found through the narrow hallways and vast common/recreational rooms, uninviting and sterile immediately upon glance, false in its claims as a hotel.Within such a world exists two factions, one of the general consensus, abiding the conditions of the modern political and social structure, the commoners filling the metropolitan landscape, enduring lives that we have come to expect in a modern world, only when befallen with a change in conditions or upon unfortunate luck that they would be forcefully stripped from such a life, hence the existence of a rehabilitating hotel. The second faction exists on the rebellious principles of its governing system, repulsed in its concept of reliance, promoting independence that refuses even genuine romance or companionship, cynical in its agendas and are soldiers of the cause, it hopes to topple the structure and revolutionise the landscape of tomorrow, hoping to reveal upon oppressed eyes of an alternative future; a group constantly hunted by the admitted members of the hotel, to first-handedly learn the valuable lesson of their insignificance and the consequences of their rebellion.The Lobster's protagonist, David (Colin Farrell), finds himself enduring through both sides of the social spectrum, initially an involuntary patient of the hotel upon the wake of his wife's passing, then later a fighter of the rebellion, a victim of oppression within both sides, learning that contentment and fulfilled fates do not reside in the pathways of either road. The world of the primary governed forced upon him trials of romance, pressured upon the narrowing of his window, at a point finding himself in a relationship that forces upon him constant artificiality in his facade, to evoke a matching in their connection that would ultimately save him from animal transformation. When thrusted upon the world of the rebellion, he finds comfort in the provided freedom, a sense of belonging that seems greater earned than what was previously experienced, only to unfortunately find a fitting soulmate upon his troupe, an attraction that is inevitable despite such fixed boundaries, building upon its fundamental attraction that reminds them of their life's value, a desperate need of escape and to hopefully place themselves back into the comforting and nurturing arms of the city.The Lobster speaks profoundly greater in its world and its ethics, rather than the citizens that fulfil it, notably its focused characters, who are portrayed distantly as it dwells on measured emotions, earning comedy through its efficient deadpan execution, but lonely and alienating in its attempt of fulfilment as the romance between David and his newly found partner, labelled as the short sighted woman and also acts as the film's narrator, characters utilised to perfection in shaping the atmosphere and emphasising the themes that its narrative desperately suggests, efficiency reached but attended with a sacrifice, a factor that may alienate those who desires immersion in the arcs and palpable souls of its characters.In speaking of the deadpan humour that The Lobster pushes to its audience, it handles so that is worthy of our laughs, constructed in the awkwardness that exists within the distance of its characters, the heated arguments that arise and explode in spontaneous farce, a claustrophobic and occasionally improvised panic that coheres and refuses repetition. It treads on a pace that burns like a candle, unapologetically deviating from cinematic formula, a film that ends on a note that should display a bang, but instead drifts the camera from visual resolution, leaving audience in an anticipatory state, forced to puzzle themselves the clues, or its lack of.Unique and articulate the film certainly is, but coneys itself in a manner that is far from obviousness, requiring one to lose themselves in the conditions of Lanthimos' storytelling, led upon measured but compelling performances from its cast, notably Farrell as he evokes the lonely capsule that was established in Spike Jonze's Her. Much dissection could be applied to The Lobster, but it can only be attended effectively upon subsequent viewings, as it highlights the detailing that was previously missed, adding texture to a world already meticulous in its presentation.",

    "review": "  If you think you have seen a weird film this year, I am guessing you haven't seen this one yet. In what is effectively an indie art-house piece, you get a completely insane and almost unfathomable world filled with more and more absurdities everywhere you look. However, it's such an incredibly unique and eye-catching film that it's still hugely engrossing and surprisingly entertaining to watch. Director Yorgos Lanthimos' new film on the surface is a dark comedy, full of rich images, and staggering performances from its principal cast. Deeper lays one of the most original and heart wrenching stories on modern relationships, likely the best seen in film since Michel Gondry's \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\". The hilariously smart script by Lanthimos and co- writer Efthymis Filippou, also manages gets some of the year's biggest laughs. If you're still single at the end of the allotted time you are turned into an animal of your choosing. This premise, though outlandish, is in essence an exploration of how in modern society singles are treated with disdain and suspicion, or rather that if you're single at a certain age there is something amiss. As a satire on dating culture, Lanthimos certainly has a lot of fun exploring his theme. The two create a symphony of truth about our society's perception of relationships and love. The best part is the film takes its story as seriously as any drama, and you feel that through the deeply disturbing atmosphere that emerges off the screen. However, as the film is just so weird, it eases you into the oddness of it all very impressively through the use of humor, something that more pretentious art-house films fail to do, and are reluctantly a lot harder to really get into. The story follows David (Colin Farrell) in a distopian future, where single people are turned into an animal of their choice if they fail to find love or a right partner in 45 days. As David has recently split for his wife, he sent to a hotel deep in the forest where the match making & the conversion process takes place. David chooses to be a lobster. As each day counts down, with the buzz of a morning alarm clock signalling breakfast, David gradually makes friends each struggling to cope with the pressures of settling down. David meets women (Ashley Jensen) who would rather kill themselves than transform into an animal. He meets men (Ben Whishaw) who'll smash their heads on a cabinet to ensure they're compatible with others. He meets another man (John C. Reilly) who's punished after proven to be masturbating. It's only absolutes: are you heterosexual or homosexual? Are you comfortably lonesome or do you seek companionship? The only grey area is outside, as the weather is permanently downcast.The beauty of the film is the intriguing questions it asks of us. David is nothing special and simply wonders what to do next. He wants to be content, he just doesn't know how. He'll try dancing. He'll try shooting an anorak-wearing loner. He'll even try uniting with the heartless one, until her lack of heart reveals its ugly side. David is the broken man who struggles to fit in. He's had a gay experience in college but, by the hotels rules, has to define himself as heterosexual. Breaking the film into two distinct halves, his experience in both companion-hotel and outcast-clan (led by L�a Seydoux) is fraught with insecurity and fear. Expectations are false and social-norms, flawed. Lanthimos' patient direction contrasts nature with the harsh urban city and aging hotel decor. Suited and neatly held in tight clothing, with ill-fitting heels (and uncomfortable trousers), David and 'short-sighted woman' (Rachel Weisz), walk on isolated, rural roads. This clash between modernity and our lack of connection with the wild is clear. Tall trees reach to the sky, dominating the frame like bars on a jail cell. Men and women are trapped by assumed rules. In the hotel, performances act out solo and duo scenarios. This appreciation of our dependency on others is laughable. But marriages break down because of a need for independence. Long-term relationships are often forged on lies. People actively choose to deceive themselves. The methods the staff at the hotel use to convince people it's better to be with someone, although shown with deadpan humor, are very disturbing and unexpectedly effective. For instance, when people arrive at the hotel one of their hands is tied up behind their backs to show them that \"everything is easier in pair\". But there's also a way to extend your stay and remain single. The nearby forest is a hiding place for a group of runaways from the hotel who the residents go out to hunt once in a while. For each successful capture they get their stay extended. It's a pretty straightforward representation of society's fight against diversity and those who don't adhere to rules, but Lanthimos doesn't stay there. In the second half of the film, when the focus moves from the hotel to the forest, we get even more rigorous rules and brutal demonstration of intolerance for those who don't follow them. It's one of director's ironical twists, but also a disturbing example of illogical and revengeful human nature. Those who were forced to find a partner formed a community in which it is forbidden to have a partner, or even just flirt. Main character proves to be an constant exception and keeps breaking the rules wherever he is and whatever they are (which brings to question whether there's any possibility for him to have a happy ending), symbolizing in that way a fight for individuality inside an oppressive system. Unfortunately, this comedy rather goes off the rails in a gratuitously over-long final section. In the same way as you never wanted to see tents again in \"Three go mad camping\" (aka \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1\") we spend what seems like forever locked in the woods with the singletons led by L�a Seydoux and David's new love interest the 'Short sighted woman\". With about 118 minutes clocking in, the final act (though very watchable) seemed to have stretched beyond comprehension. While this segment is enlivened by the occasional appearance of 'ex-humans', it is generally dull and dark enough to drive all of the comic momentum out of the film. But alas the film isn't just about its script. It also assembles one of the year's best cast ensembles. Colin Farrell delivers his best performance in the most audacious film role to date. Colin Farrell is extremely restrained and barely shows any emotion for the entire movie, adding more humor to the situations he finds himself in. Rachel Weisz is a sensation, giving her best work since her Oscar-winning role in \"The Constant Gardener.\" As the \"Lisping Man,\" its refreshing to see John C. Reilly dig deep into a role like this, one of which we haven't seen from him in nearly a decade. As the \"Limping Man,\" Ben Whishaw continues to build an arsenal of titanic-like performances, all of which solidifies him as one of the best kept secrets working today. More roles for him please. As the \"Loner Leader,\" L�a Seydoux's villainous demeanor is a fantastical addition, adding a needed depth and danger to the film and role. Olivia Colman's Hotel Manager is a bonus treat, as she effortlessly brings chuckles and fear to her mystery woman. On the whole, 'The Lobster' one of the most hilarious & weirdest presentations of a tender love story in recent years. but I must warn you that if you feel you can't cope with this film for longer than the first twenty minutes, then it's not for you. This is definitely a cult film for the ages, but won't be a big hit with general audiences.",

    "review": "  Yorgos Lanthimos is the most classic representative of the so called \"Greek Weird Wave\" and I'm one of his huge fans. Dogtooth (his most well-known movie) explored the falsies in the modern family and the Lobster focuses on interpersonal, romantic and sexual relationships. Lanthimos' personal style is again easily recognizable and unique (it reminds me a bit a mixture of modern Danish cinema with Austrian and Scandinavian cinema).Nevertheless this movie by no means deserved three awards in Cannes film Festival. The first half of the movie is funny, sarcastic, innovative and bittersweet at the same time, but the second half of the movie is a lot weaker (symbolisms are there but the means to pass them through are less innovative) and should have been quite smaller. The ending is ambiguous and clever and Collin Farrell proves with his unforced performance that he really is a quality actor. Even if you are not a Lanthimos' fan you should check out this film but please do not expect to watch a masterpiece.Grade: B-",

    "review": "  This is a curious, challenging and supremely intelligent masterpiece, both incessantly humorous and genuinely chilling. Whilst others may challenge the sustained clinical tone, I find this movie's studious and almost academic approach to the subject matter to be a commendably shrewd directorial flourish. On the surface (and, perhaps within) this film seems to exist without a shred of empathy or warmth, callous and detached throughout. It all adds up to create this remarkably bizarre yet simultaneously utterly convincing world that these pitiful characters inhabit. One may observe that this film is perhaps one of two halves, with the first being, well not exactly buoyant, but certainly a lot less dark than the second, with its tendencies leaning more towards a mix between Wes Anderson and Charlie Kaufman. (On this note, I must stress that whilst influences may be evident, this is a purely singular piece of work, with Lanthimos' voice seeping through every pore of every single wonderfully depressing frame of this film). Meanwhile, the second half sees the film undertake a subtle tonal shift, telling the story from the side of the 'loners', with the film now flying the flag for coupledom after working so hard to brutally satirise dating and relationships just an hour previously. Oh, and the eye-opening synopsis? Whilst the plot does vaguely follow this line (if you don't couple up within 45 days you're turned into an animal of your choosing), it acts mainly as just one of the many ingenious metaphors used to deliver this point, with the plot instead drifting through a whirlwind of ideas on relationships and societal expectations, with consistently wonderful consequences.Maybe I've not sold it well enough. In fact, it may just be unsellable. After having seen it twice with two separate cinema audiences, I can report only around 20% of them seemed to have 'gotten' it. Indeed, it is a rather discrete film, allowing the audience to unravel its endless delights and unpick the sprawling complexities hidden within. For others, Rachel Weisz' deliberately grating monotone line delivery may prevent them taking anything from it, or perhaps it's just the relentlessly cold and uncaring nature of the film. For me though, this is a richly detailed and fabulously oddball picture, both an insightful comedy and a bleak horror, with a rich tapestry of ideas and an immensely talented ensemble cast to deliver them. I could devote pages and pages to ideas and theories gleaned from two viewings of this film, such is the nature of this film, stuffed to the brim with provocative satirical tidbits. Maybe I'm rambling a little. Just a collection of positive adjectives vaguely assembled to give an eloquent verdict. Whatever. This is an arthouse masterwork, and a film likely to endure the test of time. For now, however, The Lobster can comfortably sit as the best film of the year, though one suspects repeat viewings will reveal it to be so much more than that.",

Gevestigd in een dystopische nabije toekomst de film vertelt een onconventioneel liefdesverhaal waar een romantische partner vinden een kwestie is van leven en dood. De filmsterren Colin Farrell en Rachel Weisz.-De film geselecteerd om te strijden voor de Palme d'Or op het 2015 Cannes Film Festival en won de Jury Prijs. Hij was te zien in de speciale presentaties gedeelte van de 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.--Kritische reactie:-De Lobster kreeg positieve recensies van filmcritici. Op Rotten Tomatoes, de film heeft een score van 91% op basis van beoordelingen van 45 critici, met een gemiddelde score van 7,5/10. De site's kritische consensus leest; \"Zo raar als het is spannend ambitieus, The Lobster is zeker een verworven smaak - maar voor kijkers met de vastberadenheid om te breken door Yorgos Lanthimos' ongewone gevoeligheden, blijkt een hartige filmische traktatie.\" Op Metacritic, die een gewogen gemiddelde score van 100 tot beoordelingen van mainstream critici, de film ontving een gemiddelde score van 80 uit 11 beoordelingen, met vermelding \"algemeen gunstige beoordelingen\".-Oliver Lyttelton van The Playlist bekroond de film een \"A\" rang en beschreef het als \"een atypische rijke en aanzienlijke comedy\" met \"een oproerende toch droge toon satire over maatschappelijke constructies, dating zeden en machtsstructuren die ook beheert een verrassend bewegende, glansrijk en rare liefdesverhaal te zijn. Hij concludeerde dat de film werd Lanthimos\" \"meest toegankelijke en louter onderhoudende film nu\". Chris Nashawaty van Entertainment Weekly gaf een positieve recensie en prees de film \"visueel verbluffende, wat de verhaallijn betreft stoutmoedig, en geheel ongewoon\", toevoegend dat \"het opent (enen) ogen voor een nieuwe manier om verhalen te vertellen.\"-Guy Lodge, schrijvend voor Variety, noemde de film \"een enorm grappig, onverwachts bewegende satire van koppel gefixeerde maatschappij\", verbeterend dat Lanthimos' \"verstorende opzet ontstaan als een briljante allegorie voor de steeds oppervlakkig systemen van hedendaagse verkering, waaronder de like-for-like algoritmes van online dating sites en de Hot-or-Not snel beslissingen van Tinder\".-Peter Bradshaw van The Guardian beoordeelde de film drie van de vijf sterren, en schreef dat The Lobster is \"elegant en excentriek Lanthimos's vertrouwde stijl\", maar \"lijkt idee�n te missen op haar half weg punt\". IGN heeft verleend een score van 8,5 uit 10, zeggende: \"Colin Farrell biedt het hoofd aan dit surrealistische, hilarische en uiteindelijk heel verontrustend verhaal.\"",

Watching the trailer I expected the 'sort of dark comedy with a pinch of romance' which can be such a fresh experience at the cinema, and while the first forty minutes proved promising (I did chuckle aloud a few times) certain aspects just left a sour taste. I think it should be said that The Lobster has a quite a heavy taint of dystopian horror which isn't focussed upon enough in the trailer, it has a few noteworthy scenes which are difficult to watch and while the 15 rating is fair, some scenes are quite mentally disturbing. Half way through I contemplated leaving. Did I get it... no, I didn't. At least I don't think I did, one thing I did know is that I personally didn't enjoy it. However I can appreciate that a lover of a darker satirical film with a stronger stomach may find it more up their alley.

Malheureusement, il reste ensuite une autre heure et le film de Yorgos Lanthimos s'�croule totalement dans sa deuxi�me partie, extr�mement r�p�titive et surtout artificiellement �trange (on est plus dans la recherche du bizarre pour le bizarre en lui-m�me que pour servir un propos). C'est dommage car Colin Farrell, John C. Reilly et Ben Whishaw sont tr�s bons. Ce sont ceux qui les entourent qui posent vraiment probl�me (L�a Seydoux dans son r�le est un des plus mauvais casting de cette ann�e). The Lobster passe vraiment � c�t� de quelque chose d'int�ressant et c'est bien dommage.",

    "review": "  The Lobster is quite possibly the strangest film I have seen. It is a dark comedy, partly science fiction, a morality tale. It is funny and also dark and confronting. It will confound and yet it has a strong humanity that makes it quite remarkable. Set sometime in the future, society banishes single people to a hotel to find love, or they will be turned into an animal of their choice. Yes, that is the premise and yet it works. Superb performances and strange dialogue make this film disturbing and also rewarding. If some of it doesn't make sense that is OK. It asks many questions of society and humanity and even if it doesn't have all the answers it will make you think.",

    "review": "  The Lobster is an Absurdist film and so has to be taken slowly and quick judgments resisted. It has many good observations and points where you think it is going to make it as a whole film, and I wanted it to make it. But I am left with the opinion that the weaving together is patchy and the overall point is laboured and unconvincing., The Director, who really impressed me me with his previous film Dogtooth, ultimately fails to bring the strands together into anything profound, and you are left with a quirky film about the sadness and craziness of dating, without anything of the profundity and joy of real loving relationship. I suspect the Director has yet to experience love beyond the veil.",

I applaud this movie however for it's embracing attitude, this film knows what is doing is fucked up and plays well on that. And also, superb work from Colin Farrell as the protagonist wandering and surviving in this disgusting mess of a future proving that there are two extremes to everything, we are all weird. There is no alternative.",

    "review": "  Saw 'Lobster' last night. Colin Farrell. Rave reviews, awards etc. Maybe I am just out of step with the rest of the Cosmos. This is the worst film I have ever seen - and I have seen 'Zombie Creeping Flesh', 'Be Kind Rewind' and '2 Days 1 Night'. I don't mind 'low budget' but 'no budget' is a step too far. The so-called 'dead pan' humour had actually died before the actors said their lines. Personally I believe it was suicide. There is only one joke and it is not a good one. I know for a fact that manta rays have written better black, deadpan humour than the drivel served up in this film. I won't give the plot away, primarily because there isn't one. Do anything other than watch this film - if you have an appointment with breathing then that is sufficient reason not to go.",

Looks critically at a our societal beliefs about being alone, being a couple and what the different meanings of love can be - lust, self-gratification, fitting in with others and ultimately a real love based on self-sacrifice. The Greek language has many words for \"love\" and this film explores these concepts of connection in an entertaining, horribly confronting and thought provoking way.

Through its natural naivety, The Lobster succeeds in scratching many open wounds that lie on the body of what we call interpersonal relationships, while giving hints of further, simmering social and political concerns. This is much more underlined by the direction on Academy Award Nominee Yorgos Lanthimos, who drives Colin Farrell and the rest of the cast to memorably perform their roles as inner-corrupted marionettes.",

If you find cinema generally too neat and predictable, then you'll love the many open endings that's available to varied interpretations. The film may feel a tad long, losing some momentum towards the last third as you're not sure if the film knows where, or in fact how, to end it all, but I would still strongly recommend this totally original cinematic experience - just keep an open mind when you do.",

Really? I saw it in a respectably full Picturehouse in the UK (ie the kind of cinema that attracts keen moviegoers) and it barely raised a titter. Lots of talent, competently deployed, but ... for what? It's described as satirical, but satire requires a real and recognisable target, and needs to make points that hurt. Not for the first time, the Tomatometer led me astray with this one.",

This is set in a work where you can book into a hotel and find a soul mate but if you fail in 45 days you get turned into an animal of your choice. the 1st half in funny with some great scenes with Coleman, Jenson and Whishaw then the second half which features Weiz goes a little off track.

It's a great black comedy with a bizarre premise. It also features some disturbing moments, but for the most part, you are laughing at the dry humor and absurdity being presented in front of you. The film does lose steam in the last third where things get a more romantic, it ends up getting a little more dull as well. Nevertheless, \"The Lobster\" is one of the most unique films of the year and it's also one of the best of 2015.",

His voice could have been altered a bit to blend according to the way his body and features morphed. I want to see the entire movie to see whether I would have a different perception about this. I also sensed that he seemed rather uncomfortable in this larger body-his body language did not seem as natural. The part about his canine companion being his brother who did not make it is funny.",
