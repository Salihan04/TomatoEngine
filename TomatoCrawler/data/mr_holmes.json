    "review": "  Sherlock Holmes battles his failing memory as he tries to solve his last case, which still haunts him.The highlight of this film is the masterful work by Ian McKellen, whose take on an aging Holmes brings to mind the thesis of A Beautiful Mind: that intelligence can outwit the infirmities of the body. Despite his failing memory, Holmes attempts to retrain his brain to renew his deductive capacities, and yet in the lines of McKellen's face, we see the emotional toll these additional intellectual acrobatics work on him.The mystery plot is pedestrian, with a payoff that does not rival some of the classic Holmes mysteries, but in fairness, the film is about age and its ravages, not necessarily a typical whodunit. Overall, I like this take on Holmes, though I pray that they don't take it too far with an uninspired sequel.",

    "review": "  If you're looking for a detective adventure in the style of Guy Ritchie, you will be disappointed. On the other hand, if you're looking for superb acting and drama focused on issues of aging, look no further. It doesn't take a brilliant sleuth to reach the conclusion that \"Mr. Holmes\" is an exceptionally well made film. The acting and script are beyond compare. At times, Sir Ian McKellen seems to channel Sir John Gielgud, in all the best senses. I would be shocked if Ian McKellen does not get a nod from the Academy for his performance in what is one of the best films of 2015. Hair, makeup, costumes, locations, cinematography, sound and directing are all excellent. With a slightly mischievous score and meticulous attention to texture and color in the visuals, \"Mr. Holmes\" is an elegant and rich feast for the senses.I cannot recommend this film highly enough -- just don't watch it expecting action, adventure, or anything beyond mild mystery.",

    "review": "  There is something quite elegant to MR. HOLMES - a feeling that is fleetingly whimsical yet one that is certainly hard to pinpoint. It is a strange film in which its purpose is a mystery but its result a success; the plot is not that exciting but rather more a calming joy as we watch a delicate and convincing Sir Ian McKellen immerse himself in the character as he goes about teaming with a curious youth (played impressively by Milo Parker) while fighting old age, memory loss, and an unsolved mystery. Though the reasons for making a film that shows an elderly Sherlock Holmes is initially kind of baffling, what Bill Condon has done is invigorate the narrative with a composed visual style along with a very patient (but not slow) pace that only strengthens its themes of retrospection and life.",

    "review": "  t 93, Sherlock Holmes(Ian McKellen) may be long retired from his career as a consulting detective, but that does not mean he does not keep busy, having just returned from a long journey to Japan. Otherwise, he looks after bees in his house in the country. In return, he is looked after by Mrs. Munro(Laura Linney) and her young son Roger(Milo Parker). That's because he has deep concerns about his memory, as he tries to recall his last case.Grounded by a masterful lived-in performance from Ian McKellen, \"Mr. Holmes\" has a deceptively complex story structure, namely combining several different stories and mysteries seamlessly. To that effect, the movie makes special use of time, moving backwards and forwards at will. For this deeply humanized version of the venerable character whose time has not yet completely passed him by, what matters most is setting the record straight before it is too late.",

    "review": "  Subtle, easy-going, and charming, Mr. Holmes is a pleasant diversion which will cater to certain crowds turned off by most summer fare. Largely playing like a glacially-paced BBC television movie (it was produced by BBC) the plot revolves around an elderly Sherlock Holmes living in the country, suffering with memory loss, befriending an intellectually curious young boy, tending bee hives, and occasionally having flashbacks. That's pretty much it. And that's all it really needs to be. I would be remiss not to compare this to Still Alice, which also features a protagonist with genius level intellect succumbing to Alzheimer's despite their mental tricks and stubborn refusal to surrender. (Though this is far less depressing.) A significant theme in Mr. Holmes is reality vs. myth, as Holmes tries to distinguish himself from the heavily fictionalized version with mixed results, while trying to desperately remember his last case and why he retired from his chosen profession. This is Sir Ian McKellen's show without question and an example of how excellent character acting and star power can hold most films afloat. He fits into the character like a glove and he easily could have played Sherlock Holmes decades ago, or his spiritual grandson James Bond. The flashbacks to the last case and post-war Hiroshima were interesting and the film's ending managed to complete any lingering character arcs in a way most movies utterly fail. An excellent rental or download to watch on a calm, relaxed evening with a glass of wine.",

Ian McKellen puts on an Oscar-worthy performance as Holmes, living alone in a seaside home with only his housekeeper and her son; tending to bees. No thrills involving big dogs or evil criminal masterminds like Professor Moriarty; but a tense, suspenseful and moving story, well shot and well directed. I liked it a lot.",

It's a movie I wouldn't recommend to most of my friends because of the type of movie it is, but those who like dramas with great acting and dialogue will fall for Mr. Holmes. I finally got to see Ian McKellen in a lead role again where he's not Magneto or Gandalf. There's a bit of mystery and a couple of twists that push the story along. McKellen gave me a glimpse of Sherlock Holmes in his later years. Instead of the typical confident Holmes, McKellen created a hesitant old man who'd disappeared from the limelight. He was assisted by Milo Parker, a seemingly up-and-coming actor who stood out as well. I wouldn't tell my typical summer movie fan friends to see Mr. Holmes, but it's a very good film that certain people are going to enjoy immensely.",

    "review": "  The casting of Sir Ian McKellen as an elderly Sherlock Holmes, battling the onset of dementia, is a stroke of genius. He is simply captivating in the role and totally believable as the short tempered and increasingly frustrated detective. Set in the late 1940s, Holmes has lost all of his established references and is living a lonely life in a cottage by the coast with only a housekeeper and her young son, Roger, for company. Holmes is desperate to try to combat his increasing mental frailty and embarks on a strange journey to find a cur. He is also haunted by fleeting and fractured memories of his final case. It is the persistence of Roger and the developing bond between the two that becomes central to the plot and it is beautifully played out by both McKellen and the young actor Milo Parker. This is a nicely observed movie and the viewer really sympathises with the confusion and anger that the Great Detective feels at his own increasing frailty. Gradually, he is able to pull together the missing pieces of his final engagement and make sense of his memories and, in doing so, makes peace with his past and faces up to the future with a new hope. Bill Condon, who also directed McKellen in the equally good Gods and Monsters, can be duly proud of this little gem of a movie which also has a beautiful score by Carter Burwell.",

I think it made the final reveal and unraveling of the story really gratifying and a true hero moment, as an old man overcame his failing health - especially as he struggled to overcome the popular image being painted of him in pop culture and fiction novels by John Watson.Definitely a really solid film; great casting and performances and it weaved with really good melancholy, especially lacing in some WWII storytelling.Get to the theater and catch this one while you can!",

The film moves along quite well with some nimble direction and story telling, but this is not so much a story in which much happens so much as one where we learn about Ian McKellen's fantastically portrayed Holmes. With Watson's novels of their adventures having been popularized, there is fantastic insight in how Holmes tries to reconcile his faded memories against the dramatized accounts he can't relate to as being accounts of his life. There is a wonderful chemistry between him and his suffering house keeper and her son. As she wishes to leave, her son wishes to stay and find out more about the elderly Holmes and this all drives some fantastic dialogue atmosphere to frame Holmes's investigations in to his own mind. Maybe not for everyone, but a good solid piece of drama with some rewarding emotional payoff and a mystery worthy of the original books whilst avoiding any cliche.",

It's both the story of him and the story of the house keepers son who idolizes Sherlock and wants to be a better person because of him. There are several stories going on at once in this and It does a good job of keeping you interested in all of them.",

    "review": "  Sherlock Holmes battles his failing memory as he tries to solve his last case, which still haunts him.The highlight of this film is the masterful work by Ian McKellen, whose take on an aging Holmes brings to mind the thesis of A Beautiful Mind: that intelligence can outwit the infirmities of the body. Despite his failing memory, Holmes attempts to retrain his brain to renew his deductive capacities, and yet in the lines of McKellen's face, we see the emotional toll these additional intellectual acrobatics work on him.The mystery plot is pedestrian, with a payoff that does not rival some of the classic Holmes mysteries, but in fairness, the film is about age and its ravages, not necessarily a typical whodunit. Overall, I like this take on Holmes, though I pray that they don't take it too far with an uninspired sequel.",

    "review": "  Movie Review MavenGrade: AIn a Nutshell: Super Sleuth Sherlock Holmes is retired and doesn't live on Baker Street anymore. This is not an action-packed Sherlock Holmes like we've seen done by Robert Downey Jr. or Benedict Cumberbatch, but rather, a thoughtful drama that showcases Ian McKellen as an aging, grumpy detective who still has one more mystery to solve and something to learn.If you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, this is a must-see film that will add even greater depth to your love of this timeless character. I attended a walking tour in London all about Sherlock Holmes. So, yeah...Uplifting Theme:� \"Logic doesn't solve matters of the heart.\" - Holmes - \"The understanding of facts doesn't mean you understand their meaning.\" - Sherlock� There are 3 examples of life and death: Holmes' bees, Ann Kelmot, and Sherlock Holmes. Ann later explains, \"The dead are not so very far away. They're just on the other side of the wall. It's us on this side who are all alone.\" - Ann Kelmot (Hattie Morahan)� Things I liked:� I liked the musical score immediately. Thank you Carter Burwell.� Ian McKellen does an outstanding job as Sherlock Holmes. Who doesn't love the man who brought us Gandolf? Did you know that he is the recipient of 6 Laurence Olivier Awards, a tony Award, a Golden Globe Ward, a Screen Actors Guild Award, 2 Academy Award nominations and 4 BAFTA nominations and 5 Emmy nominations?! This film could easily add another nomination to his prestigious list.� Laura Linney's accent is a bit off, but I have always liked her. It sounds like a mix of English, Welsh, and Scottish. What is it?� Young Milo Parker plays Roger, the son of Sherlock's housekeeper....a young star in the making.� Beautiful English countryside. Look for the White Cliffs of Dover. You only see Watson's legs and hands. Clever.� Things I didn't like:� It's very slow-moving. Then again, so is the elderly Sherlock Holmes. Funny lines: � \"When you are a detective and a man comes to visit you, it's usually about his wife.\" - Sherlock� \"I told Watson if I ever write a story, it will be to correct the million misconceptions created by his imaginative license.\" - Sherlock� \"Did you find what you were looking for in Japan? The mysterious Ashley prick?\" - Doctor\"The prickly ash.\" - Sherlock� \"Fiction is worthless!\" - Sherlock� Interesting lines:� \"I think I was real once, until John made me into fiction and then after that I just had a choice: play the part as he had fashioned it or become its contradiction.\" - Sherlock� \"My study is my sanctum sanctorum...private place.\" - Holmes� \"I've never had much use for imagination. I prefer facts.\" - Sherlock� \"Death, mourning, grief...they're all commonplace. Logic is more rare. I dwell on that.\" - Sherlock� \"Her death made me see that human nature was a mystery that logic could not illuminate.\" - Sherlock Holmes \"Don't say everything you think.\" - Mrs. Munro� Tips for Parents:� This is not a fast-moving mystery that kids will get a kick out of, but more of a \"thinking man's movie\" that might bore them. The target audience is probably an older audience, and true Sherlock buffs.� Murrder, death and suicide are the prominent themes, which you may not want young children to watch..� Sherlock informs his simple housekeeper, \"Exceptional children are often the product of unremarkable parents.\" � The bombing of Hiroshima is represented in a very sobering way. Your kids may not be familiar with this aspect of history.",

The roles of Magneto and Gandalf have always put Ian McKellen in a different light but this film proves yet again why he is still the big daddy out there.

The supporting cast is pretty disappointing due to a somewhat lacklustre script (even Laura Linney's talent could not help it, and hey, \"the hot girl\" from Mission Impossible V was also here, in an even smaller role) and confusing structure of three overlapping stories of presence, flash-back, and dementia-induced fantasy. The revelation of \"the investigation\" is decent enough, with an excellent scene by McKellen and Hattie Morahan, but the film in a whole felt a little bit boring, despite its effort of over-complicating the storyline. Still, it is very difficult to make a \"thrilling\" film out of such tepid subject of \"being old\", thus this film deserves commendation for its effort to shed a new light on the rather one-sided life of the famous detective.",

    "review": "  A completely different take on the most famous detective, Mr.Holmes is a restrained, intimate and quiet study on the last years of the life of the legendary fictional character. Lacking the sharpness, the thrills, the action and the commanding presence of Sherlock Holmes which is to typical for most movies around his persona, this movie has nothing to do with the overall perception of what a movie about the British detective should be. A depiction of the last years of Sherlock's life, the story goes about how fragile he is, about the final attempts he makes to resolve a case he never managed to. It is a story of ageing, mortality and of an old person who tries to expand the limits of his logic and memory despite the merciless advance of his age and medical condition. With the help of his Housekeer's boy, Sherlock (Ian McKellen) not only reach the truth, but also finally reaches his own limits of being himself. Finally coming to terms with his age, with the inevitability of his death he is trying to solve the mysteries of love and life. Director Bill Condon has taken an approach which would certain not please those who expect a Guy Ritchie-type of Sherlock Holmes entertainment. He focuses on the gentle and moving story of an old person, who tries to desperately remember the past, who tries to stay with his mind for as long as he could. It is true that the plot is somehow too scattered, that the pacing might be challenging for some, but on the other side there are the magnificent Ian McKellen and the very promising Milo Parket (as the young Roger) who establish a connection to keep your hearts warm. A showcase of McKellen's abilities to keep the audience intrigued throughout a hard and slow story-line, Mr.Holmes is a fine example of high level of performances and a director who is capable of delivering a piece of melancholic and touching film-making.",

Subtle in its telling, this mystery seems nonexistent simply because it's not exotic. The aging Sherlock is hoping to remember one last story from his past before his deteriorating memory catches up. With the help of Milo Parker as his young protege, Ian McKellen masterfully blends the surly know-it-all of Holmes' youth with the emotive hindsight of age. His performance is no less than you would expect of him. This is much closer to the last film Bill Condon and McKellen worked together on (Gods and Monsters) than the recent slew of musicals and large budget fairy tales he's been kicking out. His direction feels honest to elderly Sherlock and in staying true to the character we all love, only allows us to understand the sum of the story when Holmes is ready to deduce it.",

If you ever seen a movie about Dementia, one technique of film-making is to try to tell the story through the point of view of the protagonist suffering from the condition. This is very hard to pull off without being very confusing the first time you watch it. In this case the confusion is so well-placed and with intent that it really lets you explore what it is like to actually suffer from the condition. I had no idea the housekeeper was Laura Linney - I had figured she was some Irish actress previously unknown to the American audiences - that is how deep into the role she delved.

    "review": "  Mr. Holmes is definitely the best addition to the Sherlock Holmes legend in a long time. That says something considering I just consider myself a casual Sherlock Holmes fan. I was first introduced to the character as a child watching the children's animated series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century which is still my favorite version of the character personally. I've also seen the two recent films with Robert Downey Jr. which I liked, at least the first one anyway. I've also seen some of the old movies which I found rather boring. Now there's this film which I would be a close second in terms of my favorite renditions of Sherlock Holmes.The plot is as follows. The movie revolves around an aging Sherlock Holmes and moments near the end of his life. He recently returned from a trip to Japan and is back to his remote house tending to his bees. He also forms a relationship with his housekeeper's son Roger. Homes is also frantically trying to piece together his memories of his final case before he retired so he could write it down how it actually happened.What really carries this film is Sir Ian McKellen and his amazing performance. He is definitely one of my favorite actors working now. He is a great Sherlock Holmes and I could not see many other people in that role of old Sherlock Holmes. I also really like the direction they took. From the trailer I was not immensely hyped for the film. The only draw for me was Ian McKellen. It just seemed like a child friendly adventure with Rodger as the main character solving a case with Sherlock Holmes mentoring and helping him. That's not what we got and I'm glad.I like how they made this Holmes more down to Earth than any other version. Sherlock Holmes reminds me of Indiana Johns in some ways. They're both basically male fantasies who are awesome, kick ass, immensely, smart, show emotion but not too much, etc. He's an insanely brilliant man who goes off on adventures like Indiana Jones but in Holmes's case they're cases. They also both generally wear signature costumes. In Holmes's case it's his signature coat, hat, magnifying glass, and pipe. The Sherlock Holmes franchise, for the most part, has always been very stylized.This is the most humanized version I've seen. I like how they even poke fun at the image of Holmes and how the world sees him. The movie says that Watson wrote exaggerated tales of Holmes's cases and even made-up his signature attire. Holmes basically calls it all rubbish. This Holmes looks like any normal man with a brilliant mind. The atmosphere is another key driving factor. The film is kind of shot like a soap opera but here I think it worked. I like how there's no real villain but just Holmes trying to piece together his last case and his relationship with Roger. Such drama-centered film might put-off more casual viewers especially ones affiliated with the Robert Downey Jr. movies. I just found it a very soothing and relaxing film even in its more dramatic moments. The flashbacks to the earlier days were great to. Of course it would not work unless the characters were interesting and they were. Holmes is a very interesting character (plus Ian's performance helped as well) and I liked seeing his personal growth throughout the film in realizing his initial philosophy he always lived by perhaps wasn't entirely correct. Roger is also a serviceable character for Holmes to interact with.Overall, Mr. Holmes is a great new addition into the Sherlock Holmes franchise. Don't let the trailer, rating, and the tone turn you off. It may not be what is usually expected of Sherlock Holmes but it's still a brilliant character study and relaxing and entertaining watch for me.",

I thought this new film that showed a new perspective of Sherlock Holmes sounded great and I saw it got good reviews. I liked the film, but felt that it was pretty slow at the beginning and there was a scene like halfway through the movie that stated the plot, which would have been better much earlier in the film. I was a little disappointment in the flashback case as it wasn't that great of a mystery and I thought the ending was a little forced as well. Overall, I enjoyed this film and loved the idea, but felt the execution could have been a little better.",

    "review": "  Mr. Holmes may not be the biggest or boldest recent updating of Sherlock, but McKellen's performance alone is almost reason enough to see it on the big screen. Sir Ian McKellen is a pleasure to watch as an elderly Sherlock Holmes, though the drama isn't as compelling as it might have been. This is Holmes intentionally slowed down to a hobbling, reflective, end-of-life pace: dare we call it refreshing? It's a film to rummage around in, picking up old clues, considering their meaning, and turning them in your palm. It is an elegant if slight piece of work, touching and intriguing by turns, but hampered structurally in that it relies on two separate flashback sections. Mr. Holmes has moments of palpable regret and loss, but visually speaking, it looks like a blandly touching movie about a lonely old man who befriends a scrappy kid and learns about the magic of storytelling. Eventually, that's the unexciting destiny it fulfills. Unfortunately, director Bill Condon and screenwriter Jeffrey Hatcher are clueless, and come up with an incoherent, implausible, contrived mishmash. Despite a brilliant performance from Sir Ian McKellen, Mr. Holmes is a little too scattered in its plot to leave much of an impact, making you wish that there had been more focus on its intriguing mystery and less on the less satisfying parts of the tale.VERDICT: \"In The Zone\" - [Mixed Reaction] These kinds of movies are usually movies that had some good things, but some bad things kept it from being amazing. This rating says buy an ex-rental or a cheap price of the DVD to own. If you consider cinema, ask for people's opinion on the film. (Films that are rated 2.5 or 3 stars)",

It is a strange film in which its purpose is a mystery but its result a success; the plot is not that exciting but rather more a calming joy as we watch a delicate and convincing Sir Ian McKellen immerse himself in the character as he goes about teaming with a curious youth (played impressively by Milo Parker) while fighting old age, memory loss, and an unsolved mystery. Though the reasons for making a film that shows an elderly Sherlock Holmes is initially kind of baffling, what Bill Condon has done is invigorate the narrative with a composed visual style along with a very patient (but not slow) pace that only strengthens its themes of retrospection and life.",

And Holmes' interactions with his housekeeper and her son. With flashbacks to his visit to Japan to find an herbal medicine. And relatively brief segments about his last unsolved case when he retired, about a wife who goes places to play a musical instrument behind her husband's back. Though I'm not sure if that was an actual case, or Holmes was just writing a story about a fictional case. And I'm not sure what the crime was. Or if there was a crime. I don't think that playing musical instruments behind your husband's back is a crime. I was pretty much nodding off throughout the film due to lack of interest. Either way, I didn't care about anything in this film. And throughout this boring mess, McKellen portrays Holmes as a caricature of a terminally grouchy, walking-dead old man with no personality, no energy, and no wit. If you're looking for a film about Sherlock Holmes using his wonderful deductive reasoning to solve a crime, look elsehwere. There is no Sherlock Holmes here, just an old guy stumbling through his last, uninteresting and uneventful days. This is one of those movies that \"seems\" like it's a good movie, but in fact it's just long and boring and uninteresting.",

    "review": "  SEE THIS MOVIE! Mr. Holmes is a masterfully crafted movie worthy of multiple Academy Awards. You will find no gimmicks or clich�s here in a storyline that successfully and seamlessly interweaves contemporary issues in a beautiful cinematography and meaningful dialogue. This is a beautifully shot movie, with its multiple subplots contributes to its poignant and haunting conclusion. Each and every character has their own depth delivered with economy which does not burden or patronize the viewer: truly masterful storytelling based on the novel \"A Slight Trick of the Mind\" by Mitch Cullin. This movie should be considered an instant classic of cinematic arts best of the best. We have come to expect this quality and integrity from director Bill Condon (Dream Girls, Kinsey, Gods and Monsters). Mr. Holmes is a moving account of a culmination of the experiences of its characters which were chosen with economy and purpose which delivers depth that will leave us moved, touched and inspired. Ian McKellan portrays an aging Sherlock Holmes who is suffering from memory loss and fragility as he struggles to learn a very personal karmic lesson by revisiting the case which forced him into retirement. This is perhaps Sir Ian?s personal best performance and worthy of not just an Academy Best Actor award, but a portrayal that should be studied by artists and movie professionals for years to come. You?re not watching Gandalf in English post WWII period clothing here. You?re experiencing a master craftsman be and deliver a very real and raw Mr. Holmes with everything he experienced in love, loss, arrogance and humility with life lessons behind, present and in front of him. A key pivotal role of Mr. Holmes? WWII widowed housekeeper, Mrs. Munro, who must consider the near term implications of her employer rapidly declining physical and mental health as she struggles to support her and her son, Roger (Milo Parker). This is yet another delivery by Laura Linney (You Can Count on Me, Love Actually, John Adams) who should be considered for the Academy Best Actress performance as Mrs. Munro balances her multifaceted choices and challenges.Milo Parker should be considered a serious Best Supporting Actor contender for his portrayal of Roger, the son of the WWII widow housekeeper, Mrs. Munro, and is the willing intellectual assistant to Mr. Holmes. The young Milo Parker?s performance is flowing and natural, who I suspect, like his character ?Roger? is highly intelligent, compassionate and old soul. If you want to see the future Academy Award Best Picture, see Mr. Holmes.",

And when it comes to a movie about Sherlock, everything stands or falls with the actor. In my most humble opinion, there is only one who have perfected Holmes - the late but never forgotten Jeremy Brett. But I can surely and truly \"forgive\" Ian McKellen, if anyone could challenge Brett it would be him out of straight and shear talent and experience. We see a different Holmes, an aging Holmes, and that is needed now when we have a whole flood of similar takes at our constant disposal. And everything else - just wonderful. Even if you're not an Holmes nerd you would probably find something from this tender, without getting unnecessarily sappy, drama. It makes you think twice, as the man who held facts over everything else and despised feelings, is left with only feelings and no facts. Watch it.",

The premise of this movie seemed perfect for me, but I guess I just didn't like the directions the movie turned. I'd say my main problem is with the script, I feel due to its premise that it should have been much better. It just goes into a few directors I wasn't happy with in terms of Holmes' backstory. That's my problem with the movie, it doesn't seem to be a problem with audiences or critics, and clearly my own expectations have clouded my judgement of it. I love Ian McKellen, and he gives a good performance, but I feel he was miscast somewhat. Not there were many other candidates of his caliber to choose from. I don't know, I'm still frankly confused about how I feel about this one.",

    "review": "  It's been a long time since the last Sherlock Holmes movie. When this got announced I was very excited! Especially since Sherlock was going to be played by Ian McKellen! Now, a lot of people have been complaining that the movie is too slow paced and not what they were expecting. I went into the movie knowing that and I tried to overlook the slow pace and lack of tension, but at times it was hard. Yes, this movie is nothing like the Robert Downey Jr. version or the Benedict Cumberbatch one. It's still a damn great movie, though! The movie follows Sherlock Holmes in his 93rd year of life as he lives with his housekeeper and her son, Roger, in a secluded house out of the village. Sherlock's last case scarred him deeply and he had to retire from the job. Now, his past starts haunting him as Roger wants to know what exactly happened in that case. Unfortunately, Sherlock doesn't remember a lot of it and the rest of the movie is basically Sherlock remembering the case and writing down, along with some drama. The story is very intriguing, as well are the characters. Ian McKellen portrayal of Sherlock is very different from the other ones, but also one of the most interesting ones. Here, we see him old and hurt, at his weakest, while in all the other incarnations he was always a smart, seemingly immortal, detective. So, it's great to see a different approach to the character. There are a few scenes which genuinely touched me, but there were also scenes which seemed a bit over the top dramatic. The director did a great job and the movie is beautiful to look at. The whole movie has a very relaxing tone to it and sometimes seems like a Downton Abbey episode. All in all, a great movie, but not a great Sherlock Holmes movie as it misses the suspense and tension of the case-solving. I would still recommend it to fans of Sherlock Holmes and those just looking for a relaxing movie for a Sunday afternoon.",

Ian McKellen turns in a subtly-powerful performance, unlike his previous endeavours which saw him turn in more commanding performances. Although the movie starts slow and confusingly with three narrative strands, it soon gathers steam in the second act as elements of the subplots dovetail nicely to an eventual theme. In retrospect, the subplots provide clever foreshadowing to a richly multi-layered drama that still retains the suspense, mystery and wit of a Sherlock whodunnit with a welcome dash of emotional resonance.",

    "review": "  Let me clear this up first, this film is not the kind of Sherlock Holmes adaption you would expect to see! It has no witty banter of Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal on the BBC One series, or the slow mo action performed by Robert Downey Jr from the Guy Richie directed duology or the quirky mannerisms of Jonny Lee Miller as seen on the very enjoyable American adaption of CBS's Elementary. Instead its a very grounded, slow paced human story of a once sterling detective and highly admired celebrity. The film is a very tender drama with some mystery elements to it, but there is no great whodunit here. There is no theft, no murder, no Moriarty (the main antagonist of the Sherlock Holmes series) the only little bit of mystery comes in the form of Sherlock trying to recall his past. We want to know how Sherlock became a bit of a recluse? What happened on his last case that made him retreat into a small house on the seaside with his housekeeper and his bees? These questions all play into the ideas that I thought about the most while watching the film -- memory and mortality, and how we can lose both. What if Sherlock Holmes were a real person? What if he lived in a world in which he had been made famous by the writings of John Watson, his long-time friend and partner in (solving) crimes? What would Holmes be like as a man and what would he think of his fame and his legacy? These questions represent just some of what's explored in this film. Watson's accounts of Holmes' detecting made him world famous and a legend in his own time. Watson's stories made the character of Sherlock Holmes larger than life. He made the cases sound more exciting than they were and exaggerated other details that were further embellished on the big screen. Based on the Mitch Cullin novel, \"A Slight Trick of the Mind\", we get a rare glimpse into the life of an aging legend which cleverly depicts the world's most famous fictional detective from a non-fiction perspective. The film is a fine character study about a man who is losing his mental acuity. Now an aging recluse trying to connect names to faces and remember simple daily routines, he sits at home with a housekeeper and her son as his only company. As a standalone film, one of the great charms of this film is that it can be viewed with equal level of enjoyment by two different types of people: the type who know nothing other than the basics regarding the character of Sherlock Holmes, and equally the people who have seen or read everything about him. It manages to appeal to both camps by being both a revisionist version of his stories, yet still keeping in the same spirit and not denying any of the prior literature. The story follows a 93 year-old Sherlock Holmes (Ian McKellen) as he lives retired in a Sussex farmhouse with his housekeeper, Mrs. Munro (Laura Linney), whose husband died in World War II and her son, Roger (Milo Parker). He has retired to his cottage by the sea and taken up his well known hobby of beekeeping or apiculture. Sherlock is trying to write the truth about his last case before he dies, due to Dr John Watson's embellishment of the facts, he has trouble remembering how the case ended. With the help of Roger and some small tricks up his sleeve, he will write the truth about his final case and how it ended his career, but also let him know that he has a compassionate side as well. The story is basically layered with a number of events; beginning with the time where a retired Sherlock Holmes is staying on a village; then we get flashbacks of his trip to Japan finding a medicine that could help his memory and his last case that seems to have an unpleasant conclusion. We see that this is a point where Holmes does see the limitations that he didn't foresee while the other segments show how influential his career was. It's often a character study about what kind of a fascinating man he is, but also taken over by his own abilities, which lead him to regret about his once cold nature, learning to understand how others people feel about him. Due to the fact that the film's metronome is a 93-year-old man losing his memory, the pace is unfortunately slow for the first half of the film. Having multiple flashbacks that omit information until necessary keeps the viewer guessing but also at times frustrated. The second half of the film picks up in pace as the 3 story lines all begin to start solving themselves, but more importantly Mr. Holmes (I don't think his first name is ever uttered in this movie) starts to realize a moral that he never quite came to terms with in all of his sleuthing regarding the truth and humanity. I've seen a solid handful of the countless Sherlock Holmes incarnations (he is the most commonly portrayed character in cinema) and there is something that becomes almost tragic about each one as you realize he is someone whose intelligence and wit makes him unable to live normally amongst other 'ordinary' people. It is rare to find something new done with an old character, especially one that has been around for nearly 150 years like Sherlock Holmes has, but that's exactly what this film does. Director Bill Condon (The Fifth Estate, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 & Part 2, Dreamgirls) provides a wonderfully crafted story and a beautiful cinematic backdrop to unlikely discussion points. With the overly used character vehicle, Sherlock Holmes, he engages the aging hero in determining the fine line between fact and fiction and the value of the elderly. These topics may not get the average movie fan out of their seat on a weekend, but they are woven beautifully in a character driven film of relationships and mystery. A rich and meaningful relational portrait is given his mentor-ship of young Roger, who is a fledgling sleuth and fellow bee keeper. Also, Condon seems to take joy in dismantling the mythology of the legend, as he demystifies every fictitious devise that Watson has added into the character of Sherlock Holmes. Condon continues to show his ability to provide fresh vision for story and characters. His only directing weakness is the time line continuance. There are three different time lines to consider and they can get a bit muddled, but it does not detract from the overall experience. Ultimately, he is able to effectively portray the past and the present, and allow Ian McKellen develop Holmes into an original and appealing depiction of the master sleuth. When I first read that Sir Ian McKellen had landed the role of Sherlock Holmes in a film about the end of the great detective's life, I knew he would be perfect for the part, and indeed, who better to play the world famous detective other than actor who has immortalized two other pop culture roles as well - Magneto (X-Men series) & Gandalf (The Lord of The Rings series). Ian McKellan is easily one of the most talented and charismatic actors I have ever seen. He shows that a man well into his 70's can still be a Hollywood A-Lister. He proves his acting chops (as always) as he gives a moving and heartfelt performance as a man twenty years older than he is even now. He seems so feeble and struggles with not wanting to let go of his life. McKellan could and probably should see an Oscar nod for this. It's as though the charm, the suave and the elegance of the old school detective just come naturally to him. But the finest scenes are between Holmes and that farm boy Roger (Milo Parker) as they slowly but surely uncover the subtle mysteries of Ann's case and the outbreak among bees. We instantly connect to both characters and that is a credit to the rich screenplay that gives them a variety of emotions and situations to perform in. Milo Parker looks up to Sir Ian as a mentor in the same way his character looks up to Sherlock Holmes. He might be a farm boy but he is a budding detective in his mind and talent. Milo Parker as young Roger was brilliant. I wasn't expecting much, given he's a child actor, but he really nailed the role. He holds his own opposite McKellan and is absolutely amazing as the wide-eyed, vivacious little boy that Holmes takes under his wing and vice versa. Laura Linney as Roger's mother is remarkable in her role as well. Her dedication for her son's well being, her struggles with income and dismissal of Holmes' unabashed attitude make up for Mrs. Hudson's absence among characters. On the whole, 'Mr Holmes' is a delightful yet heart wrenching and human take on the legendary character, that truly deserves to be a part of the Holmes canon. If you are a fan of the character & don't mind a slow burn film, this one is for you!",

    "review": "  Mr. Holmes draws you into the mind of an aging Sherlock Holmes, played brilliantly by Sir Ian McKellan. You will find yourself wanting to examine every detail of the movie, searching each scene for hidden clues, analyzing each in hopes of reaching a final deduction before Mr. Holmes reveals it. Mr. Holmes is more than just a mystery story; it is a story of personal struggles. The main struggle is between that of Sherlock's brilliant mind and the physical restraints of aging. However, his life-long gift for logical and deductive thinking must also confront emotion issues and his ability to develop personal relationships. This is not a fast paced, action-packed film like that of Robert Downey Jr's Sherlock Holmes movies. This is a film that intends to pull you into the story slowly, providing time for you to learn to think like Sherlock. It has the pace of the \"aging\" Sherlock Holmes character. The elderly Sherlock Holmes is contrasted by a young inquisitive boy named Roger, played flawlessly by Milo Parker. Roger presents a constant reminder of what Sherlock might have been like in his youth. The young boy may also serve as a reminder that one's life can have an impact and continue through the lives of others. The young boy's relationship and admiration for Sherlock also opens opportunities for Sherlock to reveal his most human qualities and flaws.Mr. Holmes is a film that can touch you emotionally as well as intellectually. You may find yourself wanting to watch it a second time, so that you can re-visit the hidden clues that you seemed to have overlooked the first time.",

    "review": "  'Mr. Holmes' takes a rather interesting turn away from the conventional Sherlock Holmes depictions. In this film, Holmes is at his golden ages struggling to remember fragments of his final case that still haunts him thereafter his retirement while in the care of a housekeeper and her son who showcases exceptional wit and cleverness as a rising detective. With Ian McKellen's brilliant performance, the movie preserves the compelling mysteries of the original tales but focuses keenly on the endeavors of the man that solved them. Overall, it is narratively well-executed, profoundly riveting and displays a more humane approach to the renowned high-functioning sociopath.",

It's a movie I wouldn't recommend to most of my friends because of the type of movie it is, but those who like dramas with great acting and dialogue will fall for Mr. Holmes. I finally got to see Ian McKellen in a lead role again where he's not Magneto or Gandalf. There's a bit of mystery and a couple of twists that push the story along. McKellen gave me a glimpse of Sherlock Holmes in his later years. Instead of the typical confident Holmes, McKellen created a hesitant old man who'd disappeared from the limelight. He was assisted by Milo Parker, a seemingly up-and-coming actor who stood out as well. I wouldn't tell my typical summer movie fan friends to see Mr. Holmes, but it's a very good film that certain people are going to enjoy immensely.",

I say that because my mother was convinced Sherlock Holmes was a real detective and not an ingenious literary creation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The film is solidly written and the themes of age and the importance of memory are sharp, but the real success here is Ian McKellan who brings to true life to the aging detective. His performance is stellar and he really brings the character into focus.",

Ian McKellen's performance as an aged Sherlock Holmes was outstanding. I probably would not have bothered with this movie had it not been for the fact hat I just recemtly finished reading The Hound of Baskervilles, my first Sherlock Holmes book, and I found it fantastic and am reading another now. It is pretty addictive stuff. This movie was carefully and beautifully crafted and includes the wonderful Laura Linney as Holmes' housekeeper and a superb young actor Milo Parker)playing her son. McKellen and director Bill Condon teamed up splendidly for the memorable Gods and Monsters several years ago and this movie matches its quality frame for frame. See it, and don't be like me and assume you have no interest in Sherlock Holmes. He is an unforgettable character, and I personally think McKellen should be nominated for his portrayal of a geriatric Holmes in this role. Bravo!",

    "review": "  This is not the average Sherlock Holmes tale, instead of centering on the thrills of Baker Street, the story centers its attention on a question of mortality that Holmes is forced to grapple with as he nears the end of his life. In his old age, Holmes is slowly succumbing to the loss of his memory, which is a huge blow to a character whose entire identity is centered on his razor sharp mind and a keen intellect. This film is less of mystery thrill and more of a drama that plays on the emotions of the audience, especially those who are great fans of Sherlock Holmes as a character. I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I went to see this movie, it took me by surprise to honest. It's been a while since I exhausted myself trying not to sob or sniffle in the midst of a public theater. The casting is superb, Sir Ian McKellen is the perfect fit for the retired Mr. Holmes. The chemistry between the actors really shows with every single scene. You can tell every single movement is a well thought out choreography that works to depict a man who is slowly losing himself to his old age. Those were some of the most defining moments of the film.",

    "review": "  As a fan: I just saw this film and got tears around my face when I finished it. Those tears were of fear (a movie where Watson is mentioned but not physically there, same his wife, Hudson, etc....well...can't spoil anyway but yes, tears of fear), of happiness (he may be older but still has that thing that makes you smile and sometimes wants to hug him to know he's not alone), tears of anger (yeah, it's Sherlock, he may make you a bit angry sometimes but that's how he is, understand the man!); any emotion really. My tears were a mix of everything really. Oh, and the deductions! I just cannot spoil a thing (sorry), but if you are a Conan Doyle fan, you may find a few surprises (EASTER EGGS! By that, I can only say you must have read all his stories to notice this ones out, check out the film \"Young Sherlock Holmes\" & the 1st episode of Sherlock BBC for a certain person on the film [in another role obviously]). As a lover of 7th Art: I found this film well edited, sometimes slow (REALLY SLOW) but that was the point! You needed to see how Ian's Sherlock evolved from a certain age to the 93 old person he end up to be. It's so amazing that transition! Laura as Mrs. Munro was also incredible! Loved her character very much. I believe I know now how Hudson may have felt somehow when Sherlock was a pain in the a** (since Munro is also a housekeeper...yeah, Hudson denies that hehe). Well, parents at some point are like that and we must take care of them as they took care of us. So, Sherlock is like a father maybe to Munro and Roger (it's something that came to my head while watching the film). And by Roger, I must say, Milo Parker was superb! So funny, lovely, charming, smart and amazing! He nailed it for his age. Wonderful job of the director and himself too. Sanada is another of my fave actors and must admit his role here is very strong (I still believe there was a symbolism there between his story & Sherlock's case in this film that once more...can't spoil). Hattie as Ann is another strong character with a background story that will make you cry and understand that humans are hard to understand. #truethat. Anyway, loved also Frances de la Tour (for a short role, was one that really made me laugh and smile for real. Loved it).Now the only thing I did not like as a fan of music based on ACD/Sherlock Holmes, was that...and by that is the music score. Is not awful coz since this Sherlock is older, needs a music that is as he is: older. But sometimes there was no music...very mute. And that is sometimes lovely coz silence works perfectly, but on a film like this, music was needed the most.So yes, I recommend this movie to all SHERLOCK HOLMES & CONAN DOYLE FANS! To all the fans of the one who wrote the book this movie was based (not ACD obviously, but still, recommend it) and don't worry, coz if you need Mycroft, Hudson, or the Watsons, check out the novels/stories, films, comics, mangas, animes based on it with them included or SHERLOCK BBC! (better than ''Elementary'' series, sorry, is the truth). - Sept. 2nd, 2015 review. ;D",

Otherwise, he looks after bees in his house in the country. In return, he is looked after by Mrs. Munro(Laura Linney) and her young son Roger(Milo Parker). That's because he has deep concerns about his memory, as he tries to recall his last case.Grounded by a masterful lived-in performance from Ian McKellen, \"Mr. Holmes\" has a deceptively complex story structure, namely combining several different stories and mysteries seamlessly. To that effect, the movie makes special use of time, moving backwards and forwards at will. For this deeply humanized version of the venerable character whose time has not yet completely passed him by, what matters most is setting the record straight before it is too late.",

    "review": "  This may not be a great film, but at least it fits the character ofSherlock Holmes better than Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes universe whereHolmes is treated like a superhero rather than a detective. SherlockHolmes was never meant to be an action hero, and this film brings thecharacter back to a story with a style that actually makes sensecompared to the original source material by Arthur Conan Doyle.However, to me at least, this film doesn't feel like most SherlockHolmes stories since it deals with a Holmes (played by Mckellen) thatis struggling with his memory since he is very near the end of hislife, and rather than solving a case he is trying to remember a case hehad. The basic premise of the film is that he wants to write one of hisstories from his own point of view rather than the stories that comefrom Dr. Watson's point of view that just \"get things wrong\" accordingto this aging Holmes.This film is a little ambitious as it tries to tackle three differentstories simultaneously. There is the case he is trying to remember, acase or situation that deals with a man from Asia which I didn't reallyunderstand the point of, and then there is the present where Holmes istrying to form a positive relationship with his housekeeper and herson. Unfortunately the only story with a clear climax is the story withthe housekeeper's son, and it isn't as dramatic as a climax should bein my opinion.As for Mckellen, he does a fine job as usual, but to me it seems to bea performance as an aging man moreso than a performance as SherlockHolmes. Perhaps I am just used to Sherlock Holmes being a middle-agedman.This is a film that definitely has a style fitting for the character ofSherlock Holmes, but it is not one of the most interesting recentstories focusing on the famous detective.",

But if the film really only exists as \"Bill Condon's Greatest Hits,\" it's helped enormously by him bringing back Laura Linney and Ian McKellen from his past efforts, and by pulling off the unlikely feat of finding a child actor who can hold his own against both of them. Not hugely exciting, but accomplished and pleasant.",

I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan since I can remember. I have watched a lot of different types of shows on PBS. This is a very different type of Sherlock Holmes story, but if you like this type of thing you will enjoy. It's not violent but there are a few somewhat scary scenes, therefore, I wouldn't recommend it to any children younger than 11. I'm not sure if most children would like it. There is a boy in the movie who is really good so I think that helped to make it interesting for our son. As I write this, my husband & our son are watching the 1st Benedict Cumberbatch PBS show and they didn't even tell me! I guess we have a new Sherlock Holmes fan in the house!",

    "review": "  I've seen a lot of different versions of Sherlock Holmes. The original version from the books, him as a teenager in Young Sherlock, fighting alongside Batman in Batman: The Brave and the Bold and him in modern times in Sherlock and Elementary. I have even seen him in the future in Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century. But I have never seen him as an old man. And this film makes me wonder why. I have always seen Sherlock Holmes as this larger than life character. However, Ian McKellen's version here is a vulnerable aging man, and it feels more real that way. This movie is not nearly as thrilling as most other recent adaptations of Holmes, but it is instead subtle and touching.",

The case presented for an aging Sherlock played wonderfully by Ian Mckellen is not as thrilling as some of the other cases we have seen sherlock solve in the past. Nevertheless the movie manages to be entertaining as the aging sherlock aspect is something different and watching sherlock struggle with memory loss and his interactions with the housekeeper and his son Roger set it apart from the other sherlock holmes movies/tv shows.

It is slow burn drama but it has its charm and wicked humor, this is more of traditional old school Sherlock Holmes than recent invention of Sherlock Holmes character (ex, from BBC's Sherlock to CBS Elementary and to the movie form of Sherlock Holmes, starting Robert Downey Jr.)To those who likes the recent take on Sherlock Holmes character, you might be having hard time getting into the film where as for those who has open minded on the character will find this film refreshing and entertaining. I had good time watching it and love the chemistry between Sir Ian McKellen and Milo Parker, who played Sherlock Holmes and Roger in the film. This isn't must see film now but if there is showing in your local theater and if you have curiosity of this film, it surely is worth to check it out.",

It was a winning bet. Ian McKellen steals the show, barely, from youngster Milo Parker who plays the son of Holmes's housekeeper. Their onscreen relationship crackles. The action, although subdued, never flags. Several stories are told across more than one timeline and each engrosses us. The mysteries work well, but, surprisingly, the story by its end has Holmes confronting his lifelong cerebral style - AND reinventing himself. This was a very satisfying break on a vacation trip.

The film is about him starting to lose his memory since he's in his 90's now. He is also trying to remember some details about the last case he worked on that led him to retire. The film shows events at the current time, flashbacks to his last case, and a few flashbacks to a recent trip he took to Japan. Ian McKellen does a great job as the older version of the title character. I like the relationship he had with his housekeeper's son who looks up to Sherlock. The film moves along a little slowly at times and is nothing too spectacular but it is still a good film. I give it 3.5/5.",

    "review": "  \"Mr. Holmes\" takes an unexpected look at the famous detective, forgoing the usual idiosyncrasies and stereotypes associated with his character for a more down-to-Earth sleuth. As a 93-year-old man chasing the ghost of his last case, Sherlock Holmes bears not the brash wit of Robert Downey, Jr. nor the eccentric brilliance of Benedict Cumberbatch; instead, Ian McKellen portrays the \"real\" Sherlock Holmes-- a man trying to live honestly in spite of his embellishment.Years past the life in his Baker Street flat, Holmes lives with a housekeeper and her son in the countryside. Unfortunately, their narratives compete against Holmes's story, with the movie's obvious attempts to share unrelated events about the boy's father, mom's work situation, etc. The housekeeper's son is a nice touch as an aging Sherlock's \"sidekick\", and there are a few endearing moments shared between this generational gap; however, too much time was given to this relatively uninteresting context. This affected the pacing as well-- the movie unnecessarily dragged, in part due to this switching back to add more information on boy-and-mother. The other major part resulted from a separate flashback of when Sherlock recently visited Japan. While the transitioning between Japan and his old case flashbacks did not, in themselves, hamper the narrative (in fact, I found the complete opposite), the juggling between essentially three stories at once strained the movie as a whole.And though this movie did exactly what it set out to do, which was to humanize Sherlock Holmes, one could argue that they perhaps went too far in making him ordinary. Understandably, his age has him far removed from the energy of an active detective, and yet the small doses shown of his intelligence did not seem to adequately convey the oddly brilliant man he was decades earlier. Rather, \"tired weakness\" is the louder motif surrounding a fading Holmes: just a simple aging man. To make an uncommonly bright man so common is to deprive him of his genius, and thus, makes this version Sherlock Holmes curious, but less interesting. Even so, a solid performance awaits those whose curiosity is patient enough.",

    "review": "  Subtle, easy-going, and charming, Mr. Holmes is a pleasant diversion which will cater to certain crowds turned off by most summer fare. Largely playing like a glacially-paced BBC television movie (it was produced by BBC) the plot revolves around an elderly Sherlock Holmes living in the country, suffering with memory loss, befriending an intellectually curious young boy, tending bee hives, and occasionally having flashbacks. That's pretty much it. And that's all it really needs to be. I would be remiss not to compare this to Still Alice, which also features a protagonist with genius level intellect succumbing to Alzheimer's despite their mental tricks and stubborn refusal to surrender. (Though this is far less depressing.) A significant theme in Mr. Holmes is reality vs. myth, as Holmes tries to distinguish himself from the heavily fictionalized version with mixed results, while trying to desperately remember his last case and why he retired from his chosen profession. This is Sir Ian McKellen's show without question and an example of how excellent character acting and star power can hold most films afloat. He fits into the character like a glove and he easily could have played Sherlock Holmes decades ago, or his spiritual grandson James Bond. The flashbacks to the last case and post-war Hiroshima were interesting and the film's ending managed to complete any lingering character arcs in a way most movies utterly fail. An excellent rental or download to watch on a calm, relaxed evening with a glass of wine.",

    "review": "  Even though I'm a life long fan of Sherlock Holmes (both books & Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce movies) I entered this movie with no preconceptions. As a result, I was rewarded with a well acted, smartly written warm & touching drama. Ian McKellan as the aged Holmes is superb. Still possessing many of the extraordinary talents that made him a master sleuth... the film deals with a man trying desperately to hold on to his faculties in order to solve his last case. The chemistry between McKellan & Milo Parker as the young Roger is warm & entertaining without being sappy. The only weakness is Laura Linney (who I love) but is a little wooden in her role. All in all an entertaining film.",

There's nothing inherently bad about it at all and it is a solid acting vehicle for McKellan. The problem is that it's so lightweight and simple that it really has no lasting power. You'll enjoy it while you are in the theater but there's not a scene that you'll really remember and say \"oh yeah, that's the thing I liked most about that film.\" This is the film that you'll have playing for your grandparents in the background while you do other stuff and there's nothing particularly bad about that. Still, it's solidly done, well acted and thoughtful in the third act at least (it's never really clear what point it is trying to make until that part) that you won't regret watching it at all but you don't need to rush and see it.",

Holmes is living in rural England and has failed some years on a case that has left him questioning his awesome powers and \"logic\". With the help of his housekeeper's (Laura Linney slightly struggling with a rural British accent) son he unravels the mystery and learns that logic does not always tell the whole story. Well acted and a pleasure to watch.....this is a BBC Films production. Ian McKellen resembles that other grand dame of the British theatre Sir John Gielgud but he breathes new life, humour and heart into one of literature's and now film's most popular characters.",

With apologies to Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch, Ian McKellan turns in a most extraordinary performance as Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic detective in Mr. Holmes. It's absolutely magnificent. This is Holmes at 93 years-old, struggling with a failing memory and living out his years on a farm in Sussex, where he tends to bees and relies on the services of a widowed cook (Laura Linney) and her 14-year-old son, Roger (Milo Parker), an aspiring sleuth. In flashbacks we see Holmes dealing with his final case and dealing with a married woman (Hattie Morahan) who may have been the love of his life. McKellan reunites with director Bill Condon, who teamed up superbly on Gods and Monsters. Once again they deliver a fascinating, riveting character study of a lion in winter, not going gently into the night. Hopefully Oscar is paying attention.",

    "review": "  Charming \"little\" movie, about as British as one can imagine, down to the English gardens and the frequent shots of the white cliffs of Dover. This is marginally a story of detection, but the clues are to be found in the retired detective's fading memory. Which is the main complaint I had: for a story that dwells, methinks a bit too long and tiresomely, on the fact of the great man's onrush of senility (named, indeed, by the man himself), how is it that suddenly he's up and about and able to solve the problem and rescue the boy (spoiler, sort of)? I'm not an expert, but if he's been so bad off that he has to write people's names on his French cuff, it seems unlikely that he'd be able to recover. Oh well, quibbling is almost as much fun as detecting, and not nearly so hard as writing a satisfying script. Condon delivers a beautiful film, with lovely performances by McKellan and Linney and newcomer tyro Milo Parker.",

This movie finds him in the twilight of his life, living in the countryside in England after he goes into a self-imposed exile following a disturbing case. In the movie, Holmes (Ian Mckellen) lives with his housekeeper (Laura Linney) and her precocious son. Holmes forms a bond with the boy, much to Linney's dismay. I found this movie to be authentic and heartfelt. Though the characters are presented as a bit overdramatic, the director paints a nice picture of what Holmes would have been like in his later years, reclusive but witty. We are given flashbacks in the movie to time he spent in Japan following the end of the war and his final case that caused his self-imposed exile. It involves a woman who was unhappy in her marriage and was plotting to murder her husband. Holmes comes in and tries to show her the light. I thought the script in this film was smart, and the directing is equally smart. McKellen fits the bill for an older Holmes perfectly, and this film is a very good character study ------------------------------------------------------------------- B+",

In addition, I am not a huge Holmes fan so there's too much i didn't understand and missed the nuances. Holmes is an interesting approach to Sherlock Holmes. He is old and retired and lives in the english country side. He is remorseful and very lonely. He lives alone with his housekeeper and her child. Holmes is also suffering from dementia and cannot remember things but still happens to have memories of a case that pretty much ruined his life. The story is pretty much a reconstruction of this case peppered with some family experiences. The movie is well acted and it's certainly interesting but it's also punchless and a bit boring at times.

Then comes a time when the great Sherlock Holmes no longer consults and he is desperately trying to salvage his dying memory power through rumored cures and cuffs of shirts. This isn't a conventional Sherlock Holmes movie or tale. This is more like an epilogue to one of the most celebrated minds in solving crimes. It talks about how the man struggles to accept the fact that his mental faculties are dying. He wants them alive to recount the last case he ever had. The reason he stopped being a detective. As he looks for ways to jog his memory we experience this unusual tale much like the life of a retired super hero. The movie has an even pace and Ian Mckellan is sublime.

This very nearly became one of those occasions but I clung on to consciousness in the hope that it would be justified in the end. And thank God that I did because, had I succumbed, I would have missed a truly virtuoso performance by the wonderful Ian Mckellen as an ageing Sherlock Holmes facing the onset of dementia and memory loss as he struggles to recall the details of his last case that caused him to become a virtual recluse. It really is one of those period dramas that only the English can pull off. Mackellen is aided by a stellar performance from the hugely under-rated Laura Linney as his long-suffering housekeeper and a quite stunning big screen debut by Milo Parker as her son.

    "review": "  On a recent episode of WNYC's \"Studio 360,\" actor Ian McKellen (best known, to mainstream audiences, for his roles as Gandalf in \"The Lord of the Rings\" series and Magneto in the \"X-Men\" films, but also a very accomplished stage actor) stated that, ever since working with director Bill Condon on \"Gods and Monsters,\" he has always been prepared to say \"yes\" to anything that Condon might propose. And so we now find him starring as an aged (over 90!) Sherlock Holmes in the director's new project. One can certainly understand McKellen's attraction to the part - it's such an iconic character, and what actor wouldn't relish the opportunity to portray Holmes as his vaunted powers of deduction are fading? - and he most certainly does shine. It's a shame that the movie, itself, however, is not better. Perhaps it's Condon's experience working on the final two \"Twilight\" films that have reduced his appreciation for complexity, or maybe the terrific \"Gods and Monsters\" was a one-off. Who knows? What we do know is that while \"Mr. Holmes\" offers a wonderful showcase for McKellen, it doesn't offer much else.Which is too bad, as the premise offers such promise. We meet Holmes in 1947, as he returns from a trip to Japan, where he had hoped to discover a cure for his memory loss. Imagine Holmes - the great detective - unable to hold on to the simplest of details, such as the names of the people he knows! He returns to his estate, to which he retired after World War I, after a tragic end to what would be his final case left him traumatized. Now he just takes cares of his bees, and is a burden to his housekeeper, Mrs. Munro - played by the usually reliable Laura Linney (\"Hyde Park on Hudson\"), who here, unlike her co-star, does not, sadly, shine - who wishes she didn't have to play nursemaid on her meager salary. But she has a young son - played by the excellent newcomer Milo Parker - and the boy's interest in what the famous, if decrepit, sleuth has to teach him provides a way in (or back) into Holmes's memories, allowing the old man to finally solve the one mystery that eluded him. As I said, it's a great premise.Unfortunately, the story is told in an extremely heavy-handed fashion, with the director constantly underlining every single emotional beat. The flashbacks are clunky, and we see the truth of the failed case long before Holmes does. What works, however, is the marvelous interplay between the detective and his apprentice, and some great surprises lurk inside that storyline. I wouldn't call it a complete wash, then - and fans of McKellen should enjoy - but it so often painfully misses its mark that we can't help but regret the film that might have been.",

    "review": "  Mr. Holmes stars the great Ian McKellen as the legendary detective Sherlock Holmes. Holmes is now in his 90s and is trying to document his final case from more than 30 years ago. His memory however is not what it once was and is failing him which makes him struggle as he realizes that he may not learn what caused him to give up the profession he loved so much. This isn't like other Sherlock Holmes stories of late. It's not as exciting and compelling, it's more human, more down to earth. And quite interesting at that.Things I Liked:Ian McKellen. Ian McKellen is a subject of which I am terribly biased, being that he is my favorite actor that I have ever seen. But this role, he takes it and owns it. He plays two different men almost 30 years apart. And his work as a disgruntled 90+ year old man is stunning in contrast to his work as someone closer to his actual age. The physical changes, the personality changes, the way you see the weariness of the man after all that time, and then you truly see why that age and weariness has hit him. It's a very different Sherlock, but it is a brilliant Sherlock and one that is especially interesting in that it is unique and untouched before.Milo Parker. Milo, plays Sherlock's young friend Roger. He is son to Holmes' housekeeper and is very interested in Holmes work. The two form a friendship and learn from each other but also have struggles and fights and truly have human moments. It's Holmes coming to terms with himself and it really is a human story but it's the work of Parker, who makes those connections and really plays the contrast to the old weary Holmes, with his young enthusiastic Roger, that makes both characters pop off the screen and exceed expectations.The Main Plot. The plot of this thing is so unique and interesting because we've come to see Holmes as almost a 19th century superhero, so to make him fallible and human and completely flawed as the rest of us really shows him in a new light. It reminds us that the best characters are flawed and interesting and the ways the story does that is incredibly compelling. I really enjoyed that work of the actors but the plot also drives Holmes to come to terms with himself in his old age and learn that he too is not beyond human.Things I Didn't Like as Much:The Japanese Subplot. There is this other story of Holmes going to Japan to get a special herb for his memory. And it could have been removed and detracted nothing from the rest of the story. It only interrupts the plot and shows us little more of Holmes than we've already seen from the rest of the movie. It's only a nitpicky thing really because I didn't find much wrong or bothersome with the movie. It was a really great piece.Overall. Overall the movie is brilliant. McKellen gives a phenomenal performance and it carries the movie brilliantly. The ensemble only boost what McKellen is already doing and the movie pops as a result. The plot is new in yet reminds us of why we enjoy Sherlock Holmes so much. The entire film was a very refreshing work and it reminds me why Ian McKellen is one of the actors I truly respect and admire in this profession. The film is fantastic. Need I say more.",

    "review": "  There were a couple of seemingly interesting movies that came out over the weekend. Could only see one and had totake a sneak look at some of the ratings/metrics on line.Clearly \"Mr. Holmes\" had sizable likability lead over \"Southpaw\" (which I really wanted to see) and \"Paper Towns\".I saw the previews for \"Mr. Holmes\" a number of times andreally didn't grab me as I'm not a Sherlock Holmes guy. Yet teh engaging, captivating face filled with endlesswrinkles of Sir Ian McKellen tells a great story (a la JK Simmons in \"Whiplash\".Holmes is very old in this film and lives in the countryin retirement being cared for housekeeper/nurse/cook everythingMrs. Munro played by the terrific \"Laura Linney\" and her sonRoger. Roger, under age 10, is highly inquisitive in life andfascinated by the investigative gifts of Mr. Holmes.Mr. Holmes'a memory is failing him and he is well aware of it.With his lifes' finish line in sight, he is desperate to rememberthe details of his last case some 20-30 years ago. He needs to close that case by simply remembering the details of the case. With sidekick Roger ably helping him, they quest to unearthdetails and results of the long past dormant case.So yes the film goes back and forth in time and yes a bit(not much) confusing. And maybe the story of the film isn'tso compelling. Rather we get to watch aniconic actor, yes iconic, own the screen yet very willingly share the screen enthusiastically with Roger. Yesthey uncover details, but we learn much more about their relationship, their care for each other and the importance of each in each others lives.The role of bees & bee tending is a wonderful threadthrough this beautifully filmed movie. I have no ideahow old Mr. McKellen is, looks like 90 in this flick,and you owe yourself a movie trip to see this specialactor. He is a gem!",

    "review": "  This is a delightful little movie, done in the inimitable British style, about Sherlock Holmes (Ian McKellen), suffering from holes in his memory as he ages, feeling guilty about a case in which he failed. Now he wants to come to terms with it but he can't remember all the details of the case. With the help of his housekeeper's son, Roger (Milo Parker), he starts to piece the past together. The script is excellent, especially the dialogue between Holmes and Roger that explores themes of friendship and mentoring between the aged and the young. McKellen is outstanding as Holmes and Parker plays the boy very well. The cinematography of the English countryside is very pleasing on the eye. MR HOLMES is a fresh take on the Sherlock Holmes character. Overall, though, the movie is quite old-fashioned and has none of the darker aspects or emotional thrills of Holmes's character and stories found in other tellings. It's also pretty slow in pace. But it is a pleasant, undemanding piece of cinema - enjoyable.",

    "review": "  \"The man beyond the myth\" reads the tagline for this dramatic take on Baker's Street famous detective, and it couldn't be more accurate. Eschewing the superhuman investigative skills and talent for hand-to-hand combat that modern Sherlock audiences are familiar with, this version instead focuses on an elderly Holmes (Ian McKellan) filled with regret and guilt. Traveling along multiple storylines - delicately woven together by screenwriter Jeffrey Hatcher - Mr. Holmes finds the ex-sleuth pondering his retirement of 35 years, subsequently unravelling an emotional mystery he had long repressed. Although letting the pace slip in the flabby middle section, filmmaker Bill Condon's careful shot construction wisely ensures the attention is firmly on his 76-year-old star, whilst also highlighting the stunning period detail. Condon is aided by the glorious sun-soaked cinematography of Tobias A. Schliessler and a stirring score from Carter Burwell, the two combining to create a delightful, almost celestial atmosphere. Inevitably though, this movie belongs to the one and only Ian McKellan. As a curmudgeonly nonagenarian taking a final stab at redemption, McKellan strikes an impeccable balance between annoying old codger and lovable, heartbroken grump; ultimately delivering a majestic performance to absolutely relish. Those looking for the crime-centric thrills of Cumberbatch's TV Sherlock or the action-packed nature of Downey Jr's big budget Sherlock should be warned: this is as far removed from those incarnations as possible. Those seeking an intelligent, contemplative tale of late-life concerns with a masterful central turn and emotional resonance, you've come to the right place.",

    "review": "  Mr. Holmes presents us with a very different Sherlock Holmes than we're used to. We've seen him as suave, grungy, and very prickly, but we've never seen him at his most vulnerable and frail, standing on death's door and looking back on everything he's done. This forces the audience to confront their own fears about mortality, guilt, and even losing themselves to senility. While all of this is going on, we are treated to scenes of Holmes' past as he tries to piece together the details of his last case, which have escaped him with age.Ian McKellen is right at home as Sherlock Holmes, capturing the wisdom, gruffness, and even grandfatherly wisdom that's come with age. I am very grateful that they didn't get a younger actor to play him in the flashbacks, instead using McKellen throughout with varying degrees of makeup. Another refreshing bit was that they didn't feel the need to bog down the film with references to Holmes' past works. I do enjoy my continuity nods, but I'm glad that the film was able to let the legend of Sherlock Holmes stand on its own. I'll also say that it is very refreshing that there's a quieter and more slow-paced film amongst the string of high paced action movies. It knows how to take its time and make the race against Sherlock's end just as engaging as a race against a countdown. It may not be the Sherlock you're used to, but still one deserving of your time.",

    "review": "  Featuring the perfectly cast Ian McKellen as Sherlock Holmes, this version of the great detective eschews the rapid fire observations and verbose wit for a portrait of an old and reclusive Holmes at the end of his life. The movie is built primarily around the mystery of one particular case. Sherlock finds himself unable to remember the details of his last case as he fights a losing battle with Alzheimer's. That plot line runs alongside that of his house keeper (Laura Linney) and her son (Milo Parker). It is Parker who almost steals the show as Sherlock's eager and eventual sidekick. Still, it is McKellan's textured performance that provides much of the film's foundations to explore deeper emotional ground. With his strong on-screen presence, he is able to pull off the intellectual superiority of a younger Sherlock still on top of his game and switch breathlessly to the old and clearly emotionally damaged recluse that we meet at the start of the film. Through him, the film is able to peel back the layers behind the man, showing that behind the brilliant logic that defines him, is also one tinged with regret and emotional vulnerability over the unsolvable mysteries of the human condition.",

    "review": "  Mr. Holmes Initial Reaction: Elementary, my dear Watson (sorry, couldn't resist). Main Characters Sherlock Holmes: Yeah, that guy. He's played by Ian McKellen. Roger: He's a boy played by Milo Parker.Plot Summary It is Holmes's twilight years - he's getting up there in age. So, he heads out to his bee farm while under the care of a woman and her son, Roger.  Holmes and Roger instantly strike up a liking to one another, so Holmes tells him about his very last case.  Holmes's last cast involves a man who thinks his wife is being manipulated by others, and he wants to find out what's going on. But Holmes is losing his marbles (so to speak), so recalling the details of the last case is hard to do. He has trouble recalling names. And he's not in perfect physical condition, either. But even with those limitations, he still has the power of deduction, and with the help of Roger, get the truth about his last case out into the open.SCORINGMain Characters This is one side of Holmes that doesn't get much light; he's much more emotional and fragile than any other Holmes before him. It makes for a very likable character. And I like Roger as the kid who wants to follow in Sherlock's steps. SCORE: 9Other Characters Rogers Mother is great as the woman who has to keep everything on an even keel, and the characters in Holmes's last case are intriguing to say the least.  But there's part of the film where he meets up with a Japanese guy to get medicine for his ailing mind - whom I found to be not needed. SCORE: 8Plot The plotline involving Holmes's stay at the bee farm is great as is his last case. But the film (for me) goes a bit off the rails when Holmes visits Japan to get that cure for his ailing mind. I felt that was just padding. SCORE: 7Originality This Sherlock differentiates itself from the others by having Holmes show more emotion - and say that it's not just the evidence that solves cases, but what you do with said evidence. SCORE: 8Violence Factor There's not much violence in the film, but insects sting someone - a lot. And there are a few falls and such. But any crimes investigated don't get too intense. SCORE: 8Other Moral Issues This film does a good job of showing that aging isn't for wimps, but it can be overcome with help from others like family (or in this case a kid and his mother). SCORE: 9Final Score (out of 60): 49 % Score: 81.67% Holmes does it again - even if years later he forgets that he did it again.",

    "review": "  Just watched a Sherlock Holmes movie with my parents, where my dad actually didn't fully understand it, but I did and was able to explain it fully. Never felt prouder as a filmmaker.The central message of the film is that as human beings, we cannot rely solely on logic for solutions. There is not a more powerful way to convey this than hearing it from the greatest detective, a man of logic and evidence who didn't respect \"fiction.\" The main plot of the movie, as it is written on the imdb page, is to see Holmes grapple an unresolved case. It isn't that Holmes was unable to depict all the facts and motives of the case - he did - but that he doesn't understand why the woman killed herself even after their \"resolving\" talk that got her rid of the poison and disrupting matters in her life. My dad, also a man of sole logic, did not comprehend it either. My explanation is that Holmes first thought he did not actually succeed at the case in that he missed a detail and did not foresee her future (literally and figuratively), which filled him with \"guilt and useless, worthless feelings\" that eventually led him to his retirement. He finally admitted that human emotions are some things logic can not explain, and realized that that was what was missing in his detective work. His decline in acknowledging that feelings exist and are inexplicable things led him to his loneliness, which was visually illustrated as he declined the woman's offer to \"be alone together\" because he was \"fearful.\" Emotions were not something he understood, and naturally people fear what they don't know. After Roger's incident, where he bursted with emotions - something we never see anywhere else in the movie except the end - he came to embrace emotions and acknowledged that fiction, when used to account for someone's emotions, is... eh, not that bad! So he concluded his business with Mr Umezaki with his first fiction to comfort the man.There is a lot of camera movement in the film. Mostly dolly reveal shots and truck shots where a lot of obstacles are in between the character and the camera. Ann's most important line to Holmes and in the movie was something along the lines of \"the dead are just on the other side of the wall.\" A term filmmakers use to describe flamboyant, frequent camera movements as such is \"self-conscious.\" The camera is self-conscious and is constantly peeking from behind a wall with the dolly reveal shots and following characters horizontally with obstacles between them...hhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmm need I say more?Besides the macro shots which are obviously calls to attend the details since it is a Sherlock Holmes movie, there are a lot of close-ups of Holmes' face. The modern technology allows us to see every little detail on his wrinkly face, something that even made me stare and think \"wow, technology.\" Why is that so interesting for us to look at? I'm sure I'm not the only one who stares intently when we see something super high-definition (think back to the last time you were in a Costco or Best Buy looking at the new 4K TVs). Following the film's theme, my answer to that is: I don't know, it's also something logic can't explain. It just provides a new perspective. On the contrary of the close-ups, there are several times when it got cut to Medium Shots, followed by Long Shots very quickly, once again making the film self-conscious by letting you see the edits, but also giving you a breather visually and mentally. this is once again my immediate spurt right after the movie, so i'm sure i'm missing a lot of other schtuff. but that's it for now, peace out holmie!

It stars Ian McKellen, Laura Linney, and Milo Parker along with Hiroyuki Sanada and Hattie Morahan.Mr. Holmes treks the long Journey endured by Sherlock Holmes (Ian McKellen) to remember his last case and why his partner and friend Watson changed the ending entirely. As his memory fades away he travels to japan in search for something that can hold his mind together until he can finish writing down the true story behind his last case. This leads him to befriend the housekeeper's(Laura Linney) son, Roger(Milo Parker).Wow! This movie is so emotional and endearing that you can't help but get absorbed into the plot. Usually this is a negative but this movie has no three act system and strongly benefits because of this. Since there are so many flashbacks, if there had been a 3 act system the movie wouldn't have been as great as it is. Ian McKellen delivers a subtle, intelligent, and overall beautiful performance as the title character. McKellen is, so far, in the lead for Best Actor and strongly deserves it. Milo Parker gives a genuine performance as the son of the housekeeper who wants to achieve more that his mother wants him to. Second to the performances is the writing. It is so fresh and inventive that most of the twist were completely unpredictable. My only issue with the movie is the pacing. Part can be blamed on the underwhelming soundtrack and part can be blamed on the director's willingness to stretch a scene to oblivion. With that said Bill Condon and Ian McKellen work magically together as evidenced by Gods and Monsters, so Cordon's efforts in this movie can be excused.As a whole I really enjoyed Mr. Holmes but don't think I'll rewatch it for at least a few years. Nevertheless Mr. Holmes is great and gets a A or a 9/10",

McKellen is solid, though, as usual. And the make-up is great. Laura Linney, however, cannot save a thankless role - every time her character was on screen, the movie lost what little life it had.",

The story revolves around an unsolved mystery and Mr.Holmes struggling with alzheimer's trying to pen down his last assignment .... Hoping that the Prickly Ash from Japan would slow down his memory loss so he could finish his final book was of little use.... Camaraderie between Holmes and Roger develops with Holmes passing on his investigative skills to Roger..... Overall amazing performances and worth a watch !!!",

    "review": "  I have no choice but to wax rhapsodic about \"Mr. Holmes.\" It delights visually and musically, charming with details as intimate as a desk drawer and expansive as the gleaming white Cliffs of Dover. But what sets the film apart is where it dares to explore. It's no spoiler to reveal that its narrative is almost entirely from the point of view of a very elderly, very vulnerable Sherlock Holmes. Even at a glance its movie poster demonstrates there is strength still even in the frailty of advancing age. But this Mr. Holmes is also keenly aware, even as awareness itself seems to fail him, that he is at a crossroads both in history and within himself. Sir Ian McKellen here redefines the detective, transforming him (with the aid of all too realistic makeup) not only through age but with experience into more than a few, very different, distinct incarnations of the same character. What all these performances within one have in common is a sleuth who must deduce secrets he has kept even from himself. Sherlock confronts within a villian whose crime is no less one of the heart for its lack of passion. It is a stunning portrait of intellect becoming wisdom, of truth tempered by what is truly held most dear. It must be said that it is \"Mr. Holmes\" writing (by Mitch Cullin and Jeffrey Hatcher) that has given McKellen and all its fine actors (Milo Parker, Laura Linney, & Hiroyuki Sanada) such substance to work with. It is the very stuff 'that dreams are made on' and it works as the human mind itself does. Living as much in memory and on assumption as it does in the present moment, each informing regret and guiding desire carrying the other forward through actual time. This, very much as the director, Bill Condon, has skillfully guided \"Mr. Holmes.\" It is all their gifts that has given us a mystery most satisfying to solve, revealing and reveling in one's own heart and heart's own.",

    "review": "  The most brilliant mind to have ever existed in the fictional arena has been portrayed by several actors in their own distinct styles and character adaptations. While the suave and cunning of Jeremy Brett in the TV show provided a sophisticated, calm yet sharp Sherlock Holmes in the prime of his career, Benedict Cumberbatch plays the protagonist of the younger Sherlock with more social awkwardness, arrogance and seriousness in an adaptation that is darker and more cryptic. On the bigger screen, Robert Downey Jr.'s detective was awkward but effective in the midst of the explosive action in Guy's period films. Now, Bill Condon ('Gods and Monsters') directs Sir Ian McKellen in an adaptation of A slight trick of the mind that views the life of the legendary sleuth well past his prime. This isn't the typically riveting thriller one would expect but a subtle insight into one of the greatest minds that is so engaging due to the performances that it feels like a biopic of a real person.  Holmes is now 93 years old and in the English countryside, he resides in a house along with a widowed housekeeper (Laura Linney) and her curious son, Roger (Milo Parker). On one hand, dementia and frailty have weakened Holmes and on the other, they have somehow given him renewed motivation to keep his sharp wit and to pursue his hobbies. Chief among them is beehiving and a determined investigation of the factors leading to a sudden death of multiple bees. Holmes then takes up to writing, mainly to disprove Dr. John Watson's fictional storylines of several cases and to find closure to his last case that forced him into retirement. The challenge is of course to write down the facts based on strands of memory. Then there is Holmes' recent trip to Japan to meet a fellow botanist, who would help him obtain the rare prickly ash, a plant that would help him fight his memory lapses. None of these threads are unsolvable mysteries by any measure. They are simply a part of an obsessive hunt for the truth that still lingers in the damaged mind of Sherlock Holmes. In a rare occurrence, the various threads of the story come together eventually, not to reveal the big suspense but to bring closure to a remarkable career. Holmes may have solved most mysteries with his mind and science of deduction but he couldn't quite uncover the truth about the unsolvable mystery of the human soul.  Sir Ian McKellen's portrayal of Holmes is almost effortless. It's as though the charm, the suave and the elegance of the old school detective just come naturally to him. As a reclusive, snappy and bluntly outspoken old Gentleman of 93 years, Sir Ian, who is 76 in reality, comfortably transitions to the younger character who was at the height of his career and popularity when he took on what would become his last case of Mrs Ann Kelmot. But the finest scenes are between Holmes and that farm boy Roger (Milo Parker) as they slowly but surely uncover the subtle mysteries of Ann's case and the outbreak among bees. Sir Ian acts as a mentor for the kid and theirs is a grandfatherly relationship in which they share little adventures and secrets. We instantly connect to both characters and that is a credit to the rich screenplay that gives them a variety of emotions and situations to perform in. Sir Ian's Holmes might not be the most popular but he does play it with more credibility and sincerity than most. It truly is a delight to watch such an accomplished and worthy actor step out of his fantasy adventures to portray a fictional character that now seems so real. He exposes the vulnerabilities of Holmes, his failures, his drawbacks and his weakest self. Ironically, it may well be Sir Ian's strongest performance. Milo Parker looks up to Sir Ian as a mentor in the same way his character looks up to Sherlock Holmes. He might be a farm boy but he is a budding detective in his mind and talent. Laura Linney as Roger's mother is remarkable in her role as well. Her dedication for her son's well being, her struggles with income and dismissal of Holmes' unabashed attitude make up for Mrs. Hudson's absence among characters.  Bill Condon certainly took a gamble when he decided to adapt the screenplay from a book that has Sherlock Holmes towards the end of his career when the world is obsessed with his young self. Yet, with an outstanding casting that included a masterful performance by Sir Ian McKellen, 'Mr. Holmes' ends up being a distinct take on our favourite sleuth that is as likeable as any other. It still has the wit, the complexity, the observations and the deductions that made each case an exciting one. This has an equal dosage of the outspoken, serious but weak side of the character in the elegant persona of a fine actor that is Sir Ian McKellen. 8.547 on a scale of 1-10.",

    "review": "  +I first became aware of Ian McKellen as a gay activist when he publicly came out against a law in England in 1988. I was aware of his being an admired stage British actor who occasionally made films and then, after he came out, I saw him in \"And The Band Played On\" and \"6 Degrees of Separation\" but it was 17 years ago in a movie called \"Gods and Monsters\", for which he won an Oscar nomination, that I was really impressed with him. The general movie going public came to know him as Gandalf in \"Lord of the Rings\" for which he received a second Oscar nomination. He is now regarded as one of the world's best actors and is widely known as a role model for the gay community all over.Now, 17 years after \"Gods and Monsters\", he is reunited with director Bill Condon to make \"Mr. Holmes\", a story about the real Sherlock Holmes at the age of 93, retired, looking at his last case which took place 27 years earlier. McKellan, in his 70s, plays Holmes at 93, 66 and 58 believable at all stages with a lot of help from make-up artist Dave Elsey, and his crew, along with the actor's movements at the different ages.This Sherlock Holmes is not the Sherlock Holmes you know, telling an admirer that it was Watson who fictionalized his character, giving him a deerstalker hat which he never wore and a pipe when he preferred a cigar, giving the readers a wrong address as to where he lived though the detective did and still has that precision and deductions that solved his mysteries and solves a present day situation. He is now a beekeeper in his old age along with following the search for 'prickly ash' to help him with his memory which is failing.Based on a screenplay by Jeffrey Hatcher from a book by Mitch Cullin (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who?) it revolves around Holmes, his housekeeper Mrs. Munro, played by Laura Linney, in a role she could have done in her sleep but doesn't, and her son Roger, (Milo Parker), who lost his father at a very young age, a clever somewhat precocious 10 year old who becomes devoted to Holmes and who Holmes comes to see as a remarkable child. There is a side trip story regarding Japan and a Japanese mother and her son whose husband/father abandoned them to serve England in the war, which really doesn't bring much to the movie. Another part of the screenplay is Holmes's last mystery with Patrick Kennedy as Thomas Kelmot who thinks his wife Ann, played by Hattie Morahan, is cheating on him. There is also Nicholas Rowe, who plays the fictional Sherlock Holmes in a film being watched by the 'real' Sherlock Holmes and in a wasted role Frances de la Tour as a eccentric music teacher.Ian McKellen is a delight to watch, Laura Linney, in a dark wig, is powerful in a brief scene near the end with him and Milo Parker has chemistry with McKellen but I found myself walking up the aisle, after the credits, giving it a one word review in my mind, 'disappointment', which may be my fault expecting too much from another pairing of Condon and McKellen.",

    "review": "  In other hands, Mr. Holmes could have been another boring period piece. But in the hands of Ian McKellen and Laura Linney, both among our finest actors, it never bored me to tears like many do. The story overall isn't the most interesting thing in the world until the end where everything really starts to connect but I really loved the relationship of Holmes and the little boy more than anything. McKellen made every scene interesting and you couldn't zone out because his voice is such a commanding presence on the screen that even if you don't care about what he's talking about, he has such a rhythm to his voice that is like music to your ears. Linney was a tad underutilized but made every scene worth her time like she usually can be expected to do. Milo Parker gave a great breakout performance as the little boy I was talking about. He is going to have an interesting career ahead of him. Bill Condon is a director I always find myself rooting for although his past 3 films were not the best on his resume (The Fifth Estate and the final two Twilight movies) but this joins the ranks of Dreamgirls as Condon's good work but not as great as his first couple like Gods and Monsters (with McKellen) and Kinsey (with Linney). I'm not a big Sherlock Holmes fan but that's the beauty of this movie. It isn't your normal Sherlock Holmes movie. The costumes, score, production design, and make up are all great and it definitely was received well by the older crowd I saw this movie with so I would recommend all ages to go see it.",

It is a charming little film that pleasantly portrays the great detective in his aging years. Ian McKellen is engaging, charismatic and captivating as the octogenarian investigator. Unfortunately, the film's story doesn't engage us nearly as much as the actors and cinematography. Holmes could have easily been a BBC Masterpiece/Mystery. It looks great, but nothing demonstrates that it is worthy of the large screen other than some great shots of the English countryside, including the cliffs of Dover. Milo Parker playing Roger, Holmes' young beekeeping apprentice, was fantastic. The child actor nearly matched McKellen in every scene. I don't think I have ever said this about a child actor before, but I hope we see him in more films with decent roles. Laura Linney is excellent, though her part was not always well written. The little mystery that is revealed in the film is clever and well thought out, but it didn't sustain the film. Rating: Matinee. The acting is top shelf. The scenery is fantastic, a reason to see the film. However the pacing and the plot don't always hold up to the large screen. ??Peace, Tex Shelters",

    "review": "  A true showcase piece for sir Ian McKellen and, to some degree, Laura Linney, MR. HOLMES is in many ways an interesting new sort of narrative in cinematic Sherlock Holmes literature. Those looking for the action and thrill that comes with other recent adaptations of Doyle's character (Guy Richie's movies or the BBC series) will be sorely disappointed. For me, this change was a positive, though. With declining health and fading memory, this version of Holmes is more vulnerable and relatable than an almost inhuman, paranoid super-genius (however fun that character may be). Director Bill Condon does his best to set up the movie as a final mystery for Holmes to solve: a mystery regarding his retirment from sleuthing. Although this may be an interesting premise, it is not really what is delivered. And sometimes that's okay. Although other times it does feel a bit misleading, disappointing, and / or sloppy [to set up a story one way and stray so drastically]. Susan Wloszczyna of the Chicago Sun Times may have put it best when she wrote, \"The case itself ultimately proves less an involving puzzle for the audience than a lesson for Holmes in humility\". The true talking points for this movie will no doubt be about how the need for humility is presented: the supposed conflict between emotional and intellectual/rational knowledge and whether one may respect others who reason differently. Further, whether one may relate to them. Or be a friend to them. There are very clear conclusions drawn by the film that line up well with contemporary critical pedagogies. Some will like this while others will not. I, myself, find many of the points legitimate (while still be a bit hesitant about how Holmes handled certain ethical dilemmas). What everyone will likely be more inclined to agree upon is McKellen's precise and touching performance. Ultimately, this movie seems to me to be a step in back in the right direction for Bill Condon, even if he is still working out some \"bugs\" left over from his Twilight days. MR HOLMES isn't quite as smart as other recent Holmes adaptations, but it is equally or more visceral, which - as the movie points out - is an important part of humanity.",

Unfortunately, this new film is nowhere near as good. Perhaps I'm just not a McKellen fan, but he always seems to be acting for the camera in every film, not just being someone real from the inside out. He's become this generation's John Gielguld with some Margaret Rutherford thrown in.Laura Linney is skillful as usual, although it's one of her drab roles, with a weird Irish working class accent that comes and goes. The film's third main character is a 10 year old boy. Since good child actors only come along once in a Jodie Foster or Haley Joel Osment lifetime, Milo Parker is just OK and at least not insufferable. Condon handles all the time shifts reasonably well, because the story jumps around a lot from London to Sussex to Japan with flashbacks, imaginary scenes and even dream sequences.This is trying to be a British film, but seems inauthentic. \"Downton Abbey\" territory is very familiar to Americans now, so any falsity gets magnified on the big screen. The technical aspects are all very professional with camerawork, music, production design & locations all well done. But what makes a film good is the writing, acting & directing and this film is a slog to sit through. If it had been streaming, I would have bailed 20 minutes in.

    "review": "  I am British born and an avid Sherlock Holmes fan. This period piece has great acting(especially Ian McKellen), scenery and props. However, I was expecting Holmes to solve a crime using his usual wits, intelligence and deductive prowess. Instead we see an old Holmes (now 93) keeping bees in the country, but having problems with his memory. The movie centers around him trying to restore his memory about two events that happened 35 years prior. We finally get the whole story through a series of flashbacks. Despite this superbly made film, I was disappointed by the lack of a new crime for him to solve. Also it dragged in places, except at the end. Tighter editing would have made it easier to watch. Enjoyable but not high on my list to see a second time.",

The film is really a character study of an ageing man struggling to live with himself after the people he loved has gone. While there are intertwining mysteries/plots in the narrative but their untangling and resolution is not really the point, as the film shows us that the biggest mystery is the human condition. To find me endearing to the child character and not ill-willing him a horrible fate meant something really worked for me here. It is not only well scripted but more importantly brilliantly acted by Ian McKellan and co. Yes, it is Still Sherlock but it is also a meditative film about the essence of humanity and human interactions.",

    "review": "  I think I put all the best Sherlock's in order, here we go: Nicholas Rowe is the young Sherlock. Jeremy Brett is and always will be the best Sherlock. Christopher Lee was the sharp Sherlock.Robert Downey Jr. was the action Hollywood version of Sherlock.Johnny Lee Miller was the american Sherlock.Benedict Cumberbatch is the modern day Sherlock.And finally Ian McKellen is the old Sherlock.Mr. Homes show's it's version of Sherlock Holmes is in his twilight years - but looking back on his long, storied career, there is still one case that eludes him and he will not rest until he can unravel its mystery.I was interested in the idea of a old Sherlock Holmes, I mean it's different from most Sherlock stories and I thought they doing that story were the old hero re-lives his past life by they work as they age effect's them to do it again, like those kind of stories, it worked before in the past with Batman and many more superheros or maybe villains if you want to reach that far. I thought it would work even when the movie's advertisements didn't really lock me in with the rest of the movie as the film just by looking at the posters or just the trailer, it did look a bit dull and one of those British TV drama's that most people would have skipped. After seeing the movie about a couple of days ago I can say that the movie wasn't all that good, this isn't the worst movie I've seen but it could have been a lot interesting when it came to characters and story.Ian McKellen as the old Sherlock was truly spot on for him. Ian McKellen not just nailed the role as Holmes but he played it like he's been playing it he's whole life. When have you seen a movie where Ian McKellen pulled off a bad performance, hmm let's see, never. He was both caring, sweet, funny and also cool as the old Sherlock. Now I may sound mean here but I must bring this up as Ian McKellen looks like a rotted corpse in this movie, well this Sherlock is 93 years old, yep you heard that right he's 93 years old and I think that's why but while watching the movie I thought to myself \"Good god, Ian age really dose show in this movie\". But beside's that Ian McKellen really did a great job in this movie playing the old Sherlock.The movie dose look stunning as everything is all bright and well a live. The cinematography was great, the other actors in the movie even the little boy that Sherlock hangs around with he did good and so did everyone else.But that's where the good stops there for me as this movie is kind of a mess with it's pasting and the lack of interest I had in this movie.Now for the problems and there's a lot: Nothing really exciting happens in this movie and I really do mean that. The whole movie is old Sherlock and the little boy and the boy ask Sherlock questions about he's past work and about other things and Sherlock explains to him, and it's all not very interesting. The movie dose cut to flashbacks of Sherlock in Japan for something to do with bees or something, I don't know I lost interest at that point. And the other flashback is kind of interesting as we get to see Sherlock solving a small mystery that I can't bring up or can't go into full detail because if you have full interest on seeing the movie and don't want things to be spoiled then your save here, but what I can bring up that doesn't end up spoiling it is that it involves a man who's worried about he's wife and she's acting a bit strange, so Sherlock takes interest in this case and tries to solve this mystery, oh and how the flashback ends is pretty funny and that's Sherlock stopping the story and saying to himself \"I can't remember the rest of it\". But here's the thing that's not the main focus of the movie, the real main focus is Sherlock staying at this mother and son house for some reason, well I did lose interest as I said before. The movie dose jump back and forward with only these two flashbacks and that's it, the rest of this movie is with the boy and Sherlock.The director of the movie Bill Condon who did such films as: Dream Girls, Gods and Monster's and the god awful failure known as Twilight: Breaking Sh*t Part 1&2. Yep the director of Twilight did this movie and no wonder it's a mess, the pasting is all over the damn place. The movie sometimes doesn't know what it what's to be, literally. Now Condon doesn't do a terrible job directing in this movie as these little touches of greatness in some scenes of the movie and could have been better then what we got, but in my opinion they really picked the wrong director for this movie as I really can't put together Bill Condon vision for this movie. Sorry Bill you can do better next time.There was one flaw I found in this movie that I bet nobody else is going to bring up as it doesn't bother them but it's a flaw that even I can't believe they overlooked and that's when Sherlock goes to see a film (Now this scene takes place around the 30's maybe, but anywhere) it's a film about him and he's watching it and of course it's in black in white, but I noticed the screen was HD quality and the sound was pitch perfected, now I have seen many movies from the 1930's and 1940's and the audio wasn't the best and you can't fault them for that as they were testing out the audio around that time as it was new to them, but in this I wished they would have at least tried to film that film that Sherlock was watching on a old black and white camera, it will show that they at least tried but not here as it comes off lazy. Now this wouldn't bother you as most people will let that pass, but for me it's a noticeable flaw and could have easily been fixed.Overall Mr. Holmes wasn't all that great to me. But who knows you may enjoy it and you can overlook those flaws and find something enjoyable in this forgettable film. As for me I'm sticking on what I said about this movie and how it could have been so much better then it was.",

    "review": "  \"I prefer cigars myself\".It's not unreasonable to assume a Sherlock Holmes film will be solely about his detective skills. It's expected even mandatory - that's who the character. But there is more to him and 'Mr.Holmes' takes on a far more detailed character approach than its contemporaries - BBCs and Guy Ritchie's Sherlock.It mainly takes place after 'Holmes' (Ian McKellen) has packed up and is now resigned to living in the country and tending to his bees. But a case from the past that he can't remember well haunts him. The trailers suggested something a bit different with it pointing to it being an unsolved case and one that he would go back to rather than it being a memory exercise. No, 'Mr.Holmes' isn't that, it's a look at Sherlock's personality, guilt, fear - it's a look at the man himself with the occasional flashback as he tries to remember the case that caused him to quit.He's looked after by a housekeeper (Laura Linney) and her son 'Roger' (Milo Parker) as well as visits from the local doctor. It's an interesting seeing 'Sherlock' in his old age and having that extra layer of the books being embellishments of his clothes and characteristics. With the man himself laughing at the notion of the deerstalker and the pipe. It adds something to everything - dismissing the usual image of Sherlock and replacing it with a more refined, believable one.There are some issues I have, it's fairly erratic at times with several story threads (or linked sort of) being looked at. Due to them being flashbacks, memories it can be hard to make sense of them all. And the fact that it culminates to him just remembering the facts, showing there wasn't much of a case there at all. The case ends with a bit of a wimpier. No the real strength lies in the dialogue, the interactions between characters and naturally with 'McKellen' the sublime acting. these people are as real as you'll ever see.'Mr.Holmes' often shows it's titular character as a deeply flawed one, something rarely, if ever seen. And thanks to a clever dismissal of the clich�d Sherlock look gives the character that extra layer of depth. This is most real Sherlock has ever felt to me. Partly because of 'McKellen' and partly because of the great writing. It does however lack something that is suggested and that's an actual case, to be precise the last case getting it through memories isn't enough - not to mention the disappointing ending and the constant jumping. There may be no mystery as such but the characterisation, dialogue and 3 central figures make it joy to watch.",

This tells the story of Holmes as an old man and an old case which was hard to solve and a reason why he became a recluse. See this only for Mckellens performance as the back and forth storyline jars. Roger the house keepers son is a revelation though",
