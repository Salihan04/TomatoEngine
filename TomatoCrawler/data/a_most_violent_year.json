    "review": "  An immigrant's business is threatened by crime just as he has over-leveraged his assets.Oddly, A Most Violent Year is one of the least violent movies I've seen in a long time, but that doesn't mean that it's not incredibly tense and compelling. Jaw-clenching Oscar Isaac and icy-staring Jessica Chastain make compelling scene partners, and this plot puts them through the ringer.The film has been favorably compared to the work of Sidney Lumet, one of American cinema's most underrated masters, and I can see why: both director J.C. Chandor and Lumet use long, slow shots, framed in shadowy backgrounds to subtly establish a pervasively sinister mood. Anything can happen in the threatening worlds of Chandor and Lumet, and even when it doesn't, there's the feeling that the characters have only temporarily escaped tragedy. This mood leads to what I think is one of the film's great sequences. It's a chase sequence in which Abel, Isaac's character, must run down a lead on who has been stealing his business's trucks. With most chase sequences, it's easy to tell how it's going to end - the plot event has to be resolved by the character either catching the prey or not - but in this sequence, even though we know that Abel will catch the guy, we don't know whether Abel will fall further from grace and become a murderer. This moment of unpredictability is masterfully built and becomes an example of how good films can take a familiar construct - the chase - and make it fresh and exciting.Overall, A Most Violent Year is a phenomenal film, and it solidifies Isaac and Chandor as two of our most promising talents.",

    "review": "  A meticulously constructed near-masterpiece about a dirty businessman (Oscar Isaac) who begins to see his empire collapse from under him, and he suspects those he does business with are primarily responsible for it. This is a period piece about a calm, quiet character who approaches everything with a clear mind despite being under immense pressure. Isaac's rock-solid, confident performance is the driving force behind this movie, as he is a presents a rare individual that is unlike anything we've seen from these kinds of stories. The last act of the film has a scene in it that encapsulates the movie's message as a whole, and its rare we see this kind of skill behind the camera from a gifted, fairly new big movie director like J.C. Chandor.",

    "review": "  \"When it feels scary to jump, that is exactly when you jump, otherwise you end up staying in the same place your whole life, and that I can't do\".After the impressively talkative Margin Call and the hypnotically silent All Is Lost, the third film from J.C. Chandor had a lot of expectations behind it. However, due to a misjudged marketing campaign, I think many people will be left disappointed with A Most Violent Year. It's doesn't have echoes of The Godfather as the trailer would have you believe but is, in fact, a leisurely and low-key criminal affair that will mostly appeal to those who are prepared for it's more personal story.Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is self-made businessman who is determined to expand his heating oil organisation. However, someone keeps hijacking his trucks costing him money and the trust of his local investors. Abel tries to deal with the situation lawfully and non-violently but his no-nonsense wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain) suggests he gets tougher on the gangsters and the unions around him before everything he's worked hard for comes crashing down.The title A Most Violent Year will mislead many when it comes J.C. Chandor's third film. It actually refers to the year (1981) in which it's set, whereby New York had an upsurge of violent crimes. This violence isn't necessarily relevant to the film itself and to know this beforehand may allow you to enjoy the film and it's methodical and meticulous approach all the more.Although this film should certainly not be compared to Francis Ford Coppola's Corleone saga, you can definitely see Oscar Isaac resembling a young Al Pacino. He plays his character with the same simmering intensity and intelligence and it's largely due to Isaac's towering performance that the film succeeds in being a mood-piece or a solid character study and less of a mob movie. It's not overly concerned with people getting 'whacked' or double-crossed but more concerned about business and how our struggling protagonist deals with things in a controlled and dignified manner despite his righteous indignation. It also doesn't help that his wife is the daughter of a Brooklyn gangster who feels the solution to every problem is a violent one. Keeping her in check is a constant problem, especially when it's played with such verve and dangerous passion by Jessica Chastain. Personally, I'd liked to have seen the leads among the Oscar contenders this year as the work they produce here, is some of their very best.As well as the performances, the film's look is equally impressive. Bradley Young's gorgeous, desaturated cinematography captures the feel for the time and the city of New York and (as some critics have already pointed out) echoes the gritty early work of Sidney Lumet. It manages to avoid the usual genre clichés and deliver a work of thoughtful suspense. It leaves you hanging and waiting for something to happen but resists the urge to tread a well worn path within the sub-genre and, as a result, succeeds in the very things that it doesn't do.In hindsight, if Chandor had chosen a different title then he might not have led many viewers into false expectations. However, this is a slow burner and if you resist the urge to judge the film before seeing it, you'll find it as stylish and refined as the camel-haired apparel that Isaac carries so gallantly.Mark Walker",

    "review": "  If you've seen A Most Violent Year, you'd have already realized the title barely adheres to what the movie is actually about- which is the American Dream, a theme now as old as time itself. Revolutionized in The Godfather and proving it's longevity in Scarface, the subject of the American Dream in film is indeed a popular one. A Most Violent Year is about Tony Montana's boring distant cousin Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) and his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) residing in the New York/ New Jersey area, also trying to carry out his own version of the American Dream. A Most Violent Year is the maverick of American Dream/ gangster movies: Abel Morales is an honorable family man who runs an oil heating company. His wife and the company lawyer (played by Albert Brooks) both try to sway him towards the crime path while he does his best to resist them both... majority of this film is about him doing his best to do everything legally and honorably, and it's also the films biggest downfall because it makes for some pretty dull material. While I respect the themes: that some have to get a little \"dirty\" once in a while to succeed, and that attaining this American Dream is definitely not a black and white affair, I couldn't help but shake the feeling that it's been done so many times before in more entertaining, watchable, and interesting ways.",

    "review": "  In \"A Most Violent Year,\" Abel(Oscar Isaac), the owner of a home oil businessin New York City, is on the way up. Not only has he moved into a palatial new home with his wife Anna(Jessica Chastain) and their three children but he has also just closed a deal to buy a distribution center that will greatly enhance his business. However, he has only a month to get the rest of the money, or not only will he lose his sizable deposit but the property will also go to his competitors. Complicating things even further is the DA(David Oyelowo) investigating him and hijackers targeting his trucks, with Julian(Elyes Gabel) being the latest driver victimized.As he seeks to make movies on his own terms, J.C. Chandor has directed another movie that hits the mark with \"A Most Violent Year\" about a man seeking to fulfill the promise of the American dream, by making it as legitimately as he possibly can. That involves Chandor doing so with standout scenes including the one on the Queensboro Bridge and a lead character who seeks to avoid violence in the most violent of times, a message the movie handles well without resorting to being didactic.(It is either irony or penance that both Oscar Isaac and Albert Brooks were also in \"Drive\" which glorified violence to a sickening degree.) Of course, it helps when you have Jessica Chastain being no less than quietly effective and a nearly unrecognizable Albert Brooks stealing scenes left, right and center. Sadly, the Julian storyline does not work as well as it should, being as awkwardly shoehorned into the rest of the movie as it is.",

    "review": "  ONE DOG SHORT OF A FULL AFTERNOON - My Review of A MOST VIOLENT YEAR (3 1/2 Stars)J.C. Chandor is clearly a filmmaker who refuses to be pegged. From MARGIN CALL's cutting Wall Street language to almost the complete absence of it in ALL IS LOST, he has announced himself as a writer/director who can seemingly tackle any genre. Filling the shoes quite well of the late Sidney Lumet, Chandor's third film, A MOST VIOLENT YEAR, just picked up National Board of Review awards for Best Picture, Actor (Oscar Isaac) and Supporting Actress (Jessica Chastain). Based on that, I went into the film with very high expectations, but left with mixed feelings.The story of a corrupt yet somewhat honorable heating oil company owner who faces many obstacles on his way to acquiring an important piece of land, the film is set in the winter of 1981. Isaac plays Abel with a quiet intensity unmistakably comparable to that of Al Pacino in THE GODFATHER. His wife and business partner (Chastain as Anna) comes from some vaguely detailed mob past, and her slow burn throughout is one of the film's great pleasures. Populated with a strong selection of characters straight out of THE SOPRANOS handbook and effortlessly conveying its time period (credit Production Designer John P. Goldsmith for not pushing things too hard), the movie is set a simmer for most of its running time. Sure there are a couple of thrilling chase sequences (one in a tunnel has great sound design and kept you on the edge of your seat despite its utter simplicity), but the film never truly explodes. Perhaps its title is misleading. Referring to a tumultuous year in New York City, the threat of violence is always around the corner, but it rarely goes there. Some may find this unbearably suspenseful, and at times it is, but I wanted it to jump out of its shell and go full \"ATTICA! ATTICA! ATTICA!\"The issue seems to be with Isaac's characterization and how the filmmakers take their cues from his tone. A study in grace under pressure, his character gets himself into a lot of dangerous situations but never seems to lose it. Chastain, on the other hands, gets to rage beautifully. She reminded me of Amy Adams in AMERICAN HUSTLE, all suppressed rage and surprising revelations. Albert Brooks plays Abel's lawyer, and its strong, workmanlike work, but like mostly everything else here, it's unfussy. David Oyelowo (INTERSTELLAR) has some fine moments and a bucket load of ambition as the District Attorney hungry to indict Abel. Elyes Gabel, however, nearly walks away with the picture as on of Abel's put-upon drivers. Desperate, scared and unpredictable, much of the story hinges on his actions, and I couldn't help but feel I wanted that kind of energy to be released from Isaac. Now don't get me wrong, Isaac is a great actor who seems poised to give us one memorable performance after another. From DRIVE to INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS to this, he's a bonafide, classic star, but Chandor's script clearly guided him to play it cool. One scene, however, will go down as an American classic. Without spoiling things, the words \"Please stop\" are most memorable, and in this GODFATHER-esque meeting of the mobsters, Abel's ability to dominate a room is a master class in uncluttered acting. Another terrific sequence involves a birthday party, a search warrant, and file boxes being quickly stashed away. This type of minutiae gives the film its loopy charm. I wish it had more of it.As the plot thickens, all of the motivations and double crosses wrap around each other and make you truly understand how understandable everyone's actions are, leaving you with a hopeful feeling of ever being able to make a profit in this world. It's final scenes are definitely shocking, leading up to a leaky image (you'll know it when you see it) which perfectly illustrates the movie's themes. I can't wait to see what Chandor does next, as he clearly loves movies and telling stories. If only he had really cut loose and ditched some of the formalities, but I'm ok with a very, very good if overpraised film.",

    "review": "  A fan of mature filmmaking, and fast becoming a trailblazer of it, director J.C. Chandor continues to impress with A Most Violent Year. Unlike what the title would suggest, A Most Violent Year is a slow burn of a film, concerned with the psychology of its subject rather than violence as a vehicle. The film focuses on the efforts of a businessman to hold on to what he has amidst aligning forces threatening to ruin all that he has worked for.The film distinguishes itself through its smart script and excellent performances. The film serves as a meditation on not only crime, but what it takes to both achieve and sustain the American dream. Its' protagonist, Abel Morales, tries to keep himself above water in a system and a climate that thrives on tearing down those on top. Unlike most similarly themed films, Morales is able to resist these temptations to a large degree, and that is what makes him so fascinating. This theme, that of self-control and the strength it requires, is found throughout. Methodically paced, the film is a slow burn. The film is dialogue-driven, and rests on its lead, with Oscar Isaac giving an Oscar worthy performance. While the film does lack in the back-story of Morales and his family, it manages to offer a uniquely conceived story to a saturated genre.4/5 Stars",

    "review": "  Sigh. I was so ready to love this one. As it is, A Most Violent Year is a solid small-scale crime drama more along the lines of Killing Them Softly than the Scorsese-esque show stopper the trailer promised. Violent Year makes vague commentary about the American Dream through its protagonist underplayed by Oscar Isaac and his adamant refusal to believe that through his illegal business practices, forced circumstances, and shady connections he is slowly becoming a powerful criminal. (He has much in common with Niko Bellic from GTA IV, though he lacks his Terminator-esque killing prowess.) The best scenes are between Isaac and the always great Jessica Chastain. You've got to admire competent no bullshit acting when you can get it. Few, if any of the other characters make much of an impression. The film suffers more than it should from a glacial pace. And this is coming from a person who enjoys slow films. This movie is VERY slow. While I have to admire how it maintains a limited focus and is content with a very limited arc for our characters, it damages the impact it might have had. On the plus side A Most Violent Year does give you a feel for crime-ridden 1981 New York and there is an impressively filmed, restrained chase scene that came almost out of nowhere and managed to have consequence on the plot. So while it is beautifully shot and well-acted it fails to be (at least for me) enjoyable or memorable. It's worth renting or downloading and breaking it up into a couple of sessions.",

    "review": "  A carefully plodded thinking mans morality tale, J.C. Chandor's awe-striking and atmospheric latest easily ranks as one of the decade's best crime stories. Many films have charted the less-than-successful attempt of social climbing criminals to go clean (The Long Good Friday, The Godfather Part III, Carlito's Way). This film does the same with a scrupulous business unsuccessfully trying to STAY clean. Its a sad and cynical parable reflecting American politics and commerce--not just today but for as the story knowingly relays through the ages. Through generous amounts of dialogue, the film plays out like a high-stakes white-knuckle chess match. You'd think that these sequences would feel too talky, but they only build the tension and suspense of this searing drama, which works excellently as both a character study and proto-gangster story. Like every word in a James Joyce novel, the lines of this film just like the photography and shots - are meticulously chosen and controlled expressions of these powerfully drawn characters.In this R-rated crime-thriller set in New York City during 1981, an ambitious immigrant (Isaac) fights to protect his business and family (Chastain, et al) during the most dangerous year in the city's history. Without the brilliant lead performance, itself meticulous and controlled, A Most Violent Year wouldn't amount to such an auteurial tour-de-force. If Inside Llweyn Davis didn't already compound this fact: Isaac is one of the best actors working today. With Chastain, who builds upon an already ridiculously great CV (The Help, Tree of Life, Zero Dark Thirty, Interstellar), he brings immense heft to a thought-provoking, weighty story, and yes violent story. Whats amazing is that this film bowed in 2014 and amassed zero Academy Award nominations. Someone should've yelled miss-deal. Bottom line: My Favorite Year",

    "review": "  Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain give palpable performances in \"A Most Violent Year\", but the pace of the film trudges in the oil (figuratively), which is what the focus is all about.Set in the early 80's and centered around oil and fuel, Isaac's character is an honest, or is he, businessman trying to create an empire the right way. He preaches trust, loyalty, and honesty with his moral compass pointed in the direction opposite of a gangster. However, Chastain's character tugs at those strings with her connections to her father, who you never see on screen but gather was corrupt. They are great opposing forces as Isaac's character tries to keep his head without falling into violence while Chastain's always wants the quick fix to show strength.The difficulty here is the movie felt billed as a gangster/crime drama whereas it ends up being just a simple drama. It didn't quite carry the punch of the title with very limited violence and true gangster activity. I enjoyed the story though because it stuck you right in the middle of a fictional, yet believable, time period of how things were progressing back then.On an odd note, they had a shot of the city (it was set in NY) and it being the 1980's, they didn't have the twin towers in the cityscape shot.It feels like another case where the acting carries the movie from point A to B to C more-so than both the story and acting cohesively working together at the same time to get you to a fulfilling ending.",

    "review": "  Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is a Colombian immigrant who's worked his way up to the owner of a heating oil delivery service. He's got it all - money, power, a sexy wife played by Jessica Chastain, and a killer camel-hair coat - but he still wants more. How he gets it is the dramatic question of the latest entry in J.C. Chandor's impressive filmography. The film unavoidably gives off the air of \"The Godfather: Part IV\" (Chandor employs a similar slow-burn technique, violence constantly lurking on the edge of the frame, and Isaac's performance instantly conjures up the ghost of Pacino in \"Part II\"). And yet Chandor takes an alternate route - namely, dramatizing how one climbs the ladder in a society so reliant on fraud and violence without compromising one's morals. That's Abel's dilemma, and it's incredibly engaging to watch, thanks to a fantastic collaboration between Chandor's script and direction and the actors involved, not to mention a tense Pink Floyd-esque score by Alex Ebert. The only real problem is in the Chastain character. Chandor writes her as a pretty flat daughter of a gangster, the kind who 40 years ago would say things like, \"Show me what you got, mister.\" This would all be well and good, but Chastain is simply too good an actress and the character seems an odd fit. Still, this is one of the most sneakily great movies of the year, and more proof that Chandor is one of our most consistent up-and-coming filmmakers.",

    "review": "  J.C. Chandor has to be admired. With only two previous full length features under his belt (this is his third), he has made a name for himself for creating smart, well crafted, original tales that feel much different than most of what is offered on the cinematic market today. A Most Violent Year, like his impressive debut Margin Call, can best be described as a thriller of words. Or business noir if you like. They're stories that on paper don't look like they should be all that suspenseful or even particularly interesting. But in the way they're executed: the music, the acting, the dialogue, they become intense explorations of corporate corruption and entrepreneurial tenacity. This gives them that most boring sounding of genre tags 'adult drama.' But the amazing thing about these films is how compelling Chandor makes them. In A Most Violent Year, Oscar Issac is a man who is putting his whole life savings on the line toward expanding his business, a fuel farm via Standard Oil. But things become tricky when someone targets his trucks for repeated hijackings, stealing over $200,000 worth of fuel in the process and strange men with guns start showing up on his property. While all that's going on, the FBI is applying pressure in an investigation into illegal business practises that seem to be the norm for the fuel business. Then things get more complicated and more, and the dam seems about to burst for our hapless protagonist who's only wish is to build an empire in an honest, law abiding way. The story spins against the backdrop of New York City, 1981. A year in the city's history notorious for its soaring crime rates, particularly in area of violent crime (hence the movie's title). It provides an interesting historical backdrop to the narrative and is used in the same way the Obama/McCain presidential elections were in Killing Them Softly: a contextual buffering of the story, rather than a device which directly impacts it. The movie's anchored by Oscar Issac. First of all, his character is admirable. He's not perfect. There are hints that he's had his dishonest days, but his resolution to run an honest business, especially when it would be much easier to take the easy, less legal road, is always at the forefront of his actions. An uncorrupt man who is flanked on all sides by varying levels of corruption always makes for compelling viewing. Isaac himself is fantastic in the role and is surrounded by a basket of impressive supporting performances. Unfortunately, A Most Violent Year is a film with a great deal of buildup to which the climax doesn't entirely satisfy. Every scene is filled with a pervading sense of doom and tension. You consistently feel as if something bad's about to happen. It gives the whole affair a level of anxiety that fits the film if not the story. A Most Violent Year is a film that is somewhat misleading. It promises more than it delivers, but it's an interesting film and an interesting look at the pursuit of capitalism. It feels, and plays, like 70's filmmaking through and through: intelligent, precise and gritty. It's even got that desaturated, honeyed look that the first two Godfathers had. It's not as well crafted or sure of itself as Margin Call. And it's not as compelling or brave as All Is Lost, but it retains J.C. Chandor's current position within the film industry as a talent to watch. Maybe for his next film he could mix what he's already done and give us a film about a massive oil spill that threatens...oh, he is. Never mind.",

    "review": "  Despite the title, there is hardly any excessive violence in this film. I like the way the suspense is kept high without having to resort to Godfather-type gory violence that often plagues stories about recent immigrants in NYC pursuing the American dream. Also, the main protagonist Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) has an ambiguous personality that keeps you guessing whether or not he is actually a good guy or a bad guy.",

    "review": "  This should be called 'A Most Misleading Title', but while the film did split my opinion on more than a few occasions, I've been thinking about it almost constantly after it ended. On one hand, I was disappointed that the film didn't have any \"explosive\" points. There's an atmosphere of danger and violence constantly looming that never actually materializes, it's essentially a massive cock tease, and I wonder whether it would have been better for the movie if the things I was waiting for happened. On the other side of the coin, I loved how understated it was, and I really respect films when they lead you in a certain direction but do the total opposite of what you're expecting. The fact that this never turns into a violent crime thriller after it endlessly misleads you into thinking it will, is something I really enjoyed. So I'm in two minds here. What isn't up for debate is everything else. The acting is phenomenal. Oscar Isaac (Say no more) but Jessica Chastain stole it for me. Her character is the one who is really making things happen but stays out of the limelight, and her performance is great. It's shot beautifully, the cinematography and colouring seems to have been meticulously planned, and the score is so subtle I actually can't remember if a single song was played at any point during the film. Overall, this will split people down the middle. If you don't like slow paced movies, you'll probably hate this. Personally I prefer a slower pace. If you need to feel satisfied by the end of films you'll also be left a little empty probably, but if you appreciate the way the story unfolds in a realistic way and doesn't do a bunch of \"movie things\" like you're expecting, you'll find yourself in my boat. Honestly, this is a strange watch but I've decided I really like it. I had to think about it though.",

    "review": "  Good, but not entirely satisfying.New York, 1981. An owner of a heating oil supply company, Abel Morales (played by Oscar Isaac), has just struck a deal to buy an oil storage terminal. This will take his business to the next level. However, the contract to buy the terminal has a very strict timeline and provisions. To add to his worries, his trucks are being hijacked and the District Attorney is about to take him to court on felony charges...Interesting and intriguing drama. Is a slow-burner, but is never dull. However, for all the work that goes into building the intrigue and developing the plot, there are a few scenes which just don't gel and the ending does feel quite flat. There is no great profundity awaiting you at the end of it all. Excellent performance by Oscar Isaac in the lead role. Then again, I don't think he is capable of a bad performance - surely an Academy award cannot be too far away? Good work too by Jessica Chastain as his wife, Albert Brooks as their lawyer and David Oyelowo as the DA.Ultimately, while the plot is reasonably interesting, the performances carry the movie.",

    "review": "  A Most Violent Year is a tense, quiet, tightly scripted drama lead by two amazing performances from Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain. Opting for a character driven story, atmosphere and gripping dialogue over shootouts and action sequences, this film is a unique and thought-provoking subversion on the 'American Dream' narrative. It never falls into the cliches or cheap plot devices of standard mob movies, and the way it tackles its themes of corruption and the 'honest working man' is refreshingly new. The story follows a guy trying to make an honest way in a dishonest world, and actually sticking to it - the opposite of nearly every other crime movie about the American Dream. And while there are a few suspenseful moments of violence and action, like I said I must commend the powerful direction and magnetic performances for how much tension is evoked from simply two characters talking. Apart from its thematics and writing, A Most Violent Year also works really well as a period piece. The costumes and sets are amazing, and a prosperous yet melancholic 1980s New York is brought to life with immense attention to detail and sleek, captivating cinematography. A Most Violent Year is an engrossing, suspenseful and atmospheric crime drama, and while I admit I'm not as crazy about it as I've seen a lot of critics are, I believe it has undeniable merit in how it effortlessly breathes new life into such a tired genre, and it's definitely an underrated standout of 2015.",

That person doesn't get it, and that's fine. The movie is not for everyone, it should be, but it is not. A Most Violent Year is about chasing the American dream and some of the short-cuts you have to make that may come back to bite you. The main character, Abel Morales, masterfully played by Oscar Isaacs, has gone out of his way to try and keep everything above the boards but his business gets tagged by the district attorney's office forcing him to make a decision to save his business. The most jarring moment in the film is when Isaacs was driving with Jessica Chastain, who plays his wife Anna Morales, when they clip a deer. Isaacs has to put the injured animal down and hesitates. Chastain gets out the car pulls out a gun and kills the deer without batting an eye looking eerily like someone who is able to murder in cold blood. The scene shook me, Chastain and Isaacs go toe-to-toe for finest performance in the film, almost. It would be criminal to not give the nod to Elyes Gabel (from TV's Scorpion) for his portrayal of Julian, a driver for Isaacs company, who pays the highest price in the film. A Most Violent Year is bound to have a long life as an American drama and I imagine people looking at it in the same light as The Godfather.",

Jaw-clenching Oscar Isaac and icy-staring Jessica Chastain make compelling scene partners, and this plot puts them through the ringer.The film has been favorably compared to the work of Sidney Lumet, one of American cinema's most underrated masters, and I can see why: both director J.C. Chandor and Lumet use long, slow shots, framed in shadowy backgrounds to subtly establish a pervasively sinister mood. Anything can happen in the threatening worlds of Chandor and Lumet, and even when it doesn't, there's the feeling that the characters have only temporarily escaped tragedy. This mood leads to what I think is one of the film's great sequences. It's a chase sequence in which Abel, Isaac's character, must run down a lead on who has been stealing his business's trucks. With most chase sequences, it's easy to tell how it's going to end - the plot event has to be resolved by the character either catching the prey or not - but in this sequence, even though we know that Abel will catch the guy, we don't know whether Abel will fall further from grace and become a murderer. This moment of unpredictability is masterfully built and becomes an example of how good films can take a familiar construct - the chase - and make it fresh and exciting.Overall, A Most Violent Year is a phenomenal film, and it solidifies Isaac and Chandor as two of our most promising talents.",

Oscar Issac stars as an owner of an up an coming heating oil business in New York what appears to be around the 1970's. His trucks are being hijacked, the DA is investigating the industry for corruption and tax evasion and appears to be targeting his company exclusively. His real reason for targeting Isaac's company becomes apparent late in the film. Issac, starring as Abel Morales wants to do every thing according to the book. He's married to Anna, (Jessica Chastain)who we discover is the daughter of a gangster who they bought the company from years before. While Abel claims to be a straight arrow, we discover he's been fudging the numbers but all in all he's \"sorta honest\". He puts his life savings as a deposit on a large piece of property complete with huge oil tanks and has 30 days to come up with $1.5 million or he loses his deposit. OK, that's the plot. I hate Abel. He is as his wife referred to him, \"a pussy\" . The movie is boring, Abel is boring and a pussy. All he does the entire movie is \"blah, blah, blah\" about hard work, and all kinds of boring platitudes. I kept waiting for something to happen and all I got was Abel, \"Blah, blah, blah\" This is a terrible movie. I was so disappointed. It is a total waste of time. Did I tell you, I hate Abel?",

    "review": "  A fascinating and potent Shakespearean-esque examination of the American dream, honor and ambition, \"A Most Violent Year\" simmers with palpable tension and marvelous performances. Littered with well drawn characters, the film does more with less, making use of gorgeous cinematography that paints eighties New York with a golden wintery glow and artistic precision and a marvelous screenplay that couples its plot intricately with Abel's passionate drive for honorable success, a desire that proves oxymoronic, as his character is faced again and again with the difficulties of reconciling honor with success. Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain are both phenomenal. A fascinating story with true narrative heft, it's more than worth watching.",

    "review": "  This movie is as much of a crime-drama as it is a thought provoking statement on business and it manages to do both splendidly. The performances by Oscar Isaac, Jessica Chastain and Albert Brooks are all terrific, and all of the other supporting players are great too. The music is ominous and helps build suspense as it manages to fit the mood of each scene. J.C. Chandor's steady direction is also something holding this movie up above a lot of other movies within the same genre. I highly recommend \"A Most Violent Year\" to anyone looking for a great movie.",

    "review": "  This was a great film although a bit unusual. I disagree that he thought he was a gangster, I think its a misconception that that type of behaviour should be associated with being a ganster. He was a business man. The overall story is a bit flat in that you half expect him to explode into violence, you expect it from the expently predictable plot and the title. But its not predictable and although that meant there was less action it lent to other qualities that made the film pretty intense. The only thing that annoyed me was how they kept say very little and then saying 'I know'. Multiple characters sat there in moody silence and said 'I know' solemly about 5-7 times. Enough for you to be waiting for it to happen again. What I really liked about the film was all the small micro plots, or character strings. For example, the driver that shoots himself in the end asks the main character whether he thought by giving him a job he had given him a good chance in life and the main character said he had. To me that had quite a lot of power because this was really a story, like in real life, where a person gets rich essentially off the back of poor people, ie the workers. What was more intriging was the idea that they were the same person, in my minds eye, but in different universes. The one that was the manager was strong and confident and the driver was weak and pathetic. So, in real life, you think, what would my manager or boss do if he was in my shoes. Its easy to be tough and strong if your in charge. I did some floor mopping years ago and a manager used to say to me, how can you expect anyone give you a job of any value if you cant proove you can mop a floor, or words to that effect. Then the driver shoots himself. And why not, he was right. Its all very subtle without being condesending of sacramonious. The action is slight and you sort of want more which is a bit dissapointing. But its a rich environment. It absorbs you and you beleive it, to some extent. Theres a scene where the main guy goe into a barbours to confront a man he knows has been stealing his fuel. But he doesnt shoot him, which would be a natural film device, instead he has some 'words' with him. And the guy is scared, because he's been found out and the fuel is marked. Its a very believable scene, and in its own right is 'violence', it was confrontation. But the violence is subliminal. All in all this is definatly worth watching.",

    "review": "  A Most Violent Year, writer-director J.C. Chandor's third film after 2011's talky Wall Street thriller Margin Call and 2013's near-silent sailor drama All Is Lost, is yet further proof that while Chandor is capable at building and maintaining a haunting atmosphere, the stories he tells aren't very interesting. Or then he just tells them in uninteresting manners. A Most Violent Year, set in the wintry New York of 1981 (the city's statistically most crime-filled year), tries really hard to be a sophisticated and nuanced crime drama in the manner of Sidney Lumet's crime films and Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather trilogy (not least because Oscar Isaac's character very much resembles young Al Pacino), but it is this very pursuit for sophistication that makes the film incredibly dull. Like Margin Call and All Is Lost, A Most Violent Year isn't very eventful in terms of storytelling, but rather focuses on the characters and the extreme pressures they have to face. But all of Chandor's films have suffered from a distance they keep to their characters, leaving the audience no particular interest or emotional investment. Despite some typically fantastic work from Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain, good support from Albert Brooks and David Oyelowo, and Bradford Young's beautiful camerawork, A Most Violent Year ends up being just another flat and unexciting drama about a man slowly losing his moral while striving for the American dream.",

    "review": "  When you're playing poker and you think you're holding cards that are better than the other players, you raise the stakes. Well, in the poker game that is movie awards season, releasing a movie at the very end of the year is a sign that a studio thinks it has a very strong film on its hands. They're betting that those who nominate films and actors for awards will agree. Often, the gamble pays off. Sometimes it doesn't. Such is the situation in which the producers of \"A Most Violent Year\" (R, 2:05) found themselves. The film received no Oscar nominations, one Golden Globe nomination and... that's about it. There are a number of good reasons for the snubs, if you can call them that.The film centers around Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac), the owner of a heating oil supply company in New York City in 1981, which happens to have been one of the worst years for violent crime in the city's history. Abel (pronounced ah-BELL) is dealing with a rash of hijackings of his trucks by unknown thugs who steal the oil and abandon the trucks. He's also trying to raise enough money to close on a neighboring property which will allow him to expand his business. Abel has used all of his company's available cash as a down payment and has 30 days to pay the balance or he loses his deposit. He's counting on his bank to loan him the rest of the money, but an investigation of his company's business practices by Assistant District Attorney Lawrence (David Oyelowo) and the ongoing problem of the fuel oil thefts is putting the entire future of his business in jeopardy.Abel has a lot on his plate and the people closest to him sometimes seem to be working against him. His wife (Jessica Chastain) berates Abel for not doing more to protect his family, especially after he chases off a would-be intruder from his front porch and doesn't seem to have a plan to deal with the situation when his youngest daughter finds the thug's gun in the bushes. The local Teamsters leader (Peter Gerety) insists that his drivers be allowed to arm themselves for self-defense. Abel objects, for fear of what that might lead to, but Abel's lawyer (Albert Brooks) sides with the Teamsters. The fact that Abel is a decent and honest man in such a tough business makes meeting all these challenges all the more difficult.\"A Most Violent Year\" has a number of problems, starting with false advertising. The film's title and its theatrical trailer lead one to believe that this is a violent movie. Newscasts heard in the background of several scenes and a conversation or two remind us that this was a violent year for the city, but the movie is actually not very violent at all. Not only does all this misrepresent the film's story, but the movie's relative lack of violence seems counterintuitive when you think about what's going on in the story.The performances of Isaac and Chastain were excellent, but they are overshadowed by the ineptness of their characters, especially Isaac's. Abel is dangerously na�ve regarding the seriousness of the situations he and his family face and maddeningly unable to do much about his problems. He dresses, talks and carries himself like he belongs in one of the \"Godfather\" films, but underneath it all, he comes across more like a castrated Michael Corleone. I'm all for seeing an underdog triumph in a movie, or seeing a character's honesty and hard work pay off, but Abel is the kind of guy who stubbornly insists on bringing a knife to a gun fight. How a man like Abel succeeded as long as he had when the movie began or how he might hope to survive in his kind of world is a mystery, almost as much of a mystery as how this film's producers thought it deserved to be taken seriously as an awards contender. Sorry, folks. It looks like what you're holding here is no better than a pair of twos, a pair for threes... and a joker. For that hand, all you'll get from me is a \"C\".",

    "review": "  Writer-Director J.C. Chandor's \"A Most Violent Year\" is no the most violent picture I have ever seen; in fact, there is not that much violence in it. But that is irrelevant, because Chandor's picture is not much about violence, but on entrepreneur competitive tactics to supersede competitors; even though some of the players involved here do bring violence in the mix. The industry that is showcased here is the oil truck corporation. The year here is 1981 and the city, none other than New York, who in that year there was a myriad of violent acts happening in the Big Apple. Rising Star Oscar Isaac stars as Abel Morales, a oil truck company entrepreneur who is in the process of finalizing a slick deal which will bring his company to the top of the game in the New York Oil Truck market. The problem is that Abel's drivers are being thrown and assaulted in their trucks by a competitor or some other entity. Jessica Chastain co-stars as Anna Morales, Abel's wife who is pretty much the boss of that relationship, and she is the mother f*cker who runs that place. Chandor does drive \"A Most Violent Year\" in slow mode, but somehow it was the proper gear to propel this story. His screenplay was solid but not even close as one of the best in \"a most competitive year\" of terrific screenplays in the film year of 2014. However, it was Issac's money starring performance as Abel was what most paramount of \"A Most Violent Year\"; no doubt the Morales character will remind you of kinder Michael Corleone, but with the same firepower of topping his competitors. Chastain was sound, but a bit underused; and that is never a good thing when we are talking about one of the greatest, if not the greatest, actress working today. I also enjoyed Albert Brooks' showy work as the Morales' lawyer Andrew Walsh; a role that Chandor probably wrote for Brooks' to drive it home; which he did. \"A Most Violent Year\" is not for everyone, some will find it too slow, but in the end you should set a date with it. **** Good",

Slow-paced and not quite thrilling, this is a pleasing and very well written crime drama.Set in New York, during the winter of 1981 when the city experience is worst burst of crime, the story depicts the hardships the entrepreneur Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) and his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) experience when they run their business. A man of a vision and capitalist ideals, Abel is ready to face all challenges ahead of him. Neither the mob trying to put him out of business nor a possible prosecution by the DA are capable of stopping Abel to follow his dream and to try achieving it by the use of legal and moral means. The story-line develops in a particularly slow pace paying enough attention to the elements that make A Most Violent Year a retro-noir drama. Formidable photography, costumes and cinematography are surely a pleasure to observe, but to some extent they also decrease partially the story's suspense levels. On the other side, this is very successfully compensated by the relationship Oscar Isaac - Jessica Chastain. Abel (Isaac) is the idealist who is never going to do anything unethical or illegal even if this endangers his family, while Anna (Chastain) could do anything to protect her family and their business (even if it is illegal). It is a pleasure to observe Isaac as the cool-blooded capitalist who has almost lost any compassion or sensibility even when there is death around him. Director J.C. Chandor has managed to craft a character whose capitalist idealism makes him both likeable and appalling. This, of course, would not have been possible without the bleak and determined performance Oscar Isaac who does not stop to impress after his formidable appearances in Inside Llewun Davis and Ex Machina. There is no doubt that if he continues that way he has a shot at becoming an actor to follow up closely. In conclusion, A Most Violent Year is not an easy movie. Definitely a delivery for mature audiences, it offers a classic periodic experience which would possibly bring you back to the times when crime dramas were far more focused on content and characters than on pacing and suspense.",

    "review": "  One of the best crime dramas I've seen for a long time. It very much feels old school in it's style and delivery and you could imagine Al Pacino in the lead role in his younger years. It has an epic feel to it, a slow build tale of one man's struggle to power and Oscar Isaac has the screen presence to deliver such a story. He brings what I would describe as restrained menace to the screen, a man who wants to have it all, who could very easily turn into a gangster and is struggling to stay straight when the city he lives and works in all work against him. Jessica Chastain is also superb, a character who realises what must be done in order to survive, even if that leads her into conflict with the man she is trying to support.",

A slow-burner of mammoth calibre, A Most Violent Year is a mighty and intensely gripping genre that bursts with confident performances, notably Isaac as Abel - now one of my new favourite characters in film. Something like this does not emerge from modern cinema very often, and it pains me that it has passed through 2014 unnoticed or under-appreciated. I implore everyone to watch this beautifully filmed work of art - one of the best films of 2014, and possibly of the 2010s.",

    "review": "  J. C. Chandor's third film is all muted earth tones thanks to cinematography Bradford Young who did such a marvelous job on Selma. His confident lensing captures the early 80's milieu nicely but it can't do much to make the story more intriguing. After the high stakes sailboat adventure All Is Lost and the Wall Street implosion in Margin Call - a surprise nominee for Original Screenplay in 2011 - you wonder why Chandor picked a story like this. Crime movies in New York have been done to death and some of the greatest films of all time fall into that genre, so you at least need to be a little unique and able to grab your audience's attention. Nope. The most worthy aspect of the film is the performances namely the exquisite MVP Jessica Chastain. Chastain can elevate any material she touches and her aggressive, scheming mob daughter here is the one true electric spark in these dull proceedings. She needs to play this character in her own movie. Oscar Isaac, another rising star, is again a reliable leading man as he proved for the Coen brothers in last year's critic's fave Inside Llewyn Davis. Another Selma connection is David Oyelowo who plays MLK himself in the Oscar-nominated film and a fed here. And Alessandro Nivola adds to the supporting cast as he did in last year's much more successful crime film American Hustle. This guy needs to get rediscovered. Trucks are robbed, people get smacked around, guys run, Jessica Chastain smokes ... and then it's over. I've sat through worse but c'mon - this won Best Picture from the National Board of Review?",

    "review": "  \"You stole from me!!!\" as Abel shouted to his wife Anna. \"A Most Violent Year\" stars Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain. Two of my new favorite actors in this very moody and gritty crime drama. Set in 1981, considered to be one of the most violent years in the city's history, Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is the hard-working owner of Standard Oil, an up and coming heating oil company. But things turned out when one of his driver Julian (Elyes Gabel) has been hijacked by two armed and unidentified assailants. By that time on, he receive death threats. And unfortunately, his company (Standard Oil) has a case of fraud, tax evasion and felony charges. It seems one of his investors has been behind all of this with some help of the Mafia contacts. Abel is trying to sort things out as he set up meetings to his lawyers, and discuss things to his buyers to resolve all of this problems. The pacing of this film jumps from high to low. There are some really good action scenes that are beautifully shot. The long take shot of sequences are so impressive. It was all intense and I was really into it. One thing I noticed here is the color and saturation of the film. It is dark, and beautifully shot film which feels very \"80's like\". The performances are the best asset which are top notch. I love the performances. One of those film that you would really appreciate the acting. Especially for Oscar Isaac, this guy is so damn good as an actor. His facial expression says it all. I thought from his performance from that film \"drive\", he can be great on what he does. As for Chastain, saw her in that film \"Zero Dark Thirty\". She is one of my favorite actress. She can really handle her role in a very dramatic fashion. Very expressive type of acting and I love her for that. And this guy Elyes Gabel, this guy nailed his performances in here. You kinda feel for his character, from being a jolly worker till such time he became broke. That last scene for him is very intense though. I love the performances, very well executed, and definitely one of the best crime drama films of the year. Definitely deserves any recognition. 4.5/5",

    "review": "  Abel Morales: You should know that I have always taken the path that is most right. The result is never in question for me. Just what path do you take to get there, and there is always one that is most right. And that is what this is.A Most Violent Year es la pel�cula m�s incomprendida del 2014. Sospecho que se debe al marketing que se le hizo, donde se presentaba como un thriller mafioso, con mucha acci�n. Esta pel�cula si trata un poco de la mafia, pero m�s all� de eso, se enfoca en sus personajes, y como las decisiones que toman, afectan su moralidad y �tica, cualidades que son escasas dentro de este mundo.Abel Morales es un inmigrante que lleg� a Estados Unidos persiguiendo el sue�o americano y lo logr�. Tiene una empresa de aceite de calefacci�n que crece cada d�a, y que pronto ser� la m�s exitosa de todo Nueva York al cerrar un trato para adquirir un terreno. Con este �xito, �l y su familia se mudan a una nueva mansi�n con todos los lujos posibles. Cuando sus camiones empiezan a ser robados, y comienza a recibir amenazas en su vida laboral y personal, Abel trata de resolverlo de la manera m�s diplom�tica posible, mientras que su esposa Anna -hija de un mafioso- lo presiona para que utilice la violencia. Como si esto fuera poco, la empresa empieza a perder inversionistas a ra�z de el error de un empleado, que llevo un arma a el trabajo para defenderse de los robos recientes. Esto pone en peligro la adquisici�n del terreno que tanto trabajo le ha costado a Abel, y decide dejar de lado su manera correcta de hacer negocios, y adentrarse en un mundo corrupto del cual es imposible salir.A Most Violent Year es una pel�cula que se toma su tiempo. Va hilando todas las escenas con cuidado, especialmente el desarrollo de sus personajes. Abel es un hombre con un gran carisma que ha conseguido todo lo que ha querido a punto de trabajo duro y honestidad. Es muy sutil el giro que da hasta la �ltima escena donde es el testigo de el suicidio de su empleado Julian, y hace poco para prevenirlo, porque en ese momento le da prioridad a su negocio. Tiene un mensaje bastante fuerte tambi�n acerca de la presi�n que tienen los inmigrantes de ser exitosos, y son capaces de arriesgar todo para lograr este estilo de vida que les da legitimidad como ciudadanos de el pa�s. A pesar de que la mayor�a de la pel�cula es di�logo y negociaciones, la escena de acci�n donde Abel persigue a el hombre que ha estado robando sus camiones, es una de las m�s intrigantes y emocionantes del a�o. La c�mara se enfoca �nicamente en esos dos personajes, y es un ejemplo de como lograr su cometido con buenas actuaciones.Oscar Isaacs como Abel es el nuevo Don Corleone. Se maneja con una confianza incre�ble, y siempre est� en control, a�n cuando sabe que esta a punto de perder todo. Esta ha sido una de las mejores actuaciones del 2014 y de la carrera de Isaacs. Este actor es un talento que no se ve muy seguido. Jessica Chastain como siempre se roba la pantalla. Este es un papel distinto al que haya interpretado anteriormente. A�n cuando manipula a las personas, es encantadora. Su mejor escena es cuando la policia entra a inspeccionar su casa justo cuando es el cumplea�os de su hijo, y se para afuera con el D.A interpretado por David Oyelowo, y lo amenaza. El peso de estas palabras tienen un poder tremendo a pesar de la sutileza con la cual las dice.J.C. Chandor tiene una manera particular de hacer cine. En su pel�cula anterior All is Lost, crea tensi�n utilizando pocos elementos, y cero di�logo. Su estilo es minimalista, pero sus historias tienen impacto y te dejan pensando acerca de las repercusiones de las acciones de sus personajes. Es fascinante ver esta pel�cula y todas las capas sutiles dentro de ella, y que es mucho m�s compleja de lo que parece.",

    "review": "  Sometimes the gangster life is unavoidable in business, no matter how hard one tries to avoid it and keep going on a straight and narrow pace. Whether one wants to admit it or not, you have to get your hands dirty every once in a while. A Most Violent Year goes over those tough life and death decisions with aplomb with an engrossing character study of a business man who does all he can to not play dirty when things get tough. Set in the winter of 1981, New York City is statistically experiencing the most violent year in the city's history. Crime is rampant and everyone is looking to get their piece of the pie in search of that elusive American dream. Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is a Latino immigrant who is a self-made man who worked up from a driver at an oil company to be the boss of the operation. He is quickly rising up the ranks in the oil business and is about to become bigger when he makes a deal for riverside property that would grow his business exponentially and give him a stranglehold on the market. Aided by his trustful lawyer Andrew Walsh (Albert Brooks), He seeks to do business legally and won't resort to tactics that threaten his workers or himself. Things seem to be going well but troubles arise when competing oil companies stick up his drivers and steal his product and persistent DA Lawrence (David Oyelowo) is breathing down his neck for numerous illegal business practices that threaten to derail his life as well as business. To further add to his conflict is his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain), the daughter of a gangster who Abel bought the business from, who tasks him in taking a more take charge attitude and bite back. With so much added pressure, he rushes to clear the deal and take his business to the next level.This isn't your average or regular gangster drama, which may upset some but I found it to be enthralling and captivating with a couple of great performances. Isaac is one of the standouts and adds another dynamic role to his already impressive resume. Taking hints from a past gangster like Michael Corleone in The Godfather, not only in character but slicked back hair and some gorgeous coats, he is thrown into the world of crime and is unsure how to react. Michael eventually becomes a cold blooded kingpin of the criminal underworld while it's a more virtuous journey for Abel who wants to hold onto his code of honor and duty. Seeing him wade through the waters of good and evil is an entertaining exploit to what man will do to ensure the safety of his business and family. You become invested in what happens to him and what he is willing to do to make sure that he won't get pushed around anymore by those that deem him weak. Isaac has a quiet and serious mentality that is often set in stone but will diminish if the pressure is put on him. He exudes a cool confidence and an imposing front that would feel right at home in a violent gangster epic by Scorsese but in a cut throat business of heating oil, it still feels right at home. The change in background doesn't make the world any less thrilling or entertaining. If Isaac doesn't take at least one serious gangster film, I would be incredibly surprised. He has a great presence and control over his character that you could potentially see him blow up at any moment. There is much intensity in his eyes that you could practically see his blood boiling, leaving you waiting if he will give in to his violent urges. Tough and rough edged, he doesn't take things lying down, even if it never resorts to violence, and he eventually takes matters into his own hands when he won't put up with his product getting stolen any longer. But he is by no means innocent as he has been doing the same duplicitous business dealings as his competitors have done but not in a way of outright stealing from one another and threating workers lives. Doing so, it makes an interesting dynamic where you root for him somewhat while at the same time see that he was never all the way clean to begin with. Making up his better half is Chastain's amazing performance as the dutiful gangster's daughter but not necessarily the gangster's wife. She is very well connected with her family being key members of the criminal underworld that clearly influenced her character and how she does business. Abel wanting to do business his way stops her the moment she mentions her notorious family to offer him some much needed help. Whip smart and in control, she is in charge of the books for the company and proves to be incredibly valuable later on. She practically steals every scene she is in and commandeers the ship or attempts to when things get out of hand. Chastain made it very easy to be enthralled by her as she attempts to woo Abel to the dark side of business and give in to his inner gangster. She has an impressive presence that makes the complete image of her rather appealing. Her beauty matched with her no nonsense ideals makes for an amazing character that no one would dare mess with. She simply talks the talk and walks the walk, daring anybody else to stand toe to toe with her. This makes the chemistry between Isaac and Chastain crackling with tension and emotion where you can't help but stick onto every word. The repoire they show was incredibly engaging, with neither one willing to let up it made for some great drama and interactions. Brooks was good too in a small but important role as his lawyer. He is also more inclined to go into the gangster way of doing things, trying to guide Abel in that direction too. He considers arming the drivers with pistols to counteract the hijackings but Abel argues it could prove to be more trouble than its worth. Being a comedian for much of his career, he makes for great imposing authority figures in crime dramas with his performance as a gangster in Drive being one of his best roles and he fits the role like a glove.J.C. Chandor is one of the more promising directors and writers, sporting a small number of films but are all nevertheless impressive. He has a great knack for character driven films and tense moments wrought with heavy dialogue. Even though All Is Lost is basically devoid of any dialogue but it is still thrilling and captivating. He presents people who aren't perfect and puts their morality under a magnifying glass with much of the characters in the financial drama Margin Call fitting that model. It's not surprising that he got an Oscar nomination for best screenplay for Margin Call. While not full of the gun battles, explosions, car chases and gratuitous violence that is permanent in various gangster films, it instead takes a restrained approach to things. Although there was an effective and exciting car chase that later led to a foot chase that really got you in. I really liked how he went about putting a normal business like oil and heating and placing it against a mob type setting. The interactions that the characters have with one another makes for an interesting dynamic when you realize that these guys aren't cold blooded killers, just guys who want the edge on their competition. It's a slow burner where the characters are allowed to simmer where it makes it hard to guess where their emotions will take them. The dialogue is rich with intensity where you don't really expect it too. Chastain has such a great way of speaking that's threatening and condescending and she just takes everything head on. The back and forth interactions between everyone was a joy to listen to and made it much more rich and developed. The scene where Abel is coaching his new recruits how to take charge of their customers was wrought with intensity and takes it up a notch when he talks down to an employee who laughs at the all too wrong moment. If it were a true gangster movie, you would have expected the boss to level him with a baseball bat like Al Capone in The Untouchables. That's how effective A Most Violent year is in that it perfectly copies what we expect from gangster films and transports them to another movie and setting where the central character is doing all that he can to not be a gangster. It feels like a 70s throwback crime drama where action wasn't the central piece of entertainment and the dialogue and complex characters dominate the screen. It ended on somewhat of a happy note but in a direction that begets an interesting scenario for all involved. It's a little ambiguous but it becomes a little clearer when you notice the previous moments in the film.Films like A Most Violent Year can be hard to peg sometimes. There isn't much violence or bare knuckle action like many expected, but a film shouldn't always contain everything that it's about in the title. Sometimes I enjoy a slow burning drama that just captivates you with dialogue and story that unwanted action would have weighed it down and mad the film worthless in the end. If one puts in the time and doesn't expect a Scorsese film, you will come out the other end with a gem. A little too talky for some with not much of the payoff one may expect, it still has plenty of thrills with a pair of amazing performances that dominate the screen. The payoff that some may want wouldn't have made it a better film necessarily. But going the route it went leaves it with an air of ambiguity that says more than going a more pedestrian route would.

The trouble is, the plot drags along without much to keep us interested. Jessica Chastain trys her best to channel Michelle Pfeiffer in Scarface (and she's smoking hot throughout the movie), but there's just really not enough action to keep the movie going. I must say I was expecting more since my original impression was this movie might have a \"Scarface\" vibe to it. Sadly I was wrong.",

Oscar Isaac may look and sound like a gangster, but he's not. The title definitely sounds like a gangster movie, but it's not. In actual fact, it is one of the least violent movies out there at the moment. However, if you can accept that from early doors then you will hopefully appreciate 'A Most Violent Year' as a well paced and well acted portrait of moral resilience and business hardship in testing times. Fingers crossed another 'Goodfellas' comes along soon though. Johnny Depp's 'Black Mass' may be our next best bet.",

    "review": "  Though it has been proven several times throughout our history that nice guys finish last, Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is determined to be a good man and a successful business executive. But times are tough, and it's 1981 - the most crime-riddled year in New York's history. Take the first few minutes of the film, for instance. Just as he's making an important deal, one of his cargo drivers is severely beaten by some enemy henchmen who steal the truck. Abel wants to conduct his company as smoothly as possible (what businessman doesn't?), but fighting violence with violence seems to be the only answer to his problems as of late. Adding to the increasing difficulties is the District Attorney (David Oyelowo), who is certain that misconduct is plaguing the finances of the company. In his third feature as a director, J.C. Chandor pays homage to the neo-noirs of Brian De Palma and Sidney Lumet, mimicking their underlying ferociousness with unwavering detail regarding the human side of the crime world. His other features (\"Margin Call\", \"All Is Lost\"), unseen by me, were lauded by critics for their virtuosic filmmaking. \"Margin Call\", a fictional account of the financial crisis of 2008, was praised for its crackling dialogue and unwavering tension; \"All Is Lost\", a near-silent depiction of a shipwreck, gave Robert Redford the role of a lifetime and acted as a thriller without the flash of its peers. Three movies into his career, it's clear that Chandor doesn't want to be a director sidelined to a particular genre like Hitchcock. He wants to flow in-between different styles and moods, a Howard Hawks of the 2010s. \"A Most Violent Year\" is a top-notch crime drama, but not in the ways you might expect. It's not the story that compels us, not the dialogue, but the acting, the tone, the directing. The film is as atmospheric as the best of its kind can get. Like a prisoner buried alive in an underground catacomb, \"A Most Violent Year\" traps us in its yellowing, graffiti adorned world; even the good guys mesh with the bad. The sweet smell of success is much too difficult to pass by. I can't say that I was truly entertained by \"A Most Violent Year\" - rather than run alongside its all too rare intelligent characteristics, I instead appreciated them. But sometimes, appreciation can be just as powerful as entertainment itself. Chandor is supremely confident in his writing and his directing, giving us further reasoning as to why he is already becoming one of the best filmmakers of the decade. If we are ever bored with the film itself (which is a seldom concern), we aren't with Chandor, who gives every shot a great deal of grimy beauty and venomous snap. Matching Chandor's rising talents are Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac, college classmates whose careers seem to be hitting their peaks at the exact same time; Chastain announced her presence to the world in 2011 with an impressive six movie run (including \"The Tree of Life\" and \"The Help\"), and Isaac, coming out of nowhere, made himself an actor for the ages as the titular character in 2013's \"Inside Llewyn Davis\". \"A Most Violent Year\" finds them at the top of their respective games. Isaac jumps from unyielding to exposed, from weak to authoritative, at a constant pace, providing for one of the finest performances of 2015. Chastain, dawning a look only matched by Elvira Hancock, commands every scene she's in as the person keeping Standard Oil afloat as her husband refuses to corrupt himself and his company.  \"A Most Violent Year\" is an unbelievably well-directed and well-acted film, but missing is its ability to compel. Though never boring, the atmosphere is more gritty than it is truly tense, and there are a few too many characters that show up with interesting pieces of dialogue but never do much else. No matter: Chandor, in a short time, has revealed himself to be a decade defining filmmaker.",

    "review": "  Most of the complaints I've seen being leveled against this film from some of the recent reviews here say something about it being too slow, or boring, not enough action, etc. Objectively speaking, they might be partially right, but that doesn't make this film objectively bad. A MOST VIOLENT YEAR will probably not be to everyone's taste, particularly those who want something with higher stakes or a more high-octane feel to it, but for people who appreciate a moody, character-driven drama this should do just fine. The film is set in 1981 New York, apparently one of the most violent years on record. Oscar Isaac plays Abel Morales, the owner of a heating oil delivery company who quite ambitious but also cautious in the way he does business. His wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain), is a variation on the gangster's moll who lets her husband run things the way he wants to, but not without letting him hear her opinions. The two make quite a nice pairing and contrast with each other in very interesting ways, most importantly in how to best secure themselves against the rash of violence coming over their city. Thematically, the director J.C. Chandor is very interested in the morality of doing business and the fine line between \"accepted practice\" and gangsterism. It's also a story about an immigrant navigating his way among sharks as he attempts to build his version of the American dream. While this territory has been covered before, J.C. Chandor takes a step back and looks at it with a colder, more steely gaze. Everything from the shot choices to the hazy color correction suggests a calculation that is necessary in a murky, uncertain situation, and the tension that builds up in certain scenes, as well as over the course of the film, is palpable. And everything from the performances and overall put-togetherness of the film conveys the calculated intentions of the director, much like Abel is in his business dealings. Ultimately, given the slow and cerebral nature of the film, this is something easier to admire than actively enjoy. Still, it was a very interesting character study that was able to maintain an excellent level of tension throughout its 2-hour running time.",

Revolutionized in The Godfather and proving it's longevity in Scarface, the subject of the American Dream in film is indeed a popular one. A Most Violent Year is about Tony Montana's boring distant cousin Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) and his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) residing in the New York/ New Jersey area, also trying to carry out his own version of the American Dream. A Most Violent Year is the maverick of American Dream/ gangster movies: Abel Morales is an honorable family man who runs an oil heating company. His wife and the company lawyer (played by Albert Brooks) both try to sway him towards the crime path while he does his best to resist them both... majority of this film is about him doing his best to do everything legally and honorably, and it's also the films biggest downfall because it makes for some pretty dull material. While I respect the themes: that some have to get a little \"dirty\" once in a while to succeed, and that attaining this American Dream is definitely not a black and white affair, I couldn't help but shake the feeling that it's been done so many times before in more entertaining, watchable, and interesting ways.",

I'm thinking from watching the trailer the main character is in the mob.More like a movie about big pussy getting pushed around by actual gangsters. I mean the main character isn't even a tough guy. Now his wife. She's a tough guy. She doesn't take shit from anyone. The main character is a boy scout who doesn't even carry a gun. What a joke.It's just him, his wife, and his lawyer. That's it. That's his crew. No gang what so ever. So what's really stopping one of the gangsters from actually wacking the main character.No one would retaliate or avenge him. He's a nobody. Nobody would miss him if he got wacked.The only real crime here is me getting robbed J.C. Chandor for $10.00 cause I'm thinking I'm gonna watch a gangster movie.",

    "review": "  A fan of mature filmmaking, and fast becoming a trailblazer of it, director J.C. Chandor continues to impress with A Most Violent Year. Unlike what the title would suggest, A Most Violent Year is a slow burn of a film, concerned with the psychology of its subject rather than violence as a vehicle. The film focuses on the efforts of a businessman to hold on to what he has amidst aligning forces threatening to ruin all that he has worked for.The film distinguishes itself through its smart script and excellent performances. The film serves as a meditation on not only crime, but what it takes to both achieve and sustain the American dream. Its' protagonist, Abel Morales, tries to keep himself above water in a system and a climate that thrives on tearing down those on top. Unlike most similarly themed films, Morales is able to resist these temptations to a large degree, and that is what makes him so fascinating. This theme, that of self-control and the strength it requires, is found throughout. Methodically paced, the film is a slow burn. The film is dialogue-driven, and rests on its lead, with Oscar Isaac giving an Oscar worthy performance. While the film does lack in the back-story of Morales and his family, it manages to offer a uniquely conceived story to a saturated genre.4/5 Stars",

    "review": "  \"A Most Violent Year\" is a difficult movie to categorize. It isn't a mafia movie because even though organized crime is mentioned several times there are no sightings of them. Some may call it a thriller, but there are very few moments where you are actually \"thrilled\" by what happens on screen. If there ever was such a type of genre, \"Year\" would go under the category of Slow Burn.A Slow Burn film is one that moves along at well....a slow pace but gives the viewer just enough to intrigue them and have them wanting to know what is going to happen next. \"Year\" saunters on through the story of a man fighting against the person who he knows he must become in order to achieve his version of the American Dream. Abel Morales is a hardworking, tenacious, yet honorable man who wants to take his business to new heights . To do this, he has had to make major sacrifices and avoid running into the same pitfalls that other businessman have that usually involve dealings within the criminal underworld to help get where they want to be. However, in a time where New York City seems to be teeming with murder, rape, and corruption, this will prove to be most difficult for Abel.Oscar Isaac has been in the middle area of \"that guy from that thing\" and \"rising star\" for some time now and \"Year\" is yet another example of the talent this guy has to potentially be Hollywood's next major star. He has a way of using his eyes and tone of voice to convey a sense of tension that is so strong that it makes you squirm in your seat. We see Abel as this man with the ultimate chip on his shoulder from a past we never learn about, but don't necessarily need to. He is a man who has this unrelenting sense of purpose and that purpose is to make something of himself and that something is a figure of power and influence that others respect and admire. In order to achieve this, he wants to do things his own way...the \"right\" way. As we watch Abel struggle with his morality and battle to avoid becoming a gangster, we see that he may come to realize that in order to get where he wants to go, that is what he needs to be in that world at the time. At Abel's side is his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) who \"conveniently\" is the daughter of a Brooklyn neighborhood organized crime boss who may or may have not have put Abel in the position to capitalize on his desires more then he would want to admit. We learn very quickly that Anna is very savvy in the world of business and that her background allows her to see the world in a different way than Abel, which means that in order to get where they want to be, doing the \"right\" thing isn't always the best option. Chastain is so good at playing strong women, and one of the highlights of the film is watching Abel and Anna battle amongst themselves for the title of \"pants wearer\" in their relationship. Writer/director J.C. Chandor has been one of the rising stars of Hollywood amongst filmmakers for a while now and \"A Most Violent Year\" is yet another chapter in his development as one of the industries brightest and captivating story tellers. He crafts this film in a way that keeps us on the hook yet doesn't exhaust us by not overusing the \"Violent\" part of the title. He shows us a dreary world of greed, corruption, deceit that makes us question how any of these characters could even believe in this idea of the fabled American Dream. Seriously, you could argue that there is not one pair of characters that interact throughout the film that could safely say that they trust one another. Everyone seems to be out for themselves in a dog eat dog world, which makes one wonder if that is what the American Dream has become.",

While the filming is a nice throwback to 70s, 80s gangster/crime movies, the characters are weak caricatures of the roles they fill (Jessica Chastain is a little better than the rest though). Contrary to the critical consensus on rotten tomatoes, I did not find this movie either gritty or thought-provoking. The only heft involved is the heft in waiting for something to happen, which minus a few lame catfights between Anna and Abel Morales, never really occurs. The rampant violence, decay, and corruption of the day is demonstrated in a manner consistent with an episode of Hill Street Blues, not a move for the big screen. Save your money & time and avoid this movie.",

    "review": "  A Most Violent Year is a small-lit drama that keeps the character arcs consistent but can barely keep the plot interesting. The movie is set in 1981 in New York City, which is the most violent year with criminal activity. We are introduced to Abel (Oscar Isaac) an owner of his Oil Company as he tries to live up to the expectation of an American Dream. His job is not exactly legal with the way things are handled. His competitor company is trying to sabotage his business by stealing his Oil delivery trucks. His delivery drivers are getting attacked and severely beat up. His wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) convinces him to fight back using violence, as he rejects that idea and hoping a more comprisable way of handling it. Meanwhile, Abel and his business are under investigation by DA Lawrence (David Oyelowo) who is trying to expose the illegal activities his oil business is committing. The direction tries to have that gritty tone of the 80's New York but the plot has trouble in trying to find its own purpose. It is a story about a shady business owner being attacked by another company in a supposedly the worse year with criminal activity. The movie only has two car jacking scenes in it, which may be an exaggeration on the building tension that the movie tries to do. The story is slow moving and uninteresting. Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain both had stunning performances as Abel and Anna. A Most Violent Year is a fair crime drama film that has the tone and tension buildup but the plot has no real surprises that can make it exciting.",

The story tells of an immigrant man who runs and oil company and is constantly in bad terms with his opponents who are trying to destroy his company.I must say, I was expecting an all out mobster film with a lot more action, but instead I got engulfed into a crime drama that took its time to tell a story, which isn't necessarily a bad thing for me. With that being said, I think this film took a little too long to tell its story, with many scenes that zoom by and other scenes stalling. All in all, however, I think the acting and directing made up for most of my flaws with this film and for the most part and I was pleased with the outcome. If you can sit through a film that takes its time to tell a story, then I believe you can enjoy this film for what it is. 6.5/10",

    "review": "  The 2014 crime film, A Most Violent Year, written and directed by J. C. Chandor. While it deals with the most violent year in New York City?s history, it actually is a modern version of the movie The Godfather, but deals with a different ethnic group of people living in the five boroughs of New York City. It stars Oscar Isaac as Abel Morales, the owner of Standard Oil, a relatively new heating oil company. His wife Anna is played admirably by Jessica Chasten, who helps Abel in his business. A young truck driver Julian is at the center of the crisis and is played by Elyes Gabel (star of the television series Scorpion), who is horribly beaten when his oil truck is hijacked. Abel?s company, however, is being investigated by Assistant District Attorney Lawrence (well portrayed by David Oyelowo), who is attempting to expose price fixing, tax evasion and other illegalities perpetrated not only by Morales, but his competitors in the same oil business. Morales?s attorney is played by the ever-capable Albert Brooks as Andrew Walsh, who helps Morales to broker a deal to purchase an oil terminal on the East River, presently owned by a group of Chassidim, led by Josef Mendelssohn, acted by Jerry Adler. Alessandro Nivola plays Peter Forente, a competitor and friend of Abel?s who Abel reluctantly asks him to loan the money he needs to finish the deal for the terminal. The remainder of the supporting cast perform their roles well adding to the suspense and drama needed for the film.To explain the story and plot in further detail, the film is set in early 1981 in New York City. We learn from the very beginning of the film that Morales?s business is under attack and has had thousands of dollars of oil hijacked from his trucks. We also learn about Julian as well and his wife?s thoughts that Abel should fight violence with violence, but Morales is convinced that he does not have to and refuses. While all of this is going on, ADA Lawrence is investigating him and his company for illegal business practices. To secure financial independence, it is here that that Abel is dealing to purchase the fuel oil terminal, which will allow him to store more oil in the summer when oil prices are lower. He puts down a payment of 40% with the remainder due within 30 days when he closes the deal.Moving into his new home, Abel stops what would appear to be an attempted robbery, but what is actually an attempt on his life that we discover later on in the film when Abel?s daughter discovers a loaded gun in the bushes which appears to have been dropped by the robber/hit man. Abel at this point in the story begins to believe that his competitors are trying to intimidate him, so one at a time, he confronts them, with each denying that it is trying to drive him out of business. The head of the teamsters tells him that he should handout guns and fake permits to all his drivers, which Abel refuses to do, believing that this action could bring even more problems to his business and could also ruin his connections with the bank, which was financing the terminal purchase but due to the impending indictments, it decides to cancel it's financing of Abel?s purchase. This action causes Abel to seek financial aid from his competitors, who agree to loan him the money, while he manages to come up with some of the rest.Julian returning to work after recovering from his previous beating is attacked again, but he is carrying a gun and fights back. The police arrive and chase all those involved in the shootout, but they all escape. Abel does manage to intercept a help call from one of his drivers and chases the hijackers, who reveal that they are working for themselves and sold the last shipment to one of Abel?s competitors. Abel talks to this person and secures more of the needed money for the purchase of the terminal. Needing more money, Morales goes to his supposed friend Peter Forente and asks for a loan, which he secures, but on very unfavorable terms. It is here that Abel discovers that his wife has been skimming money from the company and has it in a secret account which can replace the money he just borrowed from Forente. Now having all the money, Abel pays off his debtors and buys the terminal, but unfortunately an angry Julian blames Abel for his problems and demands part of Abel?s good fortune, but kills himself because the police are still chasing him. The ADA agrees with Morales who has convinced him that with the new terminal Morales will have some political influence and suggests that he might help the ADA to secure a higher position. At this point, Abel believes that he has always done the most right thing.The music, composed by Alex Ebert, was influenced by the culture and life of the 1980s and used many synthesizers which helped to highlight the time of the film, as did the costuming and makeup. Cinematography, camera angles, and the well written and navigated script and plot line was handled expertly by the director and writer, Chandor and his cinematographer Bradford Young. The editing by Ron Patane had little problems with continuity as the film seemed to flow seamlessly. The visual effects also contributed to the 1980s feel the movie succeeded in demonstrating. As a fan of Coppola?s The Godfather and whether intended or not, the director has made a 2014 movie that is very similar to Coppola?s with Abel Morales appearing as a young, very righteous, Godfather; he even resembles a young Pacino. The themes of greed and corruption were conveyed well through many subtle messages and symbols shown throughout the film. The film is really worth seeing. GRADE: 5 of 5 crowns",

Oscar Issac is incredible as the intimidating, in over his head, egotistical Abel, who is trying to legitimately grow his business while the cops look into him and his employees are under attack. Equally as captavating is Jessica Chastain as his wife Anna who's mob ties, and inflated ego may do more to harm her family then help.

    "review": "  \"You stole from me!!!\" as Abel shouted to his wife Anna. \"A Most Violent Year\" stars Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain. Two of my new favorite actors in this very moody and gritty crime drama. Set in 1981, considered to be one of the most violent years in the city's history, Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is the hard-working owner of Standard Oil, an up and coming heating oil company. But things turned out when one of his driver Julian (Elyes Gabel) has been hijacked by two armed and unidentified assailants. By that time on, he receive death threats. And unfortunately, his company (Standard Oil) has a case of fraud, tax evasion and felony charges. It seems one of his investors has been behind all of this with some help of the Mafia contacts. Abel is trying to sort things out as he set up meetings to his lawyers, and discuss things to his buyers to resolve all of this problems. The pacing of this film jumps from high to low. There are some really good action scenes that are beautifully shot. The long take shot of sequences are so impressive. It was all intense and I was really into it. One thing I noticed here is the color and saturation of the film. It is dark, and beautifully shot film which feels very \"80's like\". The performances are the best asset which are top notch. I love the performances. One of those film that you would really appreciate the acting. Especially for Oscar Isaac, this guy is so damn good as an actor. His facial expression says it all. I thought from his performance from that film \"drive\", he can be great on what he does. As for Chastain, saw her in that film \"Zero Dark Thirty\". She is one of my favorite actress. She can really handle her role in a very dramatic fashion. Very expressive type of acting and I love her for that. And this guy Elyes Gabel, this guy nailed his performances in here. You kinda feel for his character, from being a jolly worker till such time he became broke. That last scene for him is very intense though. I love the performances, very well executed, and definitely one of the best crime drama films of the year. Definitely deserves any recognition. 4.5/5",

    "review": "  As a precursor to this review, it should be revealed that between crime film classics like The Godfather and Goodfellas, and more recent gems like Killing Them Softly and No Country For Old Men, I count myself a true fan of the genre. And while Oscar Isaac's impressively textured breakout performance in Inside Llewyn Davis had certainly given me a great deal of hope for his role as the reluctant, but driven Abel Morales, this film just didn't deliver. A surprisingly flat performance from Chastain as Morales' wife, Anna, along with pacing issues, and all-too-familiar conflicts left me feeling as though I was watching a highlight reel paying homage to the best crime-thrillers that came before it at its most interesting moments, and those moments simply fell few and far between. What investment I had in Morales came from the hint of Pacino's cool and calculated Michael Corleone, yet it felt like more of an impression and less of a performance with its own spirit. Though the film is shot beautifully, and one gripping chase scene through a dark tunnel did put me on the edge of my seat for a moment, these two highlights just weren't enough to warrant a positive review.A Most Violent Year is a film I sincerely wanted to enjoy in hopes of putting it on the shelf alongside so many other inspired and romanticized takes on organized crime. Unfortunately, this attempt is simply an offer I can refuse.",

    "review": "  What. A. Film.First things first, Oscar Isaac has come such a long way since the abusive/ annoying brute in that catastrophe of a film Sucker Punch. We now see him on screen alongside the always exceptional Jessica Chastain for a wife, and the great Albert Brooks as his accountant. Yeah, I'd want to step up my game too. He commands his business by allocating an honorable work ethic, a methodical code of conduct in his every move, all in the awfully violent year of 1981, New York. The competition is through the roof, his employees are literally facing mortality on a daily basis, smugglers are hi-jacking his product, and his youngest baby daughter of 4 plays with a loaded handgun she finds in their front yard. And the tension doesn't stop there. When we see scene sets next to the Hudson river and an undertone of Tommy guns w/ cigars, I was reminded of the beautiful camera work ala On The Waterfront, and dare I even say, The Godfather. What a treat, go watch it, no regrets will be involved. I promise.",

Set in New York in 1981 this is a slow burning, tense, dark and complex tale of ambition and consequences. It's a crime drama but it evokes classic films of the 70s. The most recent film that I could compare it to in tone would be The Yards. Abel and Anna are husband and wife who run an oil heating business. They skate pretty close to the edge of the law, but when their business is threatened by rivals they need to delve deeper into the darker side. So this superbly acted film becomes much more than a crime thriller, it's a morality tale and character study. Chastain and Isaac are superb in the lead roles, making for a richly crafted film.",

Set in 1981 in a very grey and threatening New York City it tells of one man's desire to live the American Dream without sacrificing his ethics and moral values in an industry, in a City, and at a time, where the other participants do not share such lofty ideals. Caught between those who want to see him fail, a crusading and ambitious District Attorney determined to clean up the industry and a corrupt Teamsters Union our hero, superbly played by Oscar Isaac, battles to retain his honesty and integrity against overwhelming odds assisted by his less scrupulous wife and his trusted attorney.

    "review": "  Being J.C. Chandor's followup to All is Lost and starring Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain, A Most Violent Year sounded impeccable.With all the critical acclaim surrounding A Most Violent Year I feel I may have gotten my hopes up a bit much. I certainly enjoyed the film, but I fully embrace everything in the story. A Most Violent Year embraces a very strong screenplay penned by J.C. Chandor which is full of complex politics, interesting characters and powerful dialogue. So much is going on that it can sometimes be difficult to keep up with in the end. As a means of ensuring that the viewer is able to handle everything as it comes at them, A Most Violent Year follows a fairly slow pace. Yet even then there is so much going on that I never fully understood everything, and the slow pace of the film just meant there was a bit of waiting around in the process. It certainly gave time to allow the tension to build up, but I felt like there could have been more time spent justifying plot points and explaining them to the confused viewers who fail to grasp everything that is happening. I was one of them, and I left the film with quite a few questions to ask. But still, I cannot deny that I enjoyed A Most Violent Year. A Most Violent Year captures an interesting scale. Instead of going straight for a crime concept or focusing solely on the involvement of the characters, A Most Violent Year finds a balance between them and ends up being strong on concept and characters. By that rationale A Most Violent Year ends up being a film which has characters that viewers are likely to care about while maintaining an intrigue in the story's context. Through this, everything in the tale becomes more meaningful for viewers and therefore the atmosphere grows in strength and leaves a lot more room for the tension to develop. And with the deeply involved directorial work from J.C. Chandor, he has no problem succeeding in achieving that. J.C. Chandor captures A Most Violent Year in terms of both narrative and style.Since J.C. Chandor's previous films have managed to make significant achievements with such small budgets, logically giving him $20 million should provide him incredible opportunities as a filmmaker. As he proved on All is Lost, he has a masterful eye for imagery which he brings along to A Most Violent Year to its benefit. He goes for a new angle this time around though as the story is significantly larger in scale than his prior works, and it pays off. The scenery and costumes of the time really assist in establishing the time frame of the film, but what is most impressive is the cinematography. Everything is captured with reasonably distanced cinematography which emphasizes the large scale of the tale to reflect just how widely the narrative points affect the world around them, but more impressively there are some innovative techniques which are used. There is one intense pursuit scene later on in the film which is captured perfectly as it follows the protagonist from many different angles through all the locations and ends up feeling very reminiscent of the intense chase scene from the 1971 thriller classic The French Connection. In that sense, the style of J.C. Chandor's directional work is thoroughly nostalgic and creative with how it plays with imagery. It helps to add to the intense atmosphere of the film, as does the subtle touch of Alexander Ebert's musical score. And without missing a beat, the cast in A Most Violent Year are absolutely flawless.Oscar Isaac is the finest cast member in A Most Violent Year. As the hero at the centre of the story surrounded by complex crime politics, Oscar Isaac manages to ensure that the best of the focus is on him whenever he is on screen through his expressive elements as well as his subtle ones. His line delivery always hits the perfect level of power, and he relays that tension into his physical acting so that even when he is not speaking he makes it clear that he is capturing an intense mood based on his stature or his facial expressions. Oscar Isaac sinks into his role fearlessly on a physical level by embodying the role in every inch of the part and pushing himself, but when it comes to the psychological aspects of the role that is where he truly shines. In his own war with crime and his dedication not to reduce himself to the status of the same people stealing from him, Oscar Isaac pulls off a really strong effort conveying precisely how complicated his situation is all while maintaining a likable sense of charisma which leaves the audiences enjoying his efforts and respecting his easy ability to hold the screen on his own.Jessica Chastain is also powerful. Though she does not receive as much screen time as you might hope for such a critically acclaimed performance, she is still powerful in the role. What she brings to her part is essentially a femme fatale element played into subtlety so that she is actually a powerful character instead of an archetype. The highlight of her role is the nature of the chemistry that she shares with Oscar Isaac as the two just continuously build tension off of each other and make such a powerful duo. Jessica Chastain's supporting effort in A Most Violent Year is very powerful, and her articulate line delivery continues to impress me.David Oyelowo is a powerful supporting effort as well due simply to his strong sense of confidence, and Albert Brooks is a welcome presence. Elyes Gabel also does a nice job.So though it is slow and has a premise which is very packed, A Most Violent Year is another brilliantly written film from J.C. Chandlor who directs with style and manages to bring the most out of his cast.",

Most of the story is dialogue driven with Oscar Isaac (Abel Morales) and Jessica Chastain (Anna Morales) put in adequate performances. As we follow Abel desperately trying to break from his family history of thuggery and crime, there are moments where we realise how impossible this is going to be as the story progresses - but the whole thing is lifeless with a contrived ending that doesn't really fit and is too neat. The cinematography by Bradford Young (Selma) is effectively depressing and is perhaps the most creative dimension of the film. The title suggests that there will be a lot of violence and there isn't much at all. There is so much more that could have been done with this story but the depths of its potential wasn't tapped.",

    "review": "  In the mist of the most dangerous and bloody year for the city of NYC 1981 Morales family are struggling to keep their Oil business alive. JC Chandor directs \"A Most Violent Year\" tells the story of Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) a business owner of Standard Oil a company that distribute heating to residential properties. His business is in jeopardy by constant hijacking of his trucks and attacks to the drivers. Abel is loosing money with the stole heating oil. He still believe that there is a non violent solution to the problem. But his wife Anna Morales (Jessica Chastain) thinks differently. Anna believes that there perpetrators are not the kind of people that you can negotiate to talk about the problem. Violence is the only who can solve this problem. Abel have another problems to solve. Abel Morales and his company under investigation by Assistant of the District attorney (David Oyelowo) for tax evasion, and other illegal practice. Finally Abel is working for commercial independence by teaming up with his attorney Andrew Walsh (Albert Brooks) to struck a deal with a Jewsih group to own a fuel oil terminal on the NY East River. This three events are the main arch of \"A Most Violent Year\" But with is the whole relationship with the main titles and these events. The film takes place like I mentioned earlier in 1981 which is considered the most violent year in city's history. The events shape the Morales family to the point that the most honest man will doubt about how many things you can achieve with the use of force in order to show everyone that your in charge. No matter what you do. Violence is the probably the last action to take. But Knowing that you are surrounded by violence why not use it?Competition, Illegality and growth. These are the three elements that defines the main plot of \"A Most Violent Year\". Abel suffer by the constant attacks of his competitors while the law want Abel's head and his business while he just want to make a living. He is a family man, a good father, he cares about the employees, but most of all he wants to grow. J.C. Chandor creates this Goodfellaseske world in the early 80's with less bloodiness like Scorsese does. But he does with style A Most Violent year is a tense drama with nuance of violence and action. The film develops with a excellent assemble cast. Oscar and Isaac and Jessica Chastain plays perfect as a marriage couple, but play excellent roles as a businessman and matriarch of the Morales family. Albert Brooks is excellent as well. While David Oyelowo perform a good supporting role that needs more time on screen. The film is beautifully shot by Bradford Young and perfectly edited by Ron Patane.",

    "review": "  To say A Most Violent Year isn't a great film is a lie, but I feel the title of the film isn't entirely true to the content it represents. Firstly we hardly see that much violence in the movie, we see two trucks being hijacked, Abel beating a hijacker and Julian shooting himself in the head. If you were to rename films like Taxi Driver or Dog Day Afternoon as The Most Violent Year it would work. Wall Street 3 would be a more suitable name as the film is more a business movie than a crime drama.Oscar Isaac has come a very long way since I saw him in Drive (2011) Isaac is now a very capable leading man, my only issue with his near flawless performance is the lack of memorable moments, throughout the film I was waiting for a moment where Isaac would have a De Niro like moment but no such thing occurred. I think that if Isaac's character Abel delivered vengeance to his enemies the film would have been better in my opinion, in Taxi Driver Travis gets to a boiling point and kills three undesirables, in A Most Violent Year, if Abel had killed one of the hijackers instead of letting him go, seeing Abel's character fall from righteousness to the level of the other criminals would have been a much better viewing experience.The acting in the film is great, especially Isaac's performance, he is comparable to Pacino in the 1970's. Jessica Chastain plays the best role of her career, as Anna Abel's feisty wife who believes violence should be used, Anna is her father's daughter and a strong woman who's behaviour angers Abel. Not forgetting of course the great supporting cast, with great performances by Albert Brooks and Jerry Adler. The film is very comparable to Sidney Lumet's New York movies, Chandor's direction is as always very impressive and very unique.I find it astonishing how the film has received no Academy Award nominations, I believe the film should have been nominated for Best cinematography, Best actor, Best supporting actor and Best actress, this is definitely rather strange as such a diverse and masterfully created modern masterpiece has received no nominations yet has received overwhelming critical acclaim. A Most Violent Year is a modern classic with top class acting, beautiful cinematography and masterful direction which will be looked at as The Godfather of our generation in future years.",

    "review": "  \"A Most Violent Year\" tells the story of a man named Able Morales who tries to run a successful company amidst corruption and violence within his industry. With strong acting performances the film capitalizes on a strong cast and great cinematography. The story itself is very well written and kept me on the edge of my seat. Jessica Chastain's portrayal of Anna Morales, was excellent and in my opinion probably deserved an Oscar nomination. Overall the film is great and shows that corruption can exist anywhere.",

    "review": "  While \"A Most Violent Year\" is a really well done, entertaining movie, and I liked it a lot, it's just not necessarily my style. Which isn't a bad thing, just a matter of taste. But with that in mind, there are still pretty much only positives to talk about.I enjoyed the tension between the anti-gun husband and his gang-raised wife. It's a portrayal of marriage as being a partnership, even to a fault--that even the biggest differences can be worked through and superseded. It's slow, but never boring. It keeps you in the moment while letting you anticipate Abel's (Oscar Isaac) next move. You love this character and admire his strength and integrity. So then when we see him finally at his most vulnerable, we feel close to him. We feel privileged that he shared with us a moment of weakness, much similar to how we feel the first time we watch our dad cry. Jessica Chastain, as his wife Anna, is a magnificent juxtaposition to her husband. She sells the role so well. You don't want to like her, but you do anyway out of respect for Abel.It's one of those movies that is really well done, but will probably be overlooked for all the awards. It's good but it just doesn't sweep you off your feet like you're hoping it does.Twizard Rating: 92",

    "review": "  Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is a Colombian immigrant who's worked his way up to the owner of a heating oil delivery service. He's got it all - money, power, a sexy wife played by Jessica Chastain, and a killer camel-hair coat - but he still wants more. How he gets it is the dramatic question of the latest entry in J.C. Chandor's impressive filmography. The film unavoidably gives off the air of \"The Godfather: Part IV\" (Chandor employs a similar slow-burn technique, violence constantly lurking on the edge of the frame, and Isaac's performance instantly conjures up the ghost of Pacino in \"Part II\"). And yet Chandor takes an alternate route - namely, dramatizing how one climbs the ladder in a society so reliant on fraud and violence without compromising one's morals. That's Abel's dilemma, and it's incredibly engaging to watch, thanks to a fantastic collaboration between Chandor's script and direction and the actors involved, not to mention a tense Pink Floyd-esque score by Alex Ebert. The only real problem is in the Chastain character. Chandor writes her as a pretty flat daughter of a gangster, the kind who 40 years ago would say things like, \"Show me what you got, mister.\" This would all be well and good, but Chastain is simply too good an actress and the character seems an odd fit. Still, this is one of the most sneakily great movies of the year, and more proof that Chandor is one of our most consistent up-and-coming filmmakers.",

    "review": "  Sigh. I was so ready to love this one. As it is, A Most Violent Year is a solid small-scale crime drama more along the lines of Killing Them Softly than the Scorsese-esque show stopper the trailer promised. Violent Year makes vague commentary about the American Dream through its protagonist underplayed by Oscar Isaac and his adamant refusal to believe that through his illegal business practices, forced circumstances, and shady connections he is slowly becoming a powerful criminal. (He has much in common with Niko Bellic from GTA IV, though he lacks his Terminator-esque killing prowess.) The best scenes are between Isaac and the always great Jessica Chastain. You've got to admire competent no bullshit acting when you can get it. Few, if any of the other characters make much of an impression. The film suffers more than it should from a glacial pace. And this is coming from a person who enjoys slow films. This movie is VERY slow. While I have to admire how it maintains a limited focus and is content with a very limited arc for our characters, it damages the impact it might have had. On the plus side A Most Violent Year does give you a feel for crime-ridden 1981 New York and there is an impressively filmed, restrained chase scene that came almost out of nowhere and managed to have consequence on the plot. So while it is beautifully shot and well-acted it fails to be (at least for me) enjoyable or memorable. It's worth renting or downloading and breaking it up into a couple of sessions.",

    "review": "  A carefully plodded thinking mans morality tale, J.C. Chandor's awe-striking and atmospheric latest easily ranks as one of the decade's best crime stories. Many films have charted the less-than-successful attempt of social climbing criminals to go clean (The Long Good Friday, The Godfather Part III, Carlito's Way). This film does the same with a scrupulous business unsuccessfully trying to STAY clean. Its a sad and cynical parable reflecting American politics and commerce--not just today but for as the story knowingly relays through the ages. Through generous amounts of dialogue, the film plays out like a high-stakes white-knuckle chess match. You'd think that these sequences would feel too talky, but they only build the tension and suspense of this searing drama, which works excellently as both a character study and proto-gangster story. Like every word in a James Joyce novel, the lines of this film just like the photography and shots - are meticulously chosen and controlled expressions of these powerfully drawn characters.In this R-rated crime-thriller set in New York City during 1981, an ambitious immigrant (Isaac) fights to protect his business and family (Chastain, et al) during the most dangerous year in the city's history. Without the brilliant lead performance, itself meticulous and controlled, A Most Violent Year wouldn't amount to such an auteurial tour-de-force. If Inside Llweyn Davis didn't already compound this fact: Isaac is one of the best actors working today. With Chastain, who builds upon an already ridiculously great CV (The Help, Tree of Life, Zero Dark Thirty, Interstellar), he brings immense heft to a thought-provoking, weighty story, and yes violent story. Whats amazing is that this film bowed in 2014 and amassed zero Academy Award nominations. Someone should've yelled miss-deal. Bottom line: My Favorite Year",

    "review": "  J. C. Chandor's \"A Most Violent Year\" has some of the best cinematography (and acting) we've witnessed in 2014. We can credit Bradford Young (who was also the cinematographer on \"Selma\") and Oscar Isaac for that. Isaac has become a favorite actor of mine. He plays Abel Morales, a wealthy businessman (he's in the oil industry) who wants to become wealthier and more powerful - he's trying to live out the American Dream. There's a catch, though: he wants to achieve all of this in a moral and honest way. His wife, Anna (a strong - and underused - Jessica Chastain), is a bit duplicitous. At times she's supportive, and other times she's quick to mock Abel (she shoots a deer after Abel hit it with his car and hesitated to put it out of its misery with a tire-iron). Some of the film's greatest moments come when they're talking, which usually leads to intense arguing (mostly on Anna's part). Note how Abel (tries to) remain calm every time. We see the anger bubbling up inside him, but if he lets it out then he knows he's turning into someone he doesn't want to be: a criminal. The film takes place in a muddied-looking New York City in 1981 - one of the most violent years in New York's history at the time (which is where the film's title comes from, obviously). In fact, the violence starts right away as we witness one of Abel's trucks being hijacked at a toll stop. More of his trucks get hijacked, and if that weren't enough, the DA's office (\"Selma's\" David Oyelowo - in another great performance) is after him as well for tax evasion and other serious legal jargon. He's also in the middle of closing a deal for an oil terminal that will give him direct access to the East River, and greater control over his competitors. He uses his life's savings to place a deposit, and hopes his bank will loan him the rest. When the DA's office closes in, the bank pulls out - leaving Abel to get creative in trying to find ways to secure his contract, and not lose his deposit. Discover the rest for yourselves.Most of the characters (including Anna) think the best way to fight violence is with violence. Abel is wise enough to know that fighting back would only intensify the violence. Instead, he fights the violence with his words. With the exception of one chase scene - which surely drew inspiration from William Friedkin's \"The French Connection.\"It's clear Chandor has tapped into his love and respect of the Great Directors of the 70s - from Francis Ford Coppola (many of the scenes borrow lighting from \"The Godfather\") to Sydney Lumet (especially the theme of resisting the urge to fight back with violence as witnessed in \"Dog Day Afternoon\" and even \"12 Angry Men\") to Friedkin (as witnessed in the film's big chase scene mentioned earlier).I've read many people describing \"A Most Violent Year\" as a \"mob movie\" or a \"wanna be mob movie.\" I disagree with the mob label. This is the story of a man who is surrounded by the mob, but he doesn't allow himself to go down that path. In fact, one of the film's greatest moments comes at the end when Abel tells another character that he's always taken the \"most right path\" in life. Think about those words: most right. That doesn't say he takes THE right path, but the MOST right path he believes he can take. That's the true power Abel displays - and the best way he fights all the violence.",

    "review": "  For the most violent year in New York City's history, there's fairly little violence depicted visually.For viewers paying close attention to the radio broadcasts, it's a different story. Wink.Oxymoronic also considering it's an independent film and a period piece.Elaborately set during the winter of 1981; it doesn't feel very 'independent.'It stands at $4.6M in the box office, according to Box Office Mojo and Rotten Tomatoes; a tragedy considering it's $20M production budget.This may be a reflection of late distribution, finally releasing wide in theaters on January 30.Which is intrinsically tied to its complete lack of Oscar nominations.A gosh-darn-shame, considering the filmmaker's credentials.As the scholars say, J. C. Chandor is an 'auteur.'Which Google defines as, \"A filmmaker whose personal influence and artistic control over a movie are so great that the filmmaker is regarded as the author of the movie.\"A less frilly description is writer/director.J. C.'s crafted three flicks thus far, including 2011's Margin Call and 2013's All Is Lost.Both were critically well-received, and particularly the former contains my stamp of approval.In a way, he's comparable to Woody Allen; relying less on elaborate cinematic sequences or stylistic editing, and focusing heavily on story and strong acting.'Great movies for adults' is another way to say it.A Most Violent Year's no different.The cast is phenomenal.Oscar Isaac (of Inside Llewyn Davis fame) is fantastic in the leading role.Albert Brooks is excellent, but did you expect anything less?No; of course not. The man's a master of his craft.Another master, Jessica Chastain, delivers a remarkable performance.The word 'snub' is overly bandied about.But if Laura Dern's five minutes of Wild screen time total up to a Best Supporting Actress nomination, one can easily argue Chastain deserves it more.All in all, A Most Violent Year hasn't received the credit it deserves.It's written well, full of strong performances and compelling throughout.Catch it in theaters while you still have the chance!",

    "review": "  1980s New York was a vicious, brutal and terrifying place. Times Square was a haven for pimps, prostitutes and street thugs, the Bowery an oppressive maze of dank bars and belligerent drunkards, and Central Park a decaying and lawless wasteland. You only have to watch the grindhouse films of the time, like \"New York Ripper\" or \"Basket Case\", to see the kind of milieu that New Yorkers had to wade through - it was a tough place for tough characters.J C Chandor's third film as writer/director explores what strength and what sacrifices were needed to create and grow a big business at a time where gangsters ruled the streets and corporate disagreements were settled with a bullet. Telling the story of Abel, the ambitious owner of an up-and-coming heating oil business, \"A Most Violent Year\" finds its drama in desolate urban landscapes, bleak and dangerous suburbs, and threat-laden conversations that could easily spill into violence. Abel is on the verge of the biggest deal of his life that will catapult him into the big leagues, but he's also dealing with his vehicles being hijacked, his drivers being beaten up in broad daylight, and an investigation into his finances that could bring the whole house of cards crashing down. He is always on the move, careering from meeting to deal to snatched time with his wife and family, keeping his life in some kind of precarious balance, though in the most violent year one of the world's most violent cities has ever known, it's only a matter of time before the cracks start to show. \"A Most Violent Year\" takes its cue from the quiet, gut-punch morality dramas of Sidney Lumet and James Grey rather than the visceral and stylised thrills of Scorsese and de Palma, more a character study that a gangster epic (indeed, Abel is adamant throughout that, unlike Henry Hill, he never wanted to become a gangster). But within these bounds Chandor delivers a thrilling, riveting and enormously impressive film, anchored by outstanding performances from Oscar Isaac as the intimidating and charismatic Abel, and Jessica Chastain as his viperish wife, all coiled venom and threat waiting to be unleashed on a world that has no idea what's in store for it. And amongst the business meetings and desperate deal-making, Chandor crafts not only one of the best chase scenes since \"Carlito's Way\", but also a fantastically melodramatic ending that proves one thing - in this life of oil and crime, there most certainly will be blood, though not always from the person who most deserves it.\"A Most Violent Year\" is a subdued film that spreads its canvas as wide as Abel's ambition - as he absorbs the Manhattan vista from the riverside, it's difficult not to think of his predecessors, all the way back to that Scottish king, who also regarded the world as theirs for the taking. And in its final moments Chandor unleashes the potential for Abel's story to stretch far beyond this violent year into a decade of political intrigue, bloodshed and moral murkiness reminiscent of Michael Corleone's journey. For once, it's a story that will be well worth the telling.",

    "review": "  A Most Lengthy Film: An Interesting Subject and a Great Cast Aren't Enough to Pull Us ThroughYoung Critic1/29/2015J. C. Chandor is not mainstream. The director has made films such as Margin Call about the 2008 stock market crash, All is Lost about an old man lost at sea, and most recently with A Most Violent Year. While the artistry is still there with A Most Violent Year, the pace is a little too slow for our liking. A Most Violent Year is the story of Abel Morales (Inside Llewyn Davis' Oscar Isaac) a Hispanic immigrant who has fought his way up honestly to the top of a gas company in New York City. It's 1981 and NYC is crawling with crime, Morales' trucks are constantly hijacked and he is losing a lot of money. Morales believes that his competitors are behind the attacks, but even so he refuses to play dirty despite the pleas of his lawyer, Andrew Walsh (Albert Brooks) and his vicious wife (Jessica Chastain) to save his company. The story is simple enough, but the negotiation talks and the long camera pans, while lovely, drag a little too long. The film's two hours could have easily been one and a half. Faster pace would have given a more gripping effect so as to keep the audience's rapt attention. Despite that, there are some extremely enjoyable scenes, especially a chase scene in which we see the state of the NYC subways in the 80s. The performances are great, Oscar Isaac once again proves he can take on leading roles, after his breakout performance in the Coen brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis. But the real star of the show in Jessica Chastain, whose mastery of the role and simple gestures show her expertise and skill. Thanks to her petitions she was able to get the costume department noticed as well; she thought that her character would only wear Armani, being the daughter of a rich gangster. Thus the costume department was able to track down dresses from '81, and have Chastain's character stand out amongst others visually as well. The lighting is very appropriate for the theme of the film. Abel seems to be constantly in darkness, whether while he's strolling around his house or negotiating at his office. In contrast the outside and NYC is extremely bright, almost as if evoking a sense of hope. The presence of snow is also used in a purifying manner (showing it pure white, when all city-people know that their snow is never white). The film is evocative, but the lengthy feel is deafening and ends up sucking too much of your energy. B",

It zooms in on a few individuals but it's really about the forces swirling in American life at the time which gives it a lot of layers give the view a lot to think about.",

Its strength is Isaac's portrayal of the main character trying (and failing, sadly) to hold onto his integrity. A couple edge-of-the-seat suspenseful sequences and Oscar Isaac are all I can recommend.",

Chandor's script is quite superb and further enhanced by fantastic performances from Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain. Chastain chews the scenery while Isaac is incredibly restrained and understated as he tries to stick to his morals as the only clean man in a dirty world. Gorgeously photographed by Bradford Young who captured several of my favourite shots of the year with a fantastic score from Alex Ebert. This film completely drew me in and didn't let me go until the end and I loved its cynical at a disillusioned and greedy America.",

    "review": "  Maybe I had the wrong impression upon entering \"A Most Violent Year\". For some crazy reason, I expected violence. Not that I'm necessarily a proponent of it, its just that, ah-nevermind. A long and drawn out mess, well acted mind you, it continues on like a medical assembly project with a monotony that becomes hard to muster. There are spurts of interesting, quotable dialogue, and moments of suspense, but for the most part, this film misses the mark. Its stars the fresh face of Oscar Isaac, who proves again(remember \"Inside Llewyn Davis\") that he is going to be a force to be reckoned with for years to come. He plays the ever-willful, well-dressed Abel, an entrepreneur whose morality is currently in conflict with the nature of the beast that is the oil trucking business he's at the helm of. His wife with mob ties on hold is played by an icy, intense Jessica Chastain, who looks the part as well as she embraces it. Abel constantly allows the people around him, including his wife, to walk all over him with their criticisms while he constantly does the opposite of any suggestion they make. His trucks are being highjacked and the entire film's mission is trying to find out who is responsible. There are a number of suspects, and its all rather untimely as it is happening while Abel is in the midst of acquiring a very large property to expand his businees. While this dilemma takes place another transpires when a district attorney informs Abel he will be soon be indicted for unspecified reasons. All I could think about while watching Isaac in this film was how appropriate it would be to cast him as Michael Corleone if the Godfather were to be redone. He has all the potential to be the perfect gangster, and this film doesn't allow him to be, even though it was marketed as such. I thought I was going to see a gangster flick, and what I got was a film about the thralls of the fuel currier industry. No matter how well the outcome of that premise may be, its just not my cup of tea.",

    "review": "  It's not often to see a movie focusing on a commendable businessman, especially when it is surrounded by the gritty girth of corruption and crime in early 80s New York. Upon first glance, it is easy to mistake this film as a rather savage gangster drama when in reality it is almost everything but. The film centers around a businessman in the oil industry who is determined to preserve his integrity and decency even though his substantial predicament would merit, in the eyes of the people closest to him, a less noble method to garner the desired resolution. The film is wonderfully acted, written, and shot with a graceful pace to boot. However, what appeared as a rather \"eventful\" movie upon first glance turned out to be not very eventful after all. Although there are things happening in the film, nothing in the film really feels substantial or climactic. The film feels like a series of events which, despite their fantastic execution, just feel small. The title stresses the point in time in which the events of this film take place, but the film does not allow the viewer to truly feel this \"violent\" aspect (perhaps a more fitting title could be \"A Most Inconvenient Year\"). Despite this flaw, though, this is certainly not a bad movie. It has great characters and strong morals. It just would have been nice if there was a little more offered here.",

Scenes that are quiet and somber one second become big and loud the next. There's a way to pull this off, but this film can't do it. The main focus of the story is about a man trying to maintain an honest business in the chaotic violence surrounding him. Nothing wrong with that, but the film does start juggling too many plot points and storylines and resolves them either half-heartedly or attempts to pull of a shocking ending that comes across as laughable rather than unexpected.The dialogue is really weak, too. Make a drinking game of how many times characters say \"I know\" or \"You're probably right\". You'll be dead in an hour. Oscar Isaac's performance suffers a bit, too. The guy goes from zero to shouting too easily. It's a shame. He's pretty solid when he's not required to shout at someone.Most of the violence is implied rather than shown, and for a title called A Most Violent Year, couldn't the story take place over a year instead of 33 days?If there is one bright spot, it's Jessica Chastain.

He is mesmerizing to watch as he struggles to make an honest living in a crime-ridden city who punishes those who do not play by its rules. Questions about the nature and basis of his morality and his motivations kept me absorbed for the entire movie. Pitched against him are the fragile, the ruthless, the self-serving the weary. And somehow he seems to rise above them all. However, I wonder if I would have been less gripped if it weren't for the dramatic score which infused the movie with some existential anxiety that something really important is about to happen. I questioned the relationship between the main characters. Chastain's character seemed like a bit of a caricature and there was something off about their relationship. I felt somewhat manipulated at the end. Not because it didn't tie the strings together but because what had preceded the ending had also been heavily story driven.",

I admittedly have a soft spot for films set in this era, and that part is so well done. But the story is compelling, the performances uniformly very good, and the film is original and not for viewers who need to see something explode every five minutes to be satisfied.

    "review": "  Chandor (All is Lost) is one of the more prolific young directors working. With AMVY, an adult mystery-drama-thriller, he screams of the classics: tension of French Connection, quiet of Chinatown, and menace of Mean Streets. It's a fantastic period piece that creates an authentic, distinct look at 1980s New York, while tonally replicating films from that era. Is it a bit TOO quiet and a bit TOO slow at times? Yep...but the taut skill on display is too good to ignore.Abel Morales, a successful, hardworking oil company owner, tries to thrive and survive during 1981 NYC, the most violent year in history. Despite this premise, the crime-action is more a successfully imminent background thought than a constant in-your-face presence. As the movie progresses and ultimately gets better, the subtle suspense builds, and each individual incident pushes Morales closer to his breaking point. Isaac shines in the protagonist role, playing one of the coolest characters around: broken yet proud, strong yet vulnerable, decent yet pressed, and shrewdly bad-to-the-bone. I wish Chastain was a bit more up to the task as his ominous, hardly-doting wife, but luckily she's not a huge distraction to the otherwise stellar acting by some of Hollywood's great new talents.Throughout the solid work being done, we are presented with some great things to ponder: wanting the American dream without knowing why; struggling to be successful without becoming corrupt; juggling humility and pride in a world that drains you. Unfortunately the character's relationships with these different questions bring the movie to a bore at times. Mostly though, it manages to be a solid little award-season drama.",

    "review": "  A MOST VIOLENT YEAR is masterful filmmaking. Digging through a year of film, it's hard to find a movie as well strapped together as this one, aside from maybe WHIPLASH. J.C. Chandor has crafted a meticulous look at one of New York City's most crime-ridden years, 1981. Taking cues from the master filmmakers of the 1970s and 80s - Scorsese, Pakula, Coppola, and Lumet, in particular - Chandor sets his sights on the American dream, the crime that defiles it, and the men that make their own paths. We follow Abel - played by Oscar Issac in his best performance yet, emulating but not completely copying the likes of Pacino - who wants nothing but to run a clean, good business. There's just one thing: the odds, and the city, are against him and any other man that try to define the standard criminal means and minds of the streets and businesses of NYC. Abel is married to Anna, an honest and faithful wife, whose gangster father owned the company before them and who still has a little bit of that Brooklyn edge to her - she doesn't take shit from anyone, and God forbid you go against her husband too. Jessica Chastain and Oscar Issac provoke incredible chemistry between each other - a husband and wife that know how to separate business and love, and still manage to thrive. Showing his true acting chops in 2011's DRIVE, Albert Brooks shines yet again in this film, playing the family's lawyer - a real Tom Hagen character. The cast here is beyond wonderful, with even more names: David Oyelowo as the attorney coming after Abel for all the wrong reasons, Alessandro Nivola, and Elyes Gabel. Together, they form the foundation of a film that not only totally enthralls its audience, even in its slower moments, but pulses with passion and depth. While this film keeps the consistency of Chandor's previous films - all dealing with the similar theme of men in the midst of pure crises - A MOST VIOLENT YEAR sets the new standard for American filmmaking. There was a moment during this film when I realized I was watching a new American classic and it invigorated me in ways most movies cannot. Shot digitally, but saturated in the brilliant, vibrant, milky hues of 70's film, this is a remarkably gorgeous film. Bradford Young is proving to be one of the most prominent upcoming names in cinematography - up there with the likes of Emmanuel Lubezki, Robert Elswit, and more. With a young director with a story to tell and a morale to convey, a cast of professionals, a brilliant Director of Photography, a loosely electric soundtrack, and one of the greatest car chases of all time, A MOST VIOLENT YEAR is my favorite film of 2014, tied with WHIPLASH. See this movie and relish its power and beauty. Here is a film that holds complete control over all its elemental ingredients and harnesses them to great effect. This is a movie in line with the absolute best of all time - like The Godfather - which is ironic because it's actually quite anti-gangster. Marketed as a classic gangster tale, this movie takes the genre and flips it on its head, blending elements from previous great crime movies and making them even better. That's more than you should ask for from a movie.",

Mostly this is due to actors making the best of the material and decent cinematography.Quite simply, this was not a story worth telling. The film is painfully slow and drawn out (one of the worst things you can say about a film is that it seemed much longer than it actually was) with very little action and, well, violence. That would all be fine if the plot was compelling in other ways, but it just isn't. The stakes are low, the characters are dry and one-dimensional, and there isn't much for the audience to actually care about or root for. Should we really care if some guy closes a deal on a piece of waterfront property to expand his heating oil business in 1981? Ultimately, the film mostly consists of Oscar Isaac sulking around, having conversations, and making uncomfortably-long eye contact with various people. Don't be fooled by the critical reception. This is apparently one of those films that critics will themselves to like, but which will leave most viewers perplexed by the praise.",

    "review": "  This is the first believable mob movie I have seen, and that includes stories purported to be \"true.\" MVY is about an honest man living in a mob-run world -- complete with stifling regulations often forcing people to break the law to stay in business -- who is not naive, but still decides to evolve his business as legally and ethically as possible. Everyone in this film is a \"good guy\" doing the best he can by his own measures, and trying to get along with others in an environment of seemingly insurmountable corruption. The flavor of greater NYC is captured beautifully in each person's temptation to act by pure self-interest, but ultimately acquiescing to a general spirit of mutual cooperation keeping the organism of New York City alive.",

    "review": "  \"A Most Violent Year\" is a good slow smolder full of restrained tension and nuance. It is one examination of the \"American Dream\" and what it takes to achieve it.Oscar Isaac is perfect as Abel Morales, understated at most times yet believable and charismatic. He has his own moral code, following \"the most right choice\". He says that the end result is never in doubt, the trick is in choosing the most right way to reach it. He lives and breathes his personal ambition to the point that it is not ambition but rather a natural thing build into his genetic code. At one point he is asked why he wants all this (success) to which Abel responds that he doesn't understand the question.Abel's wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain), provides the on the surface emotion. Where Abel can be cool, calculated, and focused, Anna is the fire in the family. Flashy with her Armani dresses and long fingernails, she is also the mama lion, ready to draw blood when her territory is infringed upon. Her performance is a lot of fun to watch.Visually, the film is great. Plenty of background and depth for the characters to inhabit. This film takes place in 1981 and has somewhat of the gritty feel of films such as \"The French Connection\". The background never overshadows the characters and the framing never constricts the performances. The scenery is there to set this film in a time and place, one real enough to feel, hear, and smell.This film may be \"too slow\" for some, those that need the instant jolts, the unnecessary and illogical twist endings, or unrealistic and over the top shootouts. The few visceral thrills the film provides are very effective within the steady realistic pacing of the film. Avoid this film if you don't like the idea of considering what motivates people and psychologically evaluating what actually makes people tick. Definitely check this film out if you like good character pieces and performances with beautiful yet unobtrusive cinematography. This is a hidden gem among the 2014 crop of films.Blarv Score: 8.8 out of 10",

    "review": "  (76%)There are multiple reasons why this should be a prime target for most cinema fans, but the main reason of all is the ever impressive Oscar Isaac. He's fantastic here in the lead role toiling against what feels like everything to legitimately succeed as a fuel dealer during a crime plagued era in New York history. While backing him up brilliantly is Jessica Chastain as his glamorous, tough, yet fully supportive wife. The direction from the outset is silky smooth, while still very calculated. But there are clear issues surrounding the film's momentum as this flat-out refuses to break away from its total sense of realism, meaning this is a easy film to respect, but fun to watch it ain't. Although in terms of a quality crime drama with real refinement in-front and behind the camera then look no further.",

    "review": "  \"When it feels scary to jump, that is exactly when you jump, otherwise you end up staying in the same place your whole life, and that I can't do.\"Over the past three years director J.C. Chandor has delivered three solid films which in my opinion have been overlooked by mainstream audiences. In Margin Call I was surprised with how well Chandor had written the screenplay for his financial thriller with very fast paced dialogues. Then in his next project (All is Lost), Chandor directed a film with hardly any dialogue whatsoever and managed to keep me engaged with Robert Redford's quiet performance as he struggled to survive at sea. And now in Chandor's recent film, A Most Violent Year, he also delivers a unique crime drama which resembles other classic films like Chinatown and The Godfather trilogy. Chandor has now crafted three great films that are all very different from each other. Despite admiring Chandor for his great screenplays, my favorite film of his is All is Lost which didn't really require any dialogue, so he doesn't necessarily rely on that strength of his. A Most Violent Year stands out thanks to some fantastic performances from a talented cast, some beautiful grayish camera work from Bradford Young (Selma and Ain't Them Bodies Saints), a great production design which recreates New York City in the early 80's in a very realistic way, and of course a strong and gritty screenplay written by Chandor. This is a very slow paced film which delivers on the dynamics between each character more than on traditional action scenes. What stands out the most in A Most Violent Year is the atmosphere that Chandor is able to recreate. Sometimes it feels like not much is going on, but the way the characters interact with one another keeps us engaged and interested. The film focuses on Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) an immigrant and uprising owner of a private oil company who is trying to close a deal on an important property which would boost his business. It seems that his competitors aren't very happy with his rise. The world of private oil companies is dominated by gangsters, but Abel wants to accomplish the American dream legally. Unfortunately his trucks are being hijacked and he's losing thousands of dollars in the process. He is desperately trying to figure out which of his competitors is behind these actions, but Lawrence (David Oyelowo), the officer in charge, doesn't seem to have a clue. He is more interested in opening a file against Abel's company on federal charges for tax evasion. Abel tries his best to remain an honest man, but his wife Anna (Jessica Chasten), whose father is a mobster, will do what it takes to protect her family if Abel doesn't take care of things. All these things threaten Abel's determination to remain legit and find a way to stay afloat, but he is determined to do so. Albert Brooks plays his lawyer, Andrew Walsh.The performance from Oscar Isaacs stood out for me. He reminded me of Al Pacino's performance as Michael Corleone with is calmed and determined demeanor. Things go very wrong for him, but Abel tries to remain calm and confident trying to gain back control of things. Jessica Chastain is fantastic as his wife. There is a scene where she finds her daughter playing with a gun and her reaction was priceless. The strongest moments of the film are when these two characters interact with each other. She also has a great scene with David Oyelowo where she threatens him to leave her family alone. She may be married to an honest man, but her father's blood runs through her veins. Albert Brooks was fascinating as well despite not being on screen very much. I enjoyed his scenes and his presence is sort of the balancing point for Abel who sometimes wants to do things too legit. The grey tone of the film builds the atmosphere of the story and maintains us engaged despite the slow pacing. There is a fantastic chase scene that takes place two thirds into the film that worked really well and moved the story along, but it was the small interactions between Abel and his wife, between him and other business associates that really make this film stand out. It manages to remain an engaging and gripping thriller without having much action going on thanks to the performances and the atmosphere of the film. A Most Violent Year is a stylish thriller that hits the mark once again for Chandor, and he shouldn't be overlooked from now on.",

    "review": "  The underworld of heating oil. This is about an owner of an oil company (Oscar Isaac), who makes a big move on a property, but then has surrounding events start to occur that may jeopardize his entire company's future. At one point, this film was in the talks of being considered for big time Oscar consideration; a serious, gangster period piece from the early 1980's, what's not to love? Well, I can imagine their surprise when they drew a complete goose egg in the nomination department. I was actually not looking forward to this, as I thought the trailer looked mediocre at best. There was just nothing about it that looked appealing, so I am glad to say that this is actually way better than it looks. It's really a different movie than you may imagine it to be; what would you think a movie called \"A Most Violent Year\" would be about? Maybe... violence? While the threat of violence is ever present and while it sometimes does come down to it, these are actually very reasonable people that DON'T actually want brutality, they're more interested in finding a more sensible solution. Obviously in a movie like this that stars semi-gangsters, it is going to eventually come down to some sort of power play involving savagery, and while it is always startling, it is never excessive or grotesque. This is really just this man trying to run his company, and you're watching him gradually get in over his head, like a frog slowly becoming boiled. All the pieces of this work well in a smartly put together film. Oscar Isaac has nothing but big things in store for the rest of his career, and he is sure to blow up these next couple of years, as he is attached to not one, but two upcoming geek properties (Star Wars and X-Men). Jessica Chastain turns in great work like she always does, but at this point, it's kind of expected, given her track record. The thing I most enjoyed about this was the aesthetic of it; this is one of those rare movies that takes place in the 80's, but doesn't reek of it. I loved all of the costuming here, as it all says high class, but hard work was involved obtaining it. There's good lighting, intense moments filled with fierce eye contact and lots of great scenes featured throughout. It's not even really 100% a crime move, but it hits all of those beats that you crave, the ones you have come to expect from all of the classics. This is a very good movie that unfortunately never reached its target audience.",

    "review": "  I was very excited to see A Most Violent Year. I am a big Oscar Isaac fan, I really like Jessica Chastain and I was very curious to see what director J.C. Chandor would do after All Is Lost. Well, I'm very happy to say that A Most Violent Year is an incredibly interesting slow-burning thriller!THE GOOD:+ The acting in this film is truly incredible. Oscar Isaac gives an award-worthy performance as Abel Morales, a man who is only trying to do what he thinks is right. He demonstrates emotion and gives a tame yet touching performance. Jessica Chastain, though not in the film all that much, is absolutely incredible as well. The rest of the supporting cast were excellent, with mostly unknown actors.+ The cinematography is some of the best I've seen all year. The colour-palette is unique and some of the shots of the city were breathtaking. Each frame felt like a beautiful painting. Bradford Young really has an eye for cinematography, and I want to watch more of his films in the future.+ I actually found myself enjoying the story which seemed uninteresting at first glance. I normally wouldn't care about crime in the fuel industry, but these actors made me care. Though the pace is slow, it rarely drags or feels boring. + The lighting is amazing and should have been nominated at the Academy Awards. The musical score from Alex Ebert is reminiscent of Bach and works well for the picture.+ The writing is great, featuring realistic dialogue and really tense moments. The directing by J.C. Chandor is excellent as well.THE BAD:- There are some moments that were boring and seemed very useless. There is one long scene in particular that felt completely unnecessary. OVERALL: A Most Violent Year is a visual masterpiece with incredible acting, great direction and a very interesting story. See it!RATING: 8.5/10",

The 80's were a tumultuous time in New York, both economically and in terms of crime, which Oscar Isaac's character gets caught in. Isaac, supported by the fiery Jessica Chastain as his wife, plays an oil mogul who is being ripped off by thugs hijacking his shipments. On top of dealing with internal and external problems within his company, the District Attorney's office is investigating Isaac and his agents for embezzlement and tax evasion, among other things. Isaac is the cathartic protagonist who can't catch a damn break, and even though we know he is a criminal, we wish he would be able to find a respite from his troubles. Isaac and Chastain built the American dream but at a very high social cost; creating enemies and becoming immersed in legal trouble in the process. The ensemble does a fine and convincing job all around; I thought Chastain's performance was the best, and it really showcased her passionate side as an actor. Though the film was gritty and dark in parts, as well as extremely complicated, it sustained a high level of interest and moved at a very good pace. There were several plot twists, and this film really showed what can happen when we get caught over our head in problems we have created ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- A-",

    "review": "  A film about the lies that we tell to ourselves to survive, J.C. Chandor's film about 1981 New York is brilliant and full of great performances. Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain lead a phenomenal cast in one of the best acted films of last year/this year. Watching these two go back and forth is just as fun as any big budget blockbuster. And Chandor's script and self-assured direction is so perfect for the story that he wants to tell that you can't help but be engaged throughout.I think it is too dismissive to see this film as too slow or meandering in nature, when really its pacing is deliberate to give the characters and the plot a natural amount of time to develop. Although the events of the film are pretty fantastic to most of us, they never feel over sensationalized, and it feels like something out of real life. Chandor establishes this tone by not over utilizing his score and by keeping a cool and light tone to the cinematography.The film never feels over stylized, and so you're less aware of the techniques behind the camera, than the characters on the screen. This film's plot is so dense that if you really care about it, you need to be paying attention at all times. However, I think if you focus too much on the plot, you'll miss the point of the film. This is a film about characters who are trying to be something and do something better with their lives, but have to lie to others and/or lie to themselves to get there.With a fantastic supporting cast including Albert Brooks and David Oyelowo, Chandor puts his characters at the focus of the film. This is one that you won't want to miss at all, or miss by doing something else while you're watching it. It's dense, smart, and powerfully acted, and it's one of the best films of 2015 so far.",

Although it falls short of the Godfather vibe it was clearly aiming for with its choice of lighting and thematic parallels, the film excels on a level of its own and explores dark corners of the decaying 80's New York lifestyle in a poignant, fully realized manner. With this one, up-and-coming film studio A24 delivers another independent delight further showcasing the hidden potential that lies within smaller film studios nowadays often unnoticed amongst all of the less mentally demanding blockbusters.

    "review": "  An excellent film with a terrific story and some amazing performances from the cast. Very smartly written and done this film is a treat because it deals first of all with a topic we rarely get to see in films or hear about in daily news. Second of all the choices made by the main character to avoid violence through firearms is an example of integrity and refusal to succumb to a certain facility and escalation in violence. This of all the film is a fascinating portrait of a man with values and ready to make the choices necessary to save his business. The screen alchemy of the two leads is incredibly subtle and layered. both confirm here the amazing talent they possess to captivate an audience and express the most complicated feelings being felt by human beings. A great smart film with a beautiful photography, an incredible soundtrack and some amazing natural locations that truly gives you the feeling you are in the 80's. Thumbs up. It's probably one of the best film to hit the theaters this year.",

    "review": "  Real solid film right here. A Most Violent Year is director J.C. Chandor's (All Is Lost 2013) film about a man who's trying to just do what's right and not get sucked into the gangster life style. Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is trying to be an honest business man. He owns his own business and is the process of currently expanding into new land with his business partner Andrew Walsh (Albert Brooks). He runs into a few snags though. A group of men keep hi-jacking his supply trucks and he's losing money fast. He also is being investigated by the DEA run by their chief officer Lawrence (David Oyelowo) who's putting claims that their is illegal activity happening in Abel's company. Back at home Abel's wife Anna (Jessica Chastain who looks absolutely stunning in this role) is concerned about the safety of their family after an intruder almost breaks in armed with a gun. Abel's life is slowly spiraling out of control and its up to him to get things straight. The film is really good especially for anyone who likes a good crime drama. It's not on the level of The Godfather or anything, but it's an interesting story about how far a man will go with his morality to do what he feels is right. Isaac does a wonderful job portraying Abel and you really feel for him throughout the film. The film is light on action (don't let the trailers fool you), but is a nicely paced drama. Overall, I highly recommend checking this one out if it's playing in your area.",

    "review": "  Erected with thought and utter attention to detail comes J. C. Chandor's third directorial output; a gangster film that is entirely reluctant to call itself as such. Instead of placing itself on an immensely high and treacherous pedestal, as such would incur if Chandor was willing to embark upon a Godfather-esque route with this work as the film threatens to do so numerous times, A Most Violent Year instead denotes itself as a picture on the value of honourability in business; particularly a business that demands to refute those who believe in such. Starring the impeccable Oscar Issac in what many will consider his finest role, the film traverses the difficulties he faces as he is forced to overcome difficulties in terms of his fuel supply company in a year which statistically is considered one of the most violent in the history of New York. Issac plays Abel Morales, whose initial moral compass reminds me distinctly of Michael Corleone's first moments in Francis Ford Coppola's original gangster classic. His desire to remain laudable in presentation and reputation is detested by his business partner and wife, Anna Morales, played by the ever enchanting Jessica Chastain, and as he is thrown into a rather dire predicament involving closing an admirably large investment and dealing with the constant violence provoked against drivers of his oil trucks, he comes to terms with the reality that his own righteous nature may very well threaten the success of his portfolio, repute and enterprise.Handled with clean and graceful direction, Chandor's touch on this story of internal corruption, inner defeat and honour is gorgeous and captivating. Marvin Gaye's \"Inner City Blues\" begins the story, and its wistful and carefree nature captures the audience, and introduces us to the time period exhibited; 1981. The clean-shaven, impressive stature accompanying our protagonist Abel is viewed with precision and style as he undertakes his morning jog, breath visible in the cold winter daybreak. This is intercut with images that initially seem entirely unrelated, but by the end of the sequence, become decipherable in meaning; a hijacking of one of Abel's fuel trucks. This truck is headed by Julian, played by the exceptional Elyes Gabel; this character comes to play a large part in the story later on in the running time. Quiet and serene, Chandor has a reflective quality to his style which is at once alluring and compelling. Much of the subsequent film is dialogue, and through the peaceful and neutral methodology that Chandor sports with confidence, we witness the unraveling of a multitude of characters with hushed vigour, and it is immensely enthralling; more so than many a crime drama as of recent has been able to pull off.Abel's frustrations are handled expertly on both the screenplay and actor's ends, his inability to rest his most blatant and forthcoming deal forming the basis for much of the picture's tribulations. Issac's manipulation of the careful but hard-hitting lead protagonist resonates all throughout, his concealed exasperation clearly defined as we witness both his reaction to personal dilemma and his public persona intertwine, as well as his inaptitude in relation to controlling his forceful Manhattan-raised wife. We aren't provided with all that much back story for his upbringing, Chandor subtly indicating of Abel's foreign origin, and this leaves the director/screenwriter to focus solely on the lead's current predicament. A morally established character in a film of this likes is something of a rarity, but Chandor handles his clear, upstanding lead character with finesse and dexterity, and the instability is lent to Anna. This makes for a strangely compelling power dynamic that comes into play all throughout, Anna aggressive and willing to take a less... legal viewpoint, and Abel representing the most morally accessible individual possible in his business of which he operates within; one that consistently revels in the seemingly minor (when murder is in abundance within the genre) but nevertheless illegal activities that include tax evasion and fraud. Chastain and Issac's interactions, certainly towards the end, are immensely heated, and are not simply a distraction for the intense going-ons that occur outside the family mansion.As he struts around in his high-priced coats and exorbitant shoes, Abel's personality and noble high-mindedness directly contradicts against that of his partners, business associates and those of the same strain. It's not hard to root for this individual, as he is surrounded by exhibitionists whose manners and compliments are as strained as their attempts to push blame onto other shoulders. Intense confrontations between the ambiguous opposers in the way of Abel's success and the lead protagonist serve as the bulk for much of the running time, Chandor's direction both at its finest and least appeasing in such times. Whilst Bradford Young's cinematography often captures these dialogue sequences with dynamic flair, the most preliminary of discussions, namely the initial confrontation between Abel and the District Attorney named Lawrence, played masterfully by David Oyelowo, is shot with a disjointed sense of distance. The characters are all shot in close-up and no others appear in frame alongside them. The editing is slow and leisurely on purpose, and whilst it provides an underlying sense of escalation, it means that once a character's line of dialogue has been delivered without any cuts in between, we switch to another separate angle of the opposing person, and they deliver their line. There is no dynamic to it, and despite the impressive nature of the words spouting from the character's lips, it proves underwhelming to a certain degree.These kinds of scenes are rare, for A Most Violent Year's most appetizing element is its deliberate pace, and how it never urges itself to rush towards a climax. The climax itself is unnerving and partially emotional, and reflects the sombre tone of the rest of the film; a tone which is consistent throughout, though never lacking variety. Whether it be strangely cold and steady car and running chase sequences, fits of anger from main and supporting ensembles, or reflections on the violent and gruesome lengths some are willing to go to to preserve their own being and live in happiness, Chandor negotiates much ground with his crime drama magnum opus; one that never reaches the immeasurably impeccable heights of many of its predecessors, films which it obviously aspires to, but nevertheless respectfully pays homage. This is a rich and vivid story of masterful taste and execution, one that rarely strays too far from perfection. Despite light moments of disjointed camerawork and editing, or the underwhelming and lacking score from consistently disappointing composer Alex Ebert, A Most Violent Year is much like its colour palette, provided by gaffer Bill O'Leary; a warm dose of energy and rich detail. Golden entertainment that produces a relatively conventional story within a context that it is not so usually presented within.",

    "review": "  The new film from J.C. Chandor (\"All Is Lost\") is set in New York City in 1981, a time when the Big Apple was rife with crime and decay, and centers on a former truck driver, Abel - played with heart and grit by Oscar Isaac (\"Inside Llewyn Davis\") - who now owns the heating-oil company for which he once worked and has plans to expand his business. Unfortunately, he also has a host of competitors, some of them with mob connections, and an ambitious D.A. - played by David Oyelowo (\"Selma\") - threatening to prosecute him for financial improprieties. Things could either go really well for Abel or really badly. Right at the start, they take the latter course.This is a movie that closely analyzes the politics and opportunities (or lack thereof) for social mobility in late-stage capitalism. As in Chandor's first film, \"Margin Call,\" the director is fascinated by the nitty-gritty details of how institutions operate (in a way, \"All Is Lost\" was similar, too, if one substitutes \"institution\" for \"survival\"). We spend a lot of time watching Jessica Chastain (\"Interstellar\"), as Abel's Lady Macbeth-like (and mob-connected, herself) wife poring through files (when she's not taunting Abel on how a real man would respond to threats), looking through accounting errors. Crime may be rampant in the big city, but success in business depends as much on will power as in understanding paperwork.Abel is a wonderful metaphor for what can happen to a person when they pull themselves up by their bootstraps, only to come face to face with the boot makers. He's good at what he does, but will that be good enough? In sharp contrast to Abel's mover and shaker is a fellow immigrant (Abel is originally from South America), Julian - touchingly played by Elyes Gabel (Rakharo on \"Game of Thrones\") - who doesn't have the same drive (and wife) as Abel, and so is ripe to be used and discarded when his usefulness has expired. Indeed, if the film is, indeed, an exploration of what it takes to succeed in (American capitalist) business, then it's the interactions between these two men that the story is told.The movie does have its action scenes (yes, violence comes into play), and also a lot of other, fun performances that add a rich texture to the seedy vibe. Albert Brooks is especially fine as Abel's lawyer/consigliere, and Alessandro Nivola brings charm and chill to his role as a Mafioso rival to Abel. It is a powerful film about the temptations of corruption, how to avoid them, and the price we pay when we give into them.",

The story is a little slow but Oscar Issac gives a performance that is reminiscent of Pacino in the first two Godfather films...and anyone who knows how highly I regard those films, knows I don't say that lightly. The film is beautifully shot as well. Highly recommended viewing.",

    "review": "  The mostly Oscar bait A Most Violent Year is a largely hollow experience.Review by Matt CummingsIn Writer-Director J.C. Candor's A Most violent Year, business and morals clash in the world of 1981 New York. Then and there, the city is undergoing one of its most murderous years in history, with ordinary people caught in the crossfire and businessmen seeing their property stolen from underneath them. It's here that small business owner Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) finds himself pining for a brighter future with a world trying desperately to take it all away from him. Married into the heating oil industry which was run by his wife Anna's (Jessica Chastain) father, Abel is trying to expand his business by borrowing the money needs for a massive expansion. But his jealous competition is watching and plotting against him, even as Abel tries to keep his trucks from being stolen by those same rivals. It all comes to a head when his lawyer Andrew (Albert Brooks) informs him of a damaging investigation by the assistant district attorney (David Oyelowo), who claims dirty play in the building of Abel's empire. Faced with a growing wave of pressure, Abel must use every tool at his disposal not only to succeed but to merely survive. Based on this rather lengthy plot, you might have as much trouble as I did getting excited about it, and that's about the way this drama unfolds. None of it is particularly compelling nor does it feel realistic: in the real world, the kind and empathetic Abel would simply be run through the grinder on his way to financial and personal ruin. Sure, Candor fills Violent with an impressive cast led by Isaac and Chastain, who both are nothing short of forces of nature. When Johanna finds a gun dumped outside their newly-purchased home, she knows this isn't mere coincidence. Her rage slowly builds until not even Abel can keep her from using her old Family ties to bring some balance to their struggle. But none of that - even the verbal throwdowns led by Isaac and Chastain - are enough to keep us awake through what's really a dull affair. New York's crime wave must have yielded better stories than this, yet Violent's one-man-one-struggle plot is not even that engrossing. The idea of watching someone in such slow-motion crisis doesn't really work, because we know somehow that Abel and Johanna will ultimately get through these challenges. Their lawyer (Albert Brooks) does get in a few good shots about the company's treachery, and there are some decent action scenes when one Abel's employees gets tragically caught up in a shootout for his truck. Good people succeeding in a corrupt universe is usually screen-worthy, but it's Candor the Writer's execution that left me frankly bored. Oyelowo plays stoggy attorney too well, content to sit outside Abel's home or converse with him behind a desk, rather than challenge or help actually root out the cause of these thefts. There's nothing memorable about such a performance, and it's a microcosm of why Violent fails. Moreover, the story never fully addresses why Abel feels the need to be so well-behaved. Johanna can't figure it out either, and by the time things fade to black, we couldn't care less. Stories like these place the audience in a weird place, because they never make their case to keep us around, choosing moments of empty exposition and hoping that somehow we're still dialed in because it has Oscar Bait written on it. Wrong. In a year of terrific Oscar candidates, A Most Violent Year will be easily missed, and for good reason. It's a fairly flat affair, one that misuses its enormous potential, and whose longevity will be based entirely on it attaining some sort of cult status. That's not likely. A Most Violent Year is rated R for language and some violence and has a runtime of of 125 minutes. Discuss this review with fellow SJF fans on Facebook.

    "review": "  This certain cure for insomnia plays as an adaptation of scenes scraped off the cutting room floors of Godfather and Goodfellas, plus one or two from The Wolf of Wall Street. The monotony is occasionally broken up by the film's only saving grace - the chemistry between Isaac and Chastain, who shine in their scenes together. Unfortunately, they are too few and far between, and this insipid drama shows just how little it has to say about any of the themes it touches on but makes no effort to try and explore. The lack of pace, action and plot development in the screenplay make A Most Violent Year, a most exhaustingly boring film.",

    "review": "  Statistically 1981 was one of the most violent years in New York City history and it's against that backdrop we view a family run oil business struggling against felons, larceny and police interference in the grimy Big Apple. Oscar Isaac plays Abel Morales, the father of 2 and husband to Anna (Jessica Chastain) whose integrity and moral stubbornness is tested to the limit as he tries to do a business deal to expand his operation by buying a river-front property owned by a local Jewish group. Giving him limited time to finalise (and pay for) the deal, Abel must turns every cheek on his body to remain righteous despite an impending police department investigation and rising threats against his family. The film's slow pace allows tension to build up and the absence of almost any music shifts focus to the performances and Isaac shows a magnetic screen presence and a restaurant showdown with his rivals sees him channelling Al Pacino in The Godfather. His oily dark hair and suit bringing out incredibly dark eyes with a piercing stare that the film even brings attention to in his speeches to his wayward employees. The snail's pace of the film may not be for everyone and it almost grounds to a halt two-thirds in but maintains a solid if lumbering forward momentum to its conclusion. With an interesting protagonist to characterise, Isaac has the look of every Brooklyn gangster ever seen but the revelation of the movie is that throughout the movie he tries to do the right thing although this comes with its own hefty repercussions. Chastain gives a great performance as his multi-faceted wife, equally supportive and exasperated with her obsessed husband as he fails to react to the attacks upon their idyllic life. Support from David Oyelowo as the police captain unravelling the dirty deeds on the street and Albert Brooks as Abel's legal confidante fills out an impressive cast and the period setting is spot on in its representation of dilapidated neighbourhoods and warehouses.The film doesn't run out of fuel but those expecting a quick cutting gangster flick will be tested but those willing to invest in the challenging and calculative direction and some beautifully lit scenes will be rewarded with a tale of money and murky morality.7.5/10 Midlands Movies Mike",

    "review": "  \"I'll take care of it\".What's with all the slow paced movies lately? Foxcatcher, Ex Machina etc. Not complaining as such, I mean when they're done well you get a film like Zodiac or TV show like The Americans. Of course those sky quality examples and two of my favourite piece of entertainment. But like those two recent movies I named 'A Most Violent Year' utilises it's pacing well - to create a good but not great film.There's something I'd like to put out their straight away that I found as I was watching this interesting. 'A Most Violent Year' isn't a gangster movie, I know it sounds like one it has the name even the trailer suggested so. But it does cleverly lull you into the thought of it. Set during the winter of 1981 'Abel' and wife 'Anna' have built an empire based on delivery of fuel, but things start to fall apart when their drivers become targets while the DA hits him with a legal case. It's a everything to shit for the immigrant wanting the American dream.It's a calculating movie, It never really lets on Abel's dealings with the company to the full extent. There's a disconnection between him and the work with a gnawing feeling that he's been up to something - even if it isn't true. The problem is at times It holds too much back and the fact that we never learn about the guys taking the trucks is annoying. It's not as interesting as it thinks it is, the longer the film goes on the less the intrigue there is - until the end where it finishes on an open ended note. Anne is a surprisingly refreshing wife character - when the usual would be the \"I hate my husband and I yell' character. She has a voice and for once the male lead listens to her. I was expecting their marriage to disintegrate towards the end - a la Goodfellas.Ultimately 'A Most Violent Year' is an interesting film that has a lot going for. It's paced well, well acted and dishes out it's info in a calculating way. The story of Abel and Anne feel like a real marriage which is more than can be said for likewise films. Unfortunately it feels a little more hollow the longer the film continues and some questions being left unanswered irked me a little, but it all pales as there's more than enough to like.",

Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) and his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) are try to capitalise of the benefits the American dream can afford them but the violence, decay and corruption of their surroundings threaten to pull the rug from under them.

    "review": "  Interestingly enough, this movie's not that violent. Set during one of New York City's statistically most criminal years, the violence in J.C. Chandor's A Most Violent Year is relegated to a mostly off-screen presence. Primarily a business-minded crime drama, the narrative's true oppressor is economic hardship and brutal market competition. At the center of proceedings is Abel Morales (played by Oscar Isaacs), an entrepreneurial immigrant trying to keep his business afloat during hard times. An honest and hardworking man, Abel finds it increasingly difficult to maintain professionalism and integrity as pressures mount on all sides, forcing him and those around him to make decisions that bring them all perilously close to the edge of collapse. Isaacs gives a tremendous performance, enough to equal the brilliance of his work in last year's Inside Llewyn Davis. His portrayal of Abel Morales commands sympathy while simultaneously concealing an enigmatic callousness just beneath the surface. Jessica Chastain is strong as Abel's criminally-oriented wife, but she at times comes off as one note, portraying sizzling strength and little else. The rest of the cast is equally fine, able to imbue their characters with individual identity and purpose. The only main issue I take with the film is its inability to adequately satisfy the monumental tension found in the first and second acts. The conclusion is too rushed and a little too easy, and at times the film can be dry. Nevertheless a strong effort, A Most Violent Year doesn't quite live up to its massive dramatic potential.",

Chandor's previous work, Margin Call (Lehman Brothers re-enactment) and All Is Lost (Robert Redford vs the sea) deserves a wider audience as they are entertaining and well made films that I would urge anyone who hasn't seen them to check them out. His third film, set in 1980 in NYC, is a sombre meditation on the theme of morality and corruption. It is understated and quietly intense and it screams quality with a great cast full of subtle yet intense performances; a slow burning and intelligent script that culminates to a powerful and still very relevant point it wants to make in its final few scenes and the coolest looking grey and brown cinematography ever captured on film. While it does meander and drag a bit in the middle, this \"art-house gangster\" film (think The Long Good Friday with a young Pacino pegged between Michael Corleone and Tony Mantana) is another interesting addition to his filmography and I can't wait to see what he does next.

Oscar Isaac, too, is like watching a young Al Pacino or Robert Deniro. His Abel wants so badly to keep his business and family afloat and do both legitimately, but forces out of his control and the crime-ridden streets of New York don't want him to capitalize on the American Dream. As you can see, the comparisons to Michael Corleone or various characters both Pacino or Deniro played is unmistakeable. A great film overlooked by the Academy same as \"Locke.\"",

It is a shame that in such a weak year for Supporting Actresses that she missed the cut because I would be behind a nomination but we have to settle with just the Globe nomination. J.C. Chandor has made two films prior to this (Margin Call, All is Lost) and I have a feeling he is just one of those special directors that will really grow with time to be one of the greats. It is sharply written and beautifully shot by another rising star Bradford Young that really knows how to capture an exterior shot. The costumes, hair, score, and sound design are all top notch and supporting performances from David Oyelowo and Albert Brooks are also great.

Until A Most Violent Year. This film just blew me away, just like Margin Call in 2011, with it's thrilling and intelligent atmospheric gravitas. The layers of complex storytelling and outstanding filmmaking craft present here just make it rise to the cream of the crop. It's just a notch down from Chandor's perfect directorial debut, Margin Call.Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain deliver searing performances and showcase why they are both at the top of the acting game. Isaac especially deserves recognition for giving one of the best performances of the year. It's a shame that this film came out so late in the year and didn't gain any traction with critics and Academy Award voters. The production design, cinematography and music create a subtle but thrilling mise en sc�ne that transports you to 1981 instantly and made me want to stay there from the first frame to the last. DP Bradford Young is fast becoming one of the most interesting cinematographers in the game, with Pariah, Ain't Them Bodies Saints, Selma and now A Most Violent Year. I can't wait to see what directors and films he brings his incredible eye to in the coming years. He just makes every frame, whether digital or film, come to life with gorgeous lighting and movement. J.C. Chandor has really taken the independent filmmaking world by storm with his three films over the past four years. While All Is Lost didn't grab me as much Margin Call did, largely due to it's lack of dialogue and people to keep my brain busy, A Most Violent Year shows again that Chandor is a master screenwriter with smarts and passion completely dedicated to telling great stories his way.",

Set in 1980's New York which is deemed to be the most violent year to date its suprisingly violence free and cenres on the story of a heating oil magnet and his rise to the top. Issac is cool and calm and Chastin sassy and sharp. Together the light up the screen, See it",

A Most VIolent Year is a wholly better film and firmly places atmosphere and subtly over \"mobster thrills.\" It demands a movieloving, patient audience. Luckily I'm into that.",

The performances are excellent (Chastain is, as usual, unbelievably good), the score is wonderful, and the script is as smart as anything else that came out this year. Chandor is an undeniable talent, and the Oscar's snubbing of \"A Most Violent Year\" is an unfortunate missed opportunity to recognize that talent.",

    "review": "  In \"A Most Violent Year,\" Abel(Oscar Isaac), the owner of a home oil businessin New York City, is on the way up. Not only has he moved into a palatial new home with his wife Anna(Jessica Chastain) and their three children but he has also just closed a deal to buy a distribution center that will greatly enhance his business. However, he has only a month to get the rest of the money, or not only will he lose his sizable deposit but the property will also go to his competitors. Complicating things even further is the DA(David Oyelowo) investigating him and hijackers targeting his trucks, with Julian(Elyes Gabel) being the latest driver victimized.As he seeks to make movies on his own terms, J.C. Chandor has directed another movie that hits the mark with \"A Most Violent Year\" about a man seeking to fulfill the promise of the American dream, by making it as legitimately as he possibly can. That involves Chandor doing so with standout scenes including the one on the Queensboro Bridge and a lead character who seeks to avoid violence in the most violent of times, a message the movie handles well without resorting to being didactic.(It is either irony or penance that both Oscar Isaac and Albert Brooks were also in \"Drive\" which glorified violence to a sickening degree.) Of course, it helps when you have Jessica Chastain being no less than quietly effective and a nearly unrecognizable Albert Brooks stealing scenes left, right and center. Sadly, the Julian storyline does not work as well as it should, being as awkwardly shoehorned into the rest of the movie as it is.",

    "review": "  \"A Most Violent Year,\" the third feature film directed by J.C. Chandor, stars Oscar Isaac and Academy Award nominated Jessica Chastain as Abel & Anna Morales, who must overcome the relentless corruption, violence, and misfortunes that try to ruin the business they have spent years building. I knew little about this movie until I saw a trailer for it in an indie theater in New York. Needless to say, I knew I had to see this sooner or later. The only other movie I knew was directed by Chandor before seeing this was the 2013 film \"All is Lost,\" starring Robert Redford. I have yet to see the aforementioned movie, but after seeing this one I must say I'm looking forward to it.Before I get to the performances, I must say that the atmosphere and coloring in this film is remarkable. I am a big fan of period pieces, especially ones that take place in the mid to late 20th century, and the gritty yet beautifully colored visuals are perfectly representative of the early 1980's. The look of some scenes even reminded me of the visual style of films like \"The Godfather.\" I also admire the use of both natural light and artificial lighting in order to provoke certain emotions and emphasis. Isaac and Chastain gave terrific performances in this movie, with Isaac successfully conveying Abel Morale's strong determination and Chastain believably playing Anna Morale, who feels as though Abel is at times incompetent and she needs to take matters into her own hands. David Oyelowo, better known for his role as Martin Luther King, Jr. in the movie \"Selma,\" also gives a great performance as District Attorney Lawrence, who can be seen as an antagonist, although I believe the main antagonist is more external than a single character. Going back to Isaac's character, another plus of the movie is that Morales is a unique character in that he is willing to do anything to keep his business he has worked so hard on building from falling apart, until it becomes immoral. In many movies, if a character, especially in a crime drama, is hell-bent on doing something, they wouldn't hesitate to kill or put lives at risk to get their way (such as in \"Nightcrawler\"). Morales, on the other hand, knows when to stop and decide when to change the direction he's going to solve a problem. He states in the film, \"You should know that I have always taken the path that is most right. The result is never in question for me. Just what path do you take to get there? And that is what this is.\" By the end of the film, you believe that he is innocent of all the charges he's accused of, though whether he actually is isn't clear-cut. What would usually be a negative for me in a film is that this movie is slow at some points. Despite the slow pace, however, the movie was never boring, which is a very rare case. I credit the performances and visuals for keeping me attentive (that and a few jump scares).The main bother I had with movie, which could be partially due to the trailer (which I really liked), was how little violence there actually was. I know that may sound like a nitpick or I'm implying that a movie can't be good without heads getting blown off, but considering this film emphasized that it took place in \"statistically the most violent year in New York history,\" I expected more. Much like \"There Will Be Blood,\" where there really wasn't that much of it, \"A Most Violent Year\" failed to convince me that it took place in such a time. There are only two deaths in the entire movie (three if you count a deer), and this movie could have been PG-13 if they subtracted a few \"fucks.\" Another small problem I had was the character Julian, played by Elyes Gabel. At first, it was hard to figure out if this character was important to the plot. Once you realize that he's an important character, he feels a lot less fleshed out than he should be. I wish there was more time dedicated to showing what he was going through. Also, the cops kinda suck at catching guys, which is probably why there were so many crimes in 1981. Overall, despite my initial expectation of a great mobster movie, I was pleasantly surprised to have seen a great corporate crime drama I have seldom seen before. Although I did have a few problems with \"A Most Violent Year,\" the positives greatly outweighed the negatives. I wouldn't necessarily call it an Oscar worthy film, but it's definitely on the level right under it. Hopefully, this movie gets a wider release so you can give it a watch.8/10",

It explores the expected thuggish behaviors, yet with minimal gunfire, car-chases and explosions. Instead of the loud violence, film focuses on silent territorial wars and atmospheric dealings, which slowly drag Abel into the law enforcement radar.Chandor's approach is unique as he went smart over loud.I have to admit that it is such a brilliant job by the filmmakers as well.It really does feel like it was done in 1981 when New York City was in the midst of an era filled with crime, corruption, violence and filth.\"A Most Violent Year\" is a slow burning crime thriller that is seeping with great performances, solid script and great execution of it.I highly recommend it.",

Corruption and violence ensues, accidently or otherwise. Title is a tad misleading since it suggests it is looking at the whole epidemic happening in New York City rather than it just focusing on this one family during this period but is strictly a nit pickers thing, the year is defintely a solid journey.",

It's a slow burn, and definitely not for the impatient viewer, but it may reward patience.The film is very well directed by J.C. Chandor he has a knack for atmosphere and tone. He gets the best out of his actors. The music is very moody and adds plenty of atmosphere. The editing is also remarkable, once again adding to the atmosphere. The look of the film is exceptional too, though it is too darkly lit during a few of the night scenes. I couldn't possibly sell the film's atmosphere anymore, it really is something special.Isaac shines as Abel, he channels a young Al Pacino. Isaac plays the tension, ruthlessness, and fear of Abel with credibility, charisma, and depth. Chastain is wonderful, if only she had more screen time. Chastain is sexy here, the best she's ever looked. You can wholly believe her character's manipulation, and dedication to the business. Albert Brooks and David Oyelowo, also lend their immense talents to this film as a gangster, and district attorney respectively.A Most Violent Year will be divisive. The film has an undeniably good cast, the film is beautifully shot, and it has interesting ideas. Before you see the film, realize, it's a slow film, one where words speak louder than actions.",

Jessica Chastain is amazing as an icy descendant of a top-gangster but this is truly Oscar Isaac's movie and he is flawless channeling a young Al Pacino with his quiet demeanor. The story is very simple, but feels realistic with a slower pace and time to flesh the issues out; this is not your typical gangster film. Those going in expecting a bloodbath should be warned that most of the aforementioned \"violence\" occurs off-screen or just involves hand-to-hand combat, the title more serves as the backdrop to the time-period and fills the film with a gloomy tone. It's not for everyone and many may find it dull, but I was invested throughout thanks to some solid writing and two excellent performances!",

If 'The Godfather' was made today, Isaac would have been cast as Michael Corleone and also been nominated for an Academy Award! I can't do anymore to explain and promote Jessica Chastain as one of our very best actors today, male or female! Her tough, lived in performance is the actual glue that holds this film together and when her character is not on screen we miss her! This is a movie for adults who like a plot that doesn't depend on childish, ordinary thrills and a movie whose characters are deeply written but in more subtle shades than any crime film in recent memory.

    "review": "  A Most Violent Year is a tale of crime, capitalism, personal and family values, and while it isn't as deep or as subtle as J.C. Chandor assumes it is, the film succeeds for reasons ranging from the brilliant performances by Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain, down to the slow-burn narrative of the writer-director's latest thematically rich entry in an already small but diverse filmography from a financial collapse in Margin Call (2011) to one about a man lost at sea with All Is Lost (2013).Businessman Abel Morales has it all; wealth, a beautiful wife and two daughters. But he wants more. No; he needs more. Struggling to build a heating-oil empire in statistically one of the bloodiest years in New York's history, Oscar Isaac exudes not the violent side of Al Pacino's Michael Corleone, but that of the latter's thoughtful, driven and suave side as his character, Abel, faces off not only against his competition, but also from those in his own company and family.Dabbling in business, politics, property and law, Abel's story is less about who shoots the other first, as Chandor's leading man intrinsically encapsulates the old world of crime; a seedy arena of shady under the table dealings that relied less on physical violence, and more on the power of respect, influence and questionable paperwork. Remaining steadfast in his belief that all of his problems - from his oil tankers being constantly hijacked, to the investigation into his company by the district attorney Lawrence (David Oyelowo) - can be solved without resorting to violence, Abel is gradually pushed to his breaking point as Chandor slowly roasts him through the numerous ordeals that feed back into the central theme of pitting the former's principles against exterior threats as Abel struggles to do what he believes is right in a period when doing so would end in some form of catastrophe.Validated by her \"You're not going to like what happens when I get involved\" threat earlier on, Anna's character is one of venomous mysticism which puts her apart from other female characters in contemporary crime mediums, who are usually willfully ignorant, oblivious, or subservient caricatures of a 'good housewife'. To claim that Anna's character exists solely as a provocateur to her husband wouldn't be a mere oversimplification, but to not credit Chastain's sultry performance as nothing short of riveting would be a disservice. A beautiful double-edged sword if there ever was one, Anna serves her function as the opposite side of the coin Abel is on, in that she is willing to do what her husband believes is avoidable to secure their family and company's future; this could also be inversely interpreted in the sense that the threat Anna poses is simply as another superficial narrative roadblock that Abel has to overcome in his road to becoming a 'real man' and not a 'pussy', as Anna eloquently calls her husband at one point.Bringing the gloomy atmosphere front and center yet again is Selma's cinematographer, Bradford Young, as he drapes the entire film in the type of tint and lighting that would fit cozily among crime and gangster films from the '70s up to the mid '80s; almost like a fresh corpse would in the trunk of a mafioso's Sedan. But as gloom and doom as A Most Violent Year gets with Alex Ebert's oddly fitting synth score, Chandor never truly allows the movie to become as its namesake implies despite being a gritty '80s period piece; at least not in a literal, gnashing of the teeth sense. The violence in J.C. Chandor's crime tale is one that consists of verbal, hushed deliveries as his characters trade blows through threats, verbal sparring and subtle displays of physical machismo rather than one of rattling gunfire from automatic rifles on the streets of New York.",

'All is Lost' had Robert Redford being an old guy on a boat without uttering a word.It's safe to say J.C. Chandor doesn't care for easy topics or conventional settings. Who would've thought to go looking for a gripping crime drama set in the heating oil industry of '81 ... Doesn't sound interesting you say? Well, trust me, it is.By focussing on a central character with big dreams of being the cleanest guy in a dirty business, Chandor grabs you by the neck and drags you through love and loss with his protagonist. Another great performance by Oscar Isaac.'A Most Violent Year' is Chandors most rounded achievement to date. A strong crime drama littered with tense moments.",

    "review": "  There's no letting up in director J.C. Chandor's already impressive film canon. Set in NYC's most violent year 1981, A Most Violent Year is a finely-crafted and thoroughly-riveting character study of a heating-oil businessman (Abel) reaching a nadir in his career and life as crooks and anti-corruption authorities threaten to bulldoze the empire he so painstakingly built from the ground. Undoubtedly, the impressive acting chops of Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain take center stage. Chastain is captivating as Abel's wife Anna - the morally-lax antithesis to righteous Abel who tries to address his problems without using illicit methods. It's just a letdown this superior work isn't being recognized at any of the award shows.",

Maybe the best performance for Oscar Isaac I have seen. Something however I felt was missing. You were almost waiting for a moment when Isaac's character would go off Pacino or DeNiro style. Again a good film, but I can see why it would be a fringe Best Picture candidate on the year.",

    "review": "  Finally getting around to this one. I love a good crime thriller, especially inventive ones. New York is and always will be gangster ground zero. So many films have been made about gangster mobs in New York City, and this one may one day be considered a classic. \"A Most Violent Year\" is directed by J.C. Chandor and stars Oscar Isaac, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo, Albert Brooks, and Elyes Gabel.Abel Morales (Isaac), is the owner of an oil company. The year is 1981. It's winter, and Abel is about to close on a deal that will expand his company. One morning, a young man who works for Abel named Julian (Gabel), is assaulted while driving his oil truck. The goons make off with the truck leaving Julian lying prostrate on the pavement. All over the city, Abel's oil trucks are being stolen and drained. As Abel struggles to keep his honest business together, the D.A. is investigating his company. With pressure on all sides, he attempts to keep his company afloat while also trying to keep his family safe.Oscar Isaac is one of my favorite actors right now, and Jessica Chastain is probably my favorite female actress of all time. I was so pleased with how great they were in this film. Oscar Isaac does a phenomenal job in his role. He has such range in his acting abilities. His performance is sharp and intense. Jessica Chastain is also fantastic. She has several great scenes in this where she absolutely kills it. She plays her character with such precision and with such ferociousness. Aside from these two, everyone did a great job.I was really surprised by how smart the script was. It's so well written. Every bit of dialogue is sharp and perfect. This adds to the intensity of the film. It's also full of tension from beginning to end. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. The cinematography by Bradford Young is absolutely beautiful. I was so impressed by the camera work. It's definitely some of the best cinematography I've seen this year. Every shot was beautiful with perfect lighting and a great color palette. Also, the musical score shouldn't be overlooked. It's a really simple score, but it adds to the tension of the film.If it's not obvious enough, I loved his film. However, it is not for everyone. It's what some would call a \"slow burn\". It is not a fast paced movie. It's a steady crime thriller drama from beginning to end. Therefore, this is not something everyday moviegoers will likely enjoy. Some may be put off by it's \"slowness\". I personally love slow movies and fast paced movies. The key is, they have to be engaging. Thankfully, to me, this film is. This is not a flawless movie. No film is truly flawless. Not very many are; though there are some. My only complaint is that sometimes things get a little bit genre cliche. Not much, but a bit.\"A Most Violent Year\" is a smart, superb crime drama that succeeds in every way. It's dark, gritty, engaging, well written, has astonishing cinematography, great performances, and it's full of great tension. I definitely recommend if you are into crime dramas. Some audiences may not enjoy how \"slow\" it is, but if you're a lover of films that take their time and engage you from start to finish, you'll be thoroughly impressed.",

    "review": "  Familiar? The immigrant after the American dream. A subtle \"Scarface\" in ways. And one of the rare cases where a little more style over substance may have gone a long way. Likely to be one of J.C. Chandor's less heralded films, \"A Most Violent Year\" is a slow play, a delving into the mind of a man trying so hard to stay clean in dirty world. Isaac and Chastain are the meat & potatoes of the film, especially Chastain with her complete disrespect of a 'man's world', leaves it surprising she didn't receive an Oscar nomination. And Albert Brooks is completely enjoyable as the shady attorney. Set during one of New York's City's most violent time periods, there is a lot to like about the film, very reminiscent of the 70s and 80s gangster films. However, it spends so much time building layers of empathy for a closet gangster that when the cards are shown, you just wanna see bullets fly, regardless of who they hit. Rated 3.25 out of 5.

    "review": "  If MARGIN CALL and ALL IS LOST were not enough, A MOST VIOLENT YEAR should convince any scoffers that writer/director J.C. Chandor is a major new voice working today. It's an assured, deft mood piece, a captivating crime tale (though really only tangentially so), and a tremendous character study. The movie is a bit hard to classify because it's not your standard fare - outwardly, it has the hallmarks of classic crime stories, but it also does not follow easy or predictable narrative paths, and its character work is uncommonly sharp; it's an idiosyncratic film in the best way possible. Oscar Isaac continues to show that he's one of the strongest actors of his generation with his superb work here, giving a marvelously calibrated performance as a decent man under incredible pressure. You can just see that he's a man caught between his natural instincts to do the \"right thing,\" so-to-speak, and his drive to see his company and family prosper, and in any other year, Isaac would surely be getting serious awards consideration. The always-reliable Jessica Chastain makes the most of the standard \"headstrong wife\" role and delivers a memorable turn that doesn't succumb to cliche; ditto for Albert Brooks (it's always fun to see him pop up) in his low key part as Isaac's character's lawyer/consigliere, and David Oyelowo in a more nuanced version of the hungry D.A. character type. Director Chandor captures a spectacular sense of time and place, aided chiefly by the beautiful photography, which is gloriously moody and atmospheric; if THE GODFATHER had been made in 2014, I suspect it would look a lot like this film, and I mean that as a huge compliment to cinematographer Bradford Young. The movie's tone occasionally flirts with the bleak and the cold, which might make it hard for some in the audience to latch on to what its offering, but I found it a thoughtful and satisfying experience, a movie that invites you to luxuriate in its rich tonalities. A MOST VIOLENT YEAR is one of 2014's best films.",

    "review": "  Perhaps an oil-heating company's problems don't seem like something that can sustain a film, but tell that to Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) in A Most Violent Year, set in the chilled winter of 1981 New York, when crime ran rampant everywhere, from boardrooms to bedrooms. Abel is an immigrant looking to live the American dream and wants to always do legit business. But his competitors won't allow it. They're aware he has only 30 days left to pay off a loan on a waterfront storage facility and they know he's on edge since someone is hijacking his trucks and beating his drivers. Then there's the matter of the D.A. (a terrific David Oyelowo). Abel, clad in a camel coat, has just bought a new home for his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) and their two daughters, and he's being squeezed hard. The tension is palm-sweating.That's the set-up for this dazzling third feature from writer-director J.C. Chandor (Margin Call, All Is Lost). Chandor is paying tribute to great New York crime dramas from Scorsese, Sidney Lumet and James Gray. The action--a shootout on a bridge, a chase aboard an elevated train--is gripping. But Chandor takes a more meditative pace that is all his own. Abel is all too tempted to compromise from his lawyer (a terrific Albert Brooks), but the violent streak comes from Anna, who is ready to take charge like the mob daughter she is.Chastain is amazing, which is saying something because she's always flawless. Just look at the way she mouths off like a Brooklyn fatale. 'You're not gonna like what'll happen once I get involved.' And Isaac is implosive and electrifying. Chandor allows for him to convey all the mental turmoil that his actions take upon him. Shot with a poet's eye by Selma camera wizard Bradford Young, A Most Violent Year teems with power games and sin, a world where little is held sacred. You won't be able to look away.",

It's not plot, it's that character and the way J.C. Chandor and actor Oscar Isaac make him evolve and come into his own. I'm slightly disappointed by Jessica Chastain though. There wasn't much of a character there, even though she worked hard to get past the limitations of her character, but even her attempts at going Method fell short. What was that with her fingernails?! I guess Chandor wasn't really interested in her character and the focus of the film was incredibly intense.

The decision to film at least 95 % of the scenes lighted as if by a 15% watt bulb is truly irritating - no matter if there is some artistic thought underlying that decision. The pace of the dialog - ssslloooooooo - I suppose that is one way to have a 90 minute script last 120 minutes. The emotional breadth displayed by the lead character is not believable. Given the extreme circumstances imposed upon him, his degree of calm seems to be a function of a repressed mental state, rather than an indication of superior control and self control. His verbal support and empathy for his employees is admirable, but his inability to truly strategize (fighting or otherwise) for their safety indicates a spirit of Gandhi in a competitive violent industry, or an insidious lack of caring, or simply a low IQ - I gave up wondering which, half-way thru. One observation about the car / oil truck chase - he talks to someone (cannot remember whom) about the hijacking on his old car phone / CB, but, forgets to tell him / her that he is about to engage in a high speed chase, and that maybe it would be a good idea to alert the police, since it is only his life, family, and career on the line. Or, maybe this was his moment of losing emotional control. Or maybe just an indication that persistence and slick salesmanship is his only skill, and the real brains of the operation are his wife's. The good news is this film got me to open a RT account, so I might as well also mention that Birdman and Imitation game are Great - more on another day in another place.",

In many ways this films goes to show us what Michael Corleone would have done with his family business had the situation been different. Isaac's Abel Morales is a man constantly striving to live life and do business on the up-and-up but reality keeps pulling him back down into the gutter.

We learn something about the characters in virtually every scene and every exchange of dialog. For instance, the looming figure of the Chastain character's father, who never appears in the film, plays a larger and larger role as we learn, bit by bit, the precise nature of this marriage and the business that forms the center of the action we experience. Ditto with the complicated relationship between the players in the fuel oil business, the D.A,, the cops, and the mob. Chandor knows that he is playing in the fields so well plowed by The Godfather and its imitators, and his subtle, controlled and engrossing version of a crime drama, in a sense, trumps Coppola's earlier, groundbreaking work (something I never thought I would say). This is an unmitigated triumph of cinema storytelling.",

Chandor made an interesting movie about an immigrant (Oscar Isaac) and his family (business) in a story which has nothing in common with New York City or even the set up could be play in any other year in almost any decade. The trailer was misleading - I was waiting for the full scope of violence in NYC in the year of 1981. Instead we got a partially violent winter only. I enjoyed the story and the quiet score without replaying pop songs of the early 80's. I did enjoy the two lead performances and a surprise turn from a nearly unrecognizable Albert Brooks as the family attorney. Jessica Chastain had the strongest character so far in the movie.I loved the way the story evolved, slowly at first but steadily with a strong, confident ending...A week *** 1/2 or maybe strong *** out of 4.",

    "review": "  You could say it's another one of those movies we've seen all along these last years that seem so fashionable. Well it is, but it's not what you expect at the same time. The tensed atmosphere (wonderfully depicted by the splendid photography and its dim lights) gets to you from the first minute on and never goes away. The interpretation is great (Oscar Isaac keeps getting better) and so is the stage direction. The only regret we can have is that it does not end in flames, leaving us a bit disappointed and wanting more.",

    "review": "  Between this and Nightcrawler, I have been seeing my share of gritty 70s -feeling films as of late. Oscar Issac plays Abel Morales, an immigrant who simply wants to do business in Brooklyn honestly. Jessica Chastain plays his icy, but caring wife Anna. Her roots are with the mob. When their Standard Fuel trucks keep getting hijacked, it starts to drag the two into a world of corruption and the MOB. Methodically-paced based on a screenplay by JC Chandler, this is a film that starts with a simmer and ends with a rolling boil. Highly recommend. If this is not in my top ten it will be in my honorable mentions. Four Ball Point Pens. So says The Geek.",

    "review": "  ONE DOG SHORT OF A FULL AFTERNOON - My Review of A MOST VIOLENT YEAR (3 1/2 Stars)J.C. Chandor is clearly a filmmaker who refuses to be pegged. From MARGIN CALL's cutting Wall Street language to almost the complete absence of it in ALL IS LOST, he has announced himself as a writer/director who can seemingly tackle any genre. Filling the shoes quite well of the late Sidney Lumet, Chandor's third film, A MOST VIOLENT YEAR, just picked up National Board of Review awards for Best Picture, Actor (Oscar Isaac) and Supporting Actress (Jessica Chastain). Based on that, I went into the film with very high expectations, but left with mixed feelings.The story of a corrupt yet somewhat honorable heating oil company owner who faces many obstacles on his way to acquiring an important piece of land, the film is set in the winter of 1981. Isaac plays Abel with a quiet intensity unmistakably comparable to that of Al Pacino in THE GODFATHER. His wife and business partner (Chastain as Anna) comes from some vaguely detailed mob past, and her slow burn throughout is one of the film's great pleasures. Populated with a strong selection of characters straight out of THE SOPRANOS handbook and effortlessly conveying its time period (credit Production Designer John P. Goldsmith for not pushing things too hard), the movie is set a simmer for most of its running time. Sure there are a couple of thrilling chase sequences (one in a tunnel has great sound design and kept you on the edge of your seat despite its utter simplicity), but the film never truly explodes. Perhaps its title is misleading. Referring to a tumultuous year in New York City, the threat of violence is always around the corner, but it rarely goes there. Some may find this unbearably suspenseful, and at times it is, but I wanted it to jump out of its shell and go full \"ATTICA! ATTICA! ATTICA!\"The issue seems to be with Isaac's characterization and how the filmmakers take their cues from his tone. A study in grace under pressure, his character gets himself into a lot of dangerous situations but never seems to lose it. Chastain, on the other hands, gets to rage beautifully. She reminded me of Amy Adams in AMERICAN HUSTLE, all suppressed rage and surprising revelations. Albert Brooks plays Abel's lawyer, and its strong, workmanlike work, but like mostly everything else here, it's unfussy. David Oyelowo (INTERSTELLAR) has some fine moments and a bucket load of ambition as the District Attorney hungry to indict Abel. Elyes Gabel, however, nearly walks away with the picture as on of Abel's put-upon drivers. Desperate, scared and unpredictable, much of the story hinges on his actions, and I couldn't help but feel I wanted that kind of energy to be released from Isaac. Now don't get me wrong, Isaac is a great actor who seems poised to give us one memorable performance after another. From DRIVE to INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS to this, he's a bonafide, classic star, but Chandor's script clearly guided him to play it cool. One scene, however, will go down as an American classic. Without spoiling things, the words \"Please stop\" are most memorable, and in this GODFATHER-esque meeting of the mobsters, Abel's ability to dominate a room is a master class in uncluttered acting. Another terrific sequence involves a birthday party, a search warrant, and file boxes being quickly stashed away. This type of minutiae gives the film its loopy charm. I wish it had more of it.As the plot thickens, all of the motivations and double crosses wrap around each other and make you truly understand how understandable everyone's actions are, leaving you with a hopeful feeling of ever being able to make a profit in this world. It's final scenes are definitely shocking, leading up to a leaky image (you'll know it when you see it) which perfectly illustrates the movie's themes. I can't wait to see what Chandor does next, as he clearly loves movies and telling stories. If only he had really cut loose and ditched some of the formalities, but I'm ok with a very, very good if overpraised film.",
