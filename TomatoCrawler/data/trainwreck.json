    "review": "  Comedian Amy Schumer has indeed made some incisive satirical commentary on the trials and tribulations of the modern woman, and while I can't say I'm a huge fan of her vocally fried stand-up delivery, she does prove herself a competent actress in this movie and her televised sketches. I was expecting this romcom to break a little ground though - be unabashedly unapologetic for fourth wave feminism, but it ends up reinforcing the traditional trope of one partner trying to change the other and the other one capitulating by the end. It's a cute gender-reversed capitulation with awkward Amy winning Aaron over by dancing along with the New York Knicks cheerleaders, but there's really no development as to why the two connected in the first place, and as such, whether there's enough gas in the tank to keep this tank rolling after the obligatory grand romantic gesture. Tilda Swinton, buffed and bronzed to unrecognizable perfection, channels devil in Prada as the bossy British editrix, LeBron James is a surprise comedic talent, and can DanRad BE any cooler making fun of himself in all manners of ridiculous cameos?",

Only thing I hated was the typical \"New York rom-com ending\", seriously the whole journalist apology article and flashmob performance thing has been done to death. Other than that, I'd totally pay to watch this again.",

    "review": "  All things considered, with every pun intended, this film could have easily been a \"Trainwreck,\" due to the fact that nobody has seen Amy Schumer leave her comfort zone as far as creating a feature film goes. I can say with certainty, that \"Trainwreck\" is one of my favourite films of 2015. Not only is it one of Judd Apatow's best films to date, but the dialogue and events that played out throughout this film felt so natural. As a reporter (Schumer) is hired to write a new article on a doctor (Bill Hader) who performs surgeries on major sports icons, she finds herself falling in love, which is something she never intended. As stale as that sounds, it is the freshest take on this type of story that I have seen in the last few years. I was laughing hysterically throughout this picture, and that is due to the great writing, tremendous acting, and a slow paced editing style that always adds that next level to Apatow's best works. \"Trainwreck\" does exactly what it sets out to do, and for that reason I can find no faults in this film. The one big fault that this film does suffer from however, like every Apatow film, it is just a tad too long. I am normally not a fan of this type of comedy, but it is so quick that I was laughing throughout almost every scene, and I was in tears on multiple occasions. Yes, a Judd Apatow comedy made me tear up... This film really is something special to the genre. It may just be me, but I believe this film is fantastic. \"Trainwreck\" was a huge surprise for me and I highly recommend it.",

    "review": "  A hard-drinking, hard-partying woman meets a relationship-eligible sports doctor.On a bit-by-bit basis, this comedy is pretty solid - not great comedic bits by any means, but mildly humorous. The best comic talent in the film is actually not Bill Hader or Amy Schumer but LeBron James, who is simply hilarious as Aaron's best friend.The problem with this film is the separation between its goals and what it accomplishes. Politically, Schumer and Apatow are part of modern feminism's movement against slut-shaming and female sexual empowerment, and it's clear that Amy (the character Schumer plays) represents this modern feminist. Yet because it's a romantic comedy through and through, reproducing all the cliches of that genre, Trainwreck forces Amy to change, to return to the tropes that marked women without the lessons of modern feminism. It's true that she never apologizes for her behavior, and the script never asks her to, but the recognition of her need to change indicates that the film's actual political position falls well short of its goals.Overall, while it's a decent comedy, Trainwreck's political aspirations fall short of its reality.",

    "review": "  The chick flick gets a necessary infusion of fresh blood under Schumer's able hands as, for once, the lead is not \"eccentric\" or \"not pretty\" or \"career driven\" or \"misunderstood\" or whatever bone is usually thrown the audience as for why she is not popping out kids to beat the band: she doesn't want that. In point of fact, she is the epitome of \"bad girl\" in that she sleeps around and how. She's seen in many scenes on her back with her legs splayed open. Or at least that's how it begins. No worries, she sees the error of her rebel ways, but only after we enjoy the ride to her change of mind. Along the way are pretty interesting characters too, not the least of which is Colin Quinn, finally given a role the SNL alum can get his teeth into. Some basketball players fill out the roles usually reserved for the ugly secondary \"friends\" clich�s aptly and the boyfriend, Hader, shares nice chemistry with Schumer. But this is Schumer's ticket and she does quite well in this her first time out. What's next? Team up with Melissa McCarthy, or is that too obvious?",

    "review": "  Amy Schumer is having what some might refer to as a moment. Her comedic rise has accelerated as her sketch comedy show has gained greater notoriety for its social commentary from a post-feminist feminist perspective. For many, Schumer has become a relevant and empowering creative voice, and the fact that she breaks free from the Hollywood \"thin is the only beautiful\" mold is refreshing. Her star is only going to rise higher as soon as audiences get a load of Trainwreck, a raunchy romantic comedy penned by Schumer herself and starring Schumer as the lead. Paired with director Judd Apatow (Knocked Up), Schumer excels and surprises in Trainwreck, a modest but appealing rom-com that's not afraid to get real when it counts and sweet when needed. Amy (Schumer) is a magazine writer in New York City and follows her dad's (Colin Quinn) words of wisdom he dispensed when she was ten years old: \"monogamy is unrealistic.\" Amy dates and sleeps with an assortment of men. Her current boyfriend Steven (the wrestler John Cena) likes to spend time at the gym but he doesn't quite satisfy her, at least enough not to still see other men. Amy's younger sister Kim (Brie Larson) rejected dad and settled down with a single dad and his son. The idea of marital bliss and raising children makes Amy uncomfortable. Amy's editor (Tilda Swinton) assigns her a profile on a sports surgeon, Aaron (Bill Hader), specifically because Amy hates and is ignorant of sports. Amy and Aaron hit it off and she confidently takes their relationship in a non-professional direction. It's then that Aaron surprises Amy. He calls her the next day and is interested in seeing her again. Amy has to come to terms with how to navigate a relationship with a good guy who understands her and would like more. The tone and spirit of Trainwreck is very clearly Schumer's voice, following her brand of sexually brash humor from an unapologetic and independent perspective. Amy is a love-em-and-leave-em character who would shrug at being called a \"loose woman.\" Then again if we applied these same standards to men we don't have the gender-swapped \"loose man\" nomenclature. Instead of the standard male playboy character who beds a plethora of sexual partners and then moves on about their day, this time it's a woman, and while perhaps this isn't the strongest foothold in the realm of being progressive, every bit counts (women can do it too!). Amy is unrepentant about her sexual appetites and she is not punished for them. Imagine that, a sexually liberated woman who enjoys sex and doesn't have to suffer some physical or psychological trauma related to her desires. We've come a long way from Mr. Goodbar. The character of Amy is much more than just her dating habits. She's ribald and unapologetic while finding ways to be relatable and more in depth than just the commitment-phobic lead character in a mainstream romantic comedy. Her views on relationships go back to idolizing her cad of a father and a strong sense of fatalism. Relationships can't work out so why bother? This accentuates Amy's already self-destructive habits, which make her in many ways our protagonist and antagonist. She's an enjoyable character who can also be mean-spirited, petty, and push the important people in her life away from her. Her biggest challenge isn't getting the story, holding a long-held secret, or even landing the guy, because he already wants to be with her. It's about whether she can accept a different view of herself. That's way more interesting and complicated than your standard rom-com fussbucket or workaholic.The content of Trainwreck is far easier to engage with than Apatow's previous film, 2012's This is 40. Even though she has a cushy job and a nice apartment in the big city, Amy's struggles with her relationship with her boyfriend, her sister, her father, and her boss, trying to please others without giving away too much of herself. Her father is the source of much of her discomfort as she and her sister debate how to take care of him in his ailing health. Where Amy views her father as an admirable straight-shooting guy who rebels against the social standards and expectations of decorum. Her sister views him as a bigoted and sexist jerk that was never much of a father. The slow acceptance Amy comes to about the degree of pain she's dealing with and guilt related to her father is a key development. Her rejection of the \"old ways\" is a repudiation of her father. The arguments that she has with Aaron are realistic, and he admits that he's uncomfortable with certain aspects of her lifestyle but he's not forcing her to change. There are some dramatic turns in the film that require Schumer to do some heavy dramatic lifting, and she carries it gracefully, keeping in character but also losing her carefree fa�ade. It opens up your sense of the character just as much as the actress. Trainwreck is still very much a romantic comedy and it spends its third act coalescing to its happy ending, but Schumer's self-deprecation won't let it get too saccharine. The movie is also funny quite often though it ultimately gives in to more rom-com conventions than subverting them. There's a funny sequence where Amy is trying to coax her boyfriend into being more vocally risqu� during sex, and John Cena does a great job awkwardly trying to be dirty. There's a funny moment tied to character as Amy mingles with far more straight-laced married women at a baby shower. They play a game of revealing secrets and it's everything you would want it to be. The satirical broadsides at the tabloid and celeb navel-gazing industry are broad but quite amusing, including article topics like \"Ugliest Celebrity Kids Under 6\" and, \"I'm Not Gay, You're Just Boring.\" Amy's self-destructive attitude and her outer layer of confidence lead to many humorous observations and exchanges, especially with Hader. The two actors have good chemistry and bounce off one another well, capturing a fun energy of a couple that really enjoys one another's company and exploring that. Swinton (Snowpiercer) is almost unrecognizable and quite hilarious as the unfeeling boss. The biggest scene-stealer and breakout star is the world's greatest basketball player, Lebron. He plays the standard rom-com \"concerned best friend,\" even warning Amy not to break his man's heart and having a dating debrief while playing very one-sided basketball with Aaron (all elements lampooned in last year's rom-com spoof, They Came Together). The basketball scene is particularly amusing as Lebron dominates his friend so casually and without ego. It's a fictionalized version of Lebron but the man just has natural comic timing and a star presence. I could totally see more acting work coming Lebron's way if he wanted it. However, there are jokes, storylines, and moments that don't feel as well constructed and simply don't work, enough that it hampers the overall impact of Schumer's story. There's a recurring theme of gay equals funny, notably when all of Cena's threats to a movie patron bear a striking homoerotic quality. That scene works well enough, but the theme reappears in a late storyline where a lisping intern at the magazine played by Ezra Miller (We Need to Talk About Kevin) unleashes his inner sexual freak, which involves a lot of homoerotic foreplay and positioning. It's a comedy angle that gets old fast. I also never believed the sentimentality attached to Amy's father after his health worsens. Schumer tries to turn a bigoted jerk into a well-liked character and it just doesn't connect. He has real physical struggles dealing with MS but at no point does he come across sympathetic. I sided with Kim on this one, though I think I wasn't supposed to by the film's end. There's also far too many supporting characters that just kind of float along the peripheral; this is common in Apatow comedies but these characters, from a homeless bum to Amy's work colleagues, don't feel well integrated. Hader's character is fairly underwritten, which again is something of a gender flip for the genre. There's a misfire late in the film when Lebron holds an intervention for Aaron. The core idea would work but Lebron's intervention participants include Chris Evert, Matthew Broderick, and Marv Albert, with the bulk of the jokes being Albert's in-game announcing. They don't address that the figures are playing themselves until much later in the scene, so I was wondering if somehow Broderick was Aaron's father. It's a miss. The movie-within-the-movie is also never that funny or satirical of Sundance indies, but thanks for the effort. As a side note, it seems like quite a missed opportunity that the Knicks game at the end of the film did not feature the Cavs. With Lebron as a supporting character, it would seem like a natural fit to include him in the climax. My theory on this is such: the Knicks play the Brooklyn Nets and we see Paul Pierce in a Nets uniform. As NBA fans know, Pierce left the Nets and signed with the Washington Wizards for the 2014-2015 season (he has since signed with the L.A. Clippers). That means that Trainwreck must have been filming the spring of 2014, which means Lebron was still with the Miami Heat. No wonder the movie didn't feature the Cavs in its finale. Also, in what NBA universe is Amar'e Stoudemire the star of the Knicks? Does Carmelo Anthony and his $120 million dollar contract not exist in this universe? It's a little comical that Stoudemire's knee surgery is given such dramatic stakes for a player that the Knicks were looking to dump. Trainwreck is by no means the disaster implied by its title. Even Amy isn't really a trainwreck of a person. She can be mean and self-destructive, but her shocking behavior isn't all that shocking. She drinks and has sex with multiple partners and does not feel shame in this. Look out, world. Yet it's Schumer's sprightly comedic voice that shines throughout the film even when certain jokes or storylines misfire. Make no mistake, Trainwreck is also a star vehicle for Schumer and she earns it. She even sheds some tears in very effectively dramatic moments. She can do it all (refraining from obvious bad joke...) and still be funny whether she's cutting someone to size or the butt of a joke. Trainwreck is an enjoyable romantic comedy, another in Apatow's sweet lineup of raunchy and somewhat old-fashioned romances with their happy endings. There should be more than enough to tide Schumer's fans and for her to make new ones. Nate's Grade: B+",

    "review": "  Amy Schumer is hardly the first comedienne to talk about her vagina and day-to-day feminine issues on a major platform, but her no holds-barred, real approach is fresh. It's hilarious. And it's necessary. If anything, I hope this turns people on to her Comedy Central sketch comedy show, INSIDE AMY SCHUMER, whose recent season 3 premiere won me over with an absolutely sublime tsunami of merciless feminist comedy. TRAINWRECK is cute, it's sexy, hell, it really is a fantastic syrupy sweet date movie (with all the NBA cameos and pussy humor, you truly gotta love how hard this tries and, honestly, succeeds in catering/pandering to both genders), but it's ultimately Amy Schumer fitting her style into a mold, instead of trying to create an entirely new one.",

Amy Schumer and Bill Hader have crazy great chemistry together, and are both fantastic in their roles. Lebron James and John Cena are surprisingly outrageous in this film, and offered some of the films best moments. The film isn't original and doesn't offer anything new, but the execution of the comedy and drama is why Trainwreck stands above the rest. Schumer wrote and starred in this film, and I am hoping that this brings her an entire new group of fans who were not previously familiar with her work. I thought the dramatic scenes worked well in classic Judd Appatow fashion. I did think the film ran for far too long, but thats a usualy complaint I have with this directors films.

    "review": "  ATTA GIRL! - My Review of TRAINWRECK (4 Stars)Much like Judd Apatow's collaboration with Lena Dunham for GIRLS, his work with comic and bonafide \"it girl\", Amy Schumer, has produced a thoroughly satisfying look at women one can actually recognize as human beings. While both are feminists, Dunham and Schumer seem to dismiss such a broad characterization in favor of one that says women can match men inch-for-inch in their ability to be assholes. Directing for the first time from a script he didn't write (the honors go to Schumer), Apatow has made what is clearly his best film so far. Schumer plays Amy, a hard-partying journalist with commitment issues, who is assigned to write a profile on Aaron (Bill Hader) a sports medicine physician, and sparks unexpectedly fly. From an early age, Amy and her sister (Brie Larson) were taught by their philandering father (Colin Quinn) that \"monogamy isn't realistic\". It's a hilariously written and lovingly shot opening scene that sets the stage for Amy's eventual crash and burn 23 years later. What follows is a funny sequence in which Amy dismisses conquest after conquest, sometimes unsure where she is most mornings when she does her inevitable walk of shame. What's delightful is that Schumer, unlike many stand-ups who become lead actors, fully commits to her character, never breaking or winking at the audience. Sure she gets the laughs, no great surprise, but what startles is her ability to make you cry without it feeling forced or cheesy. Her ability to appropriate that working class sensibility mixed with real smarts reminds me of Roseanne Barr in her prime. A Golden Globe nomination for writing and acting seems inevitable. Thank goodness they have the Musical/Comedy category! Joining Schumer is a stellar cast, with Brie Larson lending believable familial chemistry to her scenes with Schumer. Same goes for Quinn, whose monster dad is given so many lovable qualities that you can't help but side with many of his renegade opinions. At Amy's magazine, called S'NUFF of all things, her haughty and horrible editor is played by a completely unrecognizable Tilda Swinton, sporting enough bronzer and flowing ginger locks to keep Hollywood well-stocked in tanned versions of Emma Stone. Swinton's comic timing is impeccable, nailing her narcissistic character's breezy indifference to anything that doesn't involve her. Vanessa Bayer, one of many SNL actors in the film, seems to have cornered the market on mousy/happy roles, and every painful, toothy pause, especially when Swinton tries to get her to stop smiling, is gold. Ezra Miller uses his gawky male model androgyny to great effect in one ridiculously odd scene. Bill Hader, so wonderful in last year's THE SKELETON TWINS, embodies a fantastic male romantic lead, overcoming his character's perceived dullness to win you over with the loving, patient way he has with Amy.The biggest surprises, however, and the actors many people will be discussing are the athletes John Cena, Amar'e Stoudemire, and LeBron James. Cena plays one of Amy's boyfriends and his outbursts over his closeted homosexuality brings many laughs to the first act. Stoudemire has a woozy charm as one of Hader's patients, but it's James who wins the MVP award in this movie. He fully rounds out his cheapskate, busybody, heavily fictionalized version of himself, complete with surprising TV tastes and neediness. This is one superstar basketball player who knows how to deliver off the court too. TRAINWRECK is about a woman who learns how to grow up and love herself. It's somehow conservative that way, adhering to romcom tropes, yet it skewers all of the conventions simultaneously. This is a smart, rich entertainment, humanist in temper, reminding me at times of James L. Brooks' early films TERMS OF ENDEARMENT and BROADCAST NEWS, both of which also featured strong, flawed women at their centers. Also like those predecessors, Apatow likes to leave scenes loose. It's become something of a trademark of his, and TRAINWRECK suffers from uneven pacing and a few repetitive argument scenes between Schumer and Hader. There's even one misfire of an intervention scene loaded with odd celebrity cameos that took me right out of the movie. Ultimately it doesn't matter too much, since so much bite co-exists with so much kindness in this film. Lovingly shot by cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes (GIRLS, TINY FURNITURE, MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE) with what at times feels like an Instagram 70s filter, TRAINWRECK is a big budget movie with the soul of an indie. If you aren't reduced to a puddle by Schumer's big dramatic speech, or if your heart doesn't melt by Hader's reaction to the final act event, then maybe YOU'RE the one who needs to belly up to a bar and drink your feelings instead.",

    "review": "  Wrecking it for all rom-coms to follow, this whipsmart Train keeps chugging along thanks to honest, intelligent and hilarious look at monogamy come-lately. Characterizing Schumer as just a bawdy sketch comedienne gives one of the industry's sharpest minds short shrift. She kills it in long form too which is how superstars get made. An extension of her frank observations on Comedy Central's Inside Amy Schumer, this filmic misadventure also marks director Judd Apatow's best work since Knocked Up. This film doesn't just take a hard look at commitment phobia, it gives amazingly fresh and doubled-over laughingly funny insight into modern dating and romance. In this R-rated comedy, a commitment-phobic career woman (Schumer) who never thought that monogamy was possible faces her fears when she meets a good guy (Hader). Not only does Schumer's screenplay present a unique warts 'n' all romantic comedy, she emerges as one of the best comedic actresses working in film today. Lebron James nearly derails her train a few times with a fantastically funny supporting turn, but there's no denying this comedienne's R-rated charm. Sure, her big screen starring debut falls into formula a bit but rom-coms dictate a good deal of connecting the dots or else it becomes relationship tragedy. Brilliant and beautiful, her Trainwreck is an absolute for adult moviegoers who appreciate a dirty joke.Bottom line: N'Yuk-ed Up",

    "review": "  Trainwreck was written by and stars comedienne Amy Schumer. If you've ever seen her standup comedy, you might already know if you do or do not want to see this. She's funny, but very irreverent and potentially offensive. Many (although not all) of her jokes are shocking and sexual, with a rare racial joke thrown in. Trainwreck boldly puts female sexuality out there in a way that most movies don't. We start off seeing writer Amy in a dating relationship with the uber muscular Steven, played by John Cena. There is a funny bedroom scene where she asks him to talk dirty, and he tries...and tries, but it's just not quite working for her. He is a great guy with some weird tendencies in movie theaters who is in love with her, but he is not right for her, so they part ways. This frees her up to meet her Mr. Right. Amy's shockingly ruthless boss Dianna, played by Tilda Swinton, sends Amy on assignment to interview and write a piece on Dr. Aaron Conners, played by Bill Hader. He is a surgeon to sports stars, and numerous real life sports stars make appearances in Trainwreck, with LeBron James getting the most screentime. After Aaron's and Amy's first night together, he calls her. These two turn into a cute couple. This may be the first relationship she has truly taken seriously, and it seems to be helping her move in a healthy direction. With this one, she won't be having other men on the side, which has been a bad habit of hers until now.Amy's father and sister and sister's family like Aaron, too. When Amy goes through a tragic loss, Aaron is there for her. She even sort of moves in with him. Suddenly, there is trouble in paradise. Amy and Aaron go through a bunch of drama with each other, followed by a breakup, followed by Amy reverting to her old habits, accidentally going to bed with an underage guy!, which leads to her losing her job, which leads to her realizing she wants Aaron back.The finale is a fun reunion scenario with a big happy ending. While I like the ending, I'm not really convinced Amy has enough of her issues worked out to truly make it in this relationship, without more help, more recovery, and more support towards long-term sobriety.",

    "review": "  Decent rom-com from Writer-Star Amy Schumer and Director Judd Apatow...and if Apatow could just learn to cut the damn fat it would be a great romantic comedy. Unfortunately a lot of the scenes and jokes are dragged out longer than they need to be, and there is too much obvious improv that seems to be taking the place of actual character development. I enjoyed the movie, thought it was funny plenty of times, but as a movie, it just feels bloated. It is Apatow's style, he just needs an editor to teach him how to drop the stuff he really likes that doesn't belong. Still Schumer's voice comes through and gives this rom-com a fresh angle that doesn't feel like the tripe you see come out so often. She is what made this work, and her rapport with fellow comedian Hader is solid. She just needs a director who is a little less self indulgent when it comes to the improv stuff.",

I was expecting this romcom to break a little ground though - be unabashedly unapologetic for fourth wave feminism, but it ends up reinforcing the traditional trope of one partner trying to change the other and the other one capitulating by the end. It's a cute gender-reversed capitulation with awkward Amy winning Aaron over by dancing along with the New York Knicks cheerleaders, but there's really no development as to why the two connected in the first place, and as such, whether there's enough gas in the tank to keep this tank rolling after the obligatory grand romantic gesture. Tilda Swinton, buffed and bronzed to unrecognizable perfection, channels devil in Prada as the bossy British editrix, LeBron James is a surprise comedic talent, and can DanRad BE any cooler making fun of himself in all manners of ridiculous cameos?",

    "review": "  Trainwreck is very funny at times. Unfortunately those times more often don't feature Amy Schumer than they do which is strange as she is probably the funniest person on the cast. And yet Some of the best laughs in the movie, at least in my opinion, come from Colin Quinn or, of all people JOHN CENAAAA, who is absolutely hilarious in his 2-3 appearances, with LeBron James being quite funny at times as well. The problem, I think, is not in the comedy aspect of the movie but in the 'Romantic' one. Schumer and Hader could not be less suited for each other as co-stars, and the relationship bits that usually make the rom-com work are an utter failure in this case. Furthermore the Amy Schumer show shtick translates poorly to a feature length format as does, in my opinion, the Judd Apatow approach to comedy with a single female lead. The tension is artificial and the ending is a stinker but the movie is enjoyable, overall. Even if it fails as a big R Romantic comedy it is a lot funnier than most others so I would perhaps cautiously recommend it anyway.",

I have always liked Amy Schumer, long before she became the latest \"It Girl.\" I was happy to hear her first film was \"uproariously hilarious.\" So many reviewers and others said it was just non-stop laughter. Well, needless to say, it didn't live up to the hype. Yep, I did laugh out loud a few times, but I felt the story was predictable and often I felt the jokes fell flat. The supporting cast is pretty good. Bill Hader is excellent as the boyfriend. The sports figure cameos were hit and miss - LeBron James and John Cena acquitted themselves well. I didn't hate the film at all. I just need to make sure I see these \"gut-busting\" films right away. Maybe I'll like them more.",

I knew I wouldn't like it when I saw the trailer, and I was right. Not only was it bad it was boring. I think Amy was forced to go along with what the studio wanted and they ruined any creativity she might have brought to it. I was also very disappointed that they used so many SNL people in the movie. Who even watches SNL anymore, and these SNL players are so shticky. Bill Hader, Vanessa Bayer, Pete Davidson, and Leslie Jones did not add value to the movie at all. They should have cast actual actors for the film. They could have introduced some talented new people. The male lead should be a hunky, handsome guy and someone who had chemistry with Amy. Bill Hader was nothing like a typical orthopedic doctor and why would Amy Schumer's character be attracted to him? Bill Hader is weird looking and not a good actor. The movie was too long at over 2 hours. The plot kept switching from raunchy comedy to rom-com to serious drama. It was all over the place.",

The little I had seen I kind of liked but just not enough yet for me to really be rooting for her success. After seeing Trainwreck though, her writing was really shining through and her fearlessness in tackling really sex-heavy subject matter (like any dude-helmed comedy would wade through) shows her wanting to turn over the status quo for women and comedy and put everything on the table for everyone. Kind of in the way I Love You, Man aimed at sex and relationships, Trainwreck is doing the same but with a woman - and spoiler alert: it's still funny as shit! The big drawbacks I personally saw in the film were just problems all throughout the 3rd act with the story being too much like a roller coaster. It swerves between huge tragedy and comedy trying to save face too much and too deeply, without leaving time for the audience to realize what's going on and understand the effect on the characters in a real way. Which stinks because the comedy touches on such an intimate and relatable level all up to that point.I would say definitely see it in theaters with friends - absolutely worth the ticket and the fun time in a crowd.",

And it was an interesting film as well, due to the fact that it was a romantic comedy, but flipped to putting the female in the position of the stereotypical male role of these films. It was the girl who needed to get her act together and prove her love, rather than the guy as is typically the case. The film surprising had a good amount of drama in it as well which gave it heart and depth. And there were ton of celebrity cameos!",

When LE bron James is the star of the show, don't go. Still no really good laughs, maybe a couple. Then it gets really like hearstringy and ploty and I'm like geting emotional for these characters I like who are dying and breaking up and F. Sometimes you have to beleive it when people say pass.

    "review": "  I've come to admire Schumer through her innovative sketch show on Comedy Central, but generally stay away from contemporary gross-out comedies of the Apatow genre, which I generally find dreary and rarely very funny, unless farts and other juvenilia are one's thang. Here we have a fairly conventional rom-com setup in reverse -- party girl mistrusts commitment, meets boy who wants to settle down, girl flees, boy persists, girl returns, boy gets girl after all. Layered onto this schematic is Schumer's truly edgy persona of an empty, drunk, sexually compulsive trainwreck of a woman, which is only these days possible for a general audience, especially other women, to warm up to. It's a schtick, that wears thin fast, like most exaggerations. What makes the whole thing work is Schumer's writing, which remains sharper than average, and the supporting cast, a stellar group that includes Quinn, Hader, and Brie Larson, the latter being the only contributor who doesn't have roots in standup, giving the whole thing some razor-sharp timing. I wouldn't nominate this concoction for anything, but it's head and shoulders above the Melissa McCarthy rash that the industry seems to have contracted.",

Judd Apatow begins the film a comedy then throws some real life situation drama in. Not a fan of any of this? That's fine. I personally am a fan, mostly of Apatow. I do know the formula as I stated before but there is something about his portrayal of situations that millions of everyday people that makes it more relatable to me at least. Amy Scuhmer's script fits with the subject matter of a Apatow helm film which mkes the pairing work the more. The two leads honestly have a great chemistry an there are surprising funny support from the likes of LeBron James, Tilda Swinton and Colin Quinn. If you're curious, check it out.

    "review": "  I'm reviewing a sleeper hit called Trainwreck that actually isn't a train wreck. The film is directed by Judd Apatow and, in double duty, written and starring somebody named Amy Schumer. Schumer, who nobody knew when this was released back in July 2015, is practically a household name among film fans now because of her memorable work in this film. Judd Apatow has directed a few fairly funny raunchy comedies and this is no exception either, this is a fairly funny foul mouthed movie (thanks to Schumer) filled with buckets of sex jokes - sex scenes - and practically everything else your dirty mind could imagine...Trainwreck is the story of a dirty men's magazine writer named Amy (Played by Amy Schumer) whose life consists of one night flings, hangovers, and working at the magazine. One day, Amy is assigned by her boss Dianna (Played by the unrecognizable Tilda Swinton) to write an article about a sports doctor named Aaron Chambers (Played by Bill Hader). Soon, Amy finds herself falling for Aaron and vice versa.  Amy Schumer stars in Trainwreck, and it's her first time leading a film (She has a popular television show Inside Amy Schumer which she also leads). Schumer is great - she hits all the right notes as Amy, she has comedic timing and she effectively displays Amy's imperfect habits and traits and also a lot of heart and relatability and awkwardness that make the character who she is. Bill Hader is only OK as Schumer's love interest. LeBron James and John Cena are scene stealers and (in a small cameo) Leslie Jones had me laughing my head off. One other thing; kudos to anyone who recognizes Tilda Swinton in this film... For a comedy, there is a surprisingly strong amount of pure romance and pure drama. You can't call this a rom-com or a dramedy because this film isn't solely two genres it's a comedy and a drama and a romance film. All these different genre make it difficult for the film to find a beat and a tone. You'll watch this movie and you won't quite be sure whether it's appropriate to laugh or be sad or be happy. This consistent tonal shift causes some of the jokes to fall flat.  I also found that the film was way too raunchy and that its raunchiness took away from the enjoyment of the film. There isn't a line of dialogue that comes out of Schumer's mouth that doesn't include an innuendo. We see John Cena's buttocks several times (just because it's Amy Schumer writing this film) and we see John Cena and Amy Schumer get down with it early on in the film. If I got a penny every time there was a sex joke I would be a millionaire now. Don't get me wrong, a lot of the sex jokes were funny but after a while they began to overwhelm.  I think the best writing came in the film's final half hour... In this final half hour, I laughed a lot more than I expected to and when the film concluded I felt satisfied.   All and all, Trainwreck is a funny and enjoyable film (thanks to Amy Schumer) even if it suffers from a lack of consistent tone and overwhelming raunchiness. B- 12/18/15 & 12/21/15",

She basically lives the typical modern life until it \"gets real.\" I never knew Schumer before this, but aside from this film, I can see her being pretty hilarious. It did feel like it was dragging on at some points judging by the length of the film, but it did still bring in enough laughs. I tend to rate comedies by how much/hard I laugh, and I will admit that this one didn't seem to have much escape from me, but it did have a pretty good plot along side most of the comedy. It was also quite hilarious seeing Matthew Broderick (and of course the obvious LeBron James as a self role along with the sports references).

Its a great build over the course of the film and worth the ride, will be interesting to see how Shummer follows this one up. Also look for one of the female Ghostbusters four in a subway bit part getting a little exporsure before donning her proton pack next summer. Solid.",

    "review": "  ***** ExcellentI \"am-track\" to proclaim \"Trainwreck\" as one of the best movies of 2015, and definitely the paramount comedic film of the year. Comedy movie director Judd Apatow's latest gem stars comedian Amy Schumer as Amy, a commitment-phobic New York party-girl lush, who unexpectedly falls for restrained sports surgeon Aaron; nicely played by Apatow fav Bill Hader. But there is so much more to \"Trainwreck\" than its opposites-attract romantic story. Simply put, it is filled with some authentic and clever comedic scenes that made me laugh to pieces. Schumer not only is deserving of a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her spot-on starring performance, but also deserves another golden- boy nod for her outstanding comedic screenplay of the picture. \"Trainwreck\" is also filled with super supporting performances from Brie Larson as Amy's sister, an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton as Amy's editor boss, and Colin Quinn as Amy's non-monogamous pop; and it also had some surprising good cameo-thespian scores from famous athletes Wrestler John Cena, NBA former star (sorry Amar'e) Amar'e Stoudamire, and a NBA basketball player that won a couple of championships in Miami and then deserted Miami to go back home (yes, I am a Heat fan); and yes, I am referring to LeBron. So get on that comedic gem train, and take a ride with the stellar \"Trainwreck\".",

The two gel even though she does not believe it. Trainwreck was not a great comedy and had so many generic humor bits inserted into it. John Cena a muscle jock who is sensitive, or a girl willing to talk about gross things etc. The characters are okay, and the angle with Bill Hader's career with repairing knees for athletes was somewhat interesting, but I thought this was a pretty sub-par comedy. As a movie the film is okay movie on relationships, but overall the movie just did not impress me and I wanted to like it. The movie just feels forced and tries too hard to be edgy and impressive.",

She is, quite frankly, obnoxious. Surprisingly she isn't a bad actress but too often her true personality comes through and, as a protagonist, it destroys much of the film. I think she would be better suited for the obnoxious friend of the main girl. Bill Hader does a solid job but is mostly forgettable. Honestly, the only reason this film is worth watching is for the plethora of celebrity cameos, highlighted by LeBron James. They all play versions of themselves in hilarious skits that fit neatly into the plot. If it wasn't for James, John Cena, Amare Stoudemire, etc. this film would be among the worst comedies I've seen in recent memory.",

Other than the fact that she was very unfussy about who she slept with I couldn't work out why anybody (other than family) bothered with her. She wasn't kind, considerate or sensitive in any way and yet she somehow attracted some nice blokes. This alone in most cases would be a showstopper but what rescues it a little is the cameos in the film. Jon Cena (yes, the wrestler) is funny and his \"I look like I ate Mark Wahlberg\" line was particularly funny. I also enjoyed Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomeis black and white arthouse film cameo. It reminded me a little of the black and white film mickey takes in the marvellous 500 Days Of Summer. LeBron James (yes, THE) also not bad at times and as for Tilda Swinton, well you really have to see her in this to believe its actually her. Amazing work on the makeup front.  In not a huge fan of Judd Apatos work (Bridesmaids and Get Him To The Greek excepted) and I'm not familiar with Amy Schumer's stand up (I hear she is a comedian when not exposing herself for calendars). Maybe this point is key, if you are a fan of either or both, then the chances are that you will enjoy this. It's just that Trainwreck suffers from not being my cup of tea but when all is said and done this may be a good thing.",

    "review": "  Amy Schumer's breakthrough film was certainly one of the more hyped comedies of the year. With writer/producer/director Judd Apatow at the helm, combined with Schumer's astute comedic observations made Trainwreck seem like a match made in comedic heaven on paper. Her quick wit makes her TV series en pointe for that very reason, yet Trainwreck isn't quite in up to the same standard.Schumer herself is great in a role that combines her typically acerbic view on contemporary relationships with some interesting dramatic points. As a sarcastic nod to the traditional romantic comedy, Schumer's script is interesting and entertaining, but never quite the scathing indictment of modern relationships it seems like it's trying to be. The point of contention more often than not is Trainwreck isn't sure if it wants to be a comedy or a cautionary tale, which is sadly so often the case with Apatow's films.So while there are parts that are uneven, there are parts that work well. Bill Hader is great as her honest romantic interest, but even better is the as usual completely underrated Brie Larson as Schumer's grounded sister. The cast is great, and there are laughs to be had; which keeps Trainwreck as a notable starting point for Schumer as a comedic actress.",

    "review": "  It took me a long time to see this film. I wasn't thrilled with the trailers and I've never really been a fan of Amy Schumer's comedy, but I finally sat down and gave the film a shot. Only to see pretty much exactly what I expected out of this film, raunchy comedy, plenty of cameos, cliched story, and a lengthy Judd Apatow film. It's not that there's anything wrong with any of that, but there's just wasn't enough to this film. It wasn't funny and there wasn't a ton of depth with the cliched story. I will say however, the cameos were great, and supply with the film with some of it's rare comedic moments. I didn't hate Trainwreck, but I wasn't thrilled with it either.Trainwreck focuses on Amy Schumer's character amply named 'Amy' and her lack of desire to stay with a man for an extended period of time. The refreshing thing is that this time the character who can't settle down is a woman, considering we get so many of these films each year focusing on a male character. The problem is, the story isn't new at all. It never separates itself from other cliched rom-com-drams. With that said, there are a few redeeming qualities.The first being the numerous great cameos (or in some cases small roles). The obvious one, especially from the trailer, is LeBron James, who absolutely crushes the comedy he's given. So much so that I feel as though they wrote specific scenes just for him and added them in later (an example of the film probably being too long). There also other cameos, mostly tied to James, that make the film far more entertaining than it should have been.Schumer and Hader have solid chemistry as an odd couple and I really enjoy when Hader takes roles that call for his dramatic chops rather than only his comedic side. But I think the standout for this film, which should be no surprise, is Brie Larson. Easily one of the best up and coming actresses today, and likely the Oscar winner this year for her role in Room, she outshines Schumer in scenes that are specifically built to make us care more for Amy, that's an incredible actress.So in all, Trainwreck was just okay. It's not particularly funny and it doesn't take advantage of what should have been a fresh premise. But it does have some memorable moments with funny cameos. Just cut down the length and focus more on the dramatic side without pushing the raunchy comedy down our throats and it could be a solid film.+Cameos+Larson-Comedy doesn't hit-Too long5.9/10",

    "review": "  Where do I begin with this film. Of course, as you can see from the rating, I genuinely did enjoy this film, perhaps less than I probably would've expected, but by and large, I'd say that this is a more than solid comedy. Amy Schumer has also made the transition from stand-up comic to movies fairly seamlessly. I do like that her persona, in this film at least, is not necessarily realistic, but she is most definitely a flawed human being and I don't think the movie chooses to glamorize Amy's flaws or pretend that she's perfect. I don't think it's necessarily risky to do this, but her character, I know, will be considered unlikable by a good chunk of people. But again, I think the character is smartly written because it covers the ups and downs that all of us go through. We're not all always perfect, approachable or even that nice to other people, but that's just how life is. People are complex human beings and expecting someone to be perfect all the time is simply unrealistic and I think that that's something that Amy Schumer brings to the screen surprisingly well, from both a screenwriting and acting standpoint. But the problems are obvious once you're done with the film. First, at close to two hours, it is simply too long of a movie for the type of raunchy comedy that this is trying to be. Don't get me wrong, there can be films like this, also at two hours long, that fly by, like Spy, but it's in the minority. The problem lies in the fact that the pacing leaves a lot to be desired. But, truthfully, the pacing is a symptom of a much bigger problem and that is the fact that, comedically speaking, the film is incredibly inconsistent. Like there are moments where the film, I won't say is laugh out loud, but there are some really funny bits in the film. Like I thought Amy's scenes with her meathead boyfriend, played by WWE wrestler John Cena, were actually really funny. And they were funny because of John Cena, because Amy pretty much played the straightwoman role in these scenes. Amy herself has some real funny moments as well, she'd almost have to have them since she is the leading woman. Bill Hader is always a joy. And LeBron James is, surprisingly, really good in this movie. And I'm being completely serious about that. It's obvious that LeBron isn't experienced or anything, like this may even be his first acting role, but he did great for a novice. And, obviously, the editing of the film was bound to have made LeBron looked good, but the guy also has to perform in order for them to be able to get the best shots and the guy did great. The scene with LeBron and Bill in the cafe discussing Aaron's relationship with Amy and how LeBron kept turning the conversation about Cleveland's greatness was really funny. There's also this really great scene where Marv Albert does play-by-play for Aaron's intervention. That's probably the funniest scene here. But, sadly, there's also long bits of the film that just aren't that funny. A lot of the stuff at Amy's job really didn't click for me. Tilda Swinton is an excellent actress, but her character just wasn't that funny to me. Not that she was designed to be hilarious, but she's given a lot zingers and none of them really click. A lot of the scenes at the magazine just don't work and I feel like there was a lot of focus on them, not like it took up more than half of the movie, because of the fact that they had Tilda Swinton in the film and if I had Tilda Swinton in my movie then I'd want her on screen as much as possible. There are also times when there are jokes that don't seem to have much reason to exist other than there should be a joke at the end before cutting to the next scene. I don't wanna say they're completely pointless, but they also don't do a good job at justifying themselves. So I just don't know what you call that. I thought Amy Schumer and Bill Hader had good chemistry, but I just didn't find their characters to be all that interesting honestly. Amy, pardon the pun, is literally a trainwreck. She's a drunk, she smokes weed and she's an openly sexual woman. Aaron is the complete opposite. So you'd think they'd play more with that, but they don't. I mean, they do, but not in a completely satisfying way. The film aims to be subversive rom-com with role reversals a-plenty and I'm more than fine with that. I think we need more movies like this and Spy that play with the basic idea of what roles men and women play in these types of films, but all it boils down to in this film is 'I'm a woman and this is what I do' and that's all there is to it. There's nothing wrong with that, but that's just a hollow attempt at trying to subvert the usual cliches you see in these kinds of films. What was done was the easiest to accomplish. I don't think they play with the role reversals as much as they could. And not that they needed to beat you over the head with it, it could've been done very subtle. There's a lot of male nudity, whereas it's usually the women getting naked. That's pretty much all there is in terms of turning the cliches upside down. It's, literally, like the easiest thing you could've done. It's not clever. So that was really disappointing as, again, I thought so much more could've been done. Honestly, outside of LeBron, and Cena at the beginning, the supporting cast leaves a lot to be desired. I take that back, I thought Amy's relationship with her sister, in film of course, was strong. But, other than that, the supporting cast of characters isn't great. None are what you would call particularly memorable. There's one memorable scene with Ezra Miller's character, but that's about it. None of them really stand out or are really anything special. And that's a problem, because when you have a film that's as long as this, you need those characters to give your leads some time to rest. The film doesn't really have any of that. As far as I can tell, LeBron and Amy only interacted during the one scene. Like had an actual conversation. That was weak, would've been interesting to see some more scenes between the two. Though, to be fair, if they were filming during NBA season, then they probably had very limited access to LeBron. Amy Schumer isn't afraid to make herself look bad in the film and that's definitely a positive to the film. But there's not much to the character besides her not buying into the monogamist lifestyle and being a trainwreck. They try some stuff with her father, but it doesn't really work that well, at least to me. Look, I'm glad the film was successful, as I truly believe we need more movies like this, or more movies that attempt to subvert the typical cliches, but the fact of the matter is that this if Amy Schumer's first, official, attempt at writing a full-length film. I'm sure she had some help from Judd Apatow, but this was still her baby. Her first script and it definitely shows in the final product. The film is good and it has some real funny moments, but it's unfocused, inconsistent and longer than it needs to be. Trainwreck, much like Amy's eponymous character, is a truly flawed film. It's a good starting point, but Amy Schumer can only get better from here. I can only really recommend this as a solid rental. Enjoyable, but should've been much better.",

There's a daring premise of girl who isn't used to commitment actually falling in love, but besides the charm and humor of the two lead roles, who compliment each other well, there isn't really anything in the way of plot. Meeting through her work assignment was fine, but using the Dad's illness and death as a crutch proved that it didn't have any narrative force and needed something to fill some time and add a dynamic. It's better than most romantic comedies, but it was still very flawed.",

If the genders were flipped, this movie would have flopped so hard. Everyone would have said, \"Why is that man being so abusive to that woman? Why would we root for him?\" I mean imagine a movie where a guy is always sleeping around, then he meets a girl who wants to settle down, but he doesn't want to. Then he's a dick to her about it and says \"Why don't you just go be with someone who wants that stuff?\" after walking out on her important speech to smoke weed in the hallway. Plus, Judd Apatow once again doesn't know how to leave things on the editing floor.

Luckily he makes pretty good comedies that could just be a little better with tighter editing. This is Amy Schumer's show, however, and she's terrific. She hilarious in this, and really gets to shine as a comedy actress. The casting may not be perfect, I'm still not sure about Bill Hader or moreso Colin Quinn. I also wish Schumer had delved a little deeper into how much of a \"trainwreck\" supposedly her character is. For example, one of the things the film kind of ultimately glosses over is that Amy (the character) is an alcoholic, and the ramifications of it are never explored. But otherwise a great comic effort, hope to see Schumer in more (good) comedies.",

    "review": "  There's a lot to like here and some hilarious stuff, but the rhythm is so awful it makes it very hard to connect to the story or the characters. This is par for the course for Judd Apatow's films, which are cautionary tales of what happens when you don't believe in deleted scenes (insanely, the DVD has a couple of deleted scenes, so why cut those and leave in the one where LeBron James holds an intervention for Bill Hader's character that inexplicably involves Matthew Brodereck? Right before a really sweet and moving scene between Amy and her sister? Ack). Somebody, for the love of god, get this man an editor. That aside, this is Amy Schumer's movie and she stocks it with a murderer's row of funny people, draws funny out of LeBron James and John Cena, and even though I was constantly baffled by the clunkiness of the picture I still laughed my damn ass off.",

As expected, Amy Schumer delivers intelligent bold comedic genius to challenge the accepted \"norm\" of family, children, monogamy, relationships, and, surprisingly, sports. Thank you, Amy, for calling that one out! The comedy is beautifully offset with touching and relatable moments and thoughts on the father-daughter dynamic from the opposing perspective of the two sisters. Bill Hader brings a perfect match for Schumer's character's father issues as the likable, patient, and loving grown-up. John Cena and LeBron James were an unexpected delight.",

After finally getting through 2 hours of watching Schumer have sex and smoke weed, there is one lone bright spot: with some more lessons, Lebron James is looking at life after basketball.",

The story follows a typical plot line: boy meets girl, they fall in love, there's a conflict and they break up, then someone performs a great feat to win the other back.Warning: the paragraph above may contain spoilers.The point is, despite the standard formula, Schumer's writing and delivery make this a really enjoyable ride.3.5 out of 5 starsWhat worked: Tilda Swinton was marvelous as Amy's boss.What didn't: Seeing John Cena naked.",

    "review": "  Trainwreck is the smash debut of Amy Schumer to the masses who both wrote and starred in this film that attempts to flip the formula of a commitment-phobic man and instead center on a woman who's proud of her detachment from romance...only thing they forgot to bring was laughs. Amy Schumer has been rising in popularity with her hit show, Inside Amy Schumer, but apart from a few crass line deliveries, I found her performance more grating than funny and her character is unbearable to say the least. Following a character who lovingly sleeps around, drinks and does drugs at whim, is a complete asshole to anyone around her, and acts this immature was impossible to latch onto and though the movie wants us to dislike her, I can't see how any of the men even got past second base before bailing. The shining light in the film is the supporting players like Tilda Swinton, Brie Larson, and of course Bill Hader, who isn't given much to do except react to the crazy situations she puts him in, but man is he trying and he scored a few laughs from me based on his body language alone. Being a Judd Apatow film there is of course numerous meaningless cameos and while some work like an extended appearance from John Cena and Lebron James basically in a supporting role, cameos near the end like Mathew Broderick and Method Man are extremely pointless and don't get a laugh. I seriously have no idea what I'm missing and why this film has been getting such rave reviews as it's a below-average comedy that barely got a laugh from me and as usual with an Apatow movie; it's too long and leans way too heavily on drama in the final act. I admire the film's attempt to portray women in the same unflattering light as men can be in similar roles and it's attempt to be the next \"Bridesmaids\", but funny is funny, and this script's potential is squandered with lame, unflattering execution. I did enjoy the last cheerleading scene; that was pretty cute!",

Some pretty good jokes & one-liners throughout, mostly thanks to Schumer, with Hader playing a less zany character than usual - no impressions at all! The guest stars are good - Lebron James & Matthew Broderick, as are Birbiglia, Larson and Quinn as Amy's family. It's sometimes crass, but is a decent look at relationships in these modern times. Sometimes a bit too formulaic, but enough to like here.",

In the movie she never came, then realised I was tricked or I failed to pay attention while choosing the film. So then, who the heck was this actress. Never seen or heard before, Not so romantic or funny, totally boring. I thought She might be Will Ferrell's sister. I'm kind of frustrated because of either the movie or the actors were not excited to keep going with my watch.This is the same old story, but instead it's a woman's version. A playgirl loses the someone who loves her sincerely for what she's and later finds the one true love of her life, but it ends in a disaster due to her past. So how everything is going to be fixed is what brings curtain to the narration.It might be a well known plot, but a well crafted movie as well by one of the best comedy filmmaker who has given many awesome ones. Despite his effort to make it big it is also his bottom of the list from his filmography. Well, not all the actors were so bad, John Cena was so funny with his gay jokes, but lot like in a guest appearance. The basketball superstar that I don't know him. Definitely better than average only if a quality movie like this would have had a proper lead actress. I think some people would find it hilarious, but not to me and I wanted to like it, but I couldn't.5/10",

But the rest of the picture is dull, boring with a catastrophic lack of good jokes. Trying to make a joke of course but they have failed.The only thing that I like is the acting work. Amy Schumer coped very well but due to the fact that her character is nasty. Brie Larson as good. Bill Hader is brilliant. His character was not as nasty as the others.

Amy might be funny in real life but I didn't laugh once or even smile for the whole film. Is it a comedy, a rom com, a commentary on life? God knows but I would advise anybody to avoid it like the plague.",

There is no arguing Amy Schumer is hilarious, but this movie needed to be 15 minutes shorter and condense those laughs into a more digestible package. Also safer than I thought it was going to be... Needs more risk taking to be funny, this is merely cute.",

Amy Schumer is truly talented and hilarious. Her character is a true 'trainwreck,' but one that the audience cares about. Great movie (but be warned - this is not a movie for teens, I think).",

Her performance was not bad, neither was Lebron James's, this movie did not succeed in making a stand out comedy and i cant say i would recommend it if you are not a fan of Amy Schumer. 3/5",

    "review": "  Amy Schumer es una comediante neoyorquina poco conocida en Colombia, ganadora de un premio emmy por sus irreverentes sketchs y stand-ups en Comedy Central. En su primera incursi�n importante como protagonista en la pantalla grande, realiza el papel de Amy, una promiscua y desvergonzada neoyorquina que divide su tiempo entre un trabajo como periodista de Revista de Variedades, una convencional hermana y un padre desahuciado, evitando en el proceso mantener una relaci�n estable con los hombres que conoce en cuanta fiesta se le atraviesa. Todo cambiar� cuando conozca a Aaron (Bill Hader) un m�dico deportivo, que le ayudara a Amy a bajarse del tren de los desastres de pareja y a perder el miedo a reconocerse como novia de otra persona. Judd Apatow (Virgen de 40 a�os), dirige esta descarada comedia rom�ntica, como veh�culo de impulso de Schumer en el cine, quien realiza un buen trabajo al lado de Heder y un elenco de soporte entre los que sobresalen la polifac�ticaTilda Swinton y los deportistas de la vida real John Cena y Lebron James.",

The plot was embarrassingly cliched, the message that it's okay to be a complete and utter selfish, rude, abusive whore and still magically fall into the arms of prince charming was insulting and ridiculous. I almost dry heaved at the cringe inducing ending. The first rule of story telling is making the audience feel empathy for the protagonist. The only people empathising with the repulsive turd of a lead (and giving this film more than half a star) must be lobotomised 6 year olds.",

    "review": "  \"You're not gorgeous but pretty..ish\". A pretty accurate reflection of Amy Schumer which, combined with unapologetic sense of humour, distinguishes her as the relatable funny female figure on TV right now. Here she is given her chance to be at the helm of a Judd Apatow comedy in order to further increase her stardom. It is certainly not 'Superbad', nor is it super bad, but it is quite bad. One of the biggest problems is the lack of genuinely funny supporting actors. Although Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller produce some decent material in their scenes, the rest of them are bland, with John Cena and Lebron James, despite playing their characters with enthusiasm, showing that they should stick to their day jobs. In addition, the most talented comedic actor there (Bill Hader) had his creativity stifled by having to play a boring doctor. 'Trainwreck''s appeal comes from its empowering of women through the role reversal of Schumer being the 'player' who breaks guy's hearts and freely talks dirty about sex. Credit to her in conveying an honest interpretation of a modern sexually active female without coming across undignified or, to put it loosely, as a slut. However the comedy is all based around this idea of a women chatting promiscuously about sex and while it offers fresh appeal, it didn't prove all that funny. I felt how I usually feel when women chat raw about their bedroom experiences which is to be uncomfortable and then leave the room. Aside from one or two awkward scenes of foreplay, there was no real humorous scenarios written into the story. Schumer was naive to think her casual crude comments could sustain a two hour comedy and 'Trainwreck' suffered as a consequence. So overall it was a surprisingly bland comedy for a Judd Apatow production and I did expect more from Amy Schumer but in similar fashion to 'Bridesmaids' I welcome that women may find the female dominated unconventional romance structure refreshing.",

Sometimes poor-taste is just poor-taste, no matter how high the morning-after heals.Indoctrinated by her serial womanizing father (Colin Quinn) into believing \"monogamy is not a realistic,\" Amy (Amy Schumer) is a career driven writer for the low-brow S'nuff magazine with a fondness for drinking, sex and all forms of inappropriateness. Desperate to impress her merciless editor-in-chief (Tilda Swinton), Amy begrudgingly takes on a profile article about a highly-respected sports medico to the stars, Aaron (Bill Hader). Quickly finding herself in unchartered territory of genuine 'feelings', Will Amy cope with the concept of a normal coupledom or will her vices become too much for Aaron to handle? Schumer's delivery of her own writing is spot on while Hader is left to do his best with an underdeveloped character. Swinton is fabulously cringe-worthy and surprise cameos from the likes of LeBron James, Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei are just plain weird. The Verdict: To some this film is political incorrectness at its best, with striking throwaways, lashings of attitude and all shades of endearing wit that only Judd Apatow's brand of rom-com can produce. Sadly much like his 2012 offering of This is 40, I'm not one of those people, even if it did change tact half way.Published: Canberra WeeklyDate of Publication: 13/08/2015",

    "review": "  In short, Trainwreck is a daydream fantasy for used up sluts. The main character, Amy, played by (((Amy Schumer)))) is just such a used up slut. She is your basic catlady, a liberal single woman in Jew York riding the cock carousel, writing for a liberal rag magazine. She has reached that time in any whore's life where she begins to feel her sexual market value (SMV) decline, and at this point she begins to search desperately for a beta male who will provide her with resources as she approaches haghood. Her only alternative is to slide further into catlady-dom, only able to score cock from males who's status is declining in direct proportion to her SMV's decline.The fantasy aspect of the movie is that our heroine chooses to settle down with the beta provider for love, rather than necessity. This fantasy is fairly standard for catladies in her position, because the alternative is to deal with the reality that she is a whore who has decided to stop chasing the golden cock and settle for the golden parachute. In this fantasy, this used-up slut catlady lands a famous and successful doctor (any Jew catlady's dream, amiright?) who cares not how many disease ridden cocks have been rammed through her flabby vagina. He cares not that her fleeting fertile breeding years were spent using men as walking dildos while she invested in her career. He, like any good beta provider, is happy to have a sarcastic alcoholic slut for his bride, with zero chance of passing his beta genes on to the next generation. She is basically owed this decent golden parachute by society, because she has been a faithful servant of Moloch.After some hemming and hawing and fence-sitting, our slutty catlady loses her job. This financial blow is the final straw needed to impel her into the waiting arms of her beta provider. After all, she can continue to cheat on him after she is married, and blame her infidelities on some shortcoming or other that she will invent to assuage her hamster that she is still a good person. What's to lose? And that's Trainweck.",

    "review": "  It's fair to say Amy Schumer is perhaps the most in-demand comedienne of the moment, and her performance in 'Trainwreck' shows she's out to prove herself to be a force on the silver screen. While the film certainly does not embody its name, it is not nearly as solid as other reviews would lead you to believe. The plot revolves around a thirty-something New Yorker (appropriately named \"Amy\") who cannot stand the thought of monogamy, instead opting for the stereotypical \"guy\" approach to relationships. Of course, as with any romantic comedy (or in this case, a comedic commentary on societal norms and relationships in general), things begin to change once Amy crosses paths with a geeky sports doctor named Aaron (Bill Hader).While 'Trainwreck' is not your average comedy, it has a whole host of issues that weigh it down. For one, there are similarities that all Judd Apatow movies share, including an unnecessarily long runtime. This plagues 'Trainwreck,' as it is at least one act too long, and winds down in a spiral of tying up loose ends before it finally resolves. Additionally, while there are a good deal of laugh-out-loud funny parts, these are mostly reserved for the first hours of the film, with it becoming less and less funny as it goes along. While Schumer does alright considering it's her first lead acting role, the rest of the cast gives middling performances in supporting roles, including a painfully forced job by John Cena as Amy's boyfriend. The two exceptions are LeBron James, who plays himself and actually shows himself to be pretty funny, and Tilda Swinton, who is nearly unrecognizable as the cold, aloof executive editor of the men's magazine Amy writes for. And then, there's the overall lack of excitement, between the uncomfortable, awkward situations (some of which are funny, others are not) and the second-rate dialogue that comes off as amateurish for the most part.Again, it Schumer should be given a pass since 'Trainwreck' is her first real attempt at the big screen, and the box office performance can be seen as encouraging. But it's apparent that she still has a lot to learn before she can be compared with the Tina Feys and the Kristen Wiigs of the world.",

    "review": "  I got to see at least one more summer movie before they get swept away by the Oscar bait movies. I needed to laugh and this film provided plenty of laughs. And as a bonus, it also produced full fledged characters who might be unappealing if not presented in a wonderful way. Amy Schumer plays a writer whose life is not exactly a model woman that most parents want to see. She struggles with the fact that love is intangible because it did not work for her parents. She approaches life's relationships in a way that most men actually approach them; protective relationship armor (hard sex, booze, and full tilt work) that keep most men from entering a solid relationship. This could be just a crass date movie, but it is not. It is a story about a vulnerable person who needs love and the audience will keep on routing for her even though she sets herself up for failure every time. Amy Schumer writes a great screenplay that actually works for her in the main role. It is her comedic persona...yet she blends it with something more personal. Nothing is perfect in love and she hits the nail on the head. Bill Hader comes in as the unexpected love interest. Their chemistry together is charming. Sincerity rings throughout. Brie Larson also delivers a solid performance as her sister. There is love throughout all the anger at all of life's dysfunction. We embrace Colin Quinn's portrayal of her drunk, ill father who is bitter about relationships all together. Amy Schumer smacks sexism and sexual prejudice up side the head quite a few times. She is a comic genius and highly intelligent...if she does not get nominated for an Oscar...I hope at least her screenplay gets recognized. It was as bitter sweet as life can be...and it is definitely a welcome approach. This will be great on a Friday night and no where to go experience....Amy takes you there.",

Schumer's comedy prowess is clearly developing, as she moves from her own Comedy Central program into the big leagues of feature film making. Like her director, Apatow, Schumer has her finger on the pulse of what funny is- her outrageous sex scenes and her drunken antics are hilarious because they feel natural to her. Even the blossoming romance between her and Hader's Aaron Conners feels genuine and that's what makes comedy work- hysterical jokes and heartfelt characters. \"Trainwreck\" has it all.",

    "review": "  If you're looking for something similar to Amy Shumer's Comedy Central show, then this isn't it. This, is a rom-com. Yes, she says she doesn't want a relationship and that monogamy isn't real, but that's exactly what the movie is about. A couple in a monogamous relationship, and their struggles. As far as rom-com's go, it was pretty good. What I liked about it, is the believable problems between them. Instead of some ridiculous made-up problem between the couple, that no actual couple would ever have, they are faced with very familiar ones. A death in the family, problems at work, substance abuse, and commitment issues. Amy, of course brings humor in to all of these situations. She puts the com in the rom, if you will. But she's the only one that seems to have that power. Although Bill Hader is one of the best comedians around, he played much more of a straight man to her comedic prowess. She took notes from the leading, comedian actors before her and wrote a \"oh, stop that. Why can't you be serious?\" character, that so many women have played in every other comedy film, and gave it to a dude. She also wrote this character for her sister, and her husband, and Lebron James... I enjoyed the movie. I laughed, and I even cried. She wrote a true to life, three dimensional character, with lots of depth and humor for her self, I just wish she would have done it for the rest of the cast as well.",

Here we have Amy Schumer, a play-girl who has sex with A LOT of guys. (even though I personally think she's not that hot) One of the guys btw is JOHN CENA!!! Amy is also a magazine writer who has to write an article on a sports doctor named Aaron Conners played by Bill Hader who btw is friends with LEBRON JAMES. As Amy and Bill (er I mean Aaron) are getting to know each other, they find themselves falling for each other. Aaron more so than Amy however. Seriously, there were times when Amy's constant denial just made me roll my eyes, and there were times when she was just being a straight up Bitch. But she's still a likable character for the most part. One thing I gotta admit though, it wasn't Amy Schumer that really made me laugh all that much. Ironically the people that got the most laughs out of me were John Cena and Lebron James. Yes, those 2 athletes showed up all of the \"comedians\" in this film.. Plus, the ending was pretty abrupt. Overall, it's pretty funny and relatable. if you liked Brides Maids, I'd say check this one out.",

For Trainwreck, the problem was more subtle, wrapped up in Apatow's increasingly ineffective and boring style and the penning in of Schumer, who is simply funnier in the open ended live show format. LeBron James provided the most laughs while Hader provides the best performance of the film but the end result seems stuck somewhere between comedy and social commentary. Not a movie for a second watch and not a great start for Schumer, who lacks the polish and performance of a career actress.",

    "review": "  The story of a partygoer who hasn't had much reason to believe in commitment typically has a male in the lead part... not here though. \"Trainwreck\" is a funny and crude movie, but it actually has a large amount of heart. I'd put the scale at 60% drama and 40% comedy. Basically, it's a dramatic rom-com with a bunch of raunchiness sprinkled throughout it. Don't let that summary deter you though. There's a whole heap of funny jokes in here, but the Judd Apatow-directed brand of comedy often has more of a narrative to tell than a joke to make - which can be hit or miss depending who you ask. The cast of characters are great, the chemistry's there, and they're all relatable. I was particularly impressed that Bill Hader could convincingly play the lead guy in a love story, but I guess the part was written just right for him too. Most note worthy thing for me though is that Lebron James stole the show with all the scenes he was in. The guy can do funny. I kinda wish there was more of him, but this wasn't his movie I suppose. As for Amy Schumer herself, I'm not sure what is about her but she comes off as a very likeable person. Even in her dark moments, you're there kinda rooting for her to get back on track (or at least I was).",

Amy Schumer and Bill Hader were both delightful on screen and even better together. Normally I find frequent celebrity cameos to be distracting and overwrought, but this was not the case with Trainwreck. I would absolutely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a hilarious and intelligently delivered comedy.",

    "review": "  The title is just as (somewhat) non-laughable as the plot. From the director who gave us 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up'; director Judd Apatow is back with a somewhat laughable, but messy comedy. When it comes to the humor is it always hard to get everyone entertained, and this 'wreckish' movie is no exception. I laughed out at several occasions, but I had no interest in the plot what so ever, it just dragged on. This is my own personal opinion, and some of you will of course love the movie. This is because of several aspects. One is without any doubt the characters, which are relatable, lovable and well presented. The acting is just as phenomenal. The directing is very well done, and even though it got its flaws did I still enjoy it much more than I thought I would. Team Schumer-Hader (Amy Schumer & Bill Hader) did an amazing job, but as I previously mentioned is the story so messy and non-entertaining and it's sad that such great characters can't exist in a great world. The whole movie therefor felt non-rememberable. The humor is still great from time to time, but it's also somewhat predictable, even though the whole movie is much less 'clich�ish' than what I expected to see. Is it still worth it? Perhaps! 'Trainwreck' (except the humor and the plot) is really good, but from a personal viewpoint did I still find it a bit boring, but it might work for you!

    "review": "  This movie is a Trainwreck so its not just a clever name.First of all i dont understand any of the praise for this movie, the first 40% of this movie is hilarious but in no way due to lead actor Amy Schumer who is only funny about 5% of the time in this entire movie.what will i praise? the Hilarious performances by the always funny Bill Hader, Colin Quinn and the two comedy new comers Lebron James and John Cena who had me rolling, but i digress the fact that the supporting cast out shined the main star is what makes this movie fall short for me. Amy Schumer in no way comes off believable as the man eater she plays, not to sound sexist or be a dick but i don't find her attractive almost at all. I just cant see all these guys being desperate enough to night after night hook up with this woman (especially when they look like John Cena that guy could have any girl he wanted). And the way she was dressed in this movie the whole time i was god damn i don't wanna see that, and im not trying to pick on her its the honest truth. I do find her funny on her show and i feel she would be good in a small supporting role but shes the worst part of her own movie.i feel like she just took the typical rom-com formula and switched out the slutty sleeping around party guy who cant settle down and made it a girl. And does anyone else feel like every single movie Judd Apatow Has some say in turns out to be the closest possible thing in style and formula to Knocked Up, he needs to stop trying to re-live his success and make something new and original i get that its what he might be good at but you gotta step outta your shell once and a while. I mean even 40 Year Old Virgin Which i know came out before Knocked Up has the same similar formula about two completely different people who come together and beat there differences to find love one of which who is usually a looser more fun outgoing person and one who is more uptight and strange, who at some point become separated by a fight and then miraculously love conquers all as usual. And also in perfect Apatow fashion the movie is way to long and boring and suffers from terrible pacing with front heavy comedy and back heavy romance.If this movie ended at the 47 minute mark and starred Bill Hader as the front man i would have rated it a 7 easily, but i just cant do it, the fact that the star isnt the star and doesn't come off believably takes away, and the fact that sometimes the jokes went to far for me and felt forced, and also the over use of stereotypical rom-com stuff that was just a small twist on the same old stuff we see every year i rate this movie5.5 / 10 its watchable and sometimes funny but i promise you there is no way to watch this movie without ending up just playing on your phone and not caring by the end.",

I was surprised at how emotional the movie was at times. It had the right amount of hilarity and heart. Amy Schumer is surprisingly quite a good actress when she becomes serious and lets her guard down. Be interesting to see her in a dramatic role. She has great charisma and has a bright future ahead of her. Bill Hader is awesome as the leading man. So nice to see a normal guy instead of the typical romantic lead. The supporting cast is great and is given the chance to shine. John Cena and Lebron James are actually quite funny. I loved this shift in the romantic comedy genre where nobody (and nothing) is perfect. Was a lot more realistic and could relate to the characters more. Of course, we know they're going to end up together, but at least the ride was different. Looking forward to seeing what Amy Schumer does next.",

    "review": "  As far as romantic comedies goes, this seriously ranks up there with the best of them. Heck, as far as *movies* go, this film comes up aces in comparison. It's a completely fresh look, a new take, a non-hackneyed, anti-cliched expert piece of work from a supersmart and hyperfunny comedienne. Major props go to her for some of the brainiest/funniest/pop culturiest/obscure name-droppiest lines and setpieces in comedy filmdom history (that self-referential montage was comedy adamantium; Dave Attel's cardboard box line was genius, et al). Mondo kudos as well go to Judd Apatow, for coaxing some of the finest non-stiffest performances out of a horde of personalities who do *not* do this for a living (Lebron James stole every scene, John Cena was comic gold [and speaker of the funniest line in the movie; at least to me: an OMG reference to an obscure black 80s wrestler - heck, there's just one], Marv Albert was *so* well used), as well as from those who do (Hader was restraiiiiiined, and pitch perfect). It's clear that Schumer is not Mrs. America, which makes me genuinely wonder if she had to fight, like Sylvester Stallone did, to be the star of her first screenplay vehicle. I suspect she did not, because her non-superficial piled-high writing, comedy, timing, presence, and talent gifts are that obvious.",

If they could have employed an editor maybe they could have shortened it from 2-hours and as much as I wanted to like it, the whole thing was a big disappointment. It's like any Adam Sandler movie you've seen in the last 30-years, but stretched out by an extra half-hour. I understand that Americans think anything from SNL has to be a huge hit, but here they seemed to compensate for the lack of wit by employing American Sportsmen (oxymoron, I know, but humour me, please) for lots of cameos, but if you're not a yank then you're not going to recognise them, and at the end of the day, that's kinda the point.

The acting is good, the characters are likable enough, and the pacing is smooth. This was definitely... watchable.It seems Apatow can't decided whether he's making a drama or a comedy, so he just combines them to make well made dramadies. All his films are well made technically, but they're very inconsistent on delivering laughs. And that's very much the case here because \"Trainwreck\" is one of the most unfunny (yet still watchable) dramadies that I've seen. I think I mildly chuckled no more than three times. It's mostly awkward conversations about sex and female bodily functions. I'm sure there were more varied jokes, but I can't remember and I just watched this only a few hours ago.There's one particular face-hurting scene involving LeBron James, a sports announcer and Matthew Broderick(?) conduction an \"intervention\" with Bill Header. NO ONE in the theater laughed. Painful.It's not the dreary frustrating slog that Apatow's \"Funny People\" was, but it falls far short of the entertainment value that \"Knocked Up\" or \"40 Year-Old Virgin\" had. I say wait 'til Netflix. John Cena is pretty good though.",

    "review": "  This was just a great way to spend the afternoon. I don't really know what to say, honestly. I laughed a ton. The central romance was really sweet. I love all the actors and other talent involved.I think in a lot of ways this movie could seem overly conventional. After all, the main character sleeps around a lot, then ends up flummoxed by the idea of actually finding someone they want to spend time with. The ending involves a big romantic gesture and an inevitable kiss and 'I love you.' There's a wealth of minor characters who are super quirky and funny (Vanessa Bayer, Randall Park, Jon Glaser, Ezra Miller, etc.) but who don't have a ton of depth beyond that.There are two main things that make up for the conventionality of the story. One, a lot of it feels fresher than usual just because there's some nice gender reversal. Amy is an awesomely complex character, funny and witty but pretty narcissistic when it comes down to it. And though it's conventional that the story moves from polyamory to monogamy in a traditional way, Amy never apologizes for her actions, never makes sleeping around sound like a thing she deeply regrets or agrees to stop smoking pot. The other main thing is just that it's super funny. I laughed countless times, and when you're laughing constantly, it's easy to forgive most cliches or predictable endings. It's why the romantic comedy is the genre I'm often the most forgiving of. If I love the stars and the characters are sweet together and I laugh a lot, it's a success in my book.I also got really emotionally invested in the story, though. I could see Amy's father dying from miles away, but it still produced really emotional moments, like, of course, the funeral. I almost teared up when Amy admitted that though her father was often a terribly offensive person, he was her favorite person. And I almost teared up later on, when Kim's son showed Amy his Minecraft drawings, which included a hypothetical guest room for Amy and Aaron, and again when the whole family was hugging. Brie Larson was predictably great as Kim, and I really bought the sister relationship between them. It could've felt like a digression, but it added dimensions to Amy as a character, and in some ways it seemed a little less conventional than the main romantic arc. I especially loved Amy's dislike of her slightly creepy nephew.All in all, like I said, this was a comedy with a writer, director, and cast that I uniformly loved, with consistent laughs and an emotional heart. What more can you really ask for in a romantic comedy?",

    "review": "  When a young Amy is instructed that monogamy is unrealistic she really takes it to heart. Flash forward twenty three years and she's landed herself a job at Snuff magazine, a publication whose irreverence and cynicism is matched only by the Cruella Deville-tier inhumanity of its editer; Amy's boss. Things seem to be going well, Amy gets paid to poke a stick at stuffy, conventional 'normals' with her articles by day, and by night is doing what any self-respecting strong, independent career woman in New York (is it New York? Apatow seems to like the idea of the location as a character but Ghostbusters this ain't) would do; she's bonking. She's bonking hot guys, ugly guys, skinny guys, straight guys, gay guys, underage guys, you name it, if it's got a penis (or on three occasions a vagina) she's bonking it.Of course, this state of blissful ignorance can only last so long. This reviewer doesn't think he's giving anything away when he says that monogamy, in the end, turns out to be best all around after all, but there's no reason the movie had to be so heavy-handed in getting us there. Serious illness, family tragedy, drug abuse and lots of soul searching detract from what could have been a fun couple of hours, as Schumer's writing for herself and the stellar cast of cameo stars is very nearly buried under an avalanche of out-of-place feeling conservative family value and melodrama.One feels that Schumer wandered onto the set in the middle of shooting one of her (much funnier and less taxing) skits, and resigned herself to the trade-off she'd have to make on her character if she wanted to stay on the big screen until the end. When she goes, in the space of 48 hours, from a bar crawling, nymphomaniac, libertine stoner to a jealous girlfriend at a ballgame pouring scorn on the cheerleaders for their 'ways' it makes you wonder how brutal the studio enforced rewrite must have been.The movie really is saved, for some of us at least, by the guest appearances. This reviewer owns up to being a big time pro-wrestling fan and people, let me tell you right now, you can see John Cena in this movie. I mean, the champ is all there, and his Schumer dialogue and character (no idea how the 500+ make a wish foundation superstar agreed to it all) are worth the price of entry five times over.Likewise, one must assume, for basketball fans with Lebron James; and so it goes. If the cameos haven't whetted your appetite, you've seen and don't care for Schumer's comedy and you really can't stand another turn on the Hollywood life-affirming 'don't be different' merry-go-round, you'll want to give this a miss. Otherwise, ignore the strained plot, enjoy the (sometimes inspired) humour, and you might be able to get away with cashing it in as your chick-flick for the month, so you can drag the girlfriend along to Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation with a clean conscience.3/5",

Amy Schumer is good in the lead, but many of the characters around her are so un-life like that it drags down the drama and the film struggles to really delve into the character of Amy and address her flaws as a character. She is afterall, supposed to be a trainwreck...",

    "review": "  It's not totally devoid of laughs, but the humor is so sparse (and there are so many awkward misfires) that overall it doesn't render as a funny or even enjoyable experience. Instead, it feels like an overlong and overdone production, wrought with clich�s and offering little of substance. At times it felt like being at a stand-up show where most of the jokes fell flat, only there was no one there to heckle the offenders off the stage; it was just genuinely uncomfortable.The dramatic moments also seem out of place here, and it's hard to take them seriously despite Schumer's commitment. Many scenes felt like they were written around pre-orchestrated stand-up material, as though the scenario was nothing more than a vehicle for a joke, rather than the joke servicing the scene. Therein lies the problem. Yes, it may be funny at times and Schumer as a stand-up comic is generally great, but without a strong plot acting as a backbone, the film falls apart.Also, the pacing was just horrible and as a result the film draggggggs. At two hours long, there is so much here that could have been cut.Like all of it, for example.",

    "review": "  Wrecking it for all rom-coms to follow, this whipsmart Train keeps chugging along thanks to honest, intelligent and hilarious look at monogamy come-lately. Characterizing Schumer as just a bawdy sketch comedienne gives one of the industry's sharpest minds short shrift. She kills it in long form too which is how superstars get made. An extension of her frank observations on Comedy Central's Inside Amy Schumer, this filmic misadventure also marks director Judd Apatow's best work since Knocked Up. This film doesn't just take a hard look at commitment phobia, it gives amazingly fresh and doubled-over laughingly funny insight into modern dating and romance. In this R-rated comedy, a commitment-phobic career woman (Schumer) who never thought that monogamy was possible faces her fears when she meets a good guy (Hader). Not only does Schumer's screenplay present a unique warts 'n' all romantic comedy, she emerges as one of the best comedic actresses working in film today. Lebron James nearly derails her train a few times with a fantastically funny supporting turn, but there's no denying this comedienne's R-rated charm. Sure, her big screen starring debut falls into formula a bit but rom-coms dictate a good deal of connecting the dots or else it becomes relationship tragedy. Brilliant and beautiful, her Trainwreck is an absolute for adult moviegoers who appreciate a dirty joke.Bottom line: N'Yuk-ed Up",

I guess we can relate to this at least once in our life time.Amy Schumer whose motto I assume is like mine 'Work Hard Party harder' does exactly that when her dad drummed into her young head 'Monogamy isn't realistic?' images (3)The opening scene sets the president for what we were in store for, in which her up to no good dad (Colin Quinn) explains to his little girls, Amy and her sister Kim (Brie Larson) just why he's getting divorced from their mum - 'Your doll. you love your doll but what if it was the only doll you were allowed to play with for the rest of your lives? \"What about a doll you play with only one day and never see again?\" he asks. The girls think that sounds a great idea and in no time he has the tots happily chanting \"Monogamy isn't realistic!\"Trainwreck has to be one of the funniest romantic movie I have seen in a very long time. refreshing look at how women look at their role when it comes to dating. Reminded me a bit of Bridget Jones character, frumpy, clumsy, career women, average looking. but in this case not committed to love at all. A career women behaving badly is all I'm saying.It is worth a visit to the cinema, to sit back and enjoy some real tongue in cheek banter . A chic flick that will have you wetting your knickers.

Don't get me wrong this is very much a likeable comedy with some genuine funny laughs see John Cena in the cinema.The cast all give likeable performances from Amy Schumer to Ezra Miller's ADHD riddled intern, the performances are spot on even Tilda Swinton with her very wonky accent is a joy in this film.So what's the story the opening scene sees Colin Quinn drill into his daughters that monogamy isn't realistic, which results in 23 years later Amy Schumer's Amy having meaningless sex frequently. She's dating John Cena but isn't into him other than for sex. Meanwhile her sister played by the stunning Brie Larsen is married to Tom and raised his son who likes to call her mother and is genuinely quite odd. Working for a trashy magazine Amy dreams of being a proper writer rather than writing for a magazine which goes with pieces like \"Am I gay or are you just boring\". She is assigned to do a piece on Bill Hader's Sports surgeon sparks fly and relationship is formed will Amy see it through and find love?Trainwreck is amusing and entertaining in parts with genuine laugh out loud moments then it's such a shame that the film is so perfunctory, the plot is predictable you pretty much know how the characters are going to end up and as such it offers nothing fresh in the romcom genre.",

Hader seems to be a very capable actor. Up to now he has mostly played principally comedic roles. He is in a comedy here; but his role is more of a straight man to Amy Schumer's comedic role.The film is rated R. Schumer is known for her mainly bawdy comedy. She talks a lot about sexual matters, from a female point-of-view. I like her. She is funny. The are a few sex scenes. I was a little surprised to find that Schumer did not choose to show any nudity involving herself. Although, some of the men are seen mostly naked, from behind.Some scenes worked better than others, but the movie as a whole, worked for me. There was one odd, scene toward the end, featuring a handful of celebrity cameos. It did not work very well. Chris Evert (former prof tennis star) was present. I did not recognize her at first. She is not aging very well.It was an OK trip to the flics.",

    "review": "  When Amy (Amy Schumer) and Kim (Brie Larson) were little kids, their father took them aside and explained that he was leaving their mother because \"monogamy isn't realistic\", a phrase that is apparently his mantra. Grown-up Amy obviously took the lesson to heart (unlike her happily-married younger sister), as she seems to sleep with any guy who shows the least bit of interest, and even some who don't.The big joke of \"Trainwreck\" is hey, check out this chick being proud of sleeping around and not wanting emotional attachments and basically acting like A GUY. And all the guys she sleeps with are like \"hey, why don't you spend the night?\" but she never does and that's funny because ROLE REVERSAL, y'all! As lame of a premise as this is, some of this stuff is actually pretty funny, though other stuff not so much. Fortunately, the ratio of hits to misses is high enough to have kept me fairly amused throughout the movie's slutty first act. Before I continue, I feel compelled to point out that it's possible for one to eschew monogamy without necessarily being promiscuous. Even if one never (ahem) \"dates\" the same person more than once, an anti-monogamy stance does not actually require one to sleep with every willing person who happens to cross one's path. End of vocabulary lesson.Amy works for a trashy magazine and reports to a very bitchy editor named Dianna (Tilda Swinton) whose complete lack of compassion for her underlings makes for some of the movie's funniest scenes. [I am notoriously bad at recognizing faces, but even looking at side-by-side photos of normal, short-haired, makeup-free Swinton and her character in this movie, I cannot believe they are the same person.]For reasons that don't quite make sense, Dianna assigns sports-hating Amy to write a piece about sports-injury-doctor-to-the-pros Aaron Conners (Bill Hader), who just happens to be besties with LeBron James. As movie predictability would have it, Amy ends up falling for nice-guy Aaron (also active in Doctors without Borders, don't you know), so naturally she feels compelled to try to sabotage their fledgling relationship.Full disclosure: The main reason I saw this movie is I'm a LeBron James fan, as all followers of the NBA should be, unless of course they're jealous, irrational haters. LeBron review: Funny and natural (no doubt helped by the fact that he's playing himself). Side note: How many movies have YOU been in lately, Steph Curry?I've heard a lot of \"Trainwreck\" bashing lately, the gist of which is \"I thought it was supposed to be SO good, but it wasn't THAT good\", including from my dental hygienist as she scraped plaque off my teeth, leaving me unable to respond. Had I remembered, when she'd finished, I would have said this: \"High expectations will do you in every time.\" Instead I simply spat. \"Trainwreck\" is an Amy Schumer vehicle, a light summer rom-com that is no doubt better than \"Vacation\" and \"Pixels\", but even the best summer rom-com is still just a summer rom-com. Here's a little tip for everyone seeing this movie's 86% Tomatometer score and expecting it to be 2015's \"When Harry Met Sally\": movies that are released in the middle of the summer are graded on a curve. \"Trainwreck\" definitely exceeded my appropriately-low-to-moderate expectations, though it gets a bit draggy at the end and should have been at least fifteen minutes shorter. In a movie like this, we all know where it's going almost from the start and at some point the whole audience is like \"just get there already!\", amirite?On the plus side, the theater was nicely air conditioned, but not so frigid as to require a wrap. And, of course, LeBron's in it.",

The sometimes sketchy script is smart, funny and chock full of cultural references, proving Amy Schumer to be a very competent comedian who can also summon up some reasonable acting skills too when need be. However, like most Apatow comedies, it does meanders a bit, though not unjustifiably so in this case, and fails on the final hurdle in its non-conformity to genre expectations. Maybe what we need in the end is another injection of realism instead of the overly cute happy ending?",

Schumer shows the range we all kind of suspect she had for years but kept very hidden under blas� stand-up until only very recently (and Hader, Quinn and the scene-stealing LeBron James are good for a few laughs too, of course). Funny when it needed to be, soulful, surprisingly deep and well worth your time.",

She manages to hit every comedic note, while still providing the level of emotion required for the story. * Bill Hader's performance was a bit of a throw away, but passable for the role required. * Lebron James & John Cena's cameos were my personal favourite parts of the film. And I was extremely surprised by how funny Lebron looked. He seemed at home on the screen.",

    "review": "  I found this movie hard to like - there were a few moments that made me laugh, but it was mostly not to my taste. Might have been better if shorter/ edited more tightly - felt rather meandering. I guess I was glad that it had a happy ending, because the main character was otherwise more depressing than funny. The best thing I can say about it is that Amy Schumer comes across as real/authentic - she doesn't try to be anything other than who and what she is, which I respect. Also, I guess I'm still thinking about the movie, so that's something to its credit, I suppose. I can think of some people who would probably like it, but otherwise I don't think I'd recommend it.",

    "review": "  All things considered, with every pun intended, this film could have easily been a \"Trainwreck,\" due to the fact that nobody has seen Amy Schumer leave her comfort zone as far as creating a feature film goes. I can say with certainty, that \"Trainwreck\" is one of my favourite films of 2015. Not only is it one of Judd Apatow's best films to date, but the dialogue and events that played out throughout this film felt so natural. As a reporter (Schumer) is hired to write a new article on a doctor (Bill Hader) who performs surgeries on major sports icons, she finds herself falling in love, which is something she never intended. As stale as that sounds, it is the freshest take on this type of story that I have seen in the last few years. I was laughing hysterically throughout this picture, and that is due to the great writing, tremendous acting, and a slow paced editing style that always adds that next level to Apatow's best works. \"Trainwreck\" does exactly what it sets out to do, and for that reason I can find no faults in this film. The one big fault that this film does suffer from however, like every Apatow film, it is just a tad too long. I am normally not a fan of this type of comedy, but it is so quick that I was laughing throughout almost every scene, and I was in tears on multiple occasions. Yes, a Judd Apatow comedy made me tear up... This film really is something special to the genre. It may just be me, but I believe this film is fantastic. \"Trainwreck\" was a huge surprise for me and I highly recommend it.",

    "review": "  Trainwreck was funny. It is very clear Amy Schumer has a bright career as a movie actor in front of her to compliment her already stellar comedy show. She wrote this script and Judd Apatow directed it. Now, she's famous for her stand-up comedy and short skits on TV, and it's a bit obvious she's lacking in the longer script territory. Sure the movie follows almost every rom-com trope to a T, but it's the dialogue and jokes which move you along that keep you interested. First off, John Cena absolutely steals the show with his 5 or so minutes of screen time over a handful of scenes. He had me on the floor with his super bulked up body builder physique nice guy who might be secretly gay routine. The bedroom scene was pure instant classic.Secondly, while it was fun to see LeBron James in on the act, I didn't feel as convinced about his acting. Maybe that's because Cena actually puts on a show as a wrestler while LeBron isn't on a basketball court.Tilda Swinton was almost unrecognizable, as she usually is, and played the evil editor as outlandishly as she could. Brie Larson, as beautiful as ever, knocked the grown-up sister role out of the park. Even Daniel Radcliff and Marissa Tomei made a brief cameo in a movie about dog walking I'd actually like to see for the absurdity of it.However, it is so nice to see Bill Hader continue to branch out of his zany roles he once had at SNL to play somewhat of a straight character and still deliver on his comedic timing. He's one of my favorites. His chops and Amy's ridiculousness both with degrading physical humor and word humor make them a great pair.But it all falls back into the rom-com category. Nothing you didn't see coming. Nothing frivolous about the plot other than it's a woman drinking and smoking and sleeping around rather than a man. That's not supposed to make this feel new-age or conquering of the norm. I'd like to see Schumer continue to write movies and get better at it. It was sharp, witty and relatable, and that's a tip of the hat to Apatow on his direction. It makes the comedy pure.",

It's just another raunchy romantic comedy with awkward comedy to be funny but instead is just dead air to makes the audience uncomfortable. I usually am ok with dirty raunchy comedies but when I know the joke is coming from a mile away it makes it boring. The beat by beat humor is nothing great and does every check on the romantic comedy checklist. Now not saying anybody was bad in the film I just think as a story or character film it's kind of boring. I tried really hard to enjoy this movie, I really did. But between the awkward dead air add libed comedy it really felt like there was dead space and didn't make the film enjoyable it almost was just slaughtering the pace of the movie. This movie was sorely unimpressive and sadly enough it's directed by Judd Apatow and I usually love his heartfelt comedies but this was just kind of mediocre. If anything I'd rather recommend the funnier Bridesmaids that is just like Trainwreck but way more entertianing and consistant.",

    "review": "  Parents, the masterminds behind our first steps, our first experiences and our whole life of learning, the people responsible of shaping who we are, but also the one to blame if we end up been a mess.This is the simple plot of the film \"Trainwreck\" directed by Judd Apatow the film focus on the little girl that been influenced by her father Gordon Townsend (Colin Quinn) with the message of monogamy isn't realistic. Gordon is an alcoholic and promiscuous guy who spent his last days at a nursing home.Amy (Amy Schumer) a writer for a men's magazine is the mirror of her father, the resonance of the monogamy of dad's message, makes her a girl without commitments, afraid of the future with somebody, but also an alcoholic. You see the opposite attitude in Amy's sister Kim (Brie Larson) a settled woman, with a husband and a step kid living the typical family life. The film doesn't focus on that parallel, but just highlight moments with comedic situations, which ease the drama of that, dismembered family. Mom is no longer with them and the two girls live the pain of taking care of their dad and coping with his behavior, specially for Amy who get along with him, not so for Kim.The conflict in Trainwreck is when Amy is assigned to write a piece about a sport surgeon Aaron Conners (Bill Hader). Her boss Dianna (Tilda Swinton) is a cheeky British woman who projects her feelings about men and their lifestyle in the magazine. She is ruthless and insensitive, but is the boss. After Amy begged Diana to no give her this story, she have to accept, just with the promise of a promotion.Amy spent several occasions watching him work and do his job. Unfortunately for Amy, Aaron fell in love with her and feel attached to this messy woman. The conflict begins and the relationship goes deeper. She has to confront all her fears and is not easy.Judd Apatow develops a story written by Schumer into a funny story of this conflicted woman. The film presents the characters as caricatures of the typical life in NYC, with the vignettes of the urban city. The guys who date Amy are those stereotypes, including Steven (John Cena) a sensitive body builder, who enjoys artsy movies, walks in the park to name a few. My problem with \"Trainwreck\" is the story and the dialogues. I can swear that Amy talks in the same voice of Annie Walker (Kristin Wiig) in Bridesmaid, in fact are kind of the same character. Sometimes I feel that I seen this characters in other films, but also seems that the conflict in \"Trainwreck\" never reach its peaks, but neither the resolutions. Don't get me wrong some jokes are funny, other ones borderline into vulgar.The movie is entertaining and fun, Amy Schumer and Bill Hader are great together.",

    "review": "  As a fan of 'Inside Amy Schumer', I knew what to expect from this film - and indeed if you know Schumer's style of comedy, the main surprise from this film is that is actually is quite a conventional rom-com at heart. Schumer's hilarious persona of an average girl who likes to talk about sex in a frank and funny way is definitely something we've not seen since 'Bridesmaids'. Judd Apatow is sometimes criticized for his laddish bromantic comedies, but his championing of Lena Dunham, Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and now Amy Schumer really should earn him major feminist kudos! Schumer is more amiable, less crude than Melissa McCarthy's comedic persona; she is more of what it means to be a sexually active female in the 21st century - in fairly graphic detail at times! In this film she plays another version of this persona as Amy, a free wheeling modern girl with a good job at a pretty awful men's magazine and a happy and varied sex life with a string of men. As a child, her father had instilled in her that 'monogamy isn't realistic' in a very funny opening flashback scene. We meet her as she half heartedly dates a rather odd body builder with gay tendencies. Soon her boss at the magazine - an almost unrecognisable Tilda Swinton - sends her to interview Aaron (Bill Hader), rather dorky orthopedic surgeon to lots of famous athletes. His best friend is basketball star LeBron James, who has a really nice line in dry wit as an actor. Of course, Amy knows nothing about sports, but she pretty much talks him into bed straight away, expecting her usual one night stand. However, they unexpectedly start to build a relationship after Hader pursues her, but can Amy overcome her reticence about commitment?The first half of the film is really nicely subversive. Sex is portrayed in a way only 'Bridemaids' has done in the past. Kind of awkward, not at all movie soft-focus, strings and perfections. Also very much from a female perspective - which is still incredibly rare. Amy's bodybuilder boyfriend is a refreshingly hilarious narcissist, and I loved the very funny scene which was in the trailer of Amy and her friend's shock over Hader ringing her after their hook-up. Where the film turns a little formulaic is in the inevitable change in Amy. Her father is ill, she is arguing with her sister over his care, she realizes she does love doctor Aaron and ends up changing to please him. It is just a little bit neat and conventional. I'm not sure if Amy Schumer's message is we all just need to meet the right man to settle down with, but it kind of is the film's. Her commitment free sex life is shown as rather bogus and when she tries to return to a casual hook up with a co-worker, it goes disastrously wrong. See kids, it is true love that works! Still there is an awful lot of very funny material along the way. The appearance of those sports stars might have more meaning to a US audience - I know LeBron James' name and great to see Chris Evert in there - and with a rude line too! Didn't know if some of the others were real stars or just actors. However, James was a lot of fun. I especially liked the scene where he and Bill Hader play basketball and talk. James' hilariously superior height, strength and skill aren't commented on, it's just background for their conversation as Hader utterly fails to gain an inch.Schumer - who also wrote the script - does a pretty decent job of also putting a fair bit of emotion into the father/daughters scenes too. I believe Schumer's own father has MS so I guess there are plenty of autobiographical elements. All of the performances are good. Special mention to Tilda Swinton for having an absolute ball as a fake tan fashionista bitch. Apparently Apatow and Schumer let her have free rein to be as outrageous looking as she wanted! Has Tilda Swinton ever been funny before?The film is not without flaws; Doctor Aaron is far too perfect to still be single, the ending involving cheerleaders is no where near as funny as Schumer's 'Milk, Milk, Lemonade' sketch on her TV show (although also not as rude!) and it is a bit sentimental at times. Her TV show is sharper and more acerbic, while this big screen adventure is less threatening and more mainstream. However, I enjoyed it a lot, very funny film.",

    "review": "  A hard-drinking, hard-partying woman meets a relationship-eligible sports doctor.On a bit-by-bit basis, this comedy is pretty solid - not great comedic bits by any means, but mildly humorous. The best comic talent in the film is actually not Bill Hader or Amy Schumer but LeBron James, who is simply hilarious as Aaron's best friend.The problem with this film is the separation between its goals and what it accomplishes. Politically, Schumer and Apatow are part of modern feminism's movement against slut-shaming and female sexual empowerment, and it's clear that Amy (the character Schumer plays) represents this modern feminist. Yet because it's a romantic comedy through and through, reproducing all the cliches of that genre, Trainwreck forces Amy to change, to return to the tropes that marked women without the lessons of modern feminism. It's true that she never apologizes for her behavior, and the script never asks her to, but the recognition of her need to change indicates that the film's actual political position falls well short of its goals.Overall, while it's a decent comedy, Trainwreck's political aspirations fall short of its reality.",

    "review": "  For those unfamiliar with Amy Schumer, beware, you are about to be. In TRAINWRECK the rising star of US comedy makes her entrance into silver screen stardom with a bang. First and foremost this movie is something different. Instead of having a fun-loving and unattached bachelor find the woman who makes him want to change it is ... basically a fun-loving and unattached bachelorette who finds a man that makes her want to change. In essence it is a role reversal version of the classic cheesy Rom Coms of the 90s and 00s.Some might not be comfortable with this movies take on alcohol, drugs and female promiscuity...but this is the world we live in. The fact that this sort of lifestyle has always been accepted as long as it was being enjoyed by a man is kind of the point of this movie. Deal with it... or don't go see this movie, up to you.While Bill Hader does his part as the grounded and \"normal\" character he is arguably overshadowed by both his co-star, Mrs Schumer and in the role of his advice giving BFF...Lebron James. Yes the NBA player!James features in what was apparently supposed to be merely a cameo but organically grew into a substantial supporting role. He blends good chemistry with Hader along with self-aware star power and jokes about himself. While this movie is mostly about Schumer, James is definitely the second biggest revelation. The script and cast are great, the jokes land and thought the story does have its fair share of clich�s it is actually moving at times.",

Sparks fly and it terrifies her. This is Apatow's best film since Knocked Up in my opinion, there is plenty of rude, crude humour and some very hilarious moments. Schumer in her debut film role is great and Hader is fun as Aaron, I really like Bill Hader and it is good to see him getting a leading man role. Some good supporting characters, John Cena kills it in his limited time as the emotional beefcake lover. As usual, Apatow's films go way too long and there are some quiet moments, film could have survived at a good 90-100 minutes.",

    "review": "  \"Let me put my protein in you, yeah...\".The fairly speedy rise of 'Amy Schumer' is interesting and its all the more confirmation that the women are dominating top comedies with - 'Amy Schumer' joining: Melissa McCarthy', 'Tina Fey' and 'Amy Poehler'. Having never seen 'Inside Amy Schumer' (sorry) I have to say this has made me take an interest. Even more so given director 'Judd Apatow' generally (or should I say ever) doesn't direct other's work. that alone is enough to take notice (in the short time I was aware of this film). It's an evident style that seems to gel with Amy's writing - and joins the rare 'good comedies over 2hrs group'.Yep it's over 2hr. It's also joyfully (to me) an anti-rom-com. Replacing atypical clich�s in both genders and making them feel real. The film starts where the trailer starts with a young 'Amy' (Amy Schumer) and sister 'Kim' (Brie Larson) are being told by their dad that Monogamy is bad - where it slides off 'Kim' 'Amy' clearly takes it to heart. Where we get guy after guy being rejected by 'Amy'. It's not as simple as \"look the women is the one with commitment problems isn't that different!\". It smartly doesn't shame 'Amy' either (probably due to the writer) there is a tenancy to go down that path to show some sort of growth. But people don't grow that quickly an she's largely the same person by the end. It could be described as crass - which is usually given as a negative connotation. But it's not as simply as gross stuff that a lesser comedy would do (look at literally anything Adam Sandler has ever written). It's inter-spaced with absurd remarks and Amy's slightly twisted look on people. Actively insulting her sisters kid in-front of her or total confusion over 'Aaron' calling her. There are also some nice little cameos in 'Daniel Radcliffe' and 'Marisa Tomei' is a very strange film The Dog Walker. Aaron's best friend is 'LeBron James' and 'Amy' early on dates someone played by 'John Cena' both of which do a fantastic job and display some great comedic timing.It does end a little flat for me with a bit romantic gesture that isn't entirely out of the realms of possibility given connections. But it still seems a little off. it also tales off on the comedy and focuses more on 'Amy' and Aaron's life and feelings.'Trainwreck' is over 2 hours long and good, I'll say it again over 2 hours long and good. That's not just rare it's unheard off. The writing is sharp and full of fairly biting comments from fun-filled 'Amy'. It's a film where the characters stay who they are, there's no huge realisation and massive change of actions. It all comes down to 'Amy' and 'Aaron' being ok with who each other is and that's real life.",

Surprise to me then that there was something really off about it, and I think for me it's all down to Amy Schumer's character and that a lot of the humour was really unfunny. Amy in the movie is basically an arsehole (prolific liar, insensitive and lazy) whose only redeeming feature is perhaps her love for her father, which is so underused it hardly makes a difference. All this could still have been overcome if I believed she was actually invested in her chosen life - \"enjoying it\" as the blurb says - but she simply comes across as tired and unconvincing, and more of an arsehole. The comic sketches also often run too long, stretching it past funny, and a lot of the other humour is just mean or sad, especially when it came to her step-nephew. The trailer shows parts of scenes that were obviously cut from the final feature. I walked out after an hour. It's has nothing of the characterisation and careful balance of drama and levity in Bridesmaids (as the promos keep telling you).",

Amongst the laughs, you never quite forget that the two leads are comedians not actors, but they both have a sense of what works for them. The supporting cast may be the real highlight; Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller are as great as you expect, whereas LeBron James and especially John Cena are far better than either of them have the right to be. There are a few star cameos that smack of casting around finding something for one's mates to do, but nothing unforgiveable. What does stop the film dead in its tracks more than once is its uncertainty with the conventions and clich�s of romantic comedy; it can't quite decide whether it's bringing up certain tropes to poke fun at or to acknowledge a begrudging truth. Add an ending that's a little too uncomfortable from the perspective of gender politics, even when you know Schumer wrote it, and you're left with something that tries damn hard to let the laughs carry it through and comes damn close - but not quite close enough.",

    "review": "  \"Trainwreck\" is one of the best romantic comedies I'ven seen in years. I went to this movie without any expectations and the movie started to make me happy from the get go. It made me laugh so hard I cried. The film starts off extremely strong with some hard-edged humor. About 2/3 of the way through the film it loses some steam though - still, it didn't really matter because the whole movie switches to a more emotional (I would even go so far and say serious) perspective. \"Trainwreck\" is an extremely raunchy, yet heartwarming rom-com. There are a number of laughs, probably fewer if you are easily offended. The humor is quite vulgar.What really surprised me was the heart and sentimentality of this really cool story. The characters are so heartwarming and easy to connect to. They are so down to earth, flawed and far from perfect - unlike in most big city romances. The characters in \"Trainwreck\" really grew on me. The movie's surprisingly nuanced heroine, played by Amy Schumer, goes through one hell of a development (which is rare for movies of this type). Bill Hader turns out to be surprisingly charming and appealing. The performances are absolutely hilarious, from the main to the supporting cast. \"Trainwreck\" unveiled John Cena and LeBron James as surprise comedic talents, and also the one that let Tilda Swinton - playing an unrecognizable, eyeliner-heavy magazine boss - snarl to Schumer's character, \"I wouldn't fuck him with your dick.\" Those three really hit it. As Aaron's star patient and best friend, LeBron James is the secret highlight of this film, playing a version of himself who's sensitive, analytical and strangely stingy.This movie is a real and ultimately rewarding piece of work. A rom-com infused with actual human feelings (last seen in \"Crazy Stupid Love\") is such a rare accomplishment - but Amy Schumer and Judd Apatow did it! Wonderfully hilarious, surprisingly touching and delightfully written, this is an excellent example of romantic comedy at its best. I even liked how they used the soundtrack as a comic effect throughout the film.\"Trainwreck\" works so well because we believed it. We believe Amy and Aaron and the people in their lives could be sitting at the next table in a restaurant.And that ending... I gotta admit it: it made my heart melt.",

The movie had no direction or point for that matter relying on shock value regurgitated from Schumer's stand up act but not well translated to film. Bill Hader and the real star of this movie Lebron James almost salvaged a pretty bland and otherwise forgettable movie except Lebron just didn't have the screen time. That's how bad this movie is it makes you want more Lebron James.",

    "review": "  I guess everyone who is into comedy films knows the name Judd Apatow, a talented writer, producer & director. Having launched comedy giants such as Steve Carell, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Melissa McCarthy to the big screen, Apatow has made himself quite a unique force in the industry. This film, which is his fifth feature film directorial effort (after The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Funny People, This Is 40), & also the first film he dint write. This comedy flick is written by it's star, stand-up comedian Amy Schumer (in her feature film debut). Here is my problem with films such Bridesmaids, This is 40, The Five Year Engagement or any other comedy along the lines of those. They run about for 2 hours, and almost drains me, I feel somehow the humor dries up. Nevertheless, Schumer and Apatow have crafted an almost classic date movie yet one that's fresh and a little edgy. More so the former than the latter, but most romantic comedies don't ever find an edge. There's something in here for everyone, whether you're a guy into sports or not (especially if you are into sports though) or whether you're a woman who loves chick-flicks or a hardcore feminist. Somehow, the film exists as this acceptable contradiction. I must admit, I dint know much about Amy Schumer, it was the buzz surrounding her these last few months is something which curiously interested me. After seeing her host this year's very boring MTV awards (which she was the best part off), I can imagine why people claim she is going places. Luckily for me, I really enjoyed this film! The film is original in that it reverses typical gender roles in romantic comedies where the woman is the pursuer and the man is the pursuee. The script, written by Amy Schumer, is what really puts this film over the top.When you team up Judd Apatow, one of the best comedy directors working today, with Amy Schumer, one of the best comedians working today (arguably), you've struck gold & did I mention it has Bill Hader, like who doesn't like Bill Hader? The story follows Amy (Amy Schumer) was taught, by her father (Colin Quinn) at a very young age, that true monogamy isn't possible. As an adult, she's now a successful magazine writer; that's afraid of commitment. So she constantly uses men, she meets at bars, for sex, even though she is in a relationship with Steven (John Cena). One day her boss (Tilda Swinton) assigns her a story, on a popular sports doctor named Aaron Conners (Bill Hader). After getting to know the guy, she's amazed to find out that she actually has romantic feelings for him. Her way of life is put to the test. I'm a huge Judd Apatow fan (Knocked Up is one of my all-time favorite movies) and I've really enjoyed all of his films (even Funny People which is considered his weakest). They tend to be way too long (usually close to 2 hours, or more), and they also usually contain several repetitive actor 'improve scenes', that seem to never end, but they're always hilarious and heartfelt. Apatow is amazingly skilled at combining really emotional drama, with silly slapstick comedy. This film is no different, than any of his previous work, even though he didn't write it. It seems exactly like an Apatow flick, just with a female lead instead of a male; so it's really impressive that he found a female comedian/actress/writer, that seems to think just like he does! While this film isn't the raunch-fest I expected, it still had its moments and I still enjoyed it. The two leads are both complex and have some depth to them. Amy's character is smart, funny, outgoing but can also get emotional and dark at times. The dramatic and more emotional parts revolve around the relationship between Amy's sister (Brie Larson) and her father (Colin Quinn). Their chemistry is what sold me and it all works well. Quinn also gets the chance to deliver some of the film's best one liners as well as a speech at the opening which set the tone for the rest of the film. Hader's Aaron is the normal guy among all the outrageous ness but he holds his own. The film was also able to get some great, funny performances by those who you may not expect, mostly from some well-known athletes. The film does get a little formulaic at times but it chooses to approach this in a way that is smart, real, and non-cliche in the way that it handles relationships. This is because the characters are real and that's what makes them more relate able. There were many moments in this film that made me laugh out loud including a scene with John Cena in a movie theater which I won't spoil. By now we know that with a Judd Apatow films you'll get a nice blend of raunchy humor and heart. It is a tried and true formula - and it works again here but with something different and that's Amy Schumer. Sure there might be a few uneven moments..but the duo here help create one of the funniest romantic comedies I have seen in a long time with one of the most fun finale scenes I've had the pleasure of seeing all year long. Schumer is a force here, knocking every gag out of the park but also displaying some quite impressive dramatic skills that one doesn't expect from a stand-up comedian. Bill Hader is finally given and masters the lead role he deserves perfectly. He is lovable, relate able in every way and is the perfect match for Amy on the big screen. Their chemistry here is undeniable. Brie Larson is also very good as Schumer's sister, reminding everyone the world's greatest mystery: why isn't she in more films?! However, John Cena surprises with a supporting role filled with hysterical one liners. On top of that, he has great comedic timing! Lastly, Tilda Swinton is flat out great and unrecognizable and even LeBron James manages to be quite funny. Daniel Radcliffe & Marisa Tomei have a hilarious cameo as well. Of course the film film does have some negatives, for example the film does slow down comically in the second half. Some scenes either feel out of place or don't work from the get go and it halts the pace a bit. There is a certain pair of cameos that the joke they take part in doesn't work at all. On the whole, 'Trainwreck' is a sweet, beautifully filmed, tender (and very profane) first outing for the talented Amy Schumer. The film subverts the rom-com genre because of its unlikely protagonist, Amy, a woman who doesn't look perfect and is totally likable because of that. At the same time, the film's biggest flaw is how much it adheres to the rom-com formula, but it doesn't detract from the quality overall. Judd Apatow has given us the funniest film (or maybe at par with Spy) of this year. Give it a watch!",

    "review": "  The title is a misnomer; this is efficient, coherent and positive high comedy; if it intends calling the heroine a trainwreck then it's wrong again, since she is an intelligent, competent and compassionate person, even if she does get intoxicated and have innumerable partners. A film about a man in that situation would never be called Trainwreck. Amy Schumer both writes and acts very well, with accuracy and depth; her script and story have real warmth, and her character is an attractive person. The father's tale is beautifully told and heart rending; there are tears among the laughter. The sister and her family are fine touchstones. The film includes major African American sports stars in big comic roles, which they perform with the �lan that you would expect; it also takes racism to task, not just against Black people but also Asians in a short vignette; and there are enough feminist messages, even if they are centred on sexual gratification. Amy is not afraid to challenge female as well as male behaviour. For Australians, there would be ironical echoes with their fraught recent national debates about racism in sport. The film's comedy is camp and right out there. With examples like Snowpiercer and now this, Tilda Swinton is clearly a master in portraying the horribly funny, monstrous boss, possessed of a fleeting veneer of geniality. Her sinewed arm showing Amy the door is like a sword. The average male might feel that the film doesn't spare him much - he would be right about that; it is an unashamed effort at tipping the scales. Not a film for young kids, due to explicit sex scenes, language, drug use and nudity. But a thoughtful and entertaining one for grown-ups.",

    "review": "  The chick flick gets a necessary infusion of fresh blood under Schumer's able hands as, for once, the lead is not \"eccentric\" or \"not pretty\" or \"career driven\" or \"misunderstood\" or whatever bone is usually thrown the audience as for why she is not popping out kids to beat the band: she doesn't want that. In point of fact, she is the epitome of \"bad girl\" in that she sleeps around and how. She's seen in many scenes on her back with her legs splayed open. Or at least that's how it begins. No worries, she sees the error of her rebel ways, but only after we enjoy the ride to her change of mind. Along the way are pretty interesting characters too, not the least of which is Colin Quinn, finally given a role the SNL alum can get his teeth into. Some basketball players fill out the roles usually reserved for the ugly secondary \"friends\" clich�s aptly and the boyfriend, Hader, shares nice chemistry with Schumer. But this is Schumer's ticket and she does quite well in this her first time out. What's next? Team up with Melissa McCarthy, or is that too obvious?",

    "review": "  Amy Schumer's Trainwreck flips the gender conventions of most rom-coms with refreshing effect, yet director Judd Apatow leads it down a well-trodden and weary path of mediocrity.I like Amy Schumer. I love Bill Hader. I have come to dislike Judd Apatow. It seems a shame that the latter can have the most effect on my enjoyment of this film than the former. Trainwreck, after the half-hour mark, starts to feel like every other Apatow film; overly long, thin on gut-busting gags and more unlikable characters than fun ones. A strange combination for what is billed mainly as a comedy.Schumer's script premise is at least something different, with her central character being a 30-something sexual deviant with commitment issues - traits that are usually assigned to male leads in rom-coms. However, beyond that it is a paint-by-numbers plotline that seems to follow the genre around like a bad smell. So, it's up to the leads to distract us with some amazing gags, right?... Wrong.As much as I love Bill Hader his role is slightly subdued here and Schumer's character becomes more of a target for anger than the hero you want to succeed. Their interactions produce a few chuckles but not the belly-laughs you'd expect from such comedy talent. Instead, a host of cameo appearances steal the spotlight.Tilda Swinton is fantastic as Amy's obnoxious and aloof boss and delivers the films best one-liners. Athletes John Cena and LeBron James also steal the show by parodying the buff male stereotypes, with Cena in particular delivering the most cringe-worthy attempt at dirty talk ever committed to screen.It has its moments and can certainly be ranked toward the higher end of the scale of the genre, but there have and will be a lot funnier films out this year.",

Schumer's character is obsessive about casual sex and terrified of commitment - she objectifies men as shown in a series of casual encounters. Of course she meets the love of her life, and the movie is about the attendant problems. Colin Quinn does well playing the father, and LeBron also is credible and well-spoken. Schumer is also reasonable as a heavy-set and often not-so-attractive lead which is refreshing. Worth a trip to the theater, and has a few laughs, and in any case is ten times better than any comedy Adam Sandler or their ilk are presenting.",

    "review": "  Trainwreck was incredibly funny, but I was surprised by how real and raw it was. Admittedly, it felt like it took a bit to find the plot, but once it got going, man, it was one hell of a ride. This movie relishes making you uncomfortable, as it should; a lot of the topics from death to how bad patterns can instill a self-destructive mindset shouldn't be treated as if a sitcom's laughtrack is supposed to play under them. The laughs that they do get are definitely of the darker variety. None of it feels forced, either, not even when the movie finds its way to those romantic comedy staples. It all comes off as natural and the types of intimate talks and fights that people actually have.The script was written by Amy Schumer herself and this could have very well come off as a Mary Sue self-insert fanficition, right down to naming her character Amy. But instead of turning herself into some perfect paragon who's awesome at everything, she writes a flawed human being who is still sympathetic even through the bad decisions she's made. This very well could be her way of working out some of her own issues and it comes out beautifully. Bill Hader also plays a lovable dork of a doctor who falls for Amy and is quite the likable character. But for me, the standout has to be Lebron James, who turns in some of the most hilarious deadpan humor of the movie. Something about the world's most famous basketball player grilling Hader's character for not visiting in Cleveland and trying to get him to pay for lunch just had me in stitches.This being a Judd Apatow film, there are of course a good share of raunchy jokes. Not all of them are laugh-out-loud funny, but the ones that are bust your gut wide open. It certainly helps that all of the actors had good chemistry and can work off of each other really well. Yet underneath all of this is an astounding amount of heart that makes you feel like you came away with something at the end of it all. I'd gladly see it again and would encourage you all to do the same.",

Schumer is excellent as is Colin Quinn as her dad. Hader & Lebron are just kind of there but have some good lines, including the repurposing of some Kanye lyrics. There are a number of people that really shine despite small parts and add to the overall comedy, including Tilda Swinton as Amy's disinterested boss, Dave Attell as Amy's homeless pal and Parks & Recreation's Jon Glaser as Amy's sketchy co-worker. John Cena was a good sport about his role and did a nice job too, even if we see quite a bit more of him than we needed to (see his first scene and you will know what I mean).",

    "review": "  Train Wreck Review A woman who has been in a lot of relationships with other guys has met the perfect guy for her, but she is reluctant to leave her past and move out of her comfort zone. The movie Train Wreck stars comedian/actor Amy Schumer who is a huge star right now. She has a father (Collin Quin) who cheated on her mother during their marriage and they get a divorce while she and her sister are very young. It looks like Amy (Amy Schumer) is heading down the same rode but she's not married and she's not a cheater she's just been with a lot of guys.This characteristic is often given to male actors but this film is switches it up it's kind of refreshing and different in a way.  She's a writer for a magazine and kind of the artsy type of girl and not interested in sports or anything like that but she's dating a fitness trainer played by John Cena, a WWE professional wrestler in real life, and he is hilarious and might be gay, but he loves Amy, opposites attract. Anyway that doesn't work out and she freaks out and for good reason during a sex scene where he's sort of homoerotic. There is some male nudity in movie, but it's not frontal nudity. No female nudity though, kind of disappointing, but actually the love scenes are pretty hilarious and they're really not that racy. She's has to write an article about a sports Physician, Aaron played by Bill Hader who isn't really attractive, super nerdy, and a trainer to Athletes like Lebron James he's in the movie and he plays himself, and he does well actually. He's plays Aaron's best friend and client. There's some other athletes with smaller roles like NFL Football player, Tony Romo and Amare` Stoudamire who is another NBA basketball player.  Amy's sister, Kim (Brie Larson) is happily married and has children with Tom (Mike Birbiglia). So she went the opposite the way of her father. She has a great life and it doesn't look complicated on the outside as it is on the inside.  Both of these women are very attractive with great personalities, Amy's really funny, but The people around her are funnier than her. Dave Attel, another comedian plays a homeless man who is friends with Amy and their relationship is strictly platonic and hilarious he's in a few scenes but they're really funny. Amy's friend Nicky (Vanesssa Bayer who's on Saturday Night Live. She's also attractive and funny. I actually wouldn't mind seeing her in a starring role in a movie cause she very attractive to me, but that's just my opinion. SNL writer Leslie Jones is in cameo. She stars in the next Ghostsbuster movie. It's another funny scene. Matthew Broderick, is in the movie. Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei star in a movie with in a movie about walking dogs, which is really funny. It seems like I'm forgetting some people, but this movie has a lot star power going for it.  The sentimental scenes really got to me and they were very sad, Her father is dying and it's just sad it's breaks away from the film and even if it fits in. I personally didn't like them, but everything else is great.  This movie is really funny and just plain fun I enjoyed it a lot. It has a ton of stars and keeps the audience's attention really well. So I thought it was excellent and I hope to see more Amy schumer movies in the future. (9/10 on this one.)",

Is Amy trying to convince people she's a serious actress? There's ZERO plot, random stories about her dad suffering from MS and then dying, who cares??? She has a high paying job and a relationship with a top sports surgeon, is that a \"Trainwreck\" life?? This movie sucked. I was going to walk out halfway through but stuck it out, what a waiste of time!!!",

    "review": "  The peak of Amy Schumer's 15 minutes. So this is about that one girl that you probably know in your own life: she dates terrible guys, she's more or less a functioning alcoholic, and she barely has her life together enough to hold down a full time job. Her life is in for a shake-up when she meets a good guy (Bill Hader). This movie has been getting a lot of traction, so of course I had to take a day off and check it out (side note: I can't believe I could get a ticket for under $5, but I suppose that's the perk to seeing a movie at 10:30 AM on a Thursday.) Given that I already knew that this is a Judd Apatow production, I can say that this is everything that I was expecting it to be, which is mostly positive. While this may be an Apatow production, this is a vehicle for Schumer herself, as she is front in center, writing and starring. She has been getting a lot attention lately, which is largely because talented female comedians are so hard to come by, especially ones that have a means of reaching both genders. The girl's got talent and comedic timing, and not only that, she's got a voice as well, not afraid to speak her mind on whatever issue she feels passionately about. This is where Trainwreck succeeds the most, and it is completely her doing. Also helping the party is the very strong supporting cast. Brie Larson has been great since Scott Pilgrim, and John Cena, like other wrestlers before him, actually does have acting abilities, and he has a number of laugh-out-loud worthy lines. Bill Hader really gets to show the full extent of his acting range, and I never saw him as the S.N.L. guy here, I saw him as a real human being. Stealing the show is LeBron James, though, and he is given tons to do; even though he wasn't happy with his performance from what I hear, the way they utilize him just flat out works. Now if you recall from the first paragraph, you may gather that I have a criticism here, which is Judd Apatow's constant folly: his movies go on for longer than they need to. It's something he's never been able to correct, and it has always been a problem. Just leveling here: there is no reason why a comedy has to be longer than 100 minutes. If you've got something working, you may be able to push it to 110, but even then, it's a risk that has rare payoff. It's like the movies he makes have all of the deleted scenes featured in it, and this runs about 15 - 20 minutes longer than it needs to. It's never as trying as Funny People which is a legit 2 1/2 hour movie, but it still stands as a mark against itself. It's still funny, though, and I enjoyed this a whole lot. This makes me happy to see this financially succeed in the same way that I was happy for Bridesmaids on behalf of Kristen Wiig: this can only mean that we are going to get more Amy Schumer projects, which is something I want to see in the future.",

    "review": "  A film with a great cast, a tried and true romcom premise, and yet, there's something missing. Schumer is known for her edgy and often very sexual comedy, of which there is plenty of in the first half of this film. Hader is as funny as ever, and both John Cena and LeBron James give surprisingly funny performances. Then why is the plot so disappointing? Given Schumer's comedy, I went into this movie expecting a very different ending than the one we got. I thought I'd be seeing a romantic comedy that was going in a different direction, a bait-and-switch where there is no typical \"happy ending,\" but one more in tune with Schumer's brand of comedic material. That said, it was nice to see Amy Schumer break into film acting, as her stand-up and television career have definitely ensured she deserves some time on the big screen, and I feel this film and its general success proves she can do so no problem.",

Monogamy isn't realistic.Nine Year Old Amy, Five Year Old Kim: Monogamy isn't realistic.Gordon: Again!Nine Year Old Amy, Five Year Old Kim: Monogamy isn't realistic!Amy: I didn't understand that word at the time but now, I know exactly what he was talking about.Trainwreck es una comedia dirigida por Judd Apatow y escrita por Amy Schumer, y trata acerca de una chica llamada Amy que a ra�z de el divorcio de sus padres, aprendi� que la monogamia no es realista, entonces se rehusa a tener una relaci�n estable, y prefiere tener sexo casual, hasta que es elegida en su trabajo para escribir un art�culo acerca de Aaron Conners, un famoso doctor de atletas. Trainwreck revierte los roles de los protagonistas. Normalmente es el personaje masculino que tiene fobia a los compromisos y se comporta de esta manera, hasta que llega una mujer que lo \"cambia\", entonces es genial ver a el personaje de Amy que encarna estos estereotipos normalmente reservados para el sexo opuesto. De hecho esta pel�cula tiene aspectos que no son comunes en este g�nero tan restrictivo. Por ejemplo Kim, la hermana de Amy, que es todo lo contrario a ella, ya que tiene una relaci�n estable y est� esperando un hijo, pareciera estar feliz con su situaci�n, entonces tenemos a estos dos personajes femeninos, que son los extremos, pero que pueden convivir sin competir. Luego est� Steven (John Cena) que es el t�pico hombre obsesionado con el ejercicio, pero que tiene un lado sentimental y es el que est� buscando asentarse en la relaci�n, y la escena del cine, donde todos los insultos que dice tienen doble interpretaci�n es comiqu�sima. Finalmente Lebron James, quien es el mejor amigo de Aaron, es la mejor parte de Trainwreck. La naturalidad con la cual dice sus l�neas me sorprendi�, porque estamos acostumbrados a verlo como un atleta, pero claramente tiene talento para la actuaci�n y la comedia. Su papel es el que normalmente interpretar�a la mejor amiga de la protagonista, en la cual busca protegerla e interroga a el hombre a ver si se est� tomando en serio la relaci�n. Trainwreck en general atina las notas. Tiene escenas que son muy graciosas e inteligentes, pero otras que fallan, especialmente la de la intervenci�n, que fue terrible. Tiene la mezcla perfecta de romance, comedia y obscenidad, especialmente la de Amy y Ezra Miller que es el interno de su oficina. Los personajes son todos variados en cuanto a personalidad, pero cada uno aporta algo especial a la pel�cula, y tienen la oportunidad de brillar en ciertas escenas. Esta es una pel�cula que se nota que est� dirigida por Judd Apatow pero los protagonistas se intercambiaron, y realmente que el humor de Amy Schumer logra ser asequible y divertido para cualquier p�blico.",

It reverses the roles of a romantic comedy - the woman here is the one who \"sleeps around\" a lot, then meets the man who clicks with her and then the tropes ensue - but they commit to it and the acting is really terrific across the board. And FUNNY throughout, very funny, with people like John Cena and even more surprisingly basketball star Lebron James. I recommend it, except for one caveat: it's too long. Apatow needs an editor to tell him no, but he won't listen since he doesn't have to. Thus we get a very good movie in the style of his influences, James L Brooks and John Cassavetes once again. Though with Schumer in the lead, it's crass in the best ways and likeable too.",

    "review": "  'Inside Amy Schumer' is an awesome comedy sketch show and a personal favorite, but this movie is far away from that. Starts off great, then turns into your typical 2010-onward rom-com with characters falling for each other even though they both don't want to, but then they give in, but their differences make things complicated, yadda yadda yadda.I'd really like for Judd Apatow to at least try and make a comedy UNDER TWO HOURS, take example from the 80s and 90s and make one that's an hour and a half and doesn't have a soap opera drama chapter in its final thirty minutes, which makes the total two hours of Trainwreck a chore. I also don't know why modern comedies need its main characters to be cynical self-centered bastards that treat other people like shit, with the occasional goody two-shoes character that's totally oblivious to the fact that someone's an asshole. With that type of humor, which is based on people being jerks and insulting each other, you can almost feel the grip of auto-censorship as visually vulgar gags are avoided, as are insults that are based on race, weight, physical appearance and nationality - it's just personal insults, and some slapstick here and there. One visual that's prominent in the movie is men's asses, as there are plenty of male butt-cheeks shown throughout the movie, without a single boob, side boob, nipple or female ass, and I think Schumer didn't even show her belly button, not even during sex scenes. Is that equality? What the fuck?Plenty of cameos in this one, from notable comedians you've seen on Schumer's show or on Adult Swim shows, as well as athletes such as LeBron James. Speaking of which, the best part of this movie is WWE wrestler John Cena. I'm used to booing this man, but he was the best part of this movie, and the funniest lines were delivered by him. Never give up, Cena! Anyway, once he's gone from the story, which is early in the movie, the story falls flat. I don't even feel like mentioning any details of the actual story, as anyone who has seen a couple of rom-coms over the last few years could guess the entire script. The only conclusion I can make after watching this is that John Cena should make comedies, have him team up with The Rock, with Mark Wahlberg as well, because those two could play twins. I'll forget the vast majority of Trainwreck in a couple of days.",

If I'd known in advance that this was going to be a dramedy about the life of one of the most unsympathetic female characters in recent years, I would've given this film at least one more star. The trailer advertised a completely different film, which, in the end, resulted in me leaving the theater feeling unsatisfied and disappointed. I do love Schumer's writing style, but the role of Amy should've been played by somebody else. I didn't buy the romance between Schumer and Hader, and I was more interested in the supporting characters than the leading characters (people like Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller deserved more screen time). The jokes are hit-and-miss for the most part, and I just don't like comedy films with pathos. Trainwreck is an unfunny and quite boring film.",

    "review": "  Amy Schumer is f*&king funny! If you haven't watched Inside Amy Schumer or seen any of her stand-up then you're missing out. She is easily one of the funniest comedians working today, and I'm not going to insult her by adding the preface of \"female\" comedian because she is that damn funny. So what happens when the funniest comedian working today works with comedic director Judd Apatow, who to be fair has been a little hit and miss lately, does Amy stack up on the big screen? Due to some pretty poor parenting advice from her father as a child, Amy has become a commitment-phobic woman who has a great career, like everyone does in Apatow films, and essentially only believes in one-night stands. But when she meets a surgeon to sports stars, played by Saturday Night Live's Bill Hader, she becomes conflicted about her long held beliefs about what \"monogamy\" really means. Look, let's not beat about the bush, this is a Romantic Comedy, but a Romantic Comedy written by Amy Schumer and directed by the guy who gave us the 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, so it's fair to say that it subverts many of the common cliches and tropes of the genre. Schumer essentially has the traits of the male role reserved for Rom-Coms whereas Hader takes on the more feminine elements found in these types of movies, thus the film is refreshing. But even more so it's the raunchy comedy that pulls this out of the more cringe-worthy parts of the genre that drives most men into glazed over sacks that are just waiting for the end credits. The supporting cast around Schumer is magnificent. LeBron James is a real highlight of the film. Surprisingly, for a current sporting personality he provides a version of himself that is self-deprecating, needy and extremely funny. What's most amazing is that he doesn't make cheesy or eye-rolling references to his career, I could never see Dennis Rodman doing this in his acting career (or when people gave a shit about Dennis Rodman - if people ever did.) You also get a great comedic turn from Mark Wahlberg, sorry I mean John Cena, who looks like Mark Wahlberg ate Mark Wahlberg, he and Amy's sex scene is hilariously awkward. Bill Hader is a great leading man, very much in the same vain as Paul Rudd, he has the charm and the humour which makes for the perfect pairing for Amy Schumer. The other great casting is Tilda Swinton who is, much like in the movie Snowpiercer, completely unrecognisable as a downright despicable editor of a magazine called Snuff - she's so shallow and dismissive based on such purely superficial reasons that you don't know whether to punch her in the face or take a shower.It would have been incredibly easy for this film to just become a series of stand-up jokes delivered directly to the audience, however Apatow manages to blend much of Amy Schumer's stand-up material effortlessly into the story. In the hands of a lesser director, we would be getting lots of short unrelated comedy clips like we did in Ted 2 or A Million Ways To Die In The West, so this is not only great for Amy Schumer's debut but for us as an audience. The comedy can be on the nose at times, it can get a little dirty, well really dirty, like you might need a shower afterwards kind of dirty, but a lot of it comes off very relatable. It may get a little awkward at times when you're wife, girlfriend and partner starts laughing harder than you and starts saying between snorts \"so true, so true...\" Yeah, depending on the scene that could be an awkward conversation afterwards. Like many Apatow films there is always a strong desire to bring the serious moments into the really serious territory where it often hits a little too close to home and uncomfortable. Much like in the other Apatow films it doesn't really fit with the flow of the rest of the laugh out loud comedy. This is most likely due to Apatow's personal push for comedies to receive the coveted Oscar-nod via their own category of \"Best Comedy\" which is fine, but it shouldn't be at the expense of a comedy being a comedy. The film is clearly aiming to be an \"Anti-Rom-Com\" and it does succeed with this on many levels thanks to the raw realism of the modern dating scene and how we view sexual relationships, but the film does fall into stock-standard \"Rom-Com\" at times, particularly at the end. Thankfully, the film is far too enjoyable to hold that against it. Trainwreck gets Four and a Half out of Five Stars (or Four and a Half really awkward conversations with your partner about your sexual history)",

    "review": "  Making her feature film debut, Amy Schumer brings her stand-up persona to life with aplomb and demonstrates some not-bad dramatic chops in the process. Trainwreck is plainly designed as a showcase for her talents and does an admirable job proving why she deserves to have a future on the big screen. Trainwreck does fall prey to some of the common romantic comedy tropes, slipping into predictability a bit in the third act. In addition, Judd Apatow's latest isn't immune from some of the shortcomings that typically befall his films. Nevertheless, Trainwreck puts the spotlight on a growing comedic voice in Schumer. While her style may be off-putting to some and occasionally bordering on blatant shock value, it is certainly one worth exploring, and her partnership with Apatow works well for both parties involved, as Trainwreck is anything but what its title implies.",

    "review": "  Watching the first half of Trainwreck seemed like a very bad porno where the people fuck with their clothes on, which is bad because as horrible as Amy Schumer's acting was, seeing her tits would of probably done this film some good.I understand that Schumer wrote the script but by no means should she of played the lead. The first half of the movie it seemed like she was trying to be Kristin Wig but not nearly as awkwardly funny and then half way through she flipped to Amy Poehler except not as quirky and enthusiastic.Schumer's script was actually pretty good except I felt she didn't know what kind of movie she was writing. It's decent as a cheesy rom com, but as far as a raunchy comedy, completely missed the mark.The first twenty minutes seemed like a cheap amalgam rip off of Bridesmaids and Wedding Crashers.The middle part pretty much plays out like every Drew Barrymore rom com of the nineties and the end was like some weird Bollywood movie where people break out into dance numbers for no reason while inserting a paint by numbers ending to wrap it all up.Whoever told LeBron James that he should act should be shot in their balls. Watching LeBron act is like watching Jordan play baseball, your offended at the fact that he thinks he can do it but you just want to tune in to see how bad an amazing athlete can suck at something.There have been rumors that LeBron is supposed to be attached to star in a reboot and/or sequel to space jam. My wish is that whoever finances that movie watches this one and realizes that its a stupid fucking idea and should invest his or her money elsewhere before he or she ends up with another Thunderstruck, never heard of it, trust me Kevin Durant is happy that you haven't.John Cena was surprisingly good in this film. The WWE star provided a couple of laughs, that were few and far between, but by far the funniest person in the whole film, which is odd because Bill Hader is usually hilarious.Even though I somewhat enjoyed watching this film it is by far Judd Apatow's worst film that he has done. It didn't really feel like an Apatow film but like some hack director's cheap attempt to replicate a Paul Feig movie, Judd your better than that. Apatow has evidently hit a slump, it seems every movie after Knocked up has progressively been worse than the last.In my opinion this one is only good for a Redbox rental in the future, but keep in mind, this is no where near a classic but if your a jaded fan from South Beach at least laughing at LeBron's acting for an hour and a half should ease the pain of your team sucking again.",

She wrote and starred in Trainwreck. I'm sure Schumer had more than just a little say in how the movie turned out. The casting was amazing. I know who LeBron James is because he's a good basketball player and someone on his last team screwed his wife. I now also know he's a funny actor who seems to be comfortable in front of the camera. James owned every scene he was in. He had good chemistry with Schumer and Hader, which compensated for the lack of chemistry that Schumer and Hader had. Colin Quinn and John Cena pitched in to make Trainwreck better also. Cena showed that he has a good sense of humor. The worst thing is the run-time. 2 hours is a long time for this type of film, and it has a bit of drag toward the end. It ended up being worth it though.The lack of chemistry between Schumer and Hader that I mentioned earlier is also pretty big for a rom-com. Obviously it didn't kill Trainwreck, but two actors that seemed to get along even a little would have made it better. Trainwreck was smart and funny. It's worth watching when anyone gets the chance.",

    "review": "  My heart goes out to those who died and got injured at the Trainwreck screening shooting in Louisiana cinema. The story is about a woman raised to believe monogamy isn't realistic finds her uninhibited lifestyle starting to wear thin. When her magazine job leads her to interview a charming sports doctor, she finds herself falling for him - and maybe finding romance is just what she needs in her life.Okay I'm just going to say it, I never was a fan of Amy Schumer. I was never a fan of her work and to be honest I'm not such a big fan of her. I don't know what it is but these just something about her that I just can't put my finger on it. I only say I'm not a fan of her because I don't hate her as a person, because right now as I speak shes taking action on gun control because of the Louisiana cinema shooting that was showing Trainwreck. I'm happy that shes calling out this big issue that's still around and how this gun control problem needs to solved. A simple gun can land into the wrong hands. But all that aside I thought the movie Trainwreck wasn't all that great of a movie.The movie wasn't written that well, I mean the jokes in the movie got old after awhile. Some people say that the movie was well written but I must disagree. Amy Schumer did okay in the movie but these a couple of scenes in the movie that she didn't do such a great job, for example when shes at a funeral and she starts crying and the tears didn't look even remotely look like it was brought on by emotions the character was experiencing, it just looked like an actress trying to force whatever emotion to force out.While watching the movie I kept saying to myself \"Is this real humor?\" because the audience that I was with only chuckled a couple of times. There are a few gay jokes in the movie and that's mostly with John Cena who would say something and then somehow accidentally imply that he wants to have sex with another man and this joke happens too many times in the movie. That's pretty much the joke, now some many think I got offended by the joke but that's really not the case, I can laugh at many jokes that might be offence to some people who take it too seriously. The problem here is that there was no joke, gay was the joke. These many gay jokes out there that are funny if there's a joke behind it but not on it's own. Tilda Swinton was the only one to give a good performance in this movie. She did the best of what she had to work with by poor directing and the terrible script.The movie is called Trainwreck which is Amy Schumer character, which the movie keeps referencing about her alcohol and marijuana use but we only see her intoxicated in a couple of moments in the movie but after awhile the movie just tells you about it without Amy Schumer acting like it.Bill Hader was good in the movie but he didn't do anything special.Overall Trainwreck wasn't all that good to me. A lot of people may easily disagree with me on this one but this is just my honest thoughts on this movie. If you enjoyed the movie good for you.",

    "review": "  Amy Schumer is a comedy assassin. Proof is in her hit Comedy Central series, Inside Amy Schumer, which takes on everything from rape culture to Hollywood sexism to Bill Cosby. Proof is also now in her starring role in Trainwreck. As star and screenwriter--with director Judd Apatow wisely harnessing her comic skills instead of stifling them--Schumer is a wonder of comic talent with an assault on sexism and man attitudes that hits hard.Amy is Amy Townend, a writer for a men's magazine run by an editor (a terrifically hilarious Tilda Swinton) who has a fondness for headlines such as 'Are You Gay Or Is She Just Boring?' Amy is tasked with interviewing Aaron Conners (Bill Hader), a sports-medicine doctor who tends to the celebrity likes of LeBron James (absolutely hilarious) and Amar'e Stoudemire.Sounds like a set-up for love, but hang on. Amy, sporting a mouth fueled by booze, weed and a clueless, neglectful father (a wonderful Colin Quinn) is game to hook up with almost any guy and then dump them. Aaron isn't quite one of those dudes, though the brilliant Hader, whose comic and dramatic skills hit a new peak, imbues him with complications. These two don't go together easy, and that's how Schumer likes it. Schumer takes rom-com cliches and explodes them, replacing them with something fierce and tougher. Here's to getting more of that from her.",

    "review": "  Trainwreck is a romantic comedy directed by Judd Apatow and starring Amy Schumer and Bill Hader, and this film comes in very strong with the comedy. The romance side of the film kicks in about 30 minutes in, so for the first act of the film it really has some pretty damn good laughs. There was a pretty steady flow of jokes and comedy gags throughout the film and you have to give most of that credit to Amy Schumer who was incredibly hilarious in this. She is one of the funniest people out there today and she proves it in this film with perfect comedic timing. Her style of comedy is so blunt and fairly subtle at some moments and that makes it very unpredictable so she can hit you with great jokes left right and centre and you never see it coming. Now even though she does manage to pull it off the best, Bill Hader and the supporting cast are also hilarious and provided a lot more laughs than i had initially expected. Bill Hader of course is hilarious and he works in this film really well but he was slightly overshadowed by Amy at some moments in the film, and the large supporting cast also took away from him a little. But man were the supporting cast hilarious, i have to give credit to LeBron James because that guy is hilarious. He was one of the biggest surprises of the film, almost every scene he was in i couldn't stop laughing, it looks like Apatow and Schumer managed to teach him a few things in terms of comedy. As well as being jam packed with great hilarious moments this movie really had a basic but also pretty good rom-com story thrown in there. And it worked well, they didn't just force any random plot in there to add to the run-time. For the first two acts they did a great job at blending those comedic scenes and romantic more plot driven scenes well so they could switch between the two vary naturally. But the third act for me didn't work as much. The romantic side began to take charge and the comedy took a back seat. There were still some pretty funny scenes in the third act but it felt uneven tonally and a little jumpy. There was a pretty sad moment at one point then it tries to crack a few jokes immediately after then going back to the romantic stuff and it didn;t work for me as well as the rest of the film. I don't think it was an issue of being too long just needed a little more refining towards the end. But otherwise it was a great funny movie. Amy Schumer's comedy may not be for everyone so those who are not a fan of her 'Inside Amy Schumer' skits probably won't like this as much but as far as a romantic comedy goes, this one was actually very good and had quite a bit in there for everyone. - 7.1ALSO, on last thing, i just checked the list of cast and was surprised beyond belief when i found out that Tilda bloody Swinton was in this film. Like WTF? she was completely unrecognisable and hilarious, so see if you can pick her out when you see the film.",

My only explanation is that they were high when they watched it and I wasn't. I can't believe Judd Apatow was a part of this. Usually his comedies are good enough, some of them are hilarious, but this one failed miserably. There are more stupid jokes than clever ones and the script is basically weak on an intellectual level. This is not what I would call a good comedy film, even on romantic comedy standards, which are usually pretty low.",

    "review": "  This movie is a trainwreck, though it was funny in some parts but 2 hours of the same romantic comedy story in reverse. Instead of a male protagonist it is a female. Amy Schumer is really funny in her stand up, but in her show and in this movie not that much. To me within five min. in the movie I know I was in real trouble because there is nothing different it is the same story that has been told before. Show how protagonist plays, how protagonist falls in love, how protagonist breaks up, how protagonist over comes bullshit to be together with that person. The move was the same as it was before I expected a lot better out of Amy Schumer and Judd Apatow. I thought the movie was more about some alcoholic that falls in love or some shit, which basically is but in a different stand point. I mean because Amy Schumer is the protagonist and all of her friends are just sex in the city wannabes kept me thinking \"Wow easy pussy! And they try to justify this in a female player perspective.\" I'm sorry if this does sound a little sexist, but this movie was not my cup of tea for me.",

    "review": "  Trainwreck starring Amy Schumer and Bill Hader is definitely not a train wreck. This film succeeds on pulling off a mix of drama and comedy, while also putting a twist on the romantic comedy genre. By far the best part of this film is the chemistry between Bill Hader and Amy Schumer, they both fit their characters perfectly. My only gripe with the film is that it could have probably been twenty minutes shorter and still have been good, also some of the jokes personally didn't hit me as hard as they did others in the theatre. Trainwreck is worth checking out if your into romance stories and yuck jokes...",

    "review": "  Jud Apatow is one of the most successful producer / directors in the modern adult comedy genre. His rambling improve-heavy comedies are a collection of hits and misses; from the massively successful 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked-Up to failures like Funny People and This is 40. His style of comedy is basically a collection of You-tube like clips filled with filthy-mouthed characters improvising in front of the camera with the story never following a structure or a focused narrative. Trainwreck is Apatow's first directed comedy that's not written by him. This time, stand-up comedian Amy Schumer steps in as the star and the writer, which is a great change for Apatow's movies because they are generally male-oriented. The result of their collaboration is a funny, charming albeit flawed movie that could even be Apatow's best film to-date.Amy (Amy Schumer) is a commitment-phobic career woman living in Manhattan. Since she was a little girl, it's been drilled into Amy's head by her rascal of a dad that monogamy isn't realistic. Now a magazine writer, Amy lives by that credo - enjoying what she feels is an uninhibited life free from stifling, boring romantic commitment - but in actuality, she's kind of in a rut. When she finds herself starting to fall for the subject of the new article she's writing - a charming and successful sports doctor named Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) - Amy starts to wonder if other grown-ups, including this guy who really seems to like her, might be on to something.Schumer, whose stand-up career and Comedy Central series have earned her a passionate following (and a sizable number of haters) is poised for some serious stardom. Not only her writing smoothly switches tracks from raunchy one-liners to emotionally raw dialogue about commitment, family and self-destructiveness, but also she owns the movie. She takes central stage with her unique persona on display at all times. The movie is constantly funny from the opening scene when we meet young Amy and her sister listening to their father's advice. After that we are introduced to her life style, her narcissism and her terror of monogamy, which shows itself when her sort-of boyfriend wants to take things to the next level. The dialogue is crude, rude and sharp and the deliveries are mostly hilarious with Schumer essentially playing herself throughout the movie. It's obvious that she is emotionally connected with her written characters and knows the story well enough to make it look authentic and real on the screen. Her relationship with her dad and sister (both superbly played) are textured, charming and believable. On the other hand, her relationship with Hader seems a bit forced and scripted but the two actors work so well with each other that will make us go along with their impossible relationship. The biggest win for Trainwreck however, is that the jokes do work for the most part. The script allows most of the cast members to shine and deliver their funny lines in the most authentic way.The film has numerous problems however and some are the same flaws with every Judd Apatow movie. The story is a bit convoluted and unfocused at times and there are no excuses for this type of comedy to be this over-long. There are plenty of subplots that could have easily been trimmed or taken out and sometimes the film comes to a halt because a scene is going nowhere. Also, when the film tries to get deeper into Amy's character, this lack of focus begins to become a major problem. Instead of having more scenes about her inner desires and her relationship with her family, we get to see basketball cheerleaders, dating montages or satirical takes on the glossy magazine industry. And finally, the ending feels too romantic-comedy friendly and unbelievable which is a shame because a more daring or realistic ending could have made the film smarter and more grown-up.But despite all the problems with the unfocused narrative and over-long running time, Trainwreck ironically never goes of the rail. As far as modern day romantic comedies go, it is certainly among the best and certainly delivers the laughs. The acting is superb across the board and some of the dialogue driven scenes could even become classics in the future. It is far from perfect but it is by far Apatow's funniest movie and definitely worth watching.",

The thing that really sold it for me though is that I knew this was going to be funny. That part was obvious. What I didn't expect (and was pleasantly surprised by) were the more emotionally poignant moments. They were there, you felt them, and then you were laughing a moment later. The fact that we as an audience completely go along with it is proof of how strong this script really is. I really hope to see more writing from her in the future. The same goes for her acting. Honestly, really well done. I know I'm talking about Schumer a lot, and she is one of the main reasons that this movie works, but the rest of the cast is nothing to scoff at either. This is one of Bill Hader's more emotionally vulnerable roles that I've seen him do, and he does a really nice job. Brie Larson, Mike Birbiglia, and Colin Quinn are great as her family, they bring some of the more grounded moments to the movie. Then on the other side of the spectrum, you have Ezra Miller, Vanessa Bayer, Randall Park, and Jon Glaser as her really funny co-workers, and an unrecognizably hilarious Tilda Swinton as her boss. Also who knew that LeBron James and John Cena could act? And be funny? Super pleasantly surprised by that. I could literally keep talking about this. My only complaint is that it get a tad laggy in the middle and we all know how it's going to end. But honestly, who cares, because the ride getting there is a ton of fun.",

She plays a young woman refusing to live a monogamous lifestyle following a childhood lecture from her father. Schumer plays the traditional \"man\" role. She has a string of relationships and refuses to get close to anyone. Working for a paparazzi style magazine titled S'Nuff she is instructed by her editor a wickedly funny Tilda Swinton (I'd swear it's based on the character from Absolutely Fabulous) to interview a sports surgeon played by Bill Hader and they fall in love which totally turns her life upside down.In many ways it's a standard rom-com but at least Schumer's wit keeps you on your toes. The cast is excellent and surprisingly LeBron and Cena are funny when they need to be but the standout for me is Swinton. Who knew she could do comedy. I should have known considering she is one of the finest actresses in the world today.It drags in the third act but it's still a worthwhile effort and fine comedy-drama.

The cast is tremendous and the cameos are not too distracting and actually add a lot to the film (who would have thought Lebron James would be a solid actor). But the entire film is carried by Schumer and she does a great job in the lead role and writer of this film. Overall the film is very funny and I thoroughly enjoyed this comedy.",

I felt like that yesterday when I decided to beat the heat in my non-air conditioned house and go to a movie. The women sitting behind me and I were laughing loud and proud, but sooome people didn't find it that funny or were laughing secretly because their date didn't find it funny. So this movie is not for everyone, but it is for the lovers of Amy and Bridesmaids. I would go as far to say it is one of my all time favorite rom-com's. It is full of uncomfortable moments and some very raunchy, nasty jokes, but it works! Bill Hader was also pretty amazing and LeBron James was just having fun laughing at himself. Even John Cena made me laugh and I am not a huge fan. I would watch it again, which is more than I can say for other romantic comedies.",

    "review": "  Trainwreck: How Do I Hate Thee?I've been holding back on this rant for a week now, but seeing \"Trainwreck\" certified fresh on the movie site Rotten Tomatoes has pushed me over the edge. Apparently every other living human being besides myself and the friend I saw the movie with thinks \"Trainwreck\" is hilarious, wonderful and ground-breaking. I found it sad, poorly plotted, and only intermittently funny. I almost feel as if I've entered an alternate universe where I had to watch a bad version of a movie that's supposed to be fantastic. At any rate, here is a roll-call of my reasons for spurning the movie.Let's begin with those reviews. The New York Times lauded \"Trainwreck\" and its writer and star Amy Shumer as \"transgressive,\" praising the movie's heroine for \"owning her sexuality\" and for the daring subversion of gender norms whereby a woman is heartless and insensitive and the men around her are caring and hoping for commitment and monogamy. I shouldn't have read the reviews. They built up the hope that I was going to see a new \"Bridget Jones' Diary\" or \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" each funny and modestly transgressive in their own ways.Amy Shumer's character (named Amy, wow) in \"Trainwreck\" drinks and smokes pot to excess and has sex with anyone who will take her home with him, but won't remember who she slept with in the morning or where she is. This is not transgressive, friends. This is not \"owning your sexuality.\" It's stupid, unsafe and depressing, and it's not even amusing. Callous, joyless, commitment-free humping is no funnier when a woman does it than when a man does, and Shumer --although she gets in some funny lines-- does nothing to make a case to the contrary.Worse, there is very little sign that \"Amy\" enjoys the sex she's having. Most of the time she's complaining about it or clearly underwhelmed by it. Even when she hooks up with the man who becomes her love interest, she spends the post-coital afterglow carping at the man about his breathing and her aversion to spooning. Ha, ha, ha. A pathological inability to be truly intimate. Hilarious.Shumer is appealing and sometimes very funny, with the blond, squinty-eyed charm Renee Zellweger brought to \"Bridget Jones.\" One of the highlights of this lamentable film is that Amy never doubts that men want to sleep with her or worries about her attractiveness. Her neuroses involve a desire to avoid the closeness that commitment and monogamy have a tendency to engender. \"Monogamy is for suckers,\" as her dad says at the beginning of the movie. Of course in \"Trainwreck's\" present, that formally swinging dad is afflicted with MS and chained to a wheelchair, suggesting that he (and anyone pursuing that path) will pay for their aberrations via cosmic retribution. (A suggestion, by the way that is horrifying in its insensitivity on so many levels.)The movie presents us with a character who abuses drugs and alcohol, sleeps around, has no real friends, and is intermittently hostile to her \"normal\" sister, the sister's odd but rather dear stepson and bumbling husband. O.K. Fine. I may not buy that as entertaining, but it's a formula that worked in \"Absolutely Fabulous.\" The problem is that, once it has given us this model, \"Trainwreck\" then proceeds to prove it was all a sham. Amy isn't really like this. She was just waiting for the right man to come along, her outrageously irascible father (now HE'S funny) to perish, various other vicissitudes to occur, and a dance sequence to unfold for true love to triumph. \"Ab Fab\" was successful for those who liked it because Edina and Patsy were always and everywhere horrible, and nothing on earth could redeem them from the selfish, horrid harridans they were.What is most troubling is how the movie attempts to recast Amy as sympathetic, likeable and \"worthy\" of entering into a traditional heterosexual romantic coupling with --here's some transgression for you-- a young, caring, wealthy doctor. It does so by debasing her work and her sexuality. In the film's comic and narrative nadir, when she and the doctor break up, a drunk and high Amy goes home with a co-worker who turns out to be under-age. The episode ends in humiliation and disaster for Amy. Proving what? That her fun and fancy-free life of drug-addled boffing is an empty, dangerous exercise in futility? That the audience permitted itself to be misled into thinking this was a movie that celebrated a woman's right to be just as carefree and single as a man a la Samantha Jones in \"Sex and the City\"? Search me.Having proven Amy is an unethical, damaged person and made its comic bed with her, the movie refuses to lie in it. I might not have liked \"Trainwreck\" if it had stayed with the original premise, but I would have . . . ahem . . . respected it in the morning. The bait and switch destroyed that possibility, but apparently just for me.Oh well. LeBron James was funny. Sigh.",

When Le Bron James and John Cena two sports personalities in cameos are funny and are better actors than the leading lady then you know you've got a really bad movie on your hands. The premise of the movie is horribly unbelieveable as I could not possibly see anyone really wanting to be in a relationship with this woman. I thought it just might be me, but you know what a half full movie theatre was eerily silent which means that Ms Schumer is the darling of the press crowd right now. They have taken her under their wing and are now promoting her as the next big thing. She may be a talented stand up comedian but she is not a good actress. This movie is two stars out of four at best and it is sad that this film passes as a great comedy.In real life if an adult is caught trying to have sex with a 16 year old by the boy's mother, the police are called and it is treated as a sexual assault. IT IS NOT A JOKE!!!",

However, I will say this: Amy Schumer is hilarious and the script she has written for this film is pretty damn close to perfect. This movie is another rarity, especially within its genre, but unlike most rom-coms, Trainwreck deserves financial success and popularity. This movie deserves sold out tickets. This film deserves recognition and respect. Most of all, Trainwreck deserves a chance. So, give it a chance and go see it. I promise you won't regret it.

Even though it doesn't mean much, Trainwreck is the best thing I've seen her do, and a definite step in the right direction for her and her career. It has many funny parts and she does a good job acting in the more serious moments, but it's her writing that paints herself into a corner. She makes her character so, shall we say rough around the edges, that it robs the story of most of its sympathy and forward momentum. I suppose you could argue she did it to set up a redemption arc of sorts, but the way the movie peters out at the end doesn't deliver that, either. Anyway, the best part was clearly seeing LeBron act, who was hilarious in his limited screen time and stole the show along with Bill Hader, who for some unbeknownst reason is really smitten with Amy. Overall, Trainwreck is a step above your typical romcom, but Schumer and Judd Apatow never really come close to transcending it.",

What this is a very well written, well acted and very funny movie and even though not all the jokes work, the ones that do are hilarious. Amy Schumer makes her big screen debut and is mostly a huge success. I'm surprised that a lot of other stand up comics don't do this, write their routine into a movie, I think most of them could succeed, unless they aren't as good of a script writer because Schumer's script is great, it's witty, it's quick, it's smart, it's funny and it has a heart, that and the almost can't miss Judd Apatow directing makes this a winner. Schumer plays a monogamistic writer with a fear of commitment, until she meets Aaron, who falls deeply in love with her, and she falls (literally) for him. She's a drunk and a pot head and she's slept with every guy in New York, but he doesn't care, he still loves her, and that is the key to this whole movie is no matter what she does or who she hurts, he still loves her, and she doesn't know why. The supporting cast is good here but Schumer is the star, and she makes herself out to be one. RECOMMENDED for Amy Schumer (if you like her comedy, but I still think you should give it a chance even if you don't), the writing and the laughs...and of course the HUGE heart at the end, and also John Cena's small role, which I forgot to mention.",

This movie, directed by Judd Apatow who brought us Bridesmaids, does not have the quality and sophistication of Bridesmaids.

I laughed a couple of times. But overall, the script is pretty bland and pointless. It's hard to avoid believing that a number of the women comedians we are seeing on screen are not demeaning themselves. Pretty average.",

    "review": "  Trainwreck follows the Judd Apatow formula, add a bunch of dirty jokes, a lot of witty lines and comebacks, the subtle build up and hilarious punchlines that follow, some heartbreak and emotion, and to top it all off the sense that everything will be ok. Amy Schumer's writing helps this formula come together. She follows her routine of vagina jokes, and her \"I'm loose and fine with it\". Although the movie could of done away with hundreds of these, and at points of the movie you find yourself with a blank stare hearing all them, Schumer delivers a fantastic performance proving she is more then capable of handling lead roles with her fantastic ability to switch off the humor and bring emotion that feels genuine. Along with the countless cameos including a surprisingly comedic performance by NBA star Lebron James and WWE wrestler John Cena, we get a terrific performance by the hilarious Bill Hader. Hader takes on a whole new role that you usual don't see him do. Hader known for his hilarious character acting on SNL, is able to deliver as a toned down and basic character but also maintain his comedy throughout the film. The movie is quite long for the story which probably could of been cut down a bit, and it may be a movie you won't feel the need to see twice, Trainwreck is worth seeing. I wouldn't rush to the theater but if you ever find yourself bored or willing to wait for the DVD release, take the time to sit down and enjoy the rom-com for what it is.",

The story is somewhat formulaic and predictable but the execution is tight and great. Amy Schumer and Bill Hader have awesome chemistry and prove that they are great leads and Collin Quinn, John Cena, LeBron James and Brie Larson all have fantastic supporting roles. This is a high recommendation from me and by far Judd Apatow's best work in my opinion. This movie really isn't great for kids as it has a TON of strong sexual dialogue and some pretty raunchy sex scenes that only show male rear nudity. The Language is very strong with a ton of f-bombs, some used sexually. The main character also drinks a ton and smokes some pot a few times in the film. This is definitely a hard-R comedy but one highly recommend you check out. Hashmov",

(It was fun for me, a long-time SNL fan, to identify all of the SNL cameos.) LeBron James is actually awesome in the film. If he didn't have that basketball thing going on, I think he could definitely make it in comedy films. John Cena was hilarious as well, definitely playing against type. (After some of his scenes, let me just say that I'll never be able to watch him in wrestling the same way again.) Bill Hader, who I am a big fan of, did a great job as well; he was funny as ever but also brought some humanity to a script that at times went maybe just a little too wacky in contrast to what they were doing in the rest of the film. Like many Judd Apatow films, it's a bit too long for a comedy, and what was a subversive take on the typical rom-com gets a little too formulaic at the end. (However, going off the rails is sort of the point of this film, right?) All of that being said, Amy Schumer is charming and winning, and we enjoyed a good, raunchy time. You can't ask more than that sometimes. ROTTEN TOMATOES SCORE: 3 1/2 stars. IMDB SCORE: 7/10.",

    "review": "  Comedy is subjective and depending on the type of comedy, divisive as well. Divisive is how I feel about this movie. A weird expression, but I think it fits well.The humor in the movie worked pretty well with a few hilarious scenes and a couple that might've gone on just a bit too long. Amy does well playing a bachelorette that just wants to get laid regularly, preferably by different people. I was disappointed with how subdued Bill Hader was as \"dude-who-meets-the-protagonist's-match\", but I guess someone's gotta play it straight. LeBron probably impressed me the most as he seemed to enjoy making fun of his super-star image and gets a decent amount of screen-time.My major issue with this movie is the last half-hour. We're chugging along with some funny here and there and then BOOM, a huge tonal change happens and character(s) start doing the opposite of what they'd been doing the first ninety minutes. It tries to sell you a \"this is why they're acting like this\", but I didn't buy it.I'm also not the biggest fan of Amy, maybe because most of her routine in this movie is rooted in disgust at something in a never-ending sarcastic manner. Either way, I really wish Apatow hadn't shoehorned in that last thirty minutes to make it fit his rom-com formula. I would've enjoyed it, otherwise.",

Some people believe it's the funniest film of all time and some think it's the best comedy of this decade so far but I would have to disagree with them. The film is funny but it's not gut busting laughing. The laughs are more of a chuckle. The acting is great everyone played their part very well. Amy Schumer wrote this film and I think she did a great job for writing this film. The chemistry between her and Bill Hader is great. Also this is probably Judd Apatow's best film since 40 Year Old Virgin. The film is more of a chick flick but there are some chick flicks that I thought were funnier than this film like Bridesmaids. Also this could be a great date film for couples. I do find this film way over-hyped and probably one of the most overrated films so far this year.

Schumer, as both the writer and star, attempts to attack conventional romantic comedy, but results in only making the very thing she's out to knock. It's gender-swapping of the norms, but without giving anything to new to the craft. The best of this movie is driven by the comedians that are given bit parts and cameos (Colin Quinn as Amy's masoginistic and crass father, Mike Birbiglia as her dopey brother-in-law, and Dave Attell's lovable homeless guy), as well as LeBron James playing the super-BFF to Bill Hader's Aaron. Schumer is obviously very talented, but perhaps director Judd Apatow allowed her too much control in her first big screen attempt.",

Hilarious, shining, and alternately hard-hearted andscary, Shumer does indeed play a kind of woman that actually exists - one with some terrible flaws and warts, but who is also brilliant and a person you want to know better. One warning - just going by the trailer you might think this is a laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy from start to finish. Honestly, my female friend I saw this with called it a \"dram-com\" instead of a \"rom-com\" as most critics are labeling it. There is some serious issues going on here with Shumer's almost pathological unwillingness to commit (even for a good night kiss after a date), but I also laughed out loud more during the 2 wonderful hours spent with Shumer and her co-star, Bill Hader, than I have in any other movie this year.

    "review": "  I'm not really big on chick flicks. Not because I don't like stories about love-most movies have some sort of love story-it's more of the cliches, cardboard characters and corny dialogue of chick flicks that turn me off. Fortunately Trainwreck avoids most of these chick flick pratfalls and manages to be a pretty entertaining comedy.All of the actors are good here. I usually find the over-the-top smart-assy female character thing that's become popular in modern comedies (think Melissa McCarthy) annoying, and was expecting that in this film from Schumer, but thankfully she didn't really go that route, instead it's a more believable performance of a damaged woman who still loves the father who made it impossible for her to have a meaningful relationship with a man. Bill Hader is great here as the regular guy who falls in love with her. He plays straight laced just as well as he does gay (if you haven't checked out Skeleton Twins, give it a go, Hader's phenomenal in it). There's also a surprising supporting role by Lebron James. The surprising thing isn't necessarily that Lebron is in the film as a supporting character (not a cameo), the surprising thing is that Lebron is good. He plays the best friend of Hader's character, an athletic surgeon who works on professional athletes. Lebron's the best friend who just wants his buddy to be happy. That's it, and the comedy comes from just how good at playing that role he is. This part of the film is incredibly well done.The only issues I have with Trainwreck are that it follows the chick flick formula of: Meet, fall in love, fight, get back together, end. Which in of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing if you can make me forget that you're doing that, but this film didn't. It's comedy is fairly funny (sometimes it feels like it's trying to be edgy for edgy's sake), but I just didn't have a big enough emotional connection with Schumer's character to care if she got back together with Hader. Another problem was that their fight wasn't big enough to make me feel like there was no way they would get back together. It was a normal couple fight, not a \"we're done\" fight, that every chick flick needs. So when they get back together it feels too normal for me to really care. But if you're just looking for a good comedy, this one is miles above most other modern comedies, and just has a few of the usual chick flick problems.",

My expectations going in were raunchy humor, lots of sex, and a John Cena cameo and what I got is heart. Also, way too much John Cena. Way too much. There's no more \"You Can't See Me.\" It's extremely disturbing. Please, wear your jorts at all times, sir.What really involved me in the viewing of this movie is how fundamentally grounded everyone was. Sure, a lot of people in Amy's life have cartoonish elements, but they're also people and you can just feel that in the dialogues and jokes and character touches. Well, all but two. Two characters were just one-dimensional walking jokes. Everyone else, though. Yes, I'm looking at you LeBron, Dave Atell. Method Man. Staten Island Breakfast Guy. And holy hell, Colin Quinn. Best role he's ever had. Talk about playing against type!In summary, Amy Schumer and Bill Hader are magic from their first minute sharing a scene together, and their friends and families help support and shape these people and let you in on who they are without any need to resort to expositing. It's energetic, wild, crass, tearjerking, awkward, hilarious, empathetic, silly, and wonderful.

I would say by a thread hair this is Judd Apatow's best film to date. it's very funny in parts even if not ever single joke hits the mark perfectly, but it almost does. Everything else aside from that is perfect here from the casting to cinematography to music choices. I wasn't really expecting all this to come out of a comedy and perhaps Apatow could get an oscar nom for this screenplay alone, I would say. If you see the trailer for this and think the best parts will be there you will be wrong. This is the perfect example of a dramedy romance gone right and made for everyone no less--over 18, I would say. It does have some slightly dark moments and is a bit mean-spirited in some ways, but as a whole at the center of it all, there is a huge heart to this tale. Don't miss it.

This film is stupid and boring, ( i felt asleep in the middle) Amy lost herself between fame and reason. The script had some potential, but it never happened. But I'm glad for her, at least they paid her really well.",

Most of the time you feel like you're watching a someone's who's not so easy to relate to, and that alienates a big portion of the audience from enjoying the journey of their lead. Trainwreck has it's very funny moments though, all thanks to a great supporting cast, led by Bill Hader and made very powerful by a very funny Lebron James, who could easily lead his own comedies in the near future.",

Great flick about Amy who is literally a trainwreck, she loves life way too much and has no plans to fall in love until she meets her man through a job assignment that she wasn't expecting to get. The cast nails their roles perfectly and the real surprise in this movie is the comedic acting chops of LeBron James. You really need to watch this film just for LeBron. Overall this very funny romantic comedy serves its purpose of being a fun movie. The cameos in this film are fantastic and warming to see some old faces back on the screen.",

Sure, there were a couple of funny moments, but there was way too much lag in between...and, the last 20 minutes or so were just lame. I had high hopes for this film going in, but I was mostly bored and even checked my phone a couple of times to see how much longer was left. Then, I rewatched the trailer for it and realized that the funniest parts of the trailer aren't even in the movie (\"You dress him like that so no one wants to f�ck him? // \"I f�cked a bunch of fat guys\" // most of the LeBron/Bill Hader dialogue). Now it makes me wonder if they took a hacksaw to the film and cut all the funny stuff and that's why we were left with a snorefest? Regardless, while not terrible, it's a film I'll likely never see again unless I develop insomnia.Grade = 4.5/10",

It's a raunchy R rated comedy but the jokes all feel new and funny. It does have some moments in the 3rd act that feel a little jarring and out of place but overall its what you expect from a Judd Apatow movie. Its a little too long and starts off really funny and ends not quite as funny but tries give you a little heart. Shumer is a star and John Cena steals the show for the first 30 mins or so.

It skewers and taunts the whole concept of modern romance whileseemingly extolling the very values it claims are so phony. The movie can be enjoyed as pure comedy or it could be taken as satire. It could be analyzed to death by critics as just a Harlequin Romance disguised as a clever comedy, for the storyline is ultimately about as simplistic as those corny little books that lovelorn gals (and guys?) would read to counter the tedium of 9-5 jobs. Every character in the movie looks like someone we have known or seen in real life; Tilda Swinton nearly steals the movie as the barracuda-like boss of the sleazy men's magazine \"Amy\" (Schumer's character) works for. However, all the other supporting actors were good as well, including Brie Larson playing Amy's sister, who chose the conventional marriage/children route rather than Amy's free-wheeling, promiscuous, hard-partying lifestyle. It is easy to see where this \"trainwreck\" is heading very early on in the story as \"Amy\" is sort of a sex addict/alcoholic and commitment-phobic, but it is a pretty consistently hilarious ride. It's essentially the same old fairy tale fantasy rehashed for maximal laughs: one day she will meet a well-to-do Prince with a fabulous career who will take care of her and the ugly duckling, weird, oddball girl will be, magically, transformed into a caring, committed, upscale queen minus all the unsavory, nasty habits of a really screwed up person. This is a movie in which every character looks so deliberately and imperfectly human they look like characters come alive in a wax museum, all make-up and artifice and witty eccentricity. Still, it's a rollicking, enjoyable train ride and a lot of fun at the movies, a twisted fairy tale that delivers the laughs. It's the funniest comedy I've seen since Bridesmaids.",

    "review": "  \"Trainwreck\" is predicated on the mantra \"monogamy isn't realistic.\" That is the line Amy's father preaches to her and her sister, and it is a line Amy Schumer's character lives by in real life. Amy works as a columnist at a human interest magazine and is assigned to cover a sports doctor (Bill Hader). She lives a cavalier lifestyle, basically doing whatever and whomever, whenever she pleases. However, once she meets Hader, she starts to develop real feelings for him and is torn between her free roaming old habits and wanting to settle down with a guy once and for all. Schumer plays an honest, believable role as a woman in New York trying to make it in her own coming-of-age way. She is relatable and has many of the same problems that we all have. I laud this film for its sincerity. There are also come pro sports cameos, such as Tony Romo and Marv Albert. Lebron James also plays a significant role in the film as Hader's confidant. Overall, this is a lively, spirited film full of pizazz and zest. The comedic gold is natural and though much of the humor is sexual, its not obnoxious or over-the-top.

    "review": "  during one of the biggest droughts in comedy movie history, comedian amy schumer gets her serious debut as an actress in Trainwreck, and the results are hysterical. This is essentially a biopic; and you have to give it up for amy for the bravery, talent, and effort that she put into this film. From the celebrity cameos (a specifically brilliant cameo was the John Cena addition, nice one amy), to the filthy yet horrifyingly relevant jokes spread throughout, the film is an absolute delight. As the movie goes on, it becomes more focused on the unique characters. The plot isn't anything special, neither is the camera work necessarily, but it simply doesn't matter in the end. The reason that train wreck is such a gem, is that its so brutally honest. The slight racism, strong sexism, and toilet humor blend together to make a perfect mix of laughs, ones from the belly, and ones from the mind.",

    "review": "  Amy Schumer is the funniest woman alive. Trainwreck is not just hilarious but poignant. Judd Apatow delivers as always, though moreso than his last two or three films. And while this one borrows from his past works stylistically, Amy's signature brand of humor is more prevalent than his directing presence. The Cast of SNL almun helps, as well as Lebron and Amar'e Stoudemire's scene-stealing supporting roles. Definitely evokes as much laughter as her brilliant show on Comedy Central.",

    "review": "  I will be the first one to say that I only went to see this movie because of Jenny. I have watched Amy Schumer's comedy and I have not been a fan until now. This was a great film it had everything you could want and more. I laughed, I cried, and it even made me sort of like Lebron James and everyone knows I loathe him just a little. Amy is definitely a HOT MESS but she knows it and owns it which makes you feel for her. Growing up her dad told her monogamy was not realistic and she her sister took his advice differently. Amy believed his words and made sure she never stuck to monogamy. When she meets Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) she is not happy to write an article about a sports doctor. Aaron is quirky and doesn't seem to realize what a big deal he is. He sees the best in people and is the polar opposite of Amy. The banter between Amy and Aaron is hysterical you can't stop laughing and I am pretty sure I missed some jokes between the laughter.The cast is great from Tilda Swinton as Dianna, Amy's crazy boss, John Cena as Steven, Amy's body building boy toy who might be a little gay. Brie Larson as Kim, Amy's loving sister who believes in love. Colin Quinn as Gordon, is Amy's dad who is a cranky, hysterical, and over the top. Vanessa Bayer as Nikki, Amy's best friend are just some of the amazing cast members in this movie.I loved this movie more than words that can express and I give it 5 diamonds, it was breath of fresh air and I hope to see more fun movies from Amy Schumer.",

This was a showcase not only for her talents but for Bill Hader (whose talent seems endless), Jon Cena (who knew he had any?), LeBron James (ditto), and for all the folks who had smaller parts (her family, her office staff). Because of reviews I had read, I had low expectations for the ending, but ultimately I was very happy with it! The right amount of cheeseball to make me smile and tear up. (It's a rom-com....I'm not giving away the ending.) Bravo--can't want to see what else she creates.",

    "review": "  Not since Knocked Up have I been so pleasantly surprised by a low-key comedy! Trainwreck is a fun flick with taut one-liners and strong performances. Amy Shumer brings her balls-to-the-wall, foul-mouthed comedic talent to the big screen with aplomb, and she is ably matched at every step by Bill Hader. But for me, it is the cameo-ish roles that did the trick. Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei were great in the 'movie-within-the-movie', and LeBron James was surprisingly good with his comedic timing. However, the pi�ce de r�sistance was John Cena with his random and utterly-inappropriate lines. Who knew he could be so good in a comedic role!Trainwreck is a refreshing departure from the typical toilet humour that seems to be going around, and is great for an audience that is looking for a fun ride",

A lot of the humour didn't work for me, but it worked for most of the audience, and I had more than a few genuine laughs. Honestly, I think almost everyone else was funnier than Amy, especially the celebrities like Cena and Lebron, but she had her moments. Even when it wasn't funny, it never annoyed me, which for modern comedies is saying something. It was amusing enough to pass the time, although although it never really dragged at just over 2 hours it could have been tightened up. Mild recommendation if you're up for something slightly raunchy and amusing.",

Most of the star-studded supporting cast could have been utilized better. John Cena was one of the exceptions; his performance completely surprised me and left my sides hurting. All in all, I feel like the opening three quarters of the movie deserved a better concluding quarter of the movie. The story began comically droll but strayed away from its initial formula and turned into another predictable rom-com. If you go into this movie with high expectations, you may leave disappointed.",

    "review": "  Formulaic? Well, our lead character works for a magazine and has a hard-as-nails boss. The love-interest is (mostly) passive in this relationship. And there is a Black best friend.But the formula is only a frame. What makes Apatow's films unique is that the lead women in these movies don't have quirks; they have flaws. These flawed characters make them much more interesting to watch, and the more you're interested, the easier it is to laugh with them and laugh at them.Like Bridesmaids before it, Trainwreck is about a woman whose happiness and unhappiness rest squarely in her own behavior, with very little to do with outside influences. In other words, she has no one to blame but herself for whatever pain or sadness she might experience. Schumer's writing is smart, witty, and above all, self-effacing. The supporting cast is phenomenal, with Tilda Swinton, LeBron James, and John Cena (!) turning in charismatically funny roles. I wouldn't go so far as to call Bill Hader the weakest performer, but he simply isn't asked to do very much in this movie but be a nice guy. Still, his comedic talent comes into full force with his utterance of one single word: NO!",

There are some darker undertones here and I don't mind that, but what doesn't make this the comedy of the summer is that it pretty much goes where you think it's going. The first two thirds of the movie are the best and while there are some laughs in the final third, the happy go lucky ending also gets into the way a bit. Schumer is funny, and Bill Hader is even better. Surprisingly the athletes involved in the flick, particularly the king Lebron James, is pretty dang funny. Lebron does a great job making fun of himself, and pulls off the job well. I laughed a bunch at this one, was hoping for a little more but am expecting big things from Schumer in the future.",

It was a rip off How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and totally stayed true to your classic romcom formula. Amy's character had to conform to what her beau wanted her to be and it prolonged the notion that a cool fun girl who is sexually liberated is in fact broken. You cannot be the fun cool girl, and the girl who is taken seriously and respected apparently. I really wanted Amy Schumer to step up and make us laugh rather than make a mediocre movie that didn't challenge the status quo, which she does naturally. I'd wait for this movie to come out on video, it did have some funny parts but what movie doesn't?",

So there may be a little bias here, but this movie was well written. the jokes hit well, and the performances from the two main stars were perfect. Another thing to note is Judd Apatow's direction. It seems as though he has perfected the balance of mixing a bunch of elements into his movies (meaning the 'rom-coms'). This movie will make you laugh, be sad, be happy, be angry, etc., etc. Even the athletes were funny.",

She's confident, sophisticated, cultured, intelligent, and sweet. She's even thinking of proposing-but this guy dumps her because he's a bit weirded out by the whole bodybuilder thing, and SO not ready for that kind of commitment. He's even been cheating on her, repeatedly, and doesn't apologize. We get a few is-she-a-lesbian-I-don't-know jokes in, then leave her on the curb while our main man forgets she existed.Next up, this guy visits his family. He makes fun of his niece for being interested in science at age 10, then mock his brother for marrying down.Soon, our main man meets the gal of his dreams. She's a sports doctor who treats world-famous patients and regularly headlines major magazines. She's top of her field in general medicine and surgery, and participates in medical aid initiatives in developing countries during her spare time. She's wealthy, independent, confident, kind, generous, and ready to settle down. She soon falls for our protagonist.Eventually, this guy (A) cheats on his multiple M.D. girlfriend, multiple times; (B) refuses any notion of commitment; (C) announces that he hates sports despite his girlfriend's occupation; (D) causes his girlfriend to miss a major surgery, jeopardizing her career, and refuses to apologize; and (E) is fired from his job after sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl--though it's ok, because he didn't know she was 16, and she was \"asking for it.\"He lounges around the house for weeks, drives drunk, and otherwise spirals out of control. Meanwhile the doctor is given a prestigious award for humanitarian aid.Now imagine that at the end of the movie, one day after crashing into a tree while drunk AND stoned, our main character resolves to fix his commitment issues and get back with his girlfriend in one stroke. He throws out all his booze, invites the doctor to an empty basketball stadium, and announces his intentions to recommit to the relationship.Imagine the doctor says yes.Imagine she allows herself back into this man's life. The man who cheats on everyone he dates, mocks little girls for liking science, drives while wasted, and smacks 16-year-olds around in the bedroom.Imagine all that, then reverse the genders and you have TRAINWRECK.",

Her relationship with her father plays on equal footing as that of the one with Hader (whom it's nice to see in a starring role), although both take a back seat to the brilliance of Amy herself. The film has an assured feel that comes from Schumer's hand in both the writing and portrayal of her character. It's a role she clearly knows intimately. The jokes are layered with more subtly than maybe initially noticeable and delivered well-timed by every character. It is not necessarily Apatow's normal style but does feel like a progression that he seemed to aim for in Funny People and succeeded with here. I personally cannot wait for more from any of them.",

I'll start by saying that the acting in this movie was outstanding and for Amy Schumer's big screen debut I cant imagine she could be much happier with it. I was a big fan of Bill Hader on SNL (for any SNL fans many cameos from season 40 cast) and it was nice to see him not only acting but, also acting very well. But I think that you have to give LeBron James, for the most part athletes are terrible actors, yet James gave the movie some much needed comedy, and banter between Hader's character. Now the surprise was that even though there were some fantastic comedy scenes there were many dramatic and slow parts that made you think about relationships, that were actually beautiful and refreshing from most *cough cough* all of the crappy RomCom's in the past 3 years. So in conclusion Trainwreck was a fun time that also makes you think about the modern world and modern relationships while also being funny. I'd say great for the parents and mature minds A.K.A. not for kids. A great night out. 4 stars.",

Winks at celebrity culture, bawdy sex scenes, and assured chemistry between Hader and Schumer make for a film that's everything you expected, yet so much more, and it only gets better as it goes on. Apatow's directing hasn't evolved so much in the 8 years since Knocked Up, but he's doing what he does best here, and it will make you fall in love with his crass-yet-lovable humor all over again.",

    "review": "  As far back as films there have been romantic comedies. Most nowadays are pretty standard saccharine-filled, fantasy-inspired clich�s. However, I have to give props to Amy Schumer for coming up with a romantic comedy that is totally relatable. This is definitely a movie that both men and women will love. Not to mention the fact that Amy Schumer and Bill Hader are fantastic comedic actors with brilliant delivery and heartwarming chemistry. And the fact that LeBron James plays himself and is fantastic himself is a fun surprise. Go watch this movie!",

    "review": "  In my opinion the BEST movie Apatow has directed. Funnier, smarter, and better written (thanks to Schumer's brilliant script) than any of Apatow's other offerings, many of which are already fantastic movies. Brilliantly captures the behaviors, struggles, and relationship dynamics of those afraid of intimacy in a way that was believable and hilarious in ways that don't stoop to the often cliche and overused high school level of humor that many in this genre fall back on. Can't recommend this movie more. Best comedy I've seen in decades.",

    "review": "  Manhattan journalist Amy (Schumer, who also penned the script) gets assigned a profile of a sports doctor Aaron (Hader, significantly reigned in from \"SNL\") and falls for him, making her question her morally dubious dating habits, while also dealing with her obnoxious editor (Tilda Swinton) and her ailing father (Colin Quinn, another SNL vet). While there are genuinely big laughs and Schumer makes a convincing jump from TV sketch comic to rom-com lead, the film almost feels like two movies battling it out at once: a raucous, ribald sex romp, and a more tepid dramedy with the standard story beats and unexpectedly serious life-and-death moments. This is understandable, since director Judd Apatow's other recent efforts seem to suffer from this kind of schizophrenia as well, but at the same time the tone varies from scene to scene and can be somewhat disorienting. Regardless, there are enough laughs to make it worth watching, even though Hader's vast comic abilities are scuttled and the feel-good climax doesn't mesh with what's come before. Not the wild comedy that the marketing campaign might have you believe, but all in all still worthwhile.",

    "review": "  A hilarious rom com which is something sadly you don't hear everyday these days in movies. Amy Schumer gives a tour de force comedic performance balancing humor and really strong emotional material to prove she isn't a one trick variety performer, she is a movie star. Bill Hader is also excellent show more and more depth as an actor with each film he takes on. Tilda Swinton is phenomenal as Amy's boss to the point that I want a spin off movie for her character. Brie Larson is wonderful as ever as Amy's sister and Collin Quinn really shines as Amy's father. John Cena is surprisingly hilarious as is LeBron James. Ezra Miller is really funny but a tad underused as is Vanessa Bayer. I wish we got more office scenes with Bayer, Miller, and Swinton. I would even love a spin off full length version of the movie within the movie \"The Dogwalker\" with Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei. The script is excellent and proves Schumer's writing talents are going to be some of Hollywood's best scripts within the next few years if she continues doing them (which please please please). I didn't mind the length of the movie because I loved the characters so much and was having a great time but like every Judd Apatow film, the running time started to show and wear out its steam towards the end. This is one of the best comedies of the year so far and Amy Schumer has made her case for Hollywood's next top comedic actress.",

(also, btw...Tilda Swinton is actually freakin' hot with hair and make-up for a change, great actress,but I had no idea how beautiful she is,so way to go Trainwreck). It is that perfect mix of humour and chick stuff. The ladies get to see themselves and their sisters in the film, and the guys get a few raunchy jokes (although a lot tamer and sweeter than i thought it would be). It is the perfect \"date movie\", and I wish they had gone for a \"hard-R\" instead, but overall, enjoyable,some laugh out loud moments, and a definite star-making turn for the films lead actress, who, while I am already a huge fan, proved she could carry a film like it was no biggie, and that's quite a feat for a first timer right out of the gate.

    "review": "  I love Amy Schumer. I think her brand of pointed satire is brilliant. That brilliance is crystal clear in Trainwreck. This is a good movie.Let me list the big things I think are wrong with the movie and if they don't bug you, you will love this film... The most important problem that I have is the structure. I was going to say the writing, but the truth is that Amy's writing in the bits is brilliant, but she is unskilled at stringing the bits together coherently. So there are a few clunky attempts to tie things together. Another problem, I feel that it's related to Amy's lack of structural experience, is that there are wayyyy too many cameos... It's as if Amy knows a bunch of famous people who enjoy Amy's humor and wanted to be involved in any capacity... so she wrote some bits for them. It made the storytelling convoluted and less-than-focused, which made the film seem too long. It was as if the editor was forbidden to cut any of the cameos, and some of them needed to go.The Good: Outstanding performances by Collin Quinn and Brie Larson bring a true emotional depth to the film (fell deeply in love with Larson). Another \"great\" performance was by John Cena... I say great in quotes because the character itself is a joke, and Cena plays that joke for absolutely ever single ounce of humor one would expect... stays in-character throughout.Tilda Swinton is flawless in her role. LeBron James was acceptable as LeBron James... He made me laugh. Most of his work was with Bill Hader, whom I hate... Hader was pretty good in this movie but I have to hate him, so that's all I can say about that.Amy was *exactly* what you'd expect from Amy Schumer, so if you love her, you'll be happy. I absolutely love her \"loveable loser\" humanity. I love her flawed character. I cried twice during the film, once for sad humanity and once for triumphI recommend this film.",

    "review": "  Review by Jesse Burleson of VIEWS ON FILMOK. So I've made some observations about 2015's Trainwreck (my latest review). Note to the movie itself: Bravo on the most dead-on walk of shame sequence to ever grace the silver screen. Note to LeBron James and John Cena: You guys are the top tier in your sport (NBA basketball and WWE wrestling respectively) but your acting still needs a little work. John, I'm not sure if it's the dialogue you've been saddled with or your improvised line delivery, but you come off as unfunny while everything you say seems relatively cogent. Note to Amar'e Stoudemire: You aren't really an actor either but your cameo in \"Wreck\" (with hardly any lines) outshines James and Cena profusely. I'm not saying you're Lawrence Olivier but keep up the good work. Note to the New York Knicks organization: Just because you are talked up in this flick doesn't mean we as an audience, don't know that your team is still kind of in the crapper. Finally, note to director Judd Apatow: We know you like the concept of raunchiness (you speak of it in interviews) but you need to hire a screenwriter who doesn't let said raunchy scenes get out of control while dragging on too long. People don't interact with a vulgar nature in every adult situation (especially during weddings, baby showers, and professional business meetings) and believable sex scenes don't involve one party being fully clothed. Now granted, Trainwreck is your latest release, it's gonna make a lot of money (I could tell from an opening day screening), and I give you credit for turning virtual unknowns into leading men and woman (Steve Carell, Seth Rogen, and currently, Amy Schumer). For me though, this is a mixed bag. And I shed a tear knowing that it could have been so much better.Now as a vehicle, Trainwreck involves a thirty-year old woman who sleeps around until finally finding the man of her dreams. In the cannon of Apatow's filmography, it's a step below 2007's Knocked Up and 2012's This Is 40 (both of these films were funnier, seemed like they had more of a script, and didn't strain for comic transgression). \"Wreck\" is more on par with The 40-Year-Old Virgin, an exercise that doesn't equal a movie so much as a series of drawn-out, earthy scenes. Yeah its story is more coherent but it's improv to the max and overlong (an Apatow affidavit). As for the courtship between its characters being Schumer's Amy and Bill Hader's Aaron Conners (a big time sports doctor and said dream guy), well it's simply not believable. These people are polar opposites and there's no evidence to say that they could ever function as a couple (despite giving them a two hour running time to prove it). (Spoiler Alert) oh and did I mention the ending? Well it's faintly predictable (you just knew these crazy kids would end up together). To my dismay though, I was surprised by how unique it was (just think cheerleaders dancing at Madison Square Garden). All of this in the end, doesn't negate Apatow from being Apatow. He would rather have his cast members talking like perverted sheep than showing some unadulterated emotion. He likes everything ostentatious but I wish he would just grow up.In conclusion, I was surprised by how deep Trainwreck tried to project itself (don't let the trailer fool you). This is not necessarily a comedy (especially towards the second and third act). It deals with depression, death in the family, drug use, and of course, promiscuity (which actually just occurs in the first half-hour or so). For what it's worth, Amy Schumer is the best thing going for it. Her character is real, multilayered, and has issues. Her performance here deserves a better movie, one with an actual script and not ad libs. As an actress, she's likable, strangely attractive, and backed up with some good supporting work (Brie Larson as Amy's sister, acts with her eyes, and as usual, is solid). However, this numbing movie is indeed, a \"trainwreck\". Apatow like in Knocked Up (remember the scene a la a baby coming out of the womb), wants to gross you out with close-ups of someone getting stitches and a flask knee getting operating on graphically (to the Billy Joel jam, \"Uptown Girl\"). He's the frat boy version of John Waters, a real jester.Of note: Trainwreck didn't pulverize me with its negligible, comedic vibe but I chuckled threefold. You have Amy Schumer's narration which is unconventional in a sense yet totally humorous. There's also a cameo-laden sequence involving Matthew Broderick, Chris Evert, and Marv Albert. It had to do with some sort of intervention (Evert says the word c**kblocker, I'm not kidding). Finally, look for a scene where Aims walks on a treadmill and has her body type plastered via a large computer screen. It's crazy sexy cool and sort of reinvents the whole \"Hitler\" strut (I felt squeamish but still laughed nervously).",

    "review": "  Trainwreck was directed by Judd Apatow and that alone stands for = Good Movie. The other aspect that made this a good movie was that Amy Schumer was hilarious and the situations and lines delivered in the film were great. It was raunchy, sweet, touching and combined the perfect amount of funny with a heart felt story. There was a slew of athletes and other fairly well known actors in the film so there was always a little surprise around every corner. Most Apatow movies have sentimental moments but Trainwreck I would argue is the biggest tearjerker yet. The connection between the 2 main characters was great and that bond really shined through all the way up to the final, rather amazing scene. If you want to laugh at a raunchy comedy you can't go wrong with this one, but if you also want a touching love story don't pass this over at the theatre.",

The perfect complement to director Judd Apatow who litters his tales with dirty words and sex but is actually as innocuous as a Kate Hudson rom-com from the last decade. In fact, I would argue that BRIDE WARS has a more cutting and daring message to deliver than TRAINWRECK or any of Schumer's or Apatow's work. Pile on to that, TRAINWRECK is simply too long, lethargic, and just not very funny. And perhaps worse than anything, poor Brie Larson, who is quite the actress, is here relegated to playing the sister/homemaker with no bite or attitude. TRAINWRECK just made me feel sad in an unintentional bad way.",

I usually don't do this in my reviews but I want to address the negatives first because i only had one problem with the movie. That one problem, that Train Wreck's final act was much less bold and entertaining as the first two. The final act ends the movie on a high but extremely predictable note which sucks because this is one of my favorite comedies of the year and i was hoping to give it an A+.Now on to the positives. Amy Schumer! Amy Schumer! Amy Schumer! She is brilliant in every which way in this movie. As a writer she made the script a perfect about of sharp, lethal and above all hilarious humor and enough dramatic depth to stay afloat. This script foxed me with a twist I saw coming from the beginning but was done with such fineness that made it so sudden when it happened. Amy Schumer excels in her portrayal as Amy, the sex crazy, commitment fearing girl she was raised to be. This top notch performance is matched by Bill Halder's Aaron, sports doctor, with often times hilarious results.Train wreck boasts enough top notch dark and light comedy to please a wide audience and I strongly recommend seeing this movie. Train Wreck gets a A- or an 8/10.",

    "review": "  Many short comedy sketches by Amy Schumer inserted to a full length movie script. Vulgar, understated, ridiculous, sarcastic, ingenious fun.4.5 starsI confess I look at critic ratings prior to seeing movies, expecially ones that aren't out yet. I saw Trainwreck garnered high 90 percents from the critics on Rotten Tomatoes which really surprised me so I was interested. The cover looks like Bridesmaids and the Hangover had a baby and that's somewhat accurate. What I didn't know going in was that the protagonist has starred in her own Comedy Central show for two years. In fact, she's been on Ellen and spurred viral footage of her riffing and making Ellen snort she's so funny. I think it would help for people to know she is an established comedy commodity with a distinctive vulgar and often understated style. Without that knowledge, one could make the mistake of thinking it's just another sex and puke comedy dangled before primal eyes.Maybe that alone will work for most viewers. We've been so inundated with gross films in the last 20 years for which audiences show their love through ticket sales. As for me, I think if I didn't know of Miss Schumer's notoriety and idiosyncratic style, I might has scoffed through most the movie. As is was, I enjoyed watching her brand of humor for a couple hours. Speaking of hours, there were some scenes about 3/4 of the way through when she and her boyfroend, Bill Hader, start fighting like a married couple where the film truly dragged for me. It's for those scenes as well as unnecessary penetration scenes that didn't add to the comedic lines for me. In other words, the writers didn't have to stoop that low to relate with the audience. That a; having been said, I found this film a hoot to be sure. My wife and I were in tears during the sex scene with John Cena. He's the perfect hunk to demonstrate what talking dirty is not.",

Some people believe it's the funniest film of all time and some think it's the best comedy of this decade so far but I would have to disagree with them. The film is funny but it's not gut busting laughing. The laughs are more of a chuckle. The acting is great everyone played their part very well. Amy Schumer wrote this film and I think she did a great job for writing this film. The chemistry between her and Bill Hader is great. Also this is probably Judd Apatow's best film since 40 Year Old Virgin. The film is more of a chick flick but there are some chick flicks that I thought were funnier than this film like Bridesmaids. Also this could be a great date film for couples. I do find this film way overhyped and probably one of the most overrated films so far this year.

    "review": "  I have not laughed so hard at a movie for a long time. The entire audience was laughing along with me. This everywoman speaks the things women usually keep to themselves. The story line was a little uneven and could use some editing, but it is a bravo first movie from Amy. I can't wait to see more. I will just have to be content to view her old tv shows from the beginning. Love her!",
