The picture's excessively tedious opening 45 minutes, coupled with an overwritten, gimmicky narrative and an unfocused script that overemphasizes certain elements while slighting others, make it painful to endure, trying the patience of even the most stalwart moviegoer. Wait for this one to come to cable.",

    "review": "  + \"The Lady in the Van\" stars Maggie Smith in a trifle English story that has one of the longest drawn out endings I can recall in a long time and the movie is only 103 minutes! She plays a curmudgeon recreating the role she performed on stage written by Alan Bennett who also wrote this screenplay.The story is of an old woman who lives in a van, parking the vehicle in the driveway of the author. Alex Jennings plays the author and his alter ego who fight over art versus life which presents a distraction throughout the film.The film opens with a loud crash on a black screen and then seeing the window of the van cracked and bloody. Little by little we find out who this homeless, aimless lady was and what brought her to this point in her life. We, also, find out about the crash which really adds nothing to the story but does add to the running time as does a piano concert scene.The supporting players are all excellent English actors who add a touch of class including Jim Broadbent, Frances De La Tour, Deborah Findlay, James Corden and Roger Allam.\"The Lady in the Van\" certainly must have been better in the theatre and this film is only for truly devoted Maggie Smith fans.",

Shepherd's past is shrouded in mystery and one day she pulls up into a middle class street in a suburb in London and decides that is going to be her place to settle and subjecting the local residents to her unwelcome company in the process. One of those residents is real life author and playwright, Alan Bennett (played by Alex Jennings) whose mundane life is turned upside down when she makes his driveway a permanent fixture for her four wheeled dwelling.The film is supported with a host of British talent from the big and small screen with the likes of Jim Broadbent (Hot Fuzz) and and Frances De La Tour (best known for playing Miss Jones in the 70's sitcom Rising Damp). And this is a very British film, mingling the subject of class with a great deal of pathos and dry humour which Bennett's work is synonymous with.The screening I went to was packed with people from what I like to call the \"Silver Dollar\" crowd and the inclusion of Maggie Smith will certainly draw them in. However this is a both a moving and touching story as we see the love/hate relationship between Shepherd and Bennett grow and the mystery surrounding Miss Shepherd unravel as the story unfolds.",

So instead, I am going to praise the rather amazing Alex Jennings who plays him. The film script opens up the story by having 2 Bennetts talk to each other. It is an intriguing and effective narrative device that not only delivers some of the best lines in the film, but also avoids having him talk to himself in an artificial and somewhat theatrical manner and we get so much more from this inverted monologue as to who Bennett is: as an insecure writer, a closeted son caring for his mother and a compassionate person who just wants to help. Add on a few \"Historical\" cameos and a bittersweet ending that is befitting the lady in question, you get a cozy and often thoughtful film that verges on sentimentality but never dwells on it.",

    "review": "  To say that Maggie Smith is like a quiet hurricane in this is an understatement, she shines as the cantankerous old lady in that van. Her backstory is drip fed to the audience and its not until the final scene you know why she is living the life she does, although some of you would've already guessed. It is a film that I will probably only watch the once as it does end bittersweet, but that's not to say there aren't any funny moments, there are and it doesn't resort to American Pie style gross out gags. Its a great film that has some poignant moments but it is a film to watch the once. I'm sure it will be nominated for a lot of Best Actress awards though and maybe a nod for Alex Jennings as he does play a good role as Alan Bennett.",
