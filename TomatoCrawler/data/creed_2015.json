    "review": "  Nostalgia has crept into a lot of films lately. In 2015 alone, we've revisited Bond (for the 24th time) in Spectre, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is now the 5th film spawned from the 60's TV show, Mad Max was rebooted with Fury Road, Jurassic World and Star Wars: A Force Awakens tapped into the magic and excitement of their predecessors and now Ryan Cooglar's Creed is a revisit to the boxing gyms of Philadelphia and has much in common with the original Rocky of 1976. Yes, it's hard to believe but it's been 40 years since Balboa first had us on the edge of our seats and punching the air with delight. Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) has had a troubled youth and always forced to fight his corner in juvenile correction facilities. When he learns that his late father was World Heavyweight Champion, Apollo Creed, Adonis decides he wants to go into boxing himself. With no-on-one to train him, though, Adonis heads to Philadelphia to seek the mentorship of his late father's friend, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone).Let's face it, Creed was always going to be a bit of a gamble. Some people had written it off before it had even arrived but Ryan Cooglar and Michael B. Jordan's follow-up to the brilliant Fruitvale Station is a gamble that pays off. For a start, Jordan is a very talented and charismatic actor who has a magnetic presence while Cooglar manages to put his own stamp on the proceedings, considering he's essentially retreading old ground. A huge helping hand comes from the man himself, though; Stallone reprising his most iconic role is a real treat and it's not just for nostalgia reasons. Sly is genuinely very good here. He's not normally credited with strong performances but when he's going against his tough guy persona - like he did in Cop Land - it just shows how well he can fit that type of role and that's exactly what he does again. It's the first film to feature Rocky that hasn't been written by Stallone himself but Cooglar and co-writer Aaron Covington seamlessly manage to capture Stallone's flavour for the character. Rocky is now older, slower and more vulnerable and Stallone has no problem displaying and embracing this vulnerability. As mentioned, it isn't really anything new. We've seen, done and wore the gloves before but that's even more of a testament to Jordan, Stallone and especially Cooglar for making this work. The fact that he goes back to making it more story and character-based and less about the pugilism adds a much needed freshness to the franchise and the bouts in the ring that we do see are very impressively handled. They're frantically involving as Maryse Alberti's camera dances around the ring as much as the actors and every crunching blow makes you feel more like a participant and less of an observer - It's also an added bonus that the unashamed, flag waving jingoism that was so prominent in the Rocky sequels is toned down somewhat.Albeit from another character, this very much looks like the continuation of the franchise and it's off to a good start. The only problem now is whether they can find the material to keep it from becoming stale. For the moment, though, Creed can certainly handle itself. Mark Walker",

    "review": "  Coogler does an amazing job (his direction is excellent, especially in the boxing scenes) to tell this story that, though too familiar in its structure, echoes beautifully that of Rocky Balboa in his films and benefits mostly from the relationship developed between him and Apollo Creed's son, with Stallone in a wonderful, sensitive performance.",

    "review": "  Creed is a crowd-pleaser, an effective character drama, and a rewarding continuation into the Rocky franchise that brings greater relevancy to Sylvester Stallone's acting muscles. Thanks to the talents of co-writer/director Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station) and star Michael B. Jordan, the franchise is given new life by mostly following the same tried-and-true underdog formula that Stallone helped cement long ago. Jordan plays Adonis Creed, the illegitimate son to the deceased boxing legend, and he wants to make his way on his own merits. Adonis tracks Rocky (Stallone) down and convinces him to be his trainer, and the two build a father-son relationship supplying the half the other was sorely missing. From there the plot is fairly predictable as the media discovers Adonis' identity and he's fast-tracked for a high-profile bout with the outgoing champ but the movie still hits the right notes to earn its emotional triumph. I was surprised at the careful attention Coogler gave his supporting characters, providing details to round them out and make them feel like legitimate people rather than stock roles. I enjoyed Tessa Thompson (Dear White People) being an actual character rather than an underdeveloped love interest. Coogler's fluidity with the camera is also striking, and many of the boxing matches are filmed in long tracking shots that amp up the sports verisimilitude. Jordan gives a strongly felt performance that further confirms his star status. The real surprise is Stallone, whose legendary fighter is starting to break down physically. Rocky's inability to fight an invisible enemy makes for great drama, and Stallone sinks into the meaty dialogue. He has a few genuinely affecting moments, and I didn't even know Stallone was still capable of that. Easily the best Rocky sequel, Creed is an uplifting underdog tale that doesn't reinvent the formula but brings added attention, reverence, and sincerity to a whole lot of punching people in the face.Nate's Grade: B+",

    "review": "  Does it pass down the torch? Yes. Does it share similarities with the original \"Rocky\" film? Yes. Does this film stand on it's own? Absolutely! \"Creed\" follows the son of the late Apollo Creed as he hunts down Rocky Balboa to train him. In hopes to continue his fathers legacy while still maintaining his own name, young Adonis Creed will do whatever it takes to get into the ring. As he meets a young girl along the way, you completely buy into their connection and you never once think that it feels forced. This film is essentially about fighting for your name, but at its core it really is a release from the \"Rocky\" films and an introduction into the new generation. Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan share amazing chemistry, bringing me to tears on multiple occasions. \"Creed\" is easily one of the best entries in the franchise, even comparable to the original. With a great script, incredible performances, a story worthy of the title, and direction that puts you in the front row, \"Creed\" is fantastic! If I had one complaint, it would be that it might just share a few too similarities to the first film. By the end of the film I felt I was just accepting the conclusion. In the end, I loved this film from start to finish and I recommend seeing it in the theatres for the full experience. Terrific!",

    "review": "  Creed certainly has things going for it: the performances are mostly solid (though I don't think Stallone is Oscar worthy in this by any means), the cinematography is excellent, and the overall concept of the story is excellent. However, Creed really suffers from its execution. And no, I am not going to criticize this movie for sharing similar elements to the original Rocky. That isn't the problem for me.The problem lies in the fact that Creed's script feels filled with unfocused themes, unexplored plot lines, and new characters that aren't all that interesting. The movie seems to know what its main theme is by the end, but it seems so unsure of itself throughout the majority of its runtime that I found myself just not caring that much by the end. And ultimately, the movie didn't focus on the characters enough for me to really care. As a result, Creed left me incredibly disappointed.It's by no means terrible, and there is certainly enjoyment to be had. But a great movie, Creed certainly is not.",

    "review": "  DEAR FIGHT PEOPLE - My Review of CREED (4 Stars)I went into the most recent ROCKY movie, CREED, with the same trepidation I've felt since ROCKY II. Would I be in for another round of cornball inspiration or would this one finally be the version to equal or top the original? It's a roll of the dice I wasn't all that interested in taking, but I'm so glad I did, because CREED is surprisingly wonderful. This, despite the fact that the film ladles on the cheese with extra dollops. Maybe it's the fact that director Ryan Coogler (FRUITVALE STATION) and his co-writer Aaron Covington took over the writing responsibilities from Sylvester Stallone and added incredibly fresh, lived-in direction, but the results make this my favorite ROCKY movie since the first. Michael B. Jordan, who starred in Coogler's prior film, plays Adonis Creed, son to Apollo, Rocky's biggest opponent. An angry child who finds himself in constant trouble, he grows up wanting to be a fighter like the father he never met. Unable to secure a trainer to take him on in LA, Adonis, of course, heads off for Philadelphia to seek the assistance of none other than the Italian Stallion. Retired and happily managing his restaurant, Rocky wants nothing to do with the fight world, but damn if Adonis isn't one persistent man. Dare I say it? He's got the eye of the tiger! So the question remains, will Rocky help Adonis capture the title or say no and just go about his life? Would it be spoiling things to say which way this goes?I'm making this all sound sillier than it really is, because the filmmaker's imbue this story with such grace, capturing the scrappy, blue collar world that got lost in the many sequels. ROCKY BALBOA came close to returning to its roots, but Coogler has such wonderful visual chops, aided greatly by his cinematographer, Maryse Alberti (THE FIGHTER), and additionally gives us a ROCKY movie where we care so much about every character. Jordan clearly dedicated himself physically to this role and his approach to his character allows for Adonis' many flaws to come to the surface. I wish he had brought more humor to the proceedings, but constantly pushing himself to his limits, so there's not a lot of time for jokes. Stallone, however, brings humor and such gravity to his aged fighter, slipping into the Burgess Meredith role here and winning our hearts all over again. The way Stallone can deliver a speech in his patented deep, palooka-like monotone and get to the heart of the line, to the humanity, is astounding here. It's early, but I'm going out on a limb to say Stallone should start practicing his Oscar acceptance speech. For me, this wouldn't be the sentimental favorite award, it would be in honor of a truly great screen performance. Their co-star, Tess Thompson (DEAR WHITE PEOPLE, SELMA) delivers a charming performance as Adonis' downstairs neighbor, a singer who is slowly losing her ability to hear. Refusing to be relegated to \"the girl\" role, her Bianca is as much of a fighter as the two men. Ultimately, this is a story about fighting for your survival and leaning on your chosen family to accomplish that. So yes, it's your standard ROCKY crap, but it's done with such conviction, such visual skill, that there's no choice but to surrender to its many charms. Let's start with that great training montage. Creating an iconic shot of its own without having to resort to the run up the stairs of the Philadelphia Museum of Art (don't worry, they make an appearance), Coogler chases Adonis up a street, escorted by his supporters on various types of motorcycles. Popping wheelies in slo-mo as Adonis runs, I rolled by eyes, until they stop in front of a location to pay their respects. I won't give anything away here except to say Coogler turned cheddar into brie in this wonderful moment. Also astounding is a single take fight sequence that feels impactful, exciting, and puts the audience right in the ring with the boxers. It's a thrilling accomplishment, the camera hitting each character at the precisely right time. Also, Coogler enjoys a good slo-mo, smoke-filled entrance or two, because he has the right panache for this type of spectacle. Sure, the film takes many maudlin, melodramatic turns, some of which brought tears to my eyes, and it's because the actors fully commit. By the time the familiar opening strains of the ROCKY THEME hit, the audience I sat with cheered. CREED hits all of the right nostalgia buttons while updating the saga, passing the torch to very capable hands. In doing so, we've been given one of the year's better films.",

    "review": "  Creed is a masterful film that succeeds in being a perfect revisit into the Rocky franchise and being one of the years best movies. Ryan Coogler flaweless directs this film with a realistic and fresh view into Philadelphia. He hits every emotional chord by cutting to the core of every Rocky fan such as myself, bringing both the old and new characters to life. Michael B. Jordan brings every bit of raw power and charisma to the character of Adonis Creed. His performance only further proves he is one of the best young talents currently in the business and is absolutely leading man material. I found myself loving Adonis and his journey to glory, as he is an underdog who despite his life of fighting and troubles has stayed a good man. Sylvester Stallone gives a spectacular performance in the film as he returns to his iconic Rocky Balboa. Stallone still acts as a mentor and a hero to both Adonis and to the audience, as he once again pulls us into his world. His heartwrenching and emotional performance is Oscar caliber, as he gives us an old man we all know and love and shows him as broken as he has ever been. Stallone and Jordans chemistry and relationship in the film is the films high point, as its a father-son like relationship that will bring a tear to any Rocky fan. There was a particular boxing scene in the film that looks like it was filmed in one shot, and my jaw was dropped throughout. Coogler showed me he is a talented director with Fruitvale Station, but his second film Creed is such a triumphant picture that I believe he could go on to be one of the best directors in the business. I watched this movie and loved every second of it. Creed is a masterpiece in my opinion for what it tries to accomplish, and I will likely go and watch it several more times.",

    "review": "  Rather than put audiences between Rocky and a hard place, winning combo Creed brilliantly plays out as one of the best and freshest chapters in the storied sports franchise. What's most amazing is the continuing development of an older Italian Stallion into a complex evolving mentor figure even after he's given up the titular mantle. Reverential to the past with a dynamite new fight story all on its own, Creed pits a new unlikely underdog and his trainer on the hard knocks road to a title fight. The whipsmart result brings you to your feet almost as much as 1976's Rocky, the classic that put us all in this fight. Oh, predictability rears its punch-drunk head at times and females get underserved, but not nearly enough to throw in the towel. On the contrary, this is a rare film about legacy that beautifully honors and extends its own. In this PG-13-rated sports drama, former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa (Stallone) serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson (Jordan), the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed. If Mad Max Fury Road and Jurassic World proved anything this year, it's - with the right vision and creative minds -it's better to continue a known franchise than start from scratch with an uninspired reboot (Poltergeist). Thankfully, Creed doesn't throw out the Balboa with the bath water. In fact, Ryan Coogler finds fascinating new depths for the simple Philadelphia fighter. More than proving that he wasn't just a one-shot pony after his harrowing feted drama Fruitville Station, the writer-director advances the game of the iconic character while charting the riveting course for his prot�g�. With Rocky Balboa, Stallone conceived a warm epilogue for the series, signing off Balboa's fighting career on a high note, complete with a new status as widower keeping his beloved's memory alive by running a restaurant under her name, Adrian's. Coogler, however, uses this as an awesome jumping off point, offering up the palooka as benevolent elder statesman. With Jordan's Adonis Creed, he gives us a new hero worth rooting for while still cheering for the old hero. You get on your feet for the performances as well, especially Stallone in a career highlight that's surely due an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Bottom line: Gonna Fly and How",

    "review": "  It's easy to forget that the original Rocky was a masterpiece. A couple of terrible sequels will do that to popular perceptions. This also happened with Sylvester Stallone's other signature character Rambo, which had a truly excellent original thriller and weak, silly sequels. But I like to assert that there was great value in the character of Rocky Balboa and there were some later installments that did work. Rocky II and III were fun, above average efforts that handled character development in a way most mainstream franchises these days seem incapable of accomplishing. And sure IV and V were steaming pieces of garbage, but Rocky Balboa (2006) redeemed the character in a realistic and endearing turn. So a spin-off using an entirely new character may seem totally unnecessary. So why is this movie so damn good? Creed (no, not the crappy post-grunge band) centers around the son of Apollo Creed, Adonis, as he tries to hack out his destiny in the arena. Along the way, an older Rocky Balboa takes him on as an apprentice, serving as his Obi-Wan Kenobi like mentor. Both form a bond and learn to keep fighting in the face of tough odds. Creed doesn't break any mold, but it manages to fill it quite well, delivering a hard hitting but sentimental movie that both Rocky fans and general audiences will enjoy. Michael B. Jordan comes into his own as a leading man, proving that Hollywood really needs to start putting more diverse actors in roles such as these. He has the right amount of likeability and charisma that made Rocky such a relatable character in the original film. He commits fully and deserves credit for not using a body double during production, receiving all the punishment himself. Sylvester Stallone reminds us that yes, he can act. Old Sly provides much of the humor and light-hearted-ness of many scenes, while bringing a special type of gravitas to the film. This is a character that has grown immensely over the years, graduated from the school of hard knocks, and has much wisdom to offer to our protagonist. But what makes the picture exceptional is the back and forth between the two. There are funny moments as I mentioned before, but there are also touching and bittersweet scenes as well - on par with any awards season material this year. Creed is well directed and edited with Ryan Coogler accomplishing a masterful job helming his first large film with precision. The fight scenes are brutal and skillfully choreographed. The camera work is impressive, often revolving around the action and seemingly in one take. The final fight scene in particular, bears much in common with the climatic showdown at the end of the original film. In fact, I was quite impressed how reverential Creed was in relation to the rest of the franchise, treating all the previous movies as canon, even the bad ones. Furthermore, while these are used as background, they are not exploited or rehashed as one might expect. The love interest for the main character was completely tacked on and unnecessary and proves to be the sole weakness. So yes, you need to see this film. It is, in my opinion, the best since Rocky III, a good start to a new spin-off franchise, and one of the best dramas of the year. It goes the distance.",

    "review": "  Too often Hollywood falls into a rut when it involves some of its most famous franchises (Terminator comes to mind first) by keeping its aging star at the forefront of future movies it produces. In a complete about face, Creed levels that trend with an emotional, yet believable rise of a new young boxer played by the true star of the movie, Michael B Jordan.Rocky Balboa was truthfully a movie that didn't make any sense yet still allowed the character to have his day in the spotlight once again. Move over Sylvester Stallone. Passing off the \"Rocky\" franchise to Apollo Creed's illegitimate son Adonis was a near flawless way to continue making these movies. That being said, I don't necessarily think they need ANOTHER one, but you should definitely expect it this day and age with all the remakes and reboots and sequels we see.Let's start with Sly. He delivered his best performance at this age in this movie. Hands down. While nothing about it screams Oscar-worthy, it's the most relaxed and at home in the 'Rocky' role he's been in since he started making them. This is the tale of coming full circle you want to see from someone as beloved across the movie community as Rocky is. For a guy who lost just about everything near and dear to him, it was incredibly easy to empathize with the character throughout the movie when some major decisions force his hand late in the film.Jordan was fit, fast and loose as Adonis. We get a bit of a rushed look into his upbringing that gives you the basics on why he wants to be a fighter, but even with the fast tutorial on his younger years, that's easy to overlook as a small nuisance by kicking things off fast and heavy after the time jump to his 20s where the bulk of the film takes place. Jordan and director Ryan Coogler did Fruitvale Station together. Their chemistry is easily seen.The love interest, played by Tessa Thompson, came off as organic and believable. There's a subtle contrast between her approach to music and Jordan's approach to boxing. While it's no \"Adriaaaaan\" kind of relationship, it does the job.My only other knock on the film was the opposing fighters. The first big fight was well done. In fact, probably done better than the final fight. Though it was shorter, it had more pop. That's not to say the second (and main) fight was bad...it lacked that same ferocity in the buildup. And that has everything to do with the guy he was fighting who looked NOTHING like a boxer. There was a great knockout in that final fight that knocks you back in your seat, but aside from that, getting someone who looked the part (and a little more imposing) would have helped.Creed is a standout sports film that does everything you want from an up-and-comer. The film rises with its star character and is anchored by its veteran. If they made another, would I be surprised? No. Am I looking for it in a year or two or three? No. Would I take it? If it was anything like this...absolutely.",

    "review": "  Creed has all the ingredients you'd expect from a Rocky film with a few twists and turns along the way. Strong, consistent performances are delivered cast wide. Sylvester Stallone brings the pathos, Tessa Thompson gives us a developed, three dimensional, love interest (for Johnson) whilst the highly effective Anthony Bellew proves more than just a dynamic match for Michael B.Jordan's sulky Adonis Johnson. It's unlikely to be the last in the saga but the platform is rebuilt with solid foundations for future offerings.",

Tonally it does find itself a little stranded, not quite brave enough to tell an honest urban tale of Creed's story and not quite cheesey enough to go full Rocky. It still is fun though, if a tad simplistic and the fight scenes are great...who has a title fight at Goodison Park though?!? What a dump!",

    "review": "  After watched Rocky 4, 5 and 6 I felt the franchise was falling flat and it appeared to be pretty much down and out to me. Yes, Rocky 6 has got decent reviews but personally I think it's overrated. Creed brings a new director (Ryan Coogler) and new writers (Coogler and Aaron Lovington with input from Stallone) and with it comes a fresh pair of eyes.We see Michael B. Jordan introduced into the franchise as Adonis Johnson who leaves his day job to box full time. He goes under the name Johnson to stay under the radar and more importantly out of his great Dad's shadow but he soon learn that he needs to embrace the Creed name rather than ignore it. This film also sees Rocky (Stallone) play the trainer role similarly to Rocky V but with much better results. Stallone is on top form and I feel the Golden Globe was well deserved.This film is absolute electric, it has a great tension and determination. You feel like you are part of every step of the journey and it is truly captivating. The character's have great chemistry and above all the story feels real, it feels credible. Which is more than what can be said of Rocky 4 and 6 in my opinion. Also this brings the Rocky franchise to a whole new audience who may not have seen the original films so this can only be a good thing to bring awareness to the original films which were so great and started the ball rolling.The Rocky franchise, back with a knock-out blow!",

    "review": "  The night had finally come - it was a really long hard day: waking up 4.30 AM, flying out to a business meeting, knowing that I had a hard fight ahead of me that night - the highly praised return of the Rocky franchise: Creed. I will right get into spoilers - so please stop reading if you still planning to watch it.After coming out of the theater, I had a content grin on my face - I think it is fair to say: I was happy. Because this film really ends up making you feel good - Baby Creed ends up not being a failure and Rocky has found a new meaning in life and has a new member in the family. All good, right ? Well, yes sort of - I will confess I am probably one of the biggest Rocky fans there is on the planet; I have watched Rocky IV about 253 times, I have used the Rocky IV montages for many many workouts (and I still have Hearts on Fire and No Easy Way Out on my workout playlist) - and every now and then I watch either one of the final fight scenes on Youtube (in case you want to do the same, here is a little compilation):Admittedly, my love for the Rocky saga has no logical reasoning, the movies end up becoming sort of dumb and the fight scenes are everything but realistic but who cares: THEY ARE AWESOME!Now, why am rambling on about Rocky so much - probably I wanted this movie to take me back to the good old times. I wanted to shed a man tear like every time when Rocky says:Yo, Adrian I did it!To a certain extent, the movie does a great job in all the right places. It builds up an interesting new story line about Apollo Creed's son - who doesn't have this super cliche story - but actually is street kid from a foster home who has turned into a rich boy who can't help but shed his inner fighter. Despite all good advice he wants to give boxing a shot and who else the man himself could teach him what it takes - and also here the movie just does a wonderful of job of introducing Rocky into Adonis' life. And Stallone has aged his character beautifully; he has created his routine in which both Paulie and Adriane are still part of his life and it is just really endearing to watch. Rocky is still a simple man and everyone just absolutely loves him. Their chemistry works really well - and the film hits the drama tones as well as the more comedic tones really well.Adonis: It's already up in the CloudRocky: Which CloudAlso the love interest of Adonis is in fact a pretty interesting and solid character - and their relationship is refreshingly unclichee - so well bravo on that too. So in nutshell, this movie did in fact do all the things a good movie needs to do:Introduce new and interesting into the existing Rocky universeDon't take itself too seriousStay true to its rootsNow, let's get to what makes a great Rocky movie; let's be honest here - we all live and die for Rocky when he is either running up the stairs or mountains and/or when we are in the 3rd or 15th round and it is all about the final punch. So this factor needs to be heavily accounted for when judging a Rocky movie. Also here Creed actually delivers some really decent Training montages with Adonis journey to becoming the next Creed - the film heavily borrows from its predecessors but that's ok because ultimately it doesn't really copy but pays tribute to the originals. And when it comes to the fight scenes it actually surpasses the originals by a landslide - camera work, pacing, drama are all perfectly balanced. So also here all checks in the boxes are basically fulfilled:Training montage - CHECKDrama in the ring - CHECKGreat fight choreography - CHECKStill, when I walked out of the theatre despite absolutely loving the Rocky franchise, I did not carry the Rocky enthusiasm with me - which basically means I didn't run up the stairs, didn't sign up for a new gym membership BUT I did a shed a little mantear in Adonis' final words. The reason for my \"lack\" of excitement was probably that I love the Rocky franchise so much, that it is up on a pedestal of my childhood memories and I won't allow anything to even remotely touch it - and that's ok. Still, this was a great reboot of the Rocky franchise and Michael B.Jordan is a champion who really deserves his shot at the title of becoming the Rocky of this generation.",

So then, I started wondering where the the \"Liverpool scenes were filmed. I asked myself, is it possible the producers were too cheap to fly to Liverpool? Well, it turns out, they were too cheap to film anything in England. I surmised, from the ending credits that the \"Liverpool\" scenes were done in Georgia. This production gaffe, really let me down.

    "review": "  As we reach towards the end of the year 2015, the year's entertainment, film- and television-wise, has some portals that goes back to the respective original's glory while the portal's path is like a nostalgic vibe to feel the original's atmospheric prime. The anticipation for \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" goes back to the original in 1977, and \"Jurassic World\" goes back to \"Jurassic Park\". Those are just to tell a few as they'd gained the cultural following over the years, including newer generations to experience what their parents and grandparents felt (i.e. including \"The Peanuts Movie\"). Now, spawned from the 1976 Academy Award for Best Picture winner \"Rocky\", \"Creed\" comes for the exact scenario when it comes to build up a past legacy whilst going ultimately back to the first punch.The \"Rocky\" franchise examined the life of an everyman going the distance and facing obstacles as he fights for, and lives, the title of professional boxing, at wide recognition, with the challenges of the ups and downs in life. Apollo Creed gave Rocky Balboa an invite to rise to the distance next to him in a match, and Rocky went slacking off with the fame and fortune he'd been receiving after being recognized from his match with a Heavyweight Champion. The do-over button was pressed by Apollo asking for a rematch, and Rocky gain his title, as well the title of being a father. His celebrity status continues on even when losing his title but later regain it when he fought for his fallen trainer Mickey. Rocky then later went for the ultimate to give up his title just to avenge his friend's death for not ending the fight with the Soviet fighter Drago by fighting him in a Cold War match. Him going that much of the distance and gaining that victory weakened him at his head, and came back to his roots after a total financial mishap that costed his fortune. Retired and started to train, but being a trainer was affecting his relationship with his son. Retired from fighting and training, Rocky spent the rest of his time by owning a restaurant under his late wife's name, Adrian. He briefly went back for an exhibition match to prove one last time that he still got it despite his advanced age. Afterwards, he settles on from there with a relaxing life of an everyman still.The point of reviewing back Rocky's story is that the latest installment, being a sequel to the homage film in 2006, went for the sensitive touch to what Rocky had been through and what he has left to do under his legacy by taking on one last fight for himself while training a family friend with what he'd learned from going the distance and building up your own legacy. But this time, Rocky sits back to be the supportive character. This time, as it says on the title, his late friend Apollo's blood carries on in a fresh fighter who seems to have the same vision of life as Rocky's whilst not wanting to waste the blood of a Creed.\"Creed\" goes on to the other side of the coin between the best of rivals-turned-friends that'd built up Rocky's legacy. Spawned from a revealed affair, Adonis \"Donnie\" Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) has fighting in his blood from the father he'd never met since he was born after he died. Donnie wants to pursue his dream of professional boxing, but his adoptive, widowed mother Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rahad) is against it after what happened to her husband 30 years earlier. Now going nowhere in Los Angeles, Donnie moves to Philadelphia to kick start his dream with the help of his father's old rival-turned-friend, Rocky Balboa. With Donnie's strength and determination to go the distance that Rocky understands and sees it as the same as his old friend, he decided to train him.The \"Fruitvale Station\" director Ryan Coogler takes the \"Rocky\" franchise back to the original's glory with the modern art and spirit of cinema - particularly the cinematography - in comparison to the 1976 Best Picture winner (if I'd known that specific thought, I would've watched \"Rocky\" before \"Creed\") within the same taste of inspiring emotions of a sports drama with a little extra weight. \"Creed\" met the uplifting structure used in \"Rocky\" with the helpful elements and developments but in its own way that seems to make this the best of the series. Contributing to both glories of the current bookends is the excellent, probably definitive soundtrack heightened the former's power with certain familiar cues sporadically. Adjacent to that aspect, the film did well to the emotions it'd played out from the performances lifting the weights, especially pitting Rocky to be reached with sensitive talks.Further on the parallel-ness between the two is the level of the performances and the respective characters' relationship of the trainee and his trainer. Clarifying that thought, Sylvester Stallone's character is in a similar role as his late co-star's character Burgess Meredith as Rocky's late trainer, with similar developments, and techniques, spanning the first three films. Stallone's performance is his probable best, and agreeable on being the contender for Best Supporting Actor. Now for Michael B. Jordan, who was given the rise to stardom from \"Fruitvale\", felt his character's own independence yet performed the same as Stallone did as his character: taking the punches if possible and letting the makeup department mark the violent marks of the match (if that how it was done). Just like most dramas with high and strong energy, the main star give it all and Jordan did that. Although, not enough to meet the nominating standards like his co-star since the competition of other actors filled up the void (same goes for the film itself of its respective category if didn't go to the distance enough to be nominated), his performance is his probable best as well when next to the strength of his breakthrough.\"Creed\" is definitely in my top ten with its power and value coming from Ryan Coogler's masterful, yet faithful (considering going back to the glory days and roots) direction and the cast's performances to make a strong entertaining film in the prime fashion of the original (hopefully it doesn't include going for more rounds to lessen the remaining amount of the strength, even though the character's arc and the dynamics are appealing and would be pleasant at the sight if not going for the exact storyline structure). You'd find this sports drama generally enjoyable by its qualities when treating it as a regular film than its connection with the previous installments, but excitement of pleasant sighting would be an added weight if you've seen the other films and understand more of the emotions. \"Creed\" is a must-see of an average greatness at its ranging standards.

Ha fatto cadere il Muro di Berlino e ci ha insegnato un paio di cose importanti, tipo che ehi! Sei grande anche tu! Ma la verit� � che il mio personaggio preferito della saga � sempre stato Apollo, e questo film mi ha fatto male in tanti di quei punti che nemmeno io so come ho fatto ad alzarmi da quella poltrona; che � il mio modo sconclusionato per dire 'Some things are worth fighting for, some feelings never die'.",

    "review": "  Despite underappreciated performances by Michael B. Jordan and Phylicia Rashad and fine fight scene cinematography, these elements aren't enough to save this overlong, excessively padded exercise in trite predictability. The film offers precious little fresh material to this long-running franchise, ultimately falling back on the familiar to carry the picture. Its badly written script and dreadful performance by Tessa Thompson as the protagonist's love interest weigh the movie down even further. And, even though this offering incorporates some of the best work Sylvester Stallone has done in years, his portrayal is basically more of the same and falls far short of the numerous accolades being undeservedly heaped on it. Die-hard fans of the series will undoubtedly enjoy this release, but casual viewers who've seen other installments in the \"Rocky\" mythology are likely to come away unimpressed.",

    "review": "  The 7th (and hopefully last) movie of the Rocky franchise seems to be considered the best after the original by the critics but don't believe the hype cause it's merely disappointing.The movie on the surface tries to go to a different direction exploiting all underground stereotypes. The hero is a young black that listens to hip hop. Rocky has retired and manages his wife's Italian restaurant. The biker gangs of Philadelphia support them. The young fellow is in war with his last name, Creed, and what that represents. The easily foreseen screenplay includes amped-up training sequences and climates to a title fight with an absurd number of punches landed in every round. Stallone's character suffers from (spoiler alert) cancer and there you have a golden globe for him as well an Oscar nomination (wtf?) for best performance in a supporting role. Stallone getting an Oscar sounds like the academy is trolling us. The movie is extremely overrated (8.0 in imdb, 94% in rotten tomatoes) but even for a Rocky fan (as I am) it's extremely predictable and completely lacks emotion.Grade: C- (D if you are not a Rocky fan)",

Sylvester Stallone steals the show from this newcomer to the boxing scene; reclaiming the role he was born into and proving that he's still a damn good actor. It's hard to watch Stallone in something like THE EXPENDABLES and appreciate his performance; but when it comes down to Rocky, nobody can play the role any better. Stallone surprisingly wasn't a cameo or even a co-star. He's the lead character, right next to the protagonist boxer throughout the entire movie. There are no real surprises that make this any different than a typical boxing film, but somehow CREED still ends up absorbing the viewer with suspense, in the preparation and training for that final match - which is a thirty minute adrenaline rush.",

This may sound similar to the plot of the terrible Rocky V in which Rocky trained Tommy Gunn, however this is more in tune with the original Rocky movie than it does with that film or any of the other sequels.What Creed manages to successfully do, taking a leaf from the Star Wars book is marry the old with the new. Stallone is excellent as Rocky and displays real emotion and a sense of loneliness as he's seen all of his loved ones leave him or move on. On the flip-side you have Johnson who has boxing running through his blood but his reckless and arrogant attitude has meant that no one in his home town of LA will train him. Desperate to make it on his own, Johnson seeks out Rocky to train and mould him into a prize fighter. Despite his initial flaws, Johnson is a very likable lead and by the time the inevitable title fight comes around, as he takes on Ricky Conlan (played by real-life boxer Anthony Bellow), you are routing for \"baby-Creed\" to succeed.Creed is a film with lots of heart and doesn't push the nostalgia factor down your throats. The fights scenes are excellently shot and unlike last years somewhat underwhelming Southpaw, there is still a huge amount of tension from when the first bell rings.My only gripe with the film is that they seem to think that Goodison Park has a capacity of 100,000.  The film also co-stars Phylicia Rashad who you'll recognise as Claire Huxtable from the 80's sitcom The Cosby Show, as well as Tessa Thompson who starred in the excellent Selma.",

    "review": "  I've seen enough Rocky films to know the series has hit its highs (Rocky, Rocky II, Rocky Balboa) and its lows (Rocky IV, Rocky V). After the latest movie Rocky Balboa was released in 2006, I figured that would be the end of the series. But Hollywood has taught us that it is never the finale chapter and soon enough trailers for this new film \"Creed\" were hitting theaters everywhere. The film was advertised as a sort of spin off to the original Rocky series but I think if you just slapped on the title \"Rocky 7\" it wouldn't have made much a difference for the \"Italian Stallion\" has his fair share of screen time. Which, believe me, definitely isn't a bad thing. Creed follows the story of Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son out of wedlock. Adonis (like his father) wishes to become a professional boxer and, after quitting his job in LA, moves to Philadelphia to pursue a career. There he tracks down the legend himself Rocky Balboa who has permanently retired from boxing and convinces the old and reluctant fighter to train him. As Adonis builds up his notiroteity, he is soon challenged by British heavyweight champion \"Pretty\" Rick Conlan (who is strapped for cash and going to prison) in a boxing match across the states. The stakes are high as Adonis now has to prove himself to the world that he is not just a shadow in his father's footsteps. I have to give it to the makers of this film that after six movies they found a way to mix up the formula. Its nice to see Rocky as a trainer this time rather than the fighter in the ring. Things like that can open up this series to a slew of new possibilities. The core premise is rather simple but it works towards the film's advantage.The best part of Creed (and perhaps any other Rocky) are the characters. You got Sylvester Stallone playing the lovable Rocky Balboa and, like always, its a stellar performance. Even in his older age, Stallone plays this character with the same energy and wit as he did in Rocky 1. But newcomer Michael B. Jordon does an equally outstanding job as the flawed and complex Adonis Creed. I was rooting for this guy as much as I was for Rocky in the first film. Theres also Tessa Thompson playing Bianca, Adonis's love interest throughout the course of the film. Unlike some other films of the year, (Jurassic World/ Fifty Shades of Gray) their romance is actually real and interesting. Theres a very natural way these people play off each other and it helps make the experience a lot more enjoyable. The growing bond between Rocky and Adonis and their interactions are just as engaging as the fight scenes towards the climax. Theres a larger focus on the melodrama surrounding the boxing and thats all played out really well also. You could argue that some of these moments are a bit predictable and formulaic (like when Adonis and Bianca get into a fight and it seems like its over you know there gonna get back together) but again, these characters are what really drive these scenes home.I do wish, however, this movie had a bit more memorability in terms of these scenes. Plot wise, the only scenes that particularly stand out to me are a pretty well paced conflict with Rocky towards the middle and the boxing match at the end. Not that any of these scenes were bad but they were all just kinda solid and far matched in comparison to the characters put in them. If you asked me what I remember most from Rocky 1, I would tell you the characters, Adrian and Rocky's first date, Paulie's freakout, the training scenes/montages and, of course, the finale fight. If you asked me what I remember most from Creed, I would tell you Rocky, Adonis and Bianca. The finale fight scene won't disappoint anybody and is up to par with the rest of the series fights (particularly the first one). Its quick cut, fast paced, and full of \"edge of your seat\" adrenaline though it ran a little short. The main opponent this time around \"Pretty\" Rick is kind of dull in the personality department. He's cocky and pretty but thats about the extent of it. When it comes to past opponents from this franchise, he's definitely no Apollo Creed and is about as memorable as Rocky V was. At the very least, he proves to be a tough opponent for our hero in the finale match.At the end of it all, Creed is a pretty good film mainly because it is held up by a spectacular cast of characters who engross us in its average but somewhat forgetful plot line",

They passed on the Rocky legacy to Creed so smoothly, by the third act, when we hear the Rocky theme start up for the climax, I nearly leapt out of my seat! Older folks who have had Rocky in their life longer than I may have a harder time accepting the new guy. It can be hard to see how much Stallone is aging, but that's ok. It's expected. We'll always have Rocky 1-6.",

    "review": "  Directed and written by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale station - if you ain't seen it, see it!) - Creed is a visceral and powerful film that captures the heart of the original Rocky while also treading rich new ground. Michael B. Jordan gives a powerhouse performance as Adonis Johnson/Creed not only excelling physically as a dominating fighter but also as a sympathetic and troubled youth despite his upbringing. Not allowing age to get the better of him, Sylvester Stallone returns as the Italian Stallion and fits back into his role with ease. To me, the best thing about Balboa in the film is that it his involvement, characterisation and story makes sense and feels right. There isn't a moment where Rocky does something off-kilter as Coogler skilfully manages to maintain the character's essence and evolve it in a realistic way. Tessa Thompson who plays Bianca (The Adrian to Jordan's \"Rocky\") is a nicely rounded and developed love interest that doesn't feel shoe horned in and is a nice addition to the cast. Another thing to note is that Creed succeeds in where films like Star Wars: The Force Awakens falls with regards to fan service and references to previous instalments of the franchise. Let me put it to you this way, in Creed there are subtle nods while in Force Awakens they are more like \"nudge nudge wink wink say no more\". The action, choreography and sound design during the fight scenes are monumental where you feel every blow and hit that's landed within the ring which makes you wince and jump in your seat. Honestly, the only negatives I found within the film were that I felt the scenes filmed in Liverpool were quite jarring on a filmmaking level, tonally the indie sensibilities and blockbuster subject didn't always mesh and unfortunately Tony Bellew is a better boxer than he is an actor. BUT! Other than that - Creed is a tremendous addition to the beloved franchise we know and love and stands shoulder to shoulder with the series' best work. Aaaaaand if a sequel is to come - I welcome it with open arms.",

    "review": "  39 years after the original, the Rocky franchise came roaring back to life in 2015 with an incredibly exciting, well-crafted and emotionally resonant film. Creed took the series in a bold new direction, shifting the focus onto Michael B. Jordan's Adonis Creed, a figure with a complex emotional tie to Rocky Balboa, who became the mentor for the young hungry fighter.The idea of Apollo Creed's son seeking out Balboa for guidance is a compelling idea in itself, and was probably the best possible move for the series at this point. And both actors played the nuances and complexities of this relationship perfectly. Jordan was incredible, and continues to be one of the most exciting young actors working today. Stallone was equally amazing, and shifting him into a supporting role was ultimately the right decision, as it allowed the actor and character to truly shine for the first time in years. Tessa Thompson was also great as Creed's love interest, and the three created a close, intimate bond that was easy to get invested in because of their natural chemistry.The story is pretty simple, and the plot is very by-the-numbers as far as a Rocky film goes. But where this movie exceled was in the depth of its writing and the finesse of its filmmaking. Some of the boxing choreography was truly incredible because of both Jordan's committed performance as well as Coogler's inventive camerawork - one incredibly shot 'single-take fight' easily being the highlight for me. The film also kept the characters at the forefront, and they were all fleshed-out well with the dynamics between the lead trio feeling grounded and genuine.Creed was an emotionally powerful and exhilarating film, reaching dramatic heights that no one expected. Bolstered by strong performances and magnetic chemistry, it effortlessly breathed new life into this series, and showed that if crafted with thought, love and ingenuity, a film franchise CAN peak nearly 40 years into its run.",

Obviously, you would've needed to at least see Rocky I-IV, if just only to get a background of the relationship that Rocky had with Apollo Creed, because that is what steered this movie. Michael B Jordan did an amazing job, this had to be the best role he's had to date in his acting career. If there are going to be parts in the movie that are predictable, the least one could do is make those predictable scenes GOOD. I was not let down here.

    "review": "  LIBRE DE SPOILER. Ryan Coogler. el director que tuvo la idea de rendir tributo a su propio padre trayendo de vuelta (una vez m�s) el conocido personaje de Rocky Balboa, realizo en 2013 una estupenda pel�cula basada en una historia real: Fruitvale Station, sobre un asesinato en una estaci�n del metro en San Francisco la v�spera de Navidad. Es una buena introducci�n al actor principal Michael B. Jordan, quien vuelve a estar bajo las ordenes de Coogler, despues del fracaso este a�o de los 4 F�ntasticos. Con una est�tica callejera bastante realista que ha logrado este joven director, se construye la historia del hijo ilegitimo de Apollo Creed, el rival, luego convertido en amigo, de \"El Semental Italiano\" . Aunque siempre es un gusto, ver a Stallone regresar a su �conico papel, yo al menos ya lo habia enterrado en 2006 con Rocky Balboa. La primera pel�cula, la que gan� el oscar hace 40 a�os es una de mis favoritas y el gancho utilizado por Coogler para atraer a la audiencia es precisamente el favoritismo que tiene esta saga cinematografica entre los cinefilos a nivel mundial. La diferencia con lo que hizo Star Wars: El Despertar de la Fuerza, esta en que aunque la estructura es la msima que la de todas las pel�culas (un Don Nadie en busca de una oportunidad en el boxeo-entrenador negandose a darla- cortejo amoroso de una chica del barrio- dramas ligados con la salud-entrenamiento y combate \"hasta el ultimo round\") Coogler consigue darle la vuelta a todo este esquema, a trav� de una t�cnica nunca antes vista en el cine, mediante la cual el espectador no esta viendo una pelea de boxeo en TV o en la banca de un coliseo, sino dentro del ring con los pugilistas. Consigue mejor que el mismo Stallone (como director) esos primeros planos de golpes y lanzamientos lo que obliga al espectador o a esquivarlos o recibirlos. Muy bien logrado y bastante realista.Considero que la pel�cula funciona en la medida en que se aleja de la saga, con una est�tica propia del mundo del hip-hop, con una revelaci�n como lo es la actriz Tessa Thompson en el papel de una cantante lidiando con sus propios problemas y con las situaciones propias de la clase obrera en la Filadelfia del a�o 2016. Espero que para Creed II abandonen el tema de la nostalgia y se concentren en la propia historia de Adonis Creed, sin mucho ecos a lo que tantas veces hemos visto.",

Coogler's direction is kinetic without feeling exhausting, the performances are stellar (Thompson is an honest-to-goodness star, her presence a constant source of luminosity and her chemistry with Jordan palpable throughout), and that final show-down delivers in spades what The Force Awakens desperately wanted to achieve through its pitch-perfect coalescence of the old and the new. In a year of big-budget retreads and blockbuster disappointment, Creed comes through in a big way, more than justifying its existence and besting all but the original of the Rocky films in the process.",

I also wished they can done more with Adonis and Mrs. Creed's relationship - that could have been the most interesting one in the movie had they developed it more.

Director Ryan Coogler manages to create a movie that is part of the Rocky universe but also stands out from its prequels. Even though it follows almost the same plot as the original Rocky and even feels the same, Creed somehow manages to become a movie of its own, with many open ends that (in my opinion) threaten to become another never-ending Rocky series.However, back to the point, Sylvester Stallone does an amazing job as a coach to Apollo Creed's legacy and son, Adonis Johnson (Micheal B. Jordan). [Spoilers ahead..] His personality as a coach is likable and his sickness gives an honest sentimental touch to the movie. As a result, the story is enjoyable and greatly explained for those unfamiliar with Rocky.The performances by Micheal B.Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, and Tessa Thompson go above and beyond and the story develops in a timely manner. At the end you will realize that Creed may be another boxing movie, but it sure isn't another Rocky movie. Take this from someone that is very unfamiliar with all the Rocky movies and hates boxing (Yup, that's me). All in all, Ryan Coogler has done an amazing job.",

    "review": "  I was skeptical about \"Creed\" but this film rivals the greatest films in the Rocky franchise. We can only watch Rocky make a comeback so many times (and we can all agree that the fifth time was too many) but this spin-off brings a fresh approach to the classic story. Apollo Creed is a beloved character to all film fans and the friendship formed in \"Rocky III\" fuels this entire plot. Apollo's illegitimate son possesses the baggage and natural-born talent that make him the perfect fit for a formulaic Rocky underdog story. We are in his corner from the moment that he gains our empathy in the first scene. The cinematography and editing of the boxing sequences are astounding, particularly the tracking shot during the first major boxing match. A three-minute round of boxing has never felt so long as this shot rotates around the boxers without ever cutting away from their close-up punches. It brings perspective to how long one round must feel to the boxers. This sequence is brutally intense and a cinematic marvel. The climactic match at the end is creatively assembled by combining HBO footage, POV shots, and an array of camera angles that make it impossible to perceive whether their punches are staged or actually making painful contact. I didn't care for the background music selections which obviously reflect Adonis' race but when the Rocky theme starts playing during the final fight... Wow. It is one of the most magical movie moments I've experienced in a long time (well, at least since seeing \"The Force Awakens\" a week ago). Michael B. Jordan has set this spin-off series up for success through his strong acting and physical embodiment of a boxer. Sylvester Stallone deserves a ton of recognition for this strong comeback. He is on the radar for a Best Supporting Actor nomination though, if I'm giving a nomination for reviving an old character, Harrison Ford gets my vote. I would have liked to see more of Phylicia Rashad but her absence is necessary for the growth of Adonis. \"Creed\" has made the Rocky formula (training montages, personal drama, high-intensity boxing matches) relevant to the modern generation and I believe that it will continue to grow in popularity for at least two more films. Our society will continue to yearn for inspirational stories, no matter how many times this tale is told.",

That being said Creed is one exceptional film. I mean it really is. This film wins on all accounts. Ryan Coogler was the right person to make this film a reality with exceptional acting and a emotionally compelling story to go along with it. This film wins on all fronts. Micheal B Jordan is a excellent new edition to this world and gives this story so much heart in his overall performance making a big comeback after the failure of Fantastic Four proving that he is a phenomenal actor overall and is rightfully deserving of a Oscar win at some point in his career. Sylvester Stallone also makes a strong return to the franchise making the story all the much more memorable. I really loved him in this role as he took it with all the force he had and he undoubtedly won for me, and is deserving of so much love for what he managed to do in this role as well. Overall this is a powerful film and is a welcome home for all Rocky fans, and is just a good legitimate movie as well.",

At first Rocky isn't too keen on the idea but the kid grows on him and he does it. Michael B. Jordan is great in the role of young Creed. Stallone is great as an aging Rocky. Tessa Thompson is good as Bianca the love interest. Phylicia Rashad is good as Adonasis stepmother and Apollo Creed's widow. Dare I say this?

    "review": "  I admit to being a Rocky virgin. That's right, I had never seen a Rocky movie until I watched Creed though I guess you wouldn't call Creed a Rocky movie, because Rocky himself is only a supporter in this tale that mostly follows Adonis 'Donnie' Creed (Michael B Jordan). I may have never seen the Rocky films, but I was very familiar with them. I read the entire synopses of the film series just in case this film was to reference any of those (which it honorably did). I walked into Creed with my friends Jesse Zoeller and Kristian Plummer in tow Thanksgiving weekend, ready to see the film that had been reportedly well received.  Adonis Johnson is the son of heavyweight champion Apollo Creed. Adonis participates in underground boxing matches as a pastime to his day job in a security firm. One day Adonis decides to quit his job at the security firm to pursue his dream of becoming a professional boxer. Adonis' mom Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad) disapproves of Adonis' decision to become a professional boxer, reminding him of how his father had died in the ring 30 years before... However, Adonis' mom cannot dissuade Adonis for he has decided to follow his dream and nothing and nobody can stop him from doing this. To become a professional boxer you need a trainer so Adonis heads over to Philadelphia and finds Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone returning as good as ever) running a Italian restaurant named Adrian's (More honorable tribute to the Rocky film series). At first, Rocky declines Adonis' plea to train him though he eventually reverses his decision and agrees to train Adonis at Front Street Gym.  After defeating a local fighter, Adonis gets the attention of heavy weight champion Ricky Conlon's (Tony Bellew, a professional boxer in reality) trainer who caught word that Adonis Johnson is really Adonis Creed. Ricky Conlon's trainer wants Adonis to be Conlon's final competitor because Conlon is going to prison soon. Adonis accepts the match (after changing his last name from Johnson to Creed at Conlen's trainer's request).  I found Michael B Jordan to have given a powerful leading performance as the fully developed Adonis Creed and he shines next to Sylvester Stallone, who gives another solid performance as Rocky Balboa. The standout of the supporting cast is Tessa Thompson as Michael B Jordan's love interest who is more than your typical love interest... Thompson's character is nearly deaf and a very talented singer/songwriter. Anytime Tessa Thompson is singing, I close my eyes and smile - her voice is beautiful.  The screenplay written by director Ryan Coogler (whose directing work in Fruitvale Station and Creed is top notch) and Aaron Covington is great in terms of character development (they did an excellent job of forwarding the development of Rocky)and pacing but the story itself lacks originality... It's too predictable. The climatic boxing scene in Creed is really exciting and well staged and acted but its outcome felt like a really forced wink toward the first Rocky films conclusion. However, I feel that Coogler and Covington got away with their other tributes to the Rocky series.  Creed features strong performances and character development and excellent directing though the film doesn't have as strong a story as it does everything else. After watching Creed, I find myself wanting a sequel... B+ 12/2/15",

I was very concerned that this movie would come off too cheesey, trying to ride on Rocky's coat tails, but the film does a great job of establishing itself and continuing the Rocky story as well. I saw one quote about this film that I enjoyed and thought captured the essence very well: \"[The] film does nothing to break the mold. Rather, it shows that the mold exists for a reason.\" I liked the parallels that this film drew between itself and the original Rocky film. Among those similarities, I enjoyed the differences it took as well. I liked the scenes introducing Adonis in his youth, which set a very good tone for the film. I like the direction they went with Rocky's health, which is something I thought would be handled poorly and eclipse the film, but it worked into the narrative beautifully. I like the way the fight scenes were shot, especially Creed's second official match, which was put together in one continuous-seeming take. I like the seeds they scattered in the story for a potential future in this franchise. I would be very interested to see if Creed can develop into its own branch of the Rocky franchise and carry on for a new generation. I would certainly be interested in seeing more.",

    "review": "  Finally got the chance to see this long awaited continuance of the Rocky saga during the reality news of Philadelphia Eagles coach Chip Kelly getting fired, and seeing Cosby TV wife Phylicia Rashad play Apollo Creed's wife, at the time we see on CNN's arraignment of Bill Cosby. All that aside, none of that distracts me from enjoying this awesome movie without \"forcing\" the characters to you and not cheesy at all. Seems like it mirrors the name identity that actor Michael B. Jordan has in real life than with his character as Creed's son, Adonis. Oh and let's not forget Sylvester Stallone's character spirit as Rocky Balboa. It does not overdo or over-inflate, but just does enough to get you back in the right substance into this well done of a movie as it's 7th installment!",

    "review": "  Spoiler Alerts: The film starts out in a juvenile correction facility with Adonis, the illegitimate child of Apollo Creed, Rocky's ex-rival-turned-partner is getting in to a fight with another detainee. Creed's widow Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad) comes in to talk to him, and offers to take him in despite the fact that he was born to another woman. The movie flash-forward's to Adonis' young adulthood where, despite the fact that he has been set up with a promising desk job, he sneaks down from L.A. to Tijuana to fight professionally in low-grade establishments. Before long, he finds his way to his father's old training gym.  The trainer's at Delphi Boxing Academy refuse to train Adonis (Michael B. Jordan), who now goes by Don or Donnie. The trainer warns him that the life of a boxer is too hard, too dangerous, and that a man born to wealth would not likely be hungry enough to make it no matter how good his pedigree. Adonis decides to challenge the boxers in the gym, and ends up being knocked out by Andre Ward, the 2nd rated pound-for-pound boxer in the world, played by real-life boxer Danny 'Stuntman' Wheeler. Not one to give up, Adonis finds his way to Philadelphia to seek out Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), who he know from studying film of his father's fights. Rocky who still owns his restaurant, Adrian's, is in disbelief to hear that Adonis is Apollo's son. After some convincing, Rocky decides to train his lost friend's son. Before long, he is offered a fight against an up and comer from Mickey's gym. Soon after that, Adonis finds himself faced with the opportunity of title shot vs. bad boy champion 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan, played by real-life boxer Tony Bellew.  The film predictably ends with a title fight facing an underdog with an established champion. However, the details of the story are not nearly as important as the vehicles used to tell it. The score is original but samples and takes from the original score, but resists the temptation to unleash the classic. It is a wise choice, because the film stands on its own. Some of the clich�s are still there like the training montage, and some light hearted references to the first film.  In fact, for fans of the franchise, there are a lot of subtle references to the past editions of Rocky. One of his turtles is still alive, but we're not sure if it's Cuff or Link, Adonis takes runs through the same parts of the city that Rocky used to, he chases chickens, but stops short of using slabs of beef as a heavy bag. In a way, one of the biggest co-stars of the film was the city of Philadelphia. Part of the Rocky story is how he fought for his city and his community, and how is willingness to get the living shit beat out of himself brought people together. Despite the story being, on the surface, about one man's million to one shot, it really shows how trainers, managers, and supporters really do help make the people that we prop up to be our stars. Creed shows this as well as the original, and possibly better. There's scene near the start of Adonis' training that sticks out when Rocky is teaching him about shadow boxing. They are both looking in the mirror. Rocky tells Adonis that the man facing him is his biggest enemy and greatest obstacle. Rocky confirms that he believes that both about boxing, and about life, and really if the Rocky movies are about anything, they are about overcoming the obstacles that that opponent throws your way.  The acting in Creed is great, the love story is there, the dialogue works, the inspirational speeches are predictably present, but the phrasing and wording is fresh. The film touches on social issues such as the exploitation of disadvantaged young men through professional fighting, but doesn't really cast an analysis of it, other than the thought that anyone crazy enough to do it has to have a mountain of intrinsic motivation, and it takes until the final scenes of the movie to really understand what Adonis' is. In this sense, the script is excellent. It foreshadows and reflects on the past movies while entertaining and moving the audience. With the stories of the Rocky movies including plenty of loses, triumphs, and disappointments for both protagonist and heel, there was an element of unpredictability to the film. The final fight was graphic, and though it featured a real professional boxer (Bellew), it did not, as I feared, steer away from the massive amounts of head shots that have turned off some boxing purists in the past. However, the fight choreography of Rocky movies make for exciting cinema and there is a reason why most original screenplays about fighters are one-and-done and a reason why Rocky movies are in to their seventh installment - they are great movies. Each Rocky movie works as a standalone and this one more so than any other since the first. It used limited recycled footage, and when it did use recycled footage, it was shown in an altered fashion such as close ups, projections in a room, or still photos hanging on the wall.  In the end, Creed is a film about passing the torch from one generation to the next, but it's also about the meaning of family. Sylvester Stallone plays the character that made his star in a very inspired way. This seventh incarnation of the Italian Stallion is humble, and his physical prowess has finally slowed down to match that of his lack of wit. He appears to pretty much be a normal guy, admittedly not the best of the best, but with a lot of wisdom, and little left in the tank. However, he finds a worthy heir to both his and Apollo's legacy in Adonis. By the time the final bell rings and the credits run their course, I found myself walking out of the theater a few inches taller, walking a few paces faster.",

    "review": "  Creed was a solid addition to the Rocky franchise. It was tough at times, not seeing Rocky train or fight, but once you adjusted to the new-comer Michael B Jordan, seeing Rocky as only the trainer was just fine. The best part of the film I thought was the acting by Stallone. This was his best performance yet and he nailed every line and intense moment he was in. The boxing scenes were action packed and intense but at times the in between fight scenes did move a little slow. I appreciated the story and how it was almost a passing of the torch for Rocky but he was still heavily featured in it and it was a nice way to possibly close out the series. Creed is a must watch for any Rocky fan or just anyone who likes a solid story with great acting and can appreciate a legend like Stallone in his greatest role yet.",

This is not re-creation of the Rocky movies but it's a continuation and a very good one. Well worth the 2+ hours of watching and what I love most about it is the unpredictable ending. Without spoiling it for anyone, what you think will happen at the end may or may not happen but at least it's not your typical ending and it's a fitting one. Sly was great when it seems his career was done. He is fit for this role as an aging and ill Rocky Balboa and hopefully this is not the end and they have another 'Creed' movie or something of the sort. Great movie!",

However, Creed really suffers from its execution. And no, I am not going to criticize this movie for sharing similar elements to the original Rocky. That isn't the problem for me.The problem lies in the fact that Creed's script feels filled with unfocused themes, unexplored plot lines, and new characters that aren't all that interesting. The movie seems to know what its main theme is by the end, but it seems so unsure of itself throughout the majority of its runtime that I found myself just not caring that much by the end. And ultimately, the movie didn't focus on the characters enough for me to really care. As a result, Creed left me incredibly disappointed.It's by no means terrible, and there is certainly enjoyment to be had. But a great movie, Creed certainly is not.",

Great story.

Jordan put on a great performance (like always) and Stallone put on his best performance in decades(Oscar worthy?). Creed does seem to hit a lot of the same beats as the original Rocky but at the same time it feels fresh and new. Overall, I think Creed is fantastic and I also think director Ryan Cooler is going to be a big name in the movie industry for years to come.",

    "review": "  Creed is a better sequel than The Force Awakens. Go see it.Look, this is really not a dig at Star Wars. The Force Awakens is a really good movie. But I'm sincere when I say that \"Creed\" more effective and all around better sequel for the Rocky movies than \"The Force Awakens\" is for the Star Wars franchise. I only say this to make the point that Creed a REALLY GREAT movie and you need to go see it. Creed offers a new protagonist with his own story to live while allowing the previous hero to both continue his own story and mentor the new. The first generation seamlessly, realistically, and gracefully ushers in the next. In every detail of the movie the new, the modern, the today is breathed into this classic series in a way that is absolutely natural and unforced. Patterns are there, but there is no heavy-handed repetition... no redundancy, no dejavu. \"Creed\" is not \"Rocky\" remade. The music is ON POINT. Just as the movie's plot weaves the old and the new together, so does the soundtrack. The Rocky movies have always had brilliant music and Creed does not disappoint in this regard. The old themes resonate under a completely up-to-date, modern soundtrack. Nothing feels old, there is enough of the classic themes for resonance and nostalgia, perfectly accompanied and followed by new, pounding, thrilling music. Creed is a movie about making your own legacy that perfectly practices what it preaches. \"Creed\" steps out of \"Rocky\"s shadow into a self-made light just as its hero steps out of his father's. Finally, possibly the most brilliant and appropriate thing about this movie is the title. It's a Rocky sequel, sure, but it's also its own, standalone movie with its own standalone title. This is not \"Rocky VII: Creed\", it's \"Creed.\"And honestly, I kinda hope it's \"Creed I.\"",

From start to finish the film feels well put together with Michael B. Jordan as a convincing lead. Although the Philadelphia of Creed lacks the gritty feel of the original Rocky, the individual storylines of Stallone and Jordan are intricate and well developed and quickly make up for the shortcomings in setting and questionable choice of adversary. The real surprise in this film is the amount of chemistry Stallone and Jordan shared, and is the reason Creed is a must see for any fans of the originals.",

    "review": "  It?s been a relatively long time since a good Rocky film was produced. After the original 1976 film turned the premise of an underdog boxer fighting against surmounting odds into a bankable playing ground, the next four Rocky films in the franchise paled in comparison, increasingly beating the dead horse of the formula in the original with rhythmic swings of similar narrative beats, at least until Rocky Balboa (2006), which had Stallone returning to tackle the character from a new angle, one that was of a veteran, damaged boxer trying to relive his glory days. Performance (and that one riveting monologue aside), Rocky Balboa wasn?t anything truly special. At least, until now that is, as an excellent spinoff set within the same universe is introduced in the form of Creed.Following the rippling effects of the events in Rocky IV (1985) and the death of Apollo Creed, writer-director Ryan Coogler and Aaron Covington forge the story of Creed around that of Apollo?s illegitimate son, Adonis, played by Michael B. Jordan, as he returns to collaborate with Coogler after starring in Fruitvale Station (2013). And despite being one of the four leads in the ill-conceived and ill-received Fantastic Four reboot earlier this year, Creed serves to recoup Jordan?s losses as the young actor?s best film to date. Bringing a fiery depth to the role of a wanting son completely deprived of a father?s presence, whilst simultaneously attempting to be a better man than him, Johnson enters the acting fray as a dramatic acting force to be reckoned with at a time when the industry has a clear lack of young African-American talent. Matching the talents brought by his much younger peer, Stallone himself ? after showing dramatic range in Rocky Balboa ? proves to be a juggernaut of a co-star, impeccably displaying aged nuance as the character that he has played for 39 years.Much like how Fruitvale Station had captured the feel of its location, Coogler ? with DP Maryse Alberti ? does the same with bottling the essence of Philadelphia, the home of Rocky that Adonis travels to in search of the legendary boxer; Coogler and Alberti go further with pushing the film out of the comfort zone of regular boxing film cinematography even with one of its boxing sequences, which the filmmakers had shot in a long take, and one that captured the ballet of the sport in a breathless motion. As much as Creed is one of the year?s best films, it suffers from the oldest trope in the genre; a romantic subplot.Like Rachel McAdams? utterly wasted character in Southpaw, Adonis? love interest in Creed is a pointless role helmed by the talented Tessa Thompson of Dear White People; an experienced editor could very well snip her scenes out of the film entirely, and Creed wouldn?t be any different. If Creed had not succumbed to the aforementioned, it would certainly be more than just a great film; it would be a feat and a revelation of the sports drama genre, a film where the hackneyed female love interest doesn?t exist and the underdog male character succeeds on his own merits without a superficial eye candy on his side. Unfortunately, this isn?t the case; Creed is simply great, nothing more, nothing less.",

    "review": "  How to infuse fresh ideas and energy in a beloved movie franchise by incorporating elements that made the original so great without coming off as an unoriginal rehash? This year we got two perfect examples on how to do it right. Star Wars: The Force Awakens reinvigorated the blockbuster spectacle from the original trilogy, while Creed brings us back to the story of an underdog who tries to stand on his own two feet and create his own legacy.Both movies rely heavily on the introduction of new characters played by talented newcomer, supported by the old veterans we already know and still love. With Michael B. Jordan as Apollo Creeds son Adonis (or simply Doni), we can see once again, that this youngster has a bright future ahead of him. Adonis is a young man, who, just like his famous dad, likes to let his fists do the talking, when the occasion arises. Only problem with Doni is, that these occasions happen to frequently, which gets him into juvenile detention centers as a kid and into other equally problematic situations as a young man. After deciding that he wants to devote his young life to boxing, he quickly gets a painful lesson of not having any proper training. He then seeks the guidance and training of his fathers once rival and best friend, Rocky Balboa.Now, let's get one thing right out the way, the acting is excellent. It is riveting to see Michael B. Jordans character desperately struggeling to deny his fathers name and trying to escape his shadow. And Sylvester Stallone as Rocky... Sly is the living embodiment of the aged boxer. It's his alter ego and he knows the ins and outs of him. So it shouldn't be a surprise that Stallne is incredible, if not even oscar worthy with his very subtle acting of someone who doesn't have a lot to live for, but finds new life by training Adonis and develop a sort of father-son relationship with him.While Jordan and Stallone are the frontrunner of this incredible tale, it's the third person in this trio, who brings it all together. Ryan Coogler, who did a great job with Fruitvale Station (also with Jordan), succesfully brings this old franchise into modern times without neglecting the elements that made the legendary original so great. It adds quite a bit of humour to the movie, but also another layer of depth during the last act of the movie, that can cause watery eyes even amongst the strongest of men. During these emotional minutes it is not a fight in or outside the ring, but the heart breaking moments and dialogues which packs the biggest punch and leaves us breathless.Speaking of fight in the ring, the cinematography, choregraphy and directing during the second fight is filmmaking at it's best. Definitely one of the best and most memorable scenes in 2015.Great to see this franchise flying high again!",

First things first, this film is well handled, it's superbly directed, the gritty look, the action scenes and the heart to hearts are all well done and carried.The film starts off bold with Adonis Johnson the illegitmate child of Apollo Creed fighting with another teen in juvenile detention. Then Maryanne Creed the widower adopts Adonis gives him an education with good job prospects but Adonis longs for more. So he moves out to Philadelphia from Los Angeles and eventually gets Rocky to train him.It's from this point that this film becomes by numbers and essentially Creed's story is pushed back to focus on Rocky's continuing story. Unfortunately by focusing on Rocky's story the film just becomes another Rocky movie, but instead of Sly doing all the running around, it's Michael B. Jordan.The problem the film has is that it has to fill in the blanks from the last movie, where's Paulie? Where Robert? They put in all this effort into getting the Rocky and Robert character on good terms in the last film. Also where is Marie you remember the lovely lady he shares a kiss with in the last film and where's the dog and the kid? Some of these questions are answered some aren't, which left me a bit annoyed, but when we get too involved with Rocky the story moves wisely back to Adonis Johnson and his transition to becoming a Creed in his own right.Honestly this film is enjoyable, while I still preferred the last instalment Rocky Balboa because it ended the franchise on a solid note. The Creed franchise is just beginning let's hope Sly and Rocky don't hog the limelight next time around.",

The movie lacks a strong presence of the emotional journey of \"I got something to prove\" or \"I have a threat to something very dear to me\" that the best and worst Rocky movies featured, is somewhat overlong, has too many modernizations for hardcore Rocky fans (in theory), and ultimately reminds us that writers Ryan Coogler and Aaron Covington are probably best suited doing romantic comedies.

Creed lifted itself to be almost as good as the original Rocky. Being a fan of the Rocky movies, I've seen all 6. Creed was better than every Rocky besides the first. Sylvester Stallone also showed that he is capable of being a top-tier actor in his older portrayal of Balboa. He deserved his nomination in the Golden Globes this year. 5/5",

And yet, the fight scene is smooth and really tense. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone's acting are excellent. The only minus point to me is the romance between Creed and Bianaca, it's just so-so. Overall, great movie! WB must seriously consider Coogler for their next superhero movie. I'm sure he will do fine!",

So even though I am not the biggest Rocky fan I decided to check it out to see what all the buzz was about. Is it the greatest movie of all time like some critics shout ... no not really ... but there are some great performances here, with an good but predictable story, and some good boxing scenes. Stallone and Jordan are top notch and there performances are incredible. The story is ok but pretty predictable and has almost the exact same storyline as every boxing movie ever made. For that reason alone its not anywhere near the perfect movie people claim it to be. If you are a fan of the Rocky movies you will probably love this spin off but if you don't really care for them I highly doubt this new incarnation is going to change your mind. Worth a watch at least once for the great performances though!",

The film is really good and I liked all of the performances, especially Michael B. Jordan, who is becoming one of my favorite young actors (loved him in The Wire and Friday Night Lights). The film is a little predictable with the montages and the fights, but the speaking of the fights, they got shot extremely well and include a great long shot.

Jordan is sensational as Adonis, and Stallone is remarkably restrained and that is an achievement in itself. The writing is pretty darn good and never gets wannabe-inspirational or preachy at any point. The characters are etched carefully, Rocky's post-retirement phase and Adonis' rise to stardom are nicely packaged into roughly a hundred and thirty five minutes. Ryan Coogler needs a pat on his back for coming up with a worthy sequel/spin-off/reboot (whatever you can call it) that is a thoroughly engrossing piece of sports drama.",

    "review": "  DEAR FIGHT PEOPLE - My Review of CREED (4 Stars)I went into the most recent ROCKY movie, CREED, with the same trepidation I've felt since ROCKY II. Would I be in for another round of cornball inspiration or would this one finally be the version to equal or top the original? It's a roll of the dice I wasn't all that interested in taking, but I'm so glad I did, because CREED is surprisingly wonderful. This, despite the fact that the film ladles on the cheese with extra dollops. Maybe it's the fact that director Ryan Coogler (FRUITVALE STATION) and his co-writer Aaron Covington took over the writing responsibilities from Sylvester Stallone and added incredibly fresh, lived-in direction, but the results make this my favorite ROCKY movie since the first. Michael B. Jordan, who starred in Coogler's prior film, plays Adonis Creed, son to Apollo, Rocky's biggest opponent. An angry child who finds himself in constant trouble, he grows up wanting to be a fighter like the father he never met. Unable to secure a trainer to take him on in LA, Adonis, of course, heads off for Philadelphia to seek the assistance of none other than the Italian Stallion. Retired and happily managing his restaurant, Rocky wants nothing to do with the fight world, but damn if Adonis isn't one persistent man. Dare I say it? He's got the eye of the tiger! So the question remains, will Rocky help Adonis capture the title or say no and just go about his life? Would it be spoiling things to say which way this goes?I'm making this all sound sillier than it really is, because the filmmaker's imbue this story with such grace, capturing the scrappy, blue collar world that got lost in the many sequels. ROCKY BALBOA came close to returning to its roots, but Coogler has such wonderful visual chops, aided greatly by his cinematographer, Maryse Alberti (THE FIGHTER), and additionally gives us a ROCKY movie where we care so much about every character. Jordan clearly dedicated himself physically to this role and his approach to his character allows for Adonis' many flaws to come to the surface. I wish he had brought more humor to the proceedings, but constantly pushing himself to his limits, so there's not a lot of time for jokes. Stallone, however, brings humor and such gravity to his aged fighter, slipping into the Burgess Meredith role here and winning our hearts all over again. The way Stallone can deliver a speech in his patented deep, palooka-like monotone and get to the heart of the line, to the humanity, is astounding here. It's early, but I'm going out on a limb to say Stallone should start practicing his Oscar acceptance speech. For me, this wouldn't be the sentimental favorite award, it would be in honor of a truly great screen performance. Their co-star, Tess Thompson (DEAR WHITE PEOPLE, SELMA) delivers a charming performance as Adonis' downstairs neighbor, a singer who is slowly losing her ability to hear. Refusing to be relegated to \"the girl\" role, her Bianca is as much of a fighter as the two men. Ultimately, this is a story about fighting for your survival and leaning on your chosen family to accomplish that. So yes, it's your standard ROCKY crap, but it's done with such conviction, such visual skill, that there's no choice but to surrender to its many charms. Let's start with that great training montage. Creating an iconic shot of its own without having to resort to the run up the stairs of the Philadelphia Museum of Art (don't worry, they make an appearance), Coogler chases Adonis up a street, escorted by his supporters on various types of motorcycles. Popping wheelies in slo-mo as Adonis runs, I rolled by eyes, until they stop in front of a location to pay their respects. I won't give anything away here except to say Coogler turned cheddar into brie in this wonderful moment. Also astounding is a single take fight sequence that feels impactful, exciting, and puts the audience right in the ring with the boxers. It's a thrilling accomplishment, the camera hitting each character at the precisely right time. Also, Coogler enjoys a good slo-mo, smoke-filled entrance or two, because he has the right panache for this type of spectacle. Sure, the film takes many maudlin, melodramatic turns, some of which brought tears to my eyes, and it's because the actors fully commit. By the time the familiar opening strains of the ROCKY THEME hit, the audience I sat with cheered. CREED hits all of the right nostalgia buttons while updating the saga, passing the torch to very capable hands. In doing so, we've been given one of the year's better films.",

I thought the whole \"Son of Creed\" thing might come off as cheesy, but it really works thanks to an impressive performance from Michael B. Jordan. This movie obviously has nods to the past, but doesn't rely on it and works well on it's own. You don't normally expect much from Stallone in terms of acting ability, but he really does a fantastic job sliding back into the Rocky role. As with previous installments, the boxing sequences are intense and well put-together. Fans of Rocky definitely need to check this out, it's one of the better entries in the series.",

    "review": "  I'm sure when someone pitched the idea of a seventh film in the Rocky franchise, the response was 'you're crazy!\" However, Creed (2015) earns the merit of being a part of the franchise while also being its own thing. Strong performances from the entire cast propel this story about Apollo Creed's illegitimate son and his rise in the ranks of boxing. Director and co-writer Ryan Coogler manages to bring subtle differences to the Rocky template so the film and story feel fresh. This film features Sylvester Stallone in one of his best performance ever as he fully transitions (in combination with 2006's Rocky Balboa) from playing a caricature of Sylvester Stallone playing a caricature of Rocky Balboa to simply Sylvester Stallone playing Rocky Balboa.

Michael B. Jordan does a nice job in the role of Apollo Creed's angry illegitimate son, but the boxing scenes are pretty much the same as all the Rocky movies where the fighters unrealistically pound each other into oblivion without incurring massive brain damage or death. See Will Smith's Ali for realistic boxing scenes. And of course the outcome of the final fight is totally predictable. Unfortunately, the ending leaves the door open for a new round of Creed sequels just like the original Rocky. Time for Stallone to retire.",

    "review": "  \"What was his name?\" *chills*We have a unique situation here. A popular franchise whose reputation was once tattered, was then brought back for a supposedly final redeeming sendoff is now brought back again for what is potentially a new \"spin-off\" franchise. Rocky Balboa is back, baby! But this time he is not the central character of the story. Now, does that play to the movie's strength or its' weakness? In a way, the more I think about, a bit of both.Rocky 6 (Rocky Balboa) for me was as satisfying a sendoff for the titular character as I could've hoped for and until now, that's last we thought we would see of him. But now, Adonis, bastard son of his former opponent and good friend, Apollo Creed, has come to Philadelphia in hopes Balboa could train him. One of the interesting themes of this movie is: what does a name mean? Adonis wants to build a boxing career, but he wants to do it without relying on the celebrity of his father. Adonis goes by his mother's name and doesn't want anyone outside of Rocky knowing who he really is, feeling it would create a false perception of his character and motivation. Adonis struggles with this constantly. He resents Apollo for not being around, but can't help but be inspired by his talent and skills as a boxer. He knows using the Creed name would get him noticed, but would it really help him long term? Does he just want to use it for gain, or does he want to embrace it for pride.Another interesting thing about Adonis is his upbringing; lack of a father figure led to a life of in n' out of group homes and time in juvenile hall. Sounds clich�d, right? Well, it is and it isn't. Adonis actually finds a good home and becomes well educated with a good paying job, but he just can't let go of his street childhood. He sits behind a desk during the week and takes underground boxing fights on the weekends.The acting is solid, the editing during the fights is immersive and intense. You feel every punch that lands. And the cinematography is gritty. But the MVP of the movie is Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa. Rocky is the heart of the story. Without his performance, the movie doesn't work nearly as well. Stallone brings a new level of vulnerability to the Rocky character that started being visible in Rocky 6. Nearly all the emotion that runs through the story comes from Rocky as he is fighting a more emotional and psychological battle while training Adonis. And that may be the film's one big weakness. Adonis may be an intriguing character, but he is a shell when standing next to Rocky. Rocky just has an unfair advantage by having so many great journeys in six previous films that it may just take a while to fully embrace Adonis. Maybe he'll get there in another film or two. And unlike previous Rocky films, the \"villain\" (opponent boxer) barely gets any development; two brief scenes tops.I wouldn't call this a \"feel-good\" movie (the tone is too gritty) but it's solid installment in the Rocky franchise and I'm eager to see a follow-up.Score: 7.5/10",

    "review": "  Creed is a semi-sequel to the Rocky franchise and the definition of how to do a spin-off properly, this time focusing on Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son who begins to follow in his father's footsteps with the help from a very special trainer: Rocky Balboa! This film is everything I wanted it to be and so much more, being a relatively recent fan of the Rocky series, and seeing these two characters befriend one another and talk about events from the past films was fan-service delight! Directed expertly by Ryan Coogler, who previously worked with Michael B. Jordan on Fruitvale Station, he uses his skills behind the camera to create one of the all-time best boxing scenes; filmed in one, unbroken take, the camera dancing through the ring as if involved in the fight itself! Michael B. Jordan feels born to play this role and gives a terrific performance mentally and physically as his character tries to make it on his own and step out of his father's shadow, but most surprising of all, Sylvester Stallone steals this movie with an academy award-worthy portrayal of a broken-down, Rocky and he nearly brought me to tears a few times. The inclusion of Rocky adds weight to the canon and was a stroke of genius from the filmmakers; taking the character in some very interesting and surprising directions. Also to commend, is the inclusion of a three-dimensional love interest who actually has her own goals and is thankfully, not relegated to being the protagonist's cheerleader. This is a truly excellent, underdog fighter film that's shortcomings really only stem from the cliches of sports films and the above-mentioned, one-take boxing sequence is much more exciting than the final fight, but this is a triumph of filmmaking with great, well-loved characters, an air-tight script, and is now the staple for how to successfully create a spin-off film!",

    "review": "  Creed is a crowd-pleaser, an effective character drama, and a rewarding continuation into the Rocky franchise that brings greater relevancy to Sylvester Stallone's acting muscles. Thanks to the talents of co-writer/director Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station) and star Michael B. Jordan, the franchise is given new life by mostly following the same tried-and-true underdog formula that Stallone helped cement long ago. Jordan plays Adonis Creed, the illegitimate son to the deceased boxing legend, and he wants to make his way on his own merits. Adonis tracks Rocky (Stallone) down and convinces him to be his trainer, and the two build a father-son relationship supplying the half the other was sorely missing. From there the plot is fairly predictable as the media discovers Adonis' identity and he's fast-tracked for a high-profile bout with the outgoing champ but the movie still hits the right notes to earn its emotional triumph. I was surprised at the careful attention Coogler gave his supporting characters, providing details to round them out and make them feel like legitimate people rather than stock roles. I enjoyed Tessa Thompson (Dear White People) being an actual character rather than an underdeveloped love interest. Coogler's fluidity with the camera is also striking, and many of the boxing matches are filmed in long tracking shots that amp up the sports verisimilitude. Jordan gives a strongly felt performance that further confirms his star status. The real surprise is Stallone, whose legendary fighter is starting to break down physically. Rocky's inability to fight an invisible enemy makes for great drama, and Stallone sinks into the meaty dialogue. He has a few genuinely affecting moments, and I didn't even know Stallone was still capable of that. Easily the best Rocky sequel, Creed is an uplifting underdog tale that doesn't reinvent the formula but brings added attention, reverence, and sincerity to a whole lot of punching people in the face.Nate's Grade: B+",

Seriously though, Creed did to me what I hope The Force Awaken will, and that is tap into the feeling I had watching the original. Creed feels like the '76 Rocky in 2015.It sits well as a standalone movie, and even non-Rocky fans, even people who have never seen a Rocky film, can appreciate it in all its beauty, HOWEVER if you are a Rocky fanatic, the small, and not so small nods to the older movies are there for your pleasure. When \"Gonna Fly Now\" finally plays, its hard to hold your emotions in check.Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan seem to have that Scorsese-DiCaprio thing going. Add to that the Oscar-worthy performance of one Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson's love story as a perfect distraction, and what you get is beautiful.",

    "review": "  A worthy addition to the Rocky series, Creed is a powerful character drama that explores the issue of legacy. The film follows the illegitimate son of former heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed, Adonis Johnson, as he attempts to follow in his father's footsteps and seeks out retired champ Rocky Balboa to train him. Starring Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, and Tessa Thompson, the cast is pretty good and delivers some impressive performances. Additionally, the writing does a good job at honoring the Rocky series while also passing the torch. And as always, the fight sequences are incredibly exciting. Creed is a smart and well-crafted film that has an interesting story to tell.",

    "review": "  My Review of \"Creed\"... sort of...Last Saturday night I saw the movie Creed and I wanted to share my thoughts about it. It's extremely rare that I post something this long, so I apologize for that, but my experience with watching Creed can't really be separated from my experience with the entire Rocky series. When Rocky first came out I was 8 (almost 9) years old, and I was insistent that I see it. I believe it was the first adult movie that I felt that way about. My parents took my sister and me, and it did not disappoint. I was absolutely blown away. I would continue to be blown away by it for the next nearly-40 years. I've seen the move probably over 30 times, and if I were watching round 14 right now, I'd still get chills and feel like I could take on the world. \"Stay down!\" Mickey yells, but no, Rocky uses every bit of strength he has left to pull himself up! \"Apollo can't believe it!\" No movie has ever made me feel like that to that extent. To this day, I consider the first Rocky to be one of the best films ever made. I could go on and on as to why, but this isn't a review of the first Rocky. I will say though, I still don't think Sylvester Stallone gets anywhere near enough credit for the brilliant script he wrote. As I got older and learned more about how Rocky was made, how the studio didn't want Sylvester Stallone to play the lead role, I was so impressed. To risk not selling your screenplay because you know in your heart of hearts you were meant for a part, takes so much confidence... and guts. Not only was Rocky an underdog, so was Sylvester Stallone.As the series continued, of course I saw all of them. Rocky 2 was certainly a respectable sequel. As a kid, I thought Rocky 3 was amazing, mostly because there were 2 fights AND a wrestling match! Not to mention, it had Mr. T! Later in life, I would come to realize, Rocky 3 was pretty cheesy, and it completely shifted the series to another genre, but as a Rocky-obsessed kid of the 80s, it was awesome. Then Rocky IV came out. Oh man! That was horrible! I know there are people out there who love it. All I can say is those people must REALLY hate communism. For me, it was the worst Rocky of all. I would always say two things about that movie.... Firstly, it was just an anti-Soviet Union propaganda film. Secondly, it had a robot in it, which automatically made it the worst Rocky movie. Next was Rocky V... also terrible, just not quite as terrible as Rocky IV. So at this point, I assumed the series was over. Like almost all series of movies, they get progressively worse until they are unwatchable. However, then I found out Sylvester Stallone was making a 6th installment in the series, Rocky Balboa. When I heard this, I thought, \"Can't this guy just let it go? He's already killed it. You can't kill what's already dead.\" And then the trailer came out. I couldn't help it; I actually thought it looked sort of good. And to be honest, I'd probably go see any Rocky movie no matter what. So of course I went to see Rocky Balboa, with my friend Tom. When the movie ended, I turned to Tom and said, \"Am I crazy, or was that actually good?\" Tom replied, \"No, I think it was actually good.\" I was floored. Now, I'm not saying Rocky Balboa is a great movie, but it's really good... arguably the second best movie in the series. It's a really nice film about a former champion who is grieving the loss of his wife. The amazing thing about the movie, isn't necessarily how good it was, but that Sylvester Stallone did the impossible once again. He took a series that had become completely ridiculous and made a sequel that totally worked! I cannot think of another example of this in movie history. It was a beautiful ending to a series that I can only assume is very dear to Sylvester Stallone. Personally, I was so happy to see that Rocky, a movie that meant so much to me, got to end so well. But then...I started to hear about a plan to make ANOTHER Rocky movie focused on Apollo Creed's son. Quickly I added up the years to see if that even made logical sense. It did. I was so annoyed. You did the impossible (I'm talking to an imaginary Sylvester Stallone in my head, by the way) and ended a defunct series well, and now you're going to ruin that by making another one? This seemed ridiculous to me. But then I was reading about the movie, and I saw that Stallone was neither the writer nor the director, the first time he didn't play at least one of those roles in a Rocky movie. The movie was written and directed by Ryan Coogler, the young filmmaker who did Fruitvale Station. An indie filmmaker? I wondered if this was even Stallone's idea to make it, or did Coogler go to him with the idea. Either way, I was suddenly intrigued. A few months ago, I watched the trailer, and like Rocky Balboa, I was surprised by how good it looked. Then again, you play that Rocky theme and almost anything looks good. Then the early buzz on the movie started to come in, and it was actually quite positive. I couldn't believe it. Again, this series, which is about someone doing the impossible, is doing the impossible. At this point, I was starting to get excited to see it. I was still skeptical, mind you. Part of the reason Rocky Balboa works so well is because it practically ignores Rocky 3 through 5. Creed, however, can't ignore Rocky 4 because that's when Apollo dies. I told a friend before I saw it, \"If Creed makes one reference to Drago, I'm not sure I can like it.\" So last Saturday night, I went with my nephew, sister, and brother-in-law to see the seventh movie in the Rocky series, Creed. I'll get right to the point; I enjoyed it quite a bit. To begin with, and most importantly, we truly connect with and care about the character of Adonis (Apollo Creed's son). Coogler does an excellent job explaining how this young man, who comes from a wealthy and famous father, has grown up to be a fighter who is haunted by his own personal demons. Michael B. Jordan is excellent as Adonis, as is Tessa Thompson, who plays his love interest, Bianca. With that said, Sylvester Stallone steals the show. Every time he is on screen, I was pulled in. This has to be his best performance since the original Rocky. He conveys so much even when he's not saying a word. This might sound crazy, but I think it is a performance that is worthy of an Oscar nomination. Oddly, the nomination would mostly likely be, and should be, for Best Supporting Actor, because this movie is definitely Adonis's story. Coogler's script and direction take the Rocky series and bring it to the next generation. He creates so many beautiful little moments, and brings us along nicely as we root for Adonis on his journey to be a fighter and to accept his past. There are a couple choices that Coogler makes that I would've done differently, but I won't share those at risk of spoiling anything. Besides, what's most important is that Coogler captures the spirit and the heart of the Rocky series, which he does big time. I was moved through the entire movie. I can't think of another series where you have the unique experience of literally watching a character grow older over 39 years. Eat your heart out Boyhood! If you're a fan of the Rocky series like I am, it's a moving and heartbreaking experience. After the movie was over, I found myself thinking about it a lot. I was so impressed that it was as good as it was. I was also blown away that Stallone was willing to hand over the gauntlet like this. I still have so many questions about how that happened and how much say Stallone had in the final product. It's truly amazing to me how this series, from beginning to end, has broken the odds. Because, to be frank, there is no way this movie should've been good!On Sunday, I went to Trader Joe's, and the checker was a young man, probably in his mid-twenties. He asked how my weekend was going, and I mentioned I had seen Creed. He had seen it as well. We both shared in a short conversation about how good we both thought it was. It was clear from how his eyes lit up, he REALLY thought it was good. I asked him if he was a fan of the original Rocky series. He said, \"Yeah, it was pretty good.\" I asked him, \"So you liked this more?\" He said, \"Oh yeah!\" I left so thrilled that it seemed the Rocky series (now the Creed series) was successfully handed off to teach a whole new generation that life is hard, but you have to keep moving forward, and that our biggest opponent is ourselves.",

    "review": "  For those of us who grew up in a certain era, the Rocky movies are a treasure that we hold dear to our hearts (Those same people do not recognize Rocky V as having existed). Creed does what Rocky Balboa (the 6th installment) could not do. It brings us back to what made Rocky such an inspirational story to begin with. A true underdog, going through hell and getting an unlikely shot to rise to stardom. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone deliver award-worthy performances (No exaggeration here, and especially Stallone) and Tessa Thompson delivers a solid if not underrated performance as well. The boxing (in true Rocky fashion delivers more punches than anyone could ever take) was intense and the camera work was outstanding during those sequences. For anyone concerned that this is anything less than the standard the original Rocky movies set, fear not. This is an outstanding movie and one that in a different year could have received some Oscar consideration (though Stallone may still have a chance).",

    "review": "  DISAPPOINTINGI saw CREED Saturday, and loved Stallone's and Jordan's acting. But that didn't balance the mediocre theme, of being as good as your dad. As good as Apollo Creed, an arrogant. manipulative showman who could beat anyone (except Rocky) into the ground?. For some people, that might be inspiring, not for me. As far as fighting being \"in your blood,\" that's one of the thuings humans need to transcend, not make a life out of.The boxing choreography was good,but I one mouthful of blood being spit would have been enough..I'm not surprised Stallone didn't direct or write this one. He produced it, but I don't think it will be long remembered. I can watch ROCKY and ROCKY BALBOA once a year. Not this one.The other acting was mediocre, and the secondary characters (including Rocky) were poorly drawn. Yeah, Rocky talks to the dead again and that's moving. But he gets seriously ill (no spoiler; it's in the trailer), and gets dangerous treatment, but we see no impact of it. And the love interest's flaw is not developed either.",

    "review": "  Michael B. Jordon and Sylvester Stallone give outstanding performances in the newest film of the Rocky franchise that reminds us why Rocky became an icon to us in the first place. Adonis Johnson never knew his fighter father Apollo Creed as he was the child of his mistress. Apollo died before he was born. Adonis finds himself getting in trouble, and is later adopted by Apollo's wife, who feels a connection to Apollo's son. Adonis has boxing in his blood even though no one in his life approves of his career. He decides to move to Philadelphia to meet the man that fought his father and eventually took his title. He has watched Rocky fight on tape against his father so he decides this is the man who should train him. Apollo and Rocky had a good friendship. When Adonis introduces himself to Rocky, Rocky is reluctant to talk about boxing or even training him. Rocky has lost so much in the last few years, and spends time talking to his wife and best friend at a graveyard. When Adonis finally convinces Rocky to train him and become a part of his team, the story reminds you of all the things you loved about the first Rocky film. Sylvester Stallone is brilliant playing the now elder boxer who is living in the shadow of his past while trying to find a purpose in his new reality. I though this was one of the best films of 2015. You should see this film, it will make you cheer inside a quiet theater and make you believe that anything is possible.",

Jordan is as good as Stallone, with an impressive physique and great acting skills. Creed does the Rocky universe justice, and that itself is an victory. Ryan Coogler shows that he may be one of the best directors to come. Another highlight is the score, which fits perfectly in nearly every scene. After Rocky Balboa, most fans (me included) thought Stallone found the perfect end for the saga. But after watching Creed, I have to say that this film is another highlight in Rocky-Land.

    "review": "  Spin off movies are kinda difficult to do, look at the movie I can not mention cause it makes me so mad, cause what on earth did it have to do with Alien?!!! But here is a spin-off movie that really makes a good go of it. Rocky isn't the purest of boxing movies (look at the fight scenes in the Rocky movies) but its entertaining, except Rocky V which plunges head first in to pure farce during the last 30 minutes. Rocky isn't the main character in Creed, Adonis Johnson is and that is where the movie breaths fresh life in to the franchise. Johnson is the result of an affair that Apollo Creed had sometime before Rocky IV. Caught in the shadow of his fathers name, he shys away from the Creed Surname. The movie you can tell is shot and told in a way to separate its self from the previous Rocky movies, but at the same time does embrace the Rocky legacy. Its something that had to be done but had to be done carefully as to not make another Rocky clone, Southpaw was a Rocky clone. There are nods of course to the previous Rocky moives (all except 5, but who can blame them for that?) and Rocky's larger than life legacy is woven thru the movie. But what this movie does so well is show Johnson's struggle with who he is, what he is and what that name could do to him if he let it. Eventually Johnson takes on the Creed moniker and has the Rocky-esque perfromance. Michael B. Jordan does a great job as Creed/Johnson, Stallone is really good too as a older, wiser and supportive father figure to Johnson. This movie didn't get caught in the shadow of Rocky it refreshes and moves everything on. Sequels will of course follow and if Michael B. Jordan returns with Ryan Coogler (watch the Fruitvale Station, excetllent movie) then Creed stands a real chance of making its own real legacy.",

I wish it had something to stand out on its own.But at the same time, it did it with so much elegance and class that I can't really complain. I feel that this movie really stands on it's own. It is a great movie. The acting is fantastic. The score is big and epic. And don't even get me started on the choreography. I don't think it was as good as the first one, but only because I feel that the first one had that bit of a sprinkle of magic that comes with nostalgia. But also just that the antagonist was not as interesting as Apollo was. My only other complaint is that I don't think it passes the bechdel test, despite having 2 main female charaters and one who was a side character and were all very well written. However, I will definitely be buying this movie once it comes out and I will proudly display it next to Rocky on the shelve.",

Creed exceeded my expectations with a good story and fine acting. For the first time in years there was real dialogue between men drawn by past events that drew a picture of the imperfections of life. Like the John Wayne saying,\"There are some things a man just can't run away from.\" - \"Stagecoach,\" 1939. I was drawn to the search for truth by Creed's son Adonis played by Michael B. Jordan and Rocky's sadness brought on by the loss of Adrian, Pauley and his diagnosis, which would be his biggest challenge ever. Much like the original Rocky, which in this viewers eyes was a love story strengthening Rocky Balboa and Adrian as they together \"filled the gaps\" together. Creed shows the frailties we all encounter in our lives and the imperfections. There is a realness to this story that goes beyond championships but the road to discovery of what it is in life that brings you closure or understanding of life's many forks in the road.Fighting is the metaphor for getting knocked down and getting back up. Creed has a resounding right hand in this series. Life's struggle can be a lot of bobbing and weaving, not the clich� that would neatly wrap this up in a bow at the end. It is overcoming the obstacles and helping one another, not at the best of times, but when everyone gives up on you and you go with your dream.Go see this movie it is 15 rounder with plenty of punch.",

    "review": "  While the Rocky franchise hasn't been exactly heralded for its writing, but you could always tell that every single word out of the characters' mouths in Rocky I and II felt incredibly genuine, coming from a place in Stallone's heart that wouldn't stop beating onward through adversity. Creed somewhat fails in this aspect, with dialogue that feels neither genuine nor even believable. At about the 30 minute mark, I seriously considered walking out during an insufferable scene between Jordan and Tessa Thompson, playing the love interest/FKA Twigs-esque R&B singer, at a philly cheese steak restaurant. Now, if you can make it past the sometimes inane dialogue, slow-to-start plot structure, and some goofy moments that could have been straight out of Rocky III or IV, you'll very much enjoy this film. What Coogler lacks in writing believable, consistently toned dialogue, he more than makes up for in dynamic scenes and dramatic tension. When you get to the first fight scene between Creed and another young undefeated boxer-a scene that, I might add, appears to have been done all in one shot-you'll find yourself so engrossed in the action that you might be on the edge of your seat. Jordan's performance is incredible, as he battles his way through unrealistic lines, and Stallone's performance is clearly close to his heart, as an aging legend nears the end of his life. Thompson has some great chemistry, despite being given some of the most out of character lines of any character. Overall, I did enjoy this movie, It definitely makes up for the post-II Rocky films, but seems cheesy in comparison to Rocky I.",

Donnie \"Hollywood\" Johnson, who drives a Mustang, lives in a mansion, trains in Nike and Jordan gear, may have lived a privileged life, but his experiences growing up without a father, going through the foster care system, and denying his identity as a Creed is genuine enough to ground him as a person who wants to create his own legacy. Aside from the contrived fight with former champion Conlon, who would have never accepted that fight in real life, all the elements in this film are inspired work from the cast crew. Seeing Rocky become the OG after being the main character all these years, it made me appreciate how special his character is and how even the best fighters have to move on with life. But it's Donnie's story now, and people my age will definitely find a lot of things in common with him.",

Stallone as Rocky Balboa once again is powerful, heartbreaking and is Stallone's best performance since the original Rocky! This isn't Stallone doing the same thing he's done in past Rocky films. He brings new depth to the character that we've never seen before and is surely the front-runner for Best Supporting Actor at the upcoming Oscars! Director Ryan Coogler brings this story to life in a way no other filmmaker could have! The boxing sequences are incredibly staged and shot like no other boxing film. Apart from one or two character decisions I didn't necessarily feel were fleshed out enough, this is a flawless film! From the incredible performances, epic direction, great soundtrack, and heart felt moments that made me weep more than any film this year, Creed is a knockout film that everyone should see! 4.9 out of 5 Stars!",

    "review": "  As an ashamed Rocky series virgin, I was excited to finally see one of the widely-praised and beloved Rocky movies. I knew to expect some of the stereotypical Rocky traits, like the training montages, the unorthodox practices (like working on speed by catching chickens) and the inspirational motivation from the trainer, in this case Rocky Balboa himself (played, of course by Sylvester Stallone). Even those famous steps got to peek into the movie. However, I did not really expect the new, hi-tech, striking shots throughout the flick, the ones that kept you begging for more. From the graphics that pop up next to each potential opponent with their records and nicknames to the surround-sound shouts from Rocky Balboa in his corner, you really see the world from the perspective of Michael B. Jordan's Adonis Creed character. When he gets hit, it's disorienting, it's blurry, and it's real. When you hear the chants of 100,000 people in a loaded soccer stadium for a fight, you start to feel a bit nervous. You even feel that loneliness when he first comes to Philadelphia in his crappy apartment. So, naturally, in comes a romantic encounter, but Bianca does so much to the story. Around her, you really get to know Adonis and how real he is, because she brings something different out of him. He can be something better than a tough kid trying to prove that he can be as good as his father by himself. He is a caring human being who Bianca pushes to be the best, teaching him to do what he loves and accept where he comes from. In a similar fashion, the paternal bond between Rocky and Adonis adds another incentive for Creed to keep fighting and always keep working, even if he was slightly skeptical of Rocky's Karate Kid-like tactics. It becomes so obvious that Rocky cares so much about this kid and sees something in him that many didn't. Sure, their bond gets tested, after all, preparing for a championship fight breaks Adonis down to the core, but you always feel that they will stick together in the end, because that's what family does. Likewise, even though his providing, caring mother wanted Adonis to not go down the path her husband, Apollo, took, she still supported him in his fights, because she loved her son. Creed is about finding your own way, but never forgetting your roots, and without love, family, and support (like some of the best boxing staff in Philadelphia) it's incredibly difficult to succeed. Even the proudest and toughest of men ask for help, because they will always fight for what they want.",

    "review": "  Sure, it may not move and SOUND like the classic Rocky films we know. But much like it's new character, it has no problem standing on it's own two feet.There are many elements to this feature that deserve praise. The excellent camera work. The non traditional route of storytelling. The superb acting by the whole cast. And since we're on the topic of acting, the real bright and shining star of this picture is Stallone. That's not to discredit any of the other actors in this feature. They all did phenomenal work. But this could seriously be considered his Opus. There are some very cathartic words in Stallone's speech in this movie. Mainly pertaining to his late son who passed in 2012. Every ounce of his acting is truly genuine, and it easily sends this movie into a different category. One we haven't seen since the original. And that's something that's been missing from this franchise for a long time.But with that being said, there are a few minor problems. While the movie doesn't go the cliche route (which i appreciate), it still tries to find it's own identity. It's separating itself from the other Rocky films. A passing of the torch if you will. While i 100% agree with this decision, i still found some of the filming choices a but bleak and generic. Sure, it doesn't have to have the same bells and whistles as the original. But it has to be just as LOUD. Had they created some iconic sequences, ones that give you goosebumps everytime you watch them, then this would rival the originals. And yes, i understand that's easier said than done. But the mere fact that it's this pictures only downfall speaks volumes.My rating, 3.5 out of 5 stars",

But Donny wasn't a bad guy to be around, and it was pretty funny seeing an old timer like Rocky interact off of a young guy like Donny - such as the Icloud part, that was pretty funny. Rocky still had some good moments, like when he's visiting Paulie and Adrian's graves and gives Paulie a bottle of his favorite whisky. When Rocky had cancer at the middle of the movie, I was pretty shocked, and I don't normally feel that way about fictional characters. But since I love Rocky so much, I was pretty worried for him. That stuff happens when you follow a character you love for so many movies. The scene before the final boxing match was just awesome! When Donny gets Apollo's American flag shorts, I said \"Yes\" with so much joy in the theatre, and when the Rocky theme played during the fight everybody applauded, and I joined in. I look forward to another movie, if they ever make one, and if they do i'm pretty sure Rocky will die. It's sad but inevitable.",

    "review": "  Rather than put audiences between Rocky and a hard place, winning combo Creed brilliantly plays out as one of the best and freshest chapters in the storied sports franchise. What's most amazing is the continuing development of an older Italian Stallion into a complex evolving mentor figure even after he's given up the titular mantle. Reverential to the past with a dynamite new fight story all on its own, Creed pits a new unlikely underdog and his trainer on the hard knocks road to a title fight. The whipsmart result brings you to your feet almost as much as 1976's Rocky, the classic that put us all in this fight. Oh, predictability rears its punch-drunk head at times and females get underserved, but not nearly enough to throw in the towel. On the contrary, this is a rare film about legacy that beautifully honors and extends its own. In this PG-13-rated sports drama, former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa (Stallone) serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson (Jordan), the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed. If Mad Max Fury Road and Jurassic World proved anything this year, it's - with the right vision and creative minds -it's better to continue a known franchise than start from scratch with an uninspired reboot (Poltergeist). Thankfully, Creed doesn't throw out the Balboa with the bath water. In fact, Ryan Coogler finds fascinating new depths for the simple Philadelphia fighter. More than proving that he wasn't just a one-shot pony after his harrowing feted drama Fruitville Station, the writer-director advances the game of the iconic character while charting the riveting course for his prot�g�. With Rocky Balboa, Stallone conceived a warm epilogue for the series, signing off Balboa's fighting career on a high note, complete with a new status as widower keeping his beloved's memory alive by running a restaurant under her name, Adrian's. Coogler, however, uses this as an awesome jumping off point, offering up the palooka as benevolent elder statesman. With Jordan's Adonis Creed, he gives us a new hero worth rooting for while still cheering for the old hero. You get on your feet for the performances as well, especially Stallone in a career highlight that's surely due an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Bottom line: Gonna Fly and How",

There's nothing unique about his fighting style whereas all the boxers in the Rocky movies did, even Tommy Gunn. The writers focused a lot more on his backstory and relationships with Rocky and the girlfriend rather than his boxing. A better balance would have definitely made me rate this higher.

    "review": "  The franchise that keeps on trucking and giving despite all odds and all of these years has given us another unexpectedly sincere, touching and enthralling chapter in the Rocky universe, and I say universe in this case since Rocky truly isn't the centre of the story anymore although still provides a lot of heart in what amounts to the combination of Mickey/Adrienne role, this is the story about the underdog Adonis Johnson, Apollo Creed's illegitmate son who is looking to step out of his father's shadow in the sport he ruled, boxing. After the disaster that was Fantastic Four earlier this year, Michael B Jordan has found his first blockbustery/studio franchise film to take him to the next level and he defintiely delivers cashing in the charisma, angst and passion as well as humour to the role of the aspiring boxer and really holds the screen against the former champ as they bound over the love of the sport, and the respect of the ghost of Apollo Creed. Very really directed and believeably executed checking in on Rocky and where he would belivably be at this point. A worthy entry against all odds in the series and given the franchise new legs even if it is still comfort food.",

    "review": "  Every day it seems a new reboot or remake or prequel or something is coming out. I look at films like J.J. Abrams Star Trek which rebooted the franchise but changed everything and for a fan like myself, its difficult to process. Creed on the other hand took a franchise like Rocky, which has been dying for years and rebooted the world masterfully, keeping the old and the history and incorporating it into a film franchise of the future. This film was great and a must see for any Rocky or boxing fan. Ryan Coogler did an amazing job putting it together, he understood the history and understands how to build a better future for this world. Michael Jordan was great as Apollo Creed's son, and now boxer. His performance was flawless. Rocky took on a supporting role but this is some of the best acting Stallone has done in some time. The film is very true to the original Rocky film, Rocky is now Mickey, Creed is Rocky, and then there is the other boxer. The story was engaging and it moved well, the boxing sequences were spectacular. This is without doubt one of the best films to come out this year. The last good Rocky film came out in 1986, Rocky V was a disaster, Rocky Balboa was so so, this film was the perfect film to correct those mistakes and make you feel like you were watching a great boxing film.",

    "review": "  ***** Excellent I promise I will not knock you out with a bunch of punnercuts with my review of the latest film installment of the Rocky franchise called \"Creed\". Yo, I lied. Anyways, \"Creed\" is a marvelous picture which should round out in my list as one of the top films, if not the top, of 2015. \"Creed\" stars uprising actor Michael B. Jordan as young boxer Adonis Johnson. Adonis is also the son of Apollo Creed; and I don't have to tell you who Apollo is, unless you are spaced out with the Rocky flicks. Adonis wants to make his own name in boxing so he seeks the training help of the late Apollo's friend & competitor; the one & only Rocky Balboa. Balboa is played by..... really, do I have to tell you who it is? Come on, this is about the eight count of Rocky movies, so we all know it's Sylvester Stallone. Rocky now is an aging Philly restaurant owner who has lost both his wife Adrian and his brother-in-law Paulie. Rocky is first reluctant to train Adonis, but with some soul searching, he changes his mind. Rocky later discovers that he has to put up with another fight, no ring required in this one but it turns out to be his most important fight. \"Creed\" is proficiently directed by Ryan Coogler. Ryan's hope was not to discredit the Rocky franchise, and his hope came true with his unanimous stellar direction of \"Creed\". He also put in some inspiring write jabs with fellow scriber Aaron Covington with their heartfelt screenplay of \"Creed\". Jordan has to be a slam dunk for a Best Actor Oscar nomination with his powerful performance as Adonis. And a Stallone Academy Award nomination playing \"Rocky\" might just make a comeback to the Oscar ring with what should certainly be a Best Supporting Actor nomination. I also admired the performances of Tessa Thompson as Adonis' love interest and Phylicia Rashad as Creed's adoptive mother. I won't reveal much more of \"Creed\" because that would give this review a \"black eye\"; not that it doesn't have a few already. \"Creed\" is my second favorite of the \"Rocky\" franchise; still prefer the original by a split decision. So get creedy, and feel the \"Creed\".",

The theatre I watched this movie in was decently filled, so when strong moments of the film occurred (such as as when the Rocky theme began to play in the final fight) applause erupted from the crowd, and rightfully so. Creed has excellent leads from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone, who has proven that he is still an undeniably great actor. The cinematography of Creed also deserves an Academy nomination, as the entire film looks beautiful and there were many impressive long takes that I could not stomyself from gasping in amazement. The last time I have seen cinematography this good was in Boogie Nights, which was another great film. The fight scenes in Creed are brutal, bloody, and exhilarating, with every punch making me wince in my seat. Outside the ring, the story becomes a moving and inspirational drama, creating a great blend of emotions. Overall, Creed could be the best movie of 2015. Me and my Johnson highly recommend seeing it.",

    "review": "  Indeed the 7th round seems to be a knockout. With Stallone outside the ring and Jordan in the ring, a winning combination of character dynamics and on screen chemistry blossoms. While it may share a lot of similarities to the original \"Rocky,\" this film would be fine as a completely stand alone experience. Even if the ending could not be as original as it desired to be. As different than the middle entries of the Rocky legacy, this one does well with characters you will want to see succeed. Even if there are minor allusions to past films, viewers can sympathize with such characters often in dramatic sequences.If any Rocky film has been worth watching since the original, it would definitely be this movie here.",

The main character isn't really a character, but is more of an archetype.Also, my personal bias is that I've always thought of boxing as a rather archaic, savage activity, though I respect that it could also be viewed as an art form.I also appreciate that Coogler made several attempts to make this something other than a white savior film by utilizing counterpoint strategies such as Rocky's reluctance, Creed's attempt to make the relationship familial, etc.The movie's ending, however, is missing something. Something about the rhythm/beat was off and the impact I was looking for sort of peters out. But I must say that it was nice to see black love on film.",

It has all of the poignant montage moments, a hyped up performance by MBJ and Old Rocky, who is just as hard headed and likable as ever. The boxing scenes are very immersive, and the sound design helps by isolating the corner voices.

    "review": "  To most baby boomers, the \"ROCKY\" a.k.a. Rocky 1 was a tremendous movie capturing all emotionssurrounding the rise of the uber underdog Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). This movie killed onmany levels do the story line, the characters, the soundtrack and yes the incredible boxing scene. Nosurprise that this film won the Academy Award for best picture and spun of a multitude of sequels.As long as Stallone was in the mix (Rocky 1-4), though not as good as the original, were entertaining.' Rocky V & VI I barely remember as attempts to capture the magic and not.So Rocky VI was made in 2006 and most folks, including me, assumed it was the end of the journey as Stallone was well past fighting age (regardless what Hollywood could create with special effects).Now the newest Rocky film titled \"Creed\" I'm sure will be successful with a whole new generation of fans with falling for Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and his love interest (Tessa Thompson). Plays on the same themes of underdog, Philadelphia based, blue collar training and of course Stallone in an aligned but different role.For me, it was enjoyable and forgettable. No pun intended, but I was \"pounded\" by the Rocky brand meaning the fighting Balboa, his timid yet wonderfully loyal wife Adrian, the unforgettable goofy brother in law Paulie (the great Burt Young) and quintessential old school boxing trainer Mick played by Burgess Meredith).Adrian, Paulie and Mick are no longer in the mix and for me there significant supporting characters completed the Rocky family. Hence, though entertaining, I'm hard-wired and can't forget the past. Must say the fight scene was excellent but the rest just okay. Hope a new generation of Rocky/Creed fans surface and the series continues for them.",

    "review": "  Rating: 3.5 out of 5: A worthy addition to the Rocky franchise. While this is technically not a Rocky movie, Creed does a great take on the Rocky universe. Michael B Jordan does a great job as the son of Apollo Creed and his determination to make it as a boxer. Sylvester Stallone also does a great job being on the sideline as Rocky Balboa and being a supporting cast rather than the lead character. I think Sylvester's take on Rocky in this movie is close to winning an academy award for best supporting actor and showing us an aged Rocky in the Rocky universe. One of the disappointing parts of the movie was the role of Phylicia Rashad, she is an incredible actor and totally under used in this film. I really hope there is a follow up to this film as I believe there is more to say about Adonis Johnson and his new journey as a boxer and the son of Apollo Creed.",

But instead of having the cliched underdog story we've seen a million times, this film has a twist and is portrayed through a great movie franchise. Michael B. Jordan is great as the lead but Sylvester Stallone was fantastic! Some of the best acting I've ever seen him do. This isn't so much about the young gun defeating the all powerful evil undefeated champion, it's a story about the father and son relationship many of us are so fortunate to have.

Now Creed is Rocky reborn and in a very good way, with Sly Stallone giving his best performance well since \"ROCKY\"!!!Now if you play both the Rocky and Creed movies side by side; you will I see the similarities but also you will see the big difference!This movie is an instant classic and captures the same formula that made \" ROCKY \" an overnight hit back in the 1970's.I give this film a 5 out of 5 stars for bringing that A-game type of feel.The5 Reasons why that this movie is great:1. Sly Stallone is at his best in this film and it wouldn't surprise me if he got a Best Supporting Actor nod at the Oscars next year.2. Michael B. Jordan is at his best here to.3. It acknowledges all the Rocky movies including the bad ones, to give the story its necessary backdrop that it needs to hold up this great film.4. Of course flashbacks of Apollo Creed.5. We finally get an answer to the age old question; who won between Rocky and Apollo in the third fight behind closed doors after \"ROCKY 3\".",

    "review": "  Words simply cannot describe how much of a simultaneous relief and absolute thrill this movie was for me .Those familiar with this franchise are aware of its tonal quirks, messily progressing from artful (and Oscar-winning) minimalism to pop-entertainment to all-out cornball fun, THEN BACK, over the course of six films. While I thoroughly enjoy its sequels for their consistent sense of optimism and overall entertainment value (I challenge you to find imagery & sound that is nearly as physically motivating), Rocky '76 remains one of my all-time favorite films for its textural grit and humble storytelling.With CREED, we have, from what I can judge, something of a miracle. Not only does it mesh the heart of the original with the mythological oomph of its sequels, but it breathlessly bridges the cultural gap between the old and the new. We see the physical and social consequences of boxing, as old heroes are juxtaposed with equally ambitious offspring as some of the most pulse-pounding boxing scenes unfold (EVER. No joke. You FEEL every punch, and many camera shots go on FOREVER). We experience a heartfelt goodbye to old friends, while meeting a new batch of interesting characters that carry enough potential for future exploration. And the city of Philadelphia pulses with the spirits of its past, even if the music scene has changed.The soundtrack, like the central character, lives up to the legacy of its heritage, and should be downloaded to the phones of all who want something to get them on their feet. I will go on record, here and now, by saying that if you see me listening to more hip-hop and rap any time soon, it's because of this movie (yeah. that's right. Rocky 7 did it folks. go ahead and judge. F*** you Kanye. F*** you Nikki. Making sounds that pump people up to do some good with their lives through sheer sonic force, and not spending millions to make dis tracks and show how Warhol i am. Sorry, that's just better music to me...i SO can expand my horizons...sigh...i'm so proud of me...rant over.)And Stallone. You beautiful bastard. You got me to cry again with your signature role. Seeing the ripples of Mighty Mick himself through this performance, thus giving a more complete arc to a legendary character, will bring generations of fans to tears. That's a fact. Give him the supporting actor statue. Ya did even more for the Duke, dammit.Great cast. Great direction. Great heart, which matters immensely for a flick like this. I salute everyone involved, and urge anyone looking for a good time at the movies to see this one as soon as humanly possible.",

    "review": "  November 25, 2015\"Creed\" unfortunately proves a movie franchise can pretty much go on for all time so long as each installment is well made (and continues to make money for the studio, of course). I write \"unfortunately\" because although this seventh \"Rocky\" picture is, indeed, well made, it means we're probably bound to see more of them, and that means the talented cast and filmmakers will be diverted from other projects that could be just as good but also different, and Hollywood could use different.But I suppose I'm being unfair, not to mention unrealistic, since Hollywood ultimately sustains itself by producing the same type of content over and over again. So if we're inevitably going to get more \"Rocky\" movies, we should at least be grateful when they're given this kind of thought and attention. Plus, I must admit, there's something comforting about seeing the avuncular and gentle Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) every few years, watching him age across time. \"Creed\" even suggests the Italian Stallion has finally passed his torch to someone else and that perhaps we'll see an entirely new set of \"Rocky\"-like adventures, albeit with a different central character.His name would be Adonis \"Doni\" Creed (Michael B. Jordan), the illegitimate son of boxing legend Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), whom you'll recall was Rocky's opponent in the first two \"Rocky\" films and eventually his best friend, before dying in the ring in \"Rocky IV.\" At some point, though, Apollo had an affair and that relationship produced a son whom he never saw or supported. After young Doni's mother passes away, Apollo's widow, Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad), feels responsible for the boy. She visits the young hothead, who's prone to fights, in a Los Angeles youth facility and asks him if he wants to come live with her, taking on the role of surrogate mother. That was in 1998. Now it's 2015, and Doni, truly \"his father's son,\" routinely sneaks off from his cushy job at a financial firm to box in Mexico. Twelve hours later, he's back at his desk. Clearly, boxing is in the young man's blood, and he's determined to go professional and leave a legacy of his own, apart from his father, which is why he doesn't tell anyone who he really is. So Doni quits his job and moves to Philadelphia, where he seeks out Rocky as a trainer. Rocky, who still runs his own restaurant, is hesitant at first, but the kid gives him a new purpose, and so they begin training the old-school way, like waking up at the crack of dawn and running the streets of Philly, or chasing a chicken around the backyard to acquire speed and balance. Soon, Doni is winning local matches and word gets out of his true identity, which prompts the current lightweight champion, \"Pretty\" Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew), to challenge him in the ring to see if the son of Creed can \"really fight.\"Amidst his training, Doni fosters a relationship with Bianca (Tessa Thompson), an aspiring singer-songwriter, and we have to give the movie credit for actually taking the time to develop her character and for allowing Jordan and Thompson to really engage on-screen. Their one-on-one moments seem obligatory at first but the film lets them play out naturally and fully so they take on meaning. It helps, too, that the actors have strong presence and chemistry. Meanwhile, a subplot develops with Rocky as he must come to terms with his own mortality.The plot of \"Creed\" is by no means complicated, and much of it mirrors the original \"Rocky\" (1976), not to mention countless other sports movies, in regards to it structure. You know the drill: the underdog hero starts off lost and cocky and struggles with adversity and self-identity. Eventually, through hard work and determination, he gains knowledge, compassion and humility, thus coming out as victor, either literally or just in the eyes of himself, his family and his friends. We've seen this story hundreds of times, but what makes \"Creed\" special are its genuine human qualities. One could argue each of the characters is an archetype in a standard genre film, but the dialogue, performances and drama allow them to overcome that label. Director and co-writer Ryan Coogler (\"Fruitvale Station\") also adds some subtle, unexpected nuances to the storytelling that help overshadow the predictable plot. For instance, in one scene, Doni has a panic attack and needs to have his boxing gloves cut off immediately for reasons I won't reveal, although when you find out why, the moment will ring of one we've all experienced at one point or another. Praise should also be given to Claudia Castello and Michael P. Shawver's soft, rhythmic editing, which makes the drama really stick. So often in sports movies, excessive, rapid cutting prevents us from soaking everything in. But \"Creed\" takes its time, from a long take when Doni walks down the hall toward the climactic match, to the beauteous final shot, which could have been cheesy, but Coogler lends it grace and even the last line sounds perfectly right. Given how good \"Creed\" is, do I want them to make more \"Rocky\" movies? Honestly, no; we've seen our fair share and this one allows the series to end on a high note. I would, however, like to see more from Coogler, Jordan, Stallone and Thompson, perhaps all in the same film that tells a completely different story. Since they've shown they can breathe fresh life into a nearly 40-year-old franchise, how about they create an entirely new one altogether that's just as good? \"Creed\" makes me believe they can do it.",

    "review": "  Creed, like each of its six predecessors, is ostensibly a boxing film, and quite a good one. There are two featured fights: the first is intense and natural, punctuated by an artfully effective long take; the second is pure edge-of-your-seat action that, as clich�d as it sounds, really pumps you up. Thankfully, however, relative-newcomer Coogler recognizes what makes these movies great: not the boxing or even the plot, but the people. Creed is by no means super-original, but its big-hearted script and punchy performances soar it towards the top of the Balboa heap.Part continuation, part spin-off of the Italian Stallion saga, we meet Adonis, the son of Rocky?s one-time opponent / friend Apollo Creed, as he makes waves in the boxing community under the training of Balboa. Jordan, playing Creed, continues his assent to stardom, showing his hard-work and commitment in every frame. However, he still pales next to the Rocky character, one of the most lovable in all Hollywood cinema. Stallone wears Balboa like a wonderfully tailored old suit, playing the ever-deteriorating champ who, once the icon of running up flights of stairs, now struggles to get up a slight hill. Natural, funny, and ever-affable, Stallone puts himself deep in Oscar conversation, beautifully underlining his character?s optimistic exterior with soulful heartbreak from years of loss. This unrelenting passing of time is highlighted in an early line of the film: ?Time beat him. Time beats everybody; it?s undefeated.? But while this pessimistic realism may be the message, it is by no means the attitude; Creed is still very much a ?Rocky? film at its core: unabashedly earnest and crowd-pleasing.",

Just me and two talkers where all the Old Geezers Who Go To The Matinee Alone showed up, but except for the damn talking we enjoyed it. Sylvester Stallone takes his role out again and it is terrific. In this movie Stallone only acts and is Executive Producer (ever wonder what they do? I do) but the focus is on Michael B. Jordan, a very good young actor. The story proceeds like most boxing movies from the bad guys winning, the good guys having a crisis, the good guy comes back and works out and wins in the end. No spoiler there, all boxing movies are like that. Anyway I had a great time and might even go see it again.",

    "review": "  Works on every level: From passing the torch while simultaneously being a sequel and a reimagining/remake that somehow remains fresh to the chemistry between Jordan and Stallone's chemistry to a female lead with an original, natural romance element, this movie fires on all cylinders. The soundtrack and the tight direction add to it. Particular praise to Stallone as one of cinema's mostly fondly remembered characters shows his age.",

    "review": "  Creed is more than just a boxing movie or a Rocky spin-off. Its a varying tale of outgrowing one's parental shadow, identity, loss, and hope. Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa, as a trainer this time, but also gives the film some legitimacy. The film's boxing scenes are done smoothly without cuts, to heighten the brutal boxing matches between opponents. The movie is able to balance, drama, sports, and still provide a familiar but new story, with a new character. Most spin-offs are made for a quick buck, but Creed is one that can hold its head up high in that regard.",

But it is also enormously entertaining, wonderfully uplifting and features the best performance ever by Sylvestor Stallone. But is he really acting? As far as I am concerned he is really Rocky and his public persona is someone else. He is great as the aging Rocky Balboa who takes the young son of his old adversary and friend Apollo Creed under his wing to lead him to boxing greatness. Young Michael B Jordan as the young Creed is terrific, fulfilling the potential he showed many years ago as the youngster Wallace in The Wire. And don't think this movie is just for guys. My wife was shadow boxing throughout the boxing scenes throwing lefts and rights as she became caught up in the action. And the villain of the peace is from Liverpool England so he is very easy to hate. Highly recommended.",

    "review": "  Not as edgy as fellow 2015 boxing flick Southpaw, but tonally more consistent and featuring an equally brilliant central performance, this Rocky spinoff delivers the sort of fist pumping sports drama you would expect. Following Adonis \"son of Apollo\" Creed as he channels his anger into a boxing career, there's little variation from the tried-and-tested cinematic sporting formula, but it's executed with such flair and intensity that barely matters. Taking on both writing and helming duties, Ryan Coogler's technically marvellous direction finds fresh ways to capture both the drama and the action, dispelling any thoughts that his fantastic debut Fruitvale Station was a one-off. The training montages are traditional yet electric, the emotional beats are occasionally a little too melodramatic yet still pack a wallop, and the showdowns in the ring are ferocious and exhilarating. There's a truly awe-inspiring mid-film fight that is shot in one, long continuous take (aided by some cleverly hidden edits), which stands up as a genuine contender for the best sequence of the year. Bulked up and bringing the emotional heft, Michael B. Jordan puts Fantastic Four far in his review mirror with a compelling portrayal of a man attempting to step out from underneath another's shadow in order to craft his own legacy. Sylvester Stallone shakes off the cobwebs to return for the seventh time as the Italian Stallion, thankfully toning down his usual overwrought acting to offer a subtler supporting turn as Adonis' mentor and surrogate father. Serving up a hugely satisfying slice of sporting drama, both Coogler and Jordan demonstrate they are young Hollywood players to keep a close eye on.",

    "review": "  The name Rocky has become a home stable for many people since the release of the first film, and over the years the series has been going up and down in terms of quality. So after a implausible but still enjoyable finale to Rocky's legacy titled: Rocky Balboa, the director of my favorite indie film of 2013: Ryan Coogler decided to do a spin-off to this great series titled: Creed. And oh boy, this is what i hope Star Wars: The Force Awakens does that Creed did: Have a new fresh take for young and old adults while keeping the energy and spirit of the series alive. The film has many things that makes this not even close to ripping off the series: a great and moving story about Apollo Creed's unknown son, a emotional and very uplifting tone, great cinematography and boxing action that adds grip and tension to the film, and a spectacular performance from Michael B. Jordan and a LEGENDARY performance from Sylvester Stallone whose role as Rocky fits PERFECTLY in this film and shows that Stallone NEEDS to return to this type of role he once defined. Though only the final sequence is lackluster than the rest of the film, Creed definitely finds the spirit of not just Rocky Balboa but also his enemy and friend: Apollo Creed.",

    "review": "  My first impression of the announcement of CREED was that the movie was being produced as a way to continue milking a dead franchise for every penny that could be squeezed out of bored audiences. When I realized that Ryan Coogler would co-write and direct, I became a bit more excited about the movie. As it turns out, I should have been *much more excited. Coogler delivers an emotional powerhouse with CREED in addition to coordinating one of the most technically interesting movies of the year. Further, Coogler uses his film as a way to inject discourse on race, heritage, and aging. The story is packed with various character developments along with the expected boxing action. Somehow, though, nothing ever seems rushed or out of place. The story is both intricate and pieced together well. The movie is about the son of Rocky Balboa's greatest opponent: Apollo Creed. Creed's son, Adonis (Michael B. Jordan), finds himself attracted to fighting, but unable to get out from under his father's shadow. In his process of accepting his history, Adonis turns to Rocky for help while trying to make a name for himself as a boxer. Odie Henderson of the Chicago Sun-Times observes, regarding the climax of Adonis' journey, that \"the moment he owns up to his heritage is intertwined with the film's rousing, climactic boxing match but does not depend on it as a means of [his] acceptance\". The ending definitely serves up an interesting boxing match, but is far from a typical ending for the genre and features much more significant stakes than winning at a sporting event. Coogler's script and direction were no doubt invaluable to the success of the movie.Visual story-telling is equally as important as scripting, though. Coogler's CREED features excellent cinematographic moments throughout the whole feature. The style of cinematography adapts to the needs of the moment. Directorial and Director of Photography choices also well balance intimate moments with broad, environmentally sweeping ones. Other technical elements are noticeably outstanding as well - particularly, sound mixing and sound editing contribute to powerful visceral effects. While the tech elements are impressive, front and center in CREED is the wonderful ensemble. Michael B. Jordon brings attention to detail and makes interesting choices as always. Although, in my opinion, Phylisia Rashad and Sylvester Stallone steal the show in their supporting roles. Unfortunately, too little screen time is offered to Rashad. Stallone, on the other hand, makes a surprisingly heart-felt return to the role of Rocky and is given plenty of time shine. Rocky's outward and inward battles with age, death, purpose, and the role of family is heart-wrenching and fascinating to watch. Whether or not he receives it, Stallone deserves another nomination.The true \"winner\" here is Coogler, though. A young, black director, Coogler is very likely to be overlooked for awards attention (much like with his previous film efforts) even though his work is among the best I've seen this year. I can only cross my fingers that Coogler will receive the accolades he deserves. With or without awards, though - Coogler has offered up an interesting and important movie with CREED. In fact, its one of the best movies I've seen this year.",

    "review": "  It's easy to forget that the original Rocky was a masterpiece. A couple of terrible sequels will do that to popular perceptions. This also happened with Sylvester Stallone's other signature character Rambo, which had a truly excellent original thriller and weak, silly sequels. But I like to assert that there was great value in the character of Rocky Balboa and there were some later installments that did work. Rocky II and III were fun, above average efforts that handled character development in a way most mainstream franchises these days seem incapable of accomplishing. And sure IV and V were steaming pieces of garbage, but Rocky Balboa (2006) redeemed the character in a realistic and endearing turn. So a spin-off using an entirely new character may seem totally unnecessary. So why is this movie so damn good? Creed (no, not the crappy post-grunge band) centers around the son of Apollo Creed, Adonis, as he tries to hack out his destiny in the arena. Along the way, an older Rocky Balboa takes him on as an apprentice, serving as his Obi-Wan Kenobi like mentor. Both form a bond and learn to keep fighting in the face of tough odds. Creed doesn't break any mold, but it manages to fill it quite well, delivering a hard hitting but sentimental movie that both Rocky fans and general audiences will enjoy. Michael B. Jordan comes into his own as a leading man, proving that Hollywood really needs to start putting more diverse actors in roles such as these. He has the right amount of likeability and charisma that made Rocky such a relatable character in the original film. He commits fully and deserves credit for not using a body double during production, receiving all the punishment himself. Sylvester Stallone reminds us that yes, he can act. Old Sly provides much of the humor and light-hearted-ness of many scenes, while bringing a special type of gravitas to the film. This is a character that has grown immensely over the years, graduated from the school of hard knocks, and has much wisdom to offer to our protagonist. But what makes the picture exceptional is the back and forth between the two. There are funny moments as I mentioned before, but there are also touching and bittersweet scenes as well - on par with any awards season material this year. Creed is well directed and edited with Ryan Coogler accomplishing a masterful job helming his first large film with precision. The fight scenes are brutal and skillfully choreographed. The camera work is impressive, often revolving around the action and seemingly in one take. The final fight scene in particular, bears much in common with the climatic showdown at the end of the original film. In fact, I was quite impressed how reverential Creed was in relation to the rest of the franchise, treating all the previous movies as canon, even the bad ones. Furthermore, while these are used as background, they are not exploited or rehashed as one might expect. The love interest for the main character was completely tacked on and unnecessary and proves to be the sole weakness. So yes, you need to see this film. It is, in my opinion, the best since Rocky III, a good start to a new spin-off franchise, and one of the best dramas of the year. It goes the distance.",

The movie starts off kind of typical and seems to be cliche. But, a little after the mid point, the writing really gets good and the movie gets deep and emotional. Unfortunately, this is the point where Stallone becomes the main character and Jordan becomes the supporting actor. Nevertheless at this point, the chemistry between Stallone and Jordan really become remarkable and brings the movie to another level. The movie also has great fighting cinematography and choreography, which gives the movie a lot of excitement. Even though this movie is trying to be a stand alone movie and a reboot, it is definitely a sequel because the movie doesn't really start getting to be an excellent movie until we feel the emotion from Rocky. Also, when that Rocky music comes on, you know it's on. Don't get me wrong, Jordan does great, and later in the movie you start understanding Creed's pain as well. With all of this said, It is a must see.",

    "review": "  Adonis Johnson never knew his famous father,world heavy weight champion Apollo Creed, who died before he was born. Still, there's no denying that boxing is in his blood, so Adonis heads to Philadelphia, the site of Apollo Creed's legendary match with a tough upstart named Rocky Balboa. Rocky sees in Adonis the strength and determination he had known in Apollo - the fierce rival who became his closest friend. [Rotten Tomatoes]Let's get this out of the way: Creed is hype. It's got the raw grit and the perfectly calculated emotional beats of Fruitvale Station. It's got two of the best powerhouse performances of the year; that by Michael B. Jordan as Adonis and Sylvester Stallone as an older, melancholic version of Rocky. Stallone deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor this year because he killed it. It was really astonishing to see Stallone give his best performance in years.Ryan Coogler's debut film, Fruitvale Station, is one of my favorite biopics and a truly beautiful drama that I deeply cherish. As one would expect, Coogler's direction was top-notch and it elevated Creed above your typical boxing movie trappings. Hands down, this film is the best boxing movie since The Fighter in 2010. It more than makes up for the disappointment I found Southpaw to be. I appreciated how the script, written by Coogler and Aaron Convington, knew how to cater to all generations. It's hella nostalgic and I love how there's a great balance between the old and the new.The best part of the film is the fight sequences, directed with flawless grace by Coogler. The action is heavy and intense, the sound design makes sure that you feel every hit and the first two major fights are enough to get your blood pumping and adrenaline rushing long after the credits roll. The one-take fight around the half-way point is the best sequence I've seen in a film this year. It was so perfectly done and when it was finished, I almost fell over. I felt like I was taking each punch and that is something to praise.Another highlight of the film is the absolutely fantastic score. It's epic and loud and empowering. I loved how ambitious Ludwig G�ransson's approach to it was. Also, all the various artists that accompany the soundtrack help turn Creed into a great technical beast. It was sweet to hear \"The Fire\" by The Roots & John Legend at a high point in this movie. Lastly, a really cool idea was to have Tessa Thompson performing original songs, as well as acting as Bianca, the love interest of Adonis.Creed is a must-see knockout and one of the best films of 2015. It's emotionally complex, choreographed with technical finesse and acted beautifully. I was fighting back the tears a few times throughout the run-time and that's a good thing. If you love boxing movies, this is the one you've been waiting for. Creed knocked me off my feet and it was a wicked experience. Highly recommended.",

    "review": "  (4/5) You might not expect much more than a cash grab judging from the concept of Creed, but don't worry, because director Ryan Coogler will make you care. This is at once an intimate character drama and an exhilarating sports film in great balance. Coogler is faithful to the environment and emotional concentration he captured with Fruitvale Station, but Creed showcases his abilities even more, leaving me convinced that he can do just about anything.The environment that Coogler creates here is similar to that of his great independent hit, Fruitvale Station. Both take place in small cities and highlight a grittiness that reflects a unique and underrepresented perspective in cinema. His film does not, for the sake of Hollywood, shy away from having a black voice. It's refreshing that Coogler is confident about sticking to his roots and showcasing what he knows. Creed is certainly a Rocky film and has plenty of references to the old ones, but works, as I'd hoped, entirely on its own, thanks to a director who makes films that are distinctly his.Coogler spends a lot of time with his characters, increasing the emotional stakes and creating genuine tension between them so that we care for far more than just the boxing. He manages to get great performances out of actors Michael B Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, and Tessa Thompson. Jordan convinces us of his character's innate aggression and will to fight, but certainly allows us to see his insecurities and emotional side. Tessa Thompson gives far more depth to her character than one might expect. Her unique interests make her a well-rounded character, and Thompson gives her character a fitting amount of wittiness, intelligence, and independence that is rare to see in her type of role. Stallone relives his character in an extremely grounded way that exposes subtle emotional turmoil. The boxing scenes in Creed are exhilarating. The first boxing scene is more intimate, small scaled and personal, filmed all in a single shot. Each punch feels so real that audiences will cringe at every hard blow. The single shot captures an intensity and moment of exhilaration for Adonis. The finale boxing sequence is filmed completely differently, but is equally effective. This time the stakes are much higher and the fight is being broadcast nationally, and we get broadcasting narration, which is put to surprisingly well use. The editing brings this scene together fantastically, as we cut between shots we'd see on television to more intimate shots, to reactions of Adonis' loved ones. Although this scene makes a heavier use of editing, it never uses editing to disguise the punches, and evokes that same cringe-worthy feeling from the audience as the first match did. What kept me from loving Creed is that for all the time it spends with its characters, and for how developed they are, I didn't feel that the character's spiritual motivations were as strong as they could have been. Certain issues in Adonis's life as well as Rocky and his girlfriend's life could have been explored deeper to give the film a more triumphant feeling that wasn't just accomplished through the fighting. That doesn't mean Creed is a flat film thematically, but it didn't bring a level of depth I think it could have for the great characters it built. Audiences should flock to the theaters to see Creed and will flock away very satisfied with not only the boxing, but with the characters, weather they wanted a character-driven movie or not.",

    "review": "  Somewhere after hitting commercial and critical gold to the tune of two Oscar statues with the first Rocky, Sylvester Stallone created a musclebound, bulletproof, campy 80's alter ego: Sly. The Sylvester who penned a beautiful script about a down-and-out boxer who makes the best of a gift opportunity to enter the ring against a brash champion had been vanquished by the loud bombast of the umpteenth Rambo sequel. Look no further than the latest Expendables movie if you want the Ne Plus Ultra of Stallone's schlocky 80's roided, orange, action man. The last thing I expected walking into this movie was any resembling a return to form of a soulful Stallone. He's back and, if you'll excuse the pun, he's added a few wrinkles to his game. In Creed, he's essentially swapped roles with Micky from the from the first 3 movies. Now Michael B. Jordan playing the upstart boxer and Stallone is now the grizzled old trainer. As much as I enjoyed the previous Rocky films, the boxing fan in much grimaced during each of the boxing scenes. Not from thunderous blows landed but by how exaggerated the actual boxing choreography was. In Creed, they finally get it right. In fact, the actual boxing in depicted this film might be the most realistic portrayal of sweet science in any movie ever. Much of the credit goes to the director and cinematographer for the staging but also to Michael B. Jordan for really selling it. In fact, every boxer Creed faces in this film was played by real boxers and Jordan's scenes with them hardly ever hit a false note. It was really nice to see Stallone the actor back on screen in perhaps his last Rocky film. After a period of unsuccessful actioners, Stallone sought after smaller roles to showcase his acting. He even appeared in Copland opposite of acting heavyweights like De Niro and Keitel. Whatever his acting aspirations were, Stallone will certainly be remembered more for his macho action films. But just this one, it was good to be in the company of the understated, loving Rocky we all knew and loved. If the Rocky franchise is the definitive work of Stallone's career, then he can rest assured that he's passed his baby on to Ryan Coogler's caring, confident hands. This wasn't simply a case of a fresh-faced but fledgling director acting as a hired gun: Coogler wrote this script and his directorial choices breathe new life into what could have been an exploitative, by-the-numbers cash grab. Sports movies about struggling athletes are a mindfield at this point with so many opportunities for missteps. Jordan really kills the role as Creed's illegitimate son seeking to step out of his father's shadow but also try to be the man that he was. And for a young director stepping up to his first mainstream film, Coogler really knocks this one out of the park. This is the second film the actor and director have made together and the chemistry is obvious. Just as Rocky was the big break Stallone needed to launch his career, here's to Creed for giving Coogler and Jordan the breakthrough they deserve. And here's to more of their shared work together in the future, cinema will the better for it.",

    "review": "  Creed revives a the Rocky films in a new and modern way. I enjoyed how they kept the romance light and short, to focus more on Adonis and Rocky and their relationship. Overall enjoyable film to set up a possible new franchise with Creed and Michael B Jordan, who is a beast in this by the way. I would give it an 8.",

    "review": "  A thoughtful, thrilling resurrection/spinoff of the Rocky franchise that encompasses pretty much everything that makes a good sports movie. Stallone has never been more effective as he is here, while Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan continue to show why they're one of the most exciting pairings in recent times. Loved every second.",

    "review": "  VIEWS ON FILM review by Jesse BurlesonYou gotta hand it to Sylvester Stallone. About fifteen years ago, I figured his career had been left for dead. Somehow with his revision of Rambo, his clout to get studios to make those Expendable movies, and his relentless drive to revitalize an old, punch-drunk boxer, he's gotten into Hollywood's good graces once again. Heck, back in the day I used to quip, \"Sly who?\"Anyway, unless you've been living on a desert island via the last four decades, you'll know that Creed (my latest review) is indeed the 7th film in the storied, Rocky saga. Everyone in character Rocky Balboa's life, is gone. That includes his spouse Adrian, his brother-in-law Paulie, his trainer Mickey, and his old boxing rival Apollo. But hey, nothing can stop Stallone and company from milking every bit of the Italian Stallion's account till it runs bone dry. That's why he brought in director Ryan Coogler (he did Fruitvale Station) along with his budding movie star, Michael B. Jordan (he was the lead in Fruitvale Station). Translation: This is yet a bland Rocky entry but a mature, valiant effort. It's on par with Rocky Balboa (2006), it's a lot better than Rocky V (I'd hope so), and it has moments that are deeper and more subdued than Rocky IV (\"I must break you\" ha ha). Somewhere somehow though, I can still hear the late Burgess Meredith saying, \"I'm going on a permanent vacation\". Rocky being an Irwin Winkler-produced franchise with its obligatory training sequences and its obligatory final fights, should probably just do the same.Containing a film score that feels less compelling this time around (probably because Bill Conti wasn't at the helm) and featuring sound effects inhibiting a hammer slamming into a cookie sheet, Creed delves into Apollo's illegitimate son, Adonis (Michael B. Jordan). Adonis never knew his deceased dad but subconsciously, he always had the need to fight, to punch someone with plenty of lefts and rights. At the beginning of the proceedings, he's a teenager, serving time in a Los Angeles youth facility. When Apollo's actual widow shows up to take him in, Adonis goes with her, finally knowing who his father is and eventually finding out what he wants to do with his life. Cut to 2015 and he's winning fights in Mexico while working at a securities firm on the side. He eventually quits his job, moves to the fighting city of Philadelphia, and seeks out a man who had a long history with his pops. That would be Mr. Rocky Balboa. After some resistance from wanting to train the youthful Adonis, old Rocco caves in knowing that this youngin wants to be the light heavyweight champion of the world. \"Baby\" Creed in time, wins one big fight and then somehow gets a title shot in Liverpool, England. It's all far-fetched stuff but then again, so is the grizzled adage, \"it's only a movie\".Now the main asset in Creed, is how its story translates easily from the events in the previous Philadelphia slugger installments. It would make sense that Rocky would now be too old to fight. It would make sense that Rocky still ran a restaurant and was open to training a young buck. It would make sense that Apollo Creed's son would come knocking on Rocky's door salivating for sparring advice. Finally, it would make sense that Rocky would go back to grieve Adrian and Paulie at their respective grave sites (for reasons unknown, the Paulie Pennino character kicks the bucket circa 2012). My biggest misstep involving this flick however, is how the lead troupers (mainly Michael B. Jordan and romantic interest Tessa Thompson) fail to meet the demands of selling Creed's most considerable and most substantial scenes. Basically, they turn it into something that lacks the dramatic heft of the earlier movies and the entertainment value/popcorn feel of Rocky III and Rocky IV. What's left is a slow-burning affair, a vehicle that goes through the motions and renders itself vapid. As the end credits rolled, all I wanted to do was revisit Mr. T's portrayal in 1982, Rocky and Apollo's second Superfight in 1979, and Philly's favorite son hitting the proverbial meat back in 76'. It's all in the (collection addition) DVD set and it comes pretty cheap at Best Buy. My overall rating: 2 and a half stars.Of note: There's been talk about Stallone possibly getting an Academy Award nomination for his work in Creed. I'll admit, he knows the character well and occasionally, has some heartfelt moments. But Oscar? Come on. In all seriousness it seems like a bit of a stretch don't you think?",

Creed finds director Ryan Coogler making a more commercial transition after the success of his indie film Fruitvale Station, but sacrifices none of his razor-sharp filmmaking tactics. The film just carries a weight too it that most modern sports movie exudes, as it's plausible, semi-gritty, and ultimately triumphant. Is it groundbreaking? Hardly, but audiences with reasonable expectations and a yearning for a real underdog story will get there money's worth and then some.",

    "review": "  Ryan Coogier's wonderfully rousing new entry in the Rocky legacy. It tells the engrossing story of Adonis \"Hollywood\" Johnson, the illegitimate son of the late great heavyweight boxing champion, Apollo Creed, who died before he was born, Adonis is superbly played by Michael B. Jordan, in a truly sensational performance that is filled with fire and conviction. Adonis is a gifted fighter in his own right and is making his way up the ranks, while trying to face his father's legacy. But Adonis is up against a tremendously dangerous fighter by the name Leo \"The Lion\" Sporino, well-played by Gabe Rosado, for this upcoming match he seeks out his late father's best friend and opponent the legendary former heavyweight boxing champion Rocky Baloba as a mentor and trainer, played magnificently again by the scene-stealing Sylvester Stallone returning to his iconic signature role, his impressive surprisingly subtle performance has already won him the National Board of Review Critic's Award for Best Supporting Actor. What follows is a brilliant well-crafted motion picture of style and substance that exhilarates and has the audience rooting for the underdog, thanks to Coogier's masterful direction. The edge of your seat boxing sequences are fiercely intense and visceral. Solid entertainment from beginning to end, and an exceptional crowd pleaser. Highly Recommended.",

There were a few questions I realized later that weren't answered, loose ends from the previous Rocky Balboa movie, but we're moving forward here, not looking back.In Creed, Adonis Creed ascends to his birthright, with Rocky's help. The torch is passed.Adonis Creed is a natural born fighter, the son of boxing champion Apollo Creed, who died in the ring decades ago fighting Russian champion Ivan Drago. With his birth parents dead, Adonis receives the love of a good woman who decides to become his guardian and raise him right. Eventually, Adonis seeks a mentor to help him take his natural ability to a higher level. His new mentor is Rocky, of course. This is a beautiful friendship for both of them. Rocky has come full circle into his own mentor Mickey's role. He's ready to help young Creed rise up, and Creed also helps motivate and support Rocky as he fights his own great battle, a battle for his life.It's both a fun and touching story. There's a romance, too. Looks like it's love at first sight when Creed meets his beautiful new neighbor, Bianca. He gets busy trying to win her, while also working on preparing for fights.The story and the fighting are well done, satisfying. Could the ending be any more picture perfect? Clearly, this story was made to continue, with Creed II, Creed III, etc. I'm looking forward to it.",

    "review": "  Creed is the Rocky reboot we didn't know was coming. In 1976, Apollo Creed takes on unknown Rocky Balboa in an exhibition match that nobody believed would last 3 rounds. Rocky demonstrates an almost immortal ability to take punishment and stands toe to toe with the Champ. Twenty nine years later Apollo Creeds illegitimate son shows up on Rocky's door step to ask the aging, now restaurateur, former champ to help him train. At first Rocky declines, but soon comes to see something worthy in the young Creed and agrees. From there we see nearly the same story that we saw in 1976. The young Creed isn't taken seriously but is invited by the current champ \"Pretty Ricky\" to enter the ring. Ricky's intended opponent suffer a broken jaw at Ricky's hand during a promotional session ending a million dollar bought. Young Creed of course says yes and we see nearly the same fight we saw in '76.Don't let that turn you off, it worked in 1976 and it works in 2015. Michael B. Jordan brings a surprising amount of depth to a troubled kid who spent half his life in Juvenile Hall and the other half growing up with the widow of Apollo Creed. For his part Stallone reprises his Rocky character, a simple man with few needs who just wants to live a quiet life surrounded by the memorabilia of his days in the sun while waiting out his time to join his dead wife and brother in law in the afterlife.Creed pulls all the right strings at all the right times. These two men, both suffering from different injuries, bring healing to each other. Creed learns that there are actually people in his life he can trust and Rocky learns that there's something to live for after all.I give this two thumbs up.",

    "review": "  The movie \"Creed\" is an epic follow up to the Rocky movie franchise. From the beginning the movie automatically pulls you in and attaches you to the main character Adonis \"Doni\" by following him from his rough journey as a troubled youth in and out of foster homes to current day Adonis, the illegitimate son of professional boxer Apollo Creed. This is not just another boxing movie this movie is about the fight for survival and the fight for who you want to be in life. Doni leaves his life of luxury in LA to move to Philadelphia in hopes of training with the one man who had beaten his father in a fight \"The Italian Stallion\" Rocky Balboa. As Doni and Rocky's relationship starts to grow so does Doni not just as a fighter but as a person overall. This movie is fantastic and has something for everyone action, romance, and some tear jerker moments.",

    "review": "  So as it turns out one of the best Rocky movies is not even a Rocky movie. I thought that the trailer looked interesting, but my expectations were not all that high. I was hoping for something that was at least as decent as Rocky Balboa, but based on the story line, I was half expecting something along the lines of Rocky V... Well all I have to say is WOW! I love coming out of a movie that defies my expectations and surprises me like that. The story was fantastic and felt like it had a lot of heart. The directing was really good... It maintained the \"Rocky feel\" but brought something new that made it a bit unique. The acting was great and Sylvester Stallone did an amazing job at playing a Rocky that we are not use to seeing. This is easily better then the last 3 Rocky movies... It felt really good in the same way that the first 3 did. I really hope that they don't continue to spin things off in to a new franchise... Because this was the perfect ending to an old one. 4.5 stars",

Still, the Rocky movies are just whatever to me. However, I, like many people, heard some buzz about Creed, and it got me curious, and so I decided to give this film a chance, and I am pleased to say that I am so very glad that I did. Creed isn't just a good sequel/spin-off to the Rocky movies, it's simply a good movie. Well directed, acted, shot, lit, scored, etc. Creed is worthy of Academy Nominations across the board, especially, and surprisingly, from Sylvester Stallone.

    "review": "  CREED is not only the best film to feature the character of Rocky Balboa since 1976's ROCKY, it is also one of the strongest movies of 2015, featuring a thoughtful script, excellent performances, and dynamite direction. Implementing a storyline that is an extension of the ROCKY series more than it is a real sequel, Michael B. Jordan's Adonis is very clearly the focus, with Sylvester Stallone's Balboa being a true supporting figure, albeit one with a strong character arc of his own. The script is surprisingly sensitive as it charts its course, just as it is structured incredibly well; it's also a testament to the script that the movie's romantic subplot feels entirely of-a-piece and not some kind of distraction (this is also aided by very appealing work from Tessa Thompson, who has great chemistry with Jordan). Jordan has a magnetic star presence, and he handles Adonis - who could be a tricky guy to portray - with total ease; this is a guy with a chip on his shoulder, and who is insecure, but who is also a fundamentally decent and good person. Stallone, for his part, contributes career-best work; that might be damning-with-faint-praise to some, but Sly's effort here is deeply moving, with several moments of powerful emotion that (importantly) are not overplayed. Speculation of awards potential for Stallone's performance is absolutely warranted. Co-writer/director Ryan Coogler is the other key piece of the puzzle, and his direction is energetic, visceral, and engaging throughout; this is a guy who clearly \"gets it,\" who knows how to shoot and stage things with both a classical eye and style/personality (there's a single take fight in the middle of the movie that is thrilling and inventive). His contributions to the script are equally impressive, because the movie completely works as an installment of a franchise, while also saying something truly personal. Longtime fans of the ROCKY movies will surely dig this film, but those who are arriving at the material with fresh and impartial eyes will almost certainly a lot of things to enjoy. Engrossing throughout, CREED is a great movie.",

    "review": "  Creed isn't the seventh film in the Rocky franchise. It's the first movie in a franchise about Adonis Creed, the son of the famed boxer Apollo Creed. As the name implies, it's about a self-taught fighter trying to break into the boxing world under his own name instead of riding the reputation of his famous father. The movie is good with no complaints. There is however one important thing to point out. Creed is directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Michael B Jordan. This is important because it's the duo that directed and starred in 'Fruitville Station', the real life story of the death of Oscar Grant. If you haven't seen Fruitville you're missing something powerful and great. Creed isn't as powerful but just as good at following Jordan through a range of emotions. There isn't much to say about Stallone as Rocky Balboa, the movie isn't about him. Stallone, like his character plays a supporting role taking Creed in and training him when no one else would. There is a lot of significance here. While Balboa passes the boxing torch to Creed, Stallone passes the torch of the franchise to Jordan. In the end, Creed overcomes the battle with his demons. It's also clear that Michael B Jordan has overcome the reputation of 'Fantastic Four'. And the big screen is better off for because of both.",

    "review": "  Before I get started on this review, I should let the public know that my review maybe slightly inaccurate as I watched this film hungover running on 4 hours sleep and catching the 9;30pm session. I still stand by this review, if this changes after I watch this movie a second time i'll update my review. I apologise for my unprofessionalism as I know hundreds, dare I say thousands of people rely on my reviews.If anybody asks me what my favourite movie of all time is my answer is Rocky, it doesn't even matter which part i'm referring too. Rocky is the best movie of all time for me full stop. So I had been waiting for this movie to hit for a long time super excited. My expectations and hopes were sitting so high but that all came crashing down 3rd nov 2015.I was very disappointed to find out Sly hadn't written or directed this movie, everybody knows Rocky was built on Sly's back so the thought of someone else writing and directing this film annoyed me.I've given this movie 2 and a half stars which means it was a decent watch but I would by no means call this movie great. Not only was the movie predictable (yes I know all rocky movies are predictable) but it was long (2 and a half hours) I found myself just wanting the movie to end so I could go home and go to sleep. The movie revolved around Adonis and Biancas relationship way too much. I guess the director wanted to follow the style of Rocky 1 (Adrien and Rockys relationship) but I found myself yawning every time these two love birds graced us with 15 minute scenes filled with cuddling and small talk.Rocky and Adonis on the otherhand had really good chemistry together the movie should have focused more on their relationship or perhaps focus on Adonis's journey a little more.Michael B Jordan was great, I don't have a bad thing to say about him he looked the part and his performance was solid. The producers should have spent a little more money and hired Zoe Kravitz to play Bianca but that's neither here nor there. For a while there I felt like I was watching Stomp The Yard and not a Rocky movie. This movie turned too ghetto for my liking. Rumour has it Chris Brown will be in the next installment and Fetty Wap will be providing the soundtrack :)Adonis's training montage was the worst i've ever seen out of all 7 movies. At one point he was running and yelling while random people were on dirt bikes doing tricks and burnouts which made zero sense whatsoever but okay.And all of this led us right to the predictable ending of Adonis going the distance, which I have no problem with but for me it was bitter-sweet because the build up was done poorly. It was like getting on a rollercoaster that went slow the whole ride but had an awesome ending. By then it's just too late. By all means its not a bad movie I'll gladly watch this movie again on a nice cool day when I have nothing else to do but I just didn't feel the \"Rocky\" magic in this movie. The first time I saw Rocky 1 I joined boxing classes (and quit a month later) I used to watch the training montages from part 2, 3, and 4 before every workout I did. Even \"Rocky Balboa\" made me wanna run straight to the gym! \"Creed\" on the other had made me tired and hungry the only thing I was inspired to do was to sleep. I wouldn't call \"Creed\" the worst instalment but if I had to choose between watching \"Rocky V\" and \"Creed\" it would actually be a tough decision. Good try to the producers and writters hopefully the next instalment will be better. Sly is a hero of mine so it was still great to see him on screen as \"Rocky\"Definitely worth the watch, a hell of a lot better than \"South Paw\" don't let me get started on that heap of junk. But I must say I was disappointed. 2 and a half stars from YakBrah",

    "review": "  I heard Creed was good. I had no idea it was THIS good. Coming off of the brilliant Fruitvale Station, Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan are back collaborating for the Rocky spinoff, Creed. Knowing how well made of a film Fruitvale Station is, I figured Coogler was the right guy to helm the film but for some reason I was still skeptical about the project in general. The story itself is fascinating but I didn't know if it would be handled with the care needed to produce a quality installment in this legendary franchise. Not only is this a great boxing film, it's one of the best all around films of the year. Everything you love from the original films is here in at least some capacity and the nostalgia is at an all time high. I haven't seen all of the Rocky films but I love the characters and aesthetic of the series enough for Creed to emotionally resonate with me multiple times throughout the film. A lot of people are going to complain that it's too similar to the first Rocky, and while that may be a valid criticism, I think you can make the case that great films always take from the best. Creed has the best aspects from the original films and takes an original spin on it.Most notably being that our lead character, Adonis Johnson (son of Apollo Creed) isn't like Rocky Balboa at all. He has the passion and fire but his background is completely different. He's from Hollywood and due to his father being a heavyweight champion, he's well off as well. I really like this twist on the boxing film. As much as I really liked Southpaw from earlier this year, Creed really hits on all levels. The acting is getting a lot of credit and rightfully so. I don't know that Sylvester Stallone has ever been better. Michael B. Jordan, who may have been snubbed for an Oscar a few years back, is just as good. I think because of how good Stallone is in a supporting role, you don't realize how perfect Jordan is in this role.The directing from Ryan Coogler and cinematography from Maryse Alberti is marvelous. The camera work and shot selection alone is worth seeing on the big screen, and then probably seen again. All the fight scenes are good, but the first big fight Creed has is quite simply one of the most well choreographed scenes of 2015. It is all done in one continuous few minute take. I really couldn't believe how well that was handled.But by far the biggest thing I took away from this film was that it doesn't try to be something it's not. It knows it's a spinoff from Rocky and it plays on that in a perfect way. Yet it also doesn't rely on the nostalgia factor alone, though it does have some great callbacks to the old films. It doesn't take unnecessary risks or try to do too much with its plot. It is just one of the best executed films of the year. The entertainment value is just as much if not more than the superhero films this year, and it also has a well written story, directed to perfection, along with a fantastic sound design/mixing/editing, with incredible performances all around. What's not to love about this movie?+Stallone at his career best+Impressive direction+Contained story+Awesome fight scenes+Sound design+Nostalgia9.6/10",

    "review": "  Creed was...wow. From the previews I had high hopes and knew it was going to be good. But I had no idea it was going to be like this. This movie was phenomenal. Creed did so many things right to create such a beautiful film. One of the best things Creed does is not relying on all the old Rocky elements but still bring back some aspects that we all loved. I like how Rocky had his little ball, the chicken scene was funny, and I loved how in Rocky II when all the little kids start following rock to the theme music, but in Creed all the bike guys start following Adonis to a sick rap song. Now that got me hyped. Ryan Coogler comes up with a brilliant idea and directs a masterpiece which can be an amazing franchise. All the characters in the film are so well developed. Each actor gives such a great performance that make the movie that much more amazing. The movie in a nutshell, Adonis Creed, son of the famous Apollo Creed, wants to be a fighter like his father but not under his name and start from his own. He gets in to fights as a kid, in and out of jail, and the hardest thing not growing up with his father. Michael B. Jordan shows us he can do anything. He perfectly played this role and gave one of the best performances of the year. His emotion, anger, and determination throughout the film is memorizing. And Stallone,(supporting actor nomination?) you can tell he wanted to give his all in this film. He brings back all the great elements of Rocky's character that we saw in the better original films. The chemistry between Rocky and Adonis is excellent. A man who needs a role model in his life connecting with a man who just needs someone in his life. The emotion, drama, and boxing scenes are so well balanced and portrayed, There are a lot of scenes between the main characters that are quite touching and are very well made. The boxing scenes and montages. WOW. There is so much to say about the fight scenes that I have to keep it short. The shots were great, and the fighting was so fun to watch. Great ending, Creed was one of the best films I have seen in awhile. Beautifully shot, directed, and acted. Creed is a movie not just to watch for its boxing, but for the incredible story as well.",

    "review": "  Superb entry in the \"Rocky\" franchise that stays true to the original while moving the series in an exciting new direction. The cast is excellent, with Michael B. Jordan giving a breakthrough lead performance, instantly charismatic while believable as a boxer (his physique is insane). The highlight, though, is Sly Stallone returning to his iconic role, this time playing a supporting role as a trainer while delivering a nuanced turn as Rocky slowly comes back to life when Creed enters his. Behind the camera, writer/director Ryan Coolger pays fine tribute to the previous films while keeping the movie more down to earth. Nothing feels cheesy and even the classic 'Rocky' theme is only used at the right moment. The boxing is superbly filmed as well, especially the first fight, with appears to be in just one take. The only quibble is the absence of Rocky's son, Robert, which is explained at first but events later in the film leave you questioning where he's at. Despite that, this is not only the best Rocky sequel to date but one of the most entertaining & crowd-pleasing movies of the year.",

However, the old man found it in the annals of his brain to come up with Creed. This last iteration is not only great but it's a total flashback to the original. It's actually about boxing and while it has it's share of fluff it really is a fighters movie. Creed is a really good movie and it has all the ingredients for a surprise Oscar run. In fact it would be a travesty if Sly doesn't get the nomination as best supporting actor. Thatsaid, the most important thing about this movie is that they finally give Apollo the respect he deserves. Not only was he the best rival Rockhead ever faced but he was the best fighter ever. When Adonis had flashbacks with the old man fighting, I almost soiled my pants.",

    "review": "  Perhaps just a little bit too sentimental to be a classic, this is still an excellent film with three Oscar-worthy performances. Although the fight sequences are typically storybook, the action is realistic and intense. The chemistry between Jordan and Stallone is evident throughout and their bond as uncle and nephew (the way Jordan's character perceives their relationship) is believable. Tessa Thompson provides a more modern take on the hero's romantic interest providing strength, rather than serving as a diversion. The story, though far-fetched, seems believable within the context in which it is told. The ending is riveting; I heard gasps and \"come ons\" from the audience. Based on the conclusion, it seems clear that the intent is to make another Creed film. As was the case for Rockys II through VI, the bar will be very high for any sequels. Although it's impossible to top the original, this movie is, in my opinion, a clear second.",

Creed goes back to the roots of what made the original Rocky so good and even goes it's own path. There are some winks and nods to the originals but this isn't a simple reboot. I think it's well written, it absolutely is well shot, and well acted with a terrific musical score. Sly Stallone isn't the focal point but he is very good and so is Michael Jordan. There's plenty of depth to these characters that simply builds from a pretty slow beginning to a fantastic third act. The middle fight scene goes down as one of the well shot sports scenes in film history with a continuous no cut camera during the entire fight. The beginning is a bit slow, but this is one of my favorite movies of the year.",

    "review": "  Too often Hollywood falls into a rut when it involves some of its most famous franchises (Terminator comes to mind first) by keeping its aging star at the forefront of future movies it produces. In a complete about face, Creed levels that trend with an emotional, yet believable rise of a new young boxer played by the true star of the movie, Michael B Jordan.Rocky Balboa was truthfully a movie that didn't make any sense yet still allowed the character to have his day in the spotlight once again. Move over Sylvester Stallone. Passing off the \"Rocky\" franchise to Apollo Creed's illegitimate son Adonis was a near flawless way to continue making these movies. That being said, I don't necessarily think they need ANOTHER one, but you should definitely expect it this day and age with all the remakes and reboots and sequels we see.Let's start with Sly. He delivered his best performance at this age in this movie. Hands down. While nothing about it screams Oscar-worthy, it's the most relaxed and at home in the 'Rocky' role he's been in since he started making them. This is the tale of coming full circle you want to see from someone as beloved across the movie community as Rocky is. For a guy who lost just about everything near and dear to him, it was incredibly easy to empathize with the character throughout the movie when some major decisions force his hand late in the film.Jordan was fit, fast and loose as Adonis. We get a bit of a rushed look into his upbringing that gives you the basics on why he wants to be a fighter, but even with the fast tutorial on his younger years, that's easy to overlook as a small nuisance by kicking things off fast and heavy after the time jump to his 20s where the bulk of the film takes place. Jordan and director Ryan Coogler did Fruitvale Station together. Their chemistry is easily seen.The love interest, played by Tessa Thompson, came off as organic and believable. There's a subtle contrast between her approach to music and Jordan's approach to boxing. While it's no \"Adriaaaaan\" kind of relationship, it does the job.My only other knock on the film was the opposing fighters. The first big fight was well done. In fact, probably done better than the final fight. Though it was shorter, it had more pop. That's not to say the second (and main) fight was bad...it lacked that same ferocity in the buildup. And that has everything to do with the guy he was fighting who looked NOTHING like a boxer. There was a great knockout in that final fight that knocks you back in your seat, but aside from that, getting someone who looked the part (and a little more imposing) would have helped.Creed is a standout sports film that does everything you want from an up-and-comer. The film rises with its star character and is anchored by its veteran. If they made another, would I be surprised? No. Am I looking for it in a year or two or three? No. Would I take it? If it was anything like this...absolutely.",

The idea to have Apollo Creed's son meet up with Rocky is the only way a 7th film could have ever overcome the odds against any critical opponents in the other corner of the ring. Michael B Jordan's portrayal of Adonis Creed is amazing and highlights the impressive talent of the young actor. On the opposite age spectrum is Sylvester Stallone, Hey Yo, who shows why Rocky is still the champ while also creating an undisputed chemistry with Jordan. Creed's plot, music, acting, and the film as a whole are the best of 2015, you know? Even if the tryptophan of Thanksgiving Turkey is making you sleepy, go out and see Creed. If you get there and still can't open your eyes from being so full, simply say \"Cut Me Mick\" and watch a Knock Out!",

Adonis Johnson is just a made up character, fighting a choreographed fight that was shot on a movie set with countless takes-retakes. Still, I literally moved as if I had to bob & weave right along with Adonis as he fought through each round. That's a sign of investment. Kudos to Michael B Jordan and Ryan Coogler for making Adonis a likable albeit flawed millennial - much easier said than done! The emotional rollercoaster ride and all the talk of battling memories and the feelings of loss that a adult child has to deal with when losing a parent(s) got me thinking about struggle and responsibility and all that business. As a dude who grew up with a father who was widely respected from the streets to the pulpit, and whose name was bigger than most, I found myself getting a little verklempt; then, I shook it off and remembered it was a damned movie spin-off of Rocky, son.

    "review": "  After a few years in development and a lengthy stretch in a rumor mill, the spinoff to the Rocky franchise Creed is here and it is hands down one of the finest sports films in recent memory and is a standout entry into one of film's most notorious franchises. There is so much to say about this movie I will try to get through this so let's start with the story. The story here revolves around the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, Adonis, and his struggles to find himself as a boxer as well himself growing up in the shadow of his father. In order to do this he seeks the help of his father's friend Rocky Balboa and thus we have the makings of a spectacular film. This film sounds simple but the excellence lies in the execution of this film. Director Ryan Coogler has crafted a truly thrilling film here with outstanding boxing sequences as well as truly touching and moving dramatic scenes that make this film stand out above the rest. Coogler made this movie look pristine but it is also worth mentioning that the sound and music department did their job and compliment this movie extremely well. The script here is also fantastic with dialogue that is both simple but complex in it's delivery that even harkens back to the glory days of the Rocky films. At times, has the feel of the first Rocky film with a gritty undertone mixed with lighthearted humor and heart. Speaking of which, this movie isn't a cheap excuse to see Rocky again. This film focuses on Adonis and his growth and uses Rocky as a plot device rather than a gimmick and even pays homage to the work of Carl Weathers from the early Rocky films. The character of Adonis is rich here with depth and isn't a simple write off protagonist and this is thankful to the script but also to the performance by Michael B. Jordan as Adonis. Jordan had a rough year this year with him starring in Fantastic Four, but he does more than rebound here. He delivers a performance of a lifetime here that never borders on sentimentality but instead makes us cheer for him and deeply care for him. Simply put, Jordan establishes himself as a contender in this movie. Sylvester Stallone returns here as Rocky Balboa and he does a great job here. Stallone looks like he is where he belongs and it was great to see the character again. The rest of the cast is great with Tessa Thompson and Phylicia Rashad delivering fantastic performances. Normally this is the part of the review where I list my problems with the film but I have to be honest, I literally had no complaints with this film. The pacing is perfect, the boxing scenes hit hard and are thrilling, the drama is perfect, and we get an introduction to a fantastic new character in Adonis Creed. Overall I absolutely loved this film and I urge you to see this film as soon as possible. This isn't a cheap spinoff or a film that panders to fans, this movie is simply an outstanding piece of cinema that is well worth your time.",

It is so nice to see Michal B Jordan show some acting chops after that other film this year that I won't mention, and also nice to see Stallone slide smoothly into the supporting role. This film also has some of the best use of camera angles I've seen, because as much as steady cam shots will often bother me, here they were used to excellent effect. It also features several montages, which often irk me, but his is how to do it RIGHT: stay on a scene long enough for you to get the idea, jump to the next for the same length, etc, showing progress each time, as opposed to simply showing an unrelated series of events that don't actually tie together to show progress. Simply put: if you want to do a passing-of-the-torch type film, this is how you do it. I'm even honestly not a huge fan of the original \"Rocky\" films, but this was great.",

After all these decades, I never thought a film from the Rocky franchise could be so good until this day, Creed lifts up the franchise to a new height, and is a possible new franchise that is promising, and leaves me waiting for the sequel. At last a film leaves me anxiously waiting for the sequel, since its script is so promising, and has a lot more to expand. Overall, Creed is a fantastic film in a year where sequels and reboots have dominated. Creed is not only one of the best films of the year, but it has some of the best performances this year has offered, and a promising new direction which I hope Coogler can take the director's chair again in the sequel.",

One particular moment in the story was unexpected - but I can't tell you which one without spoiling the plot. The problem with boxing movies is that they seem to rely quite heavily on the boxers training - and there's only so much of the training you can watch without getting bored. While CREED might be an adequate movie, it doesn't reach the creativity of the recent Southpaw starring Jake Gyllenhaal. Sylvester Stallone is pretty good and exceeded my expectations. If you really like watching realistic boxing, then maybe give it a go. As a continuation of the Rocky franchise, it's ok.",

As far as what I thought of this movie, I can tell you that the story was kind of interesting, but there were some scenes here and there that I felt were not necessary. For example, they tried to through a little romance in the movie for Michael B. Jordan's character, and I felt that the movie could have been just as good or better without that. As far as the fighting scenes go, they were very good, and I went sort of on the edge of my seat at the end. As far as comparing this movie with Southpaw, I can say that they are close to the same on my list, but I still think that Southpaw was a little bit better. Anyway, I would recommend this to any movie person.",

    "review": "  \"You see this guy here? That's the toughest opponent you're ever going to have to face. I believe that's true in the ring, and I think that's true in life. Now show me something.\"\"Creed\", stars Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone, and is the unofficial sequel to the well-known franchise called \"Rocky\". Now at the moment, Creed is off the charts for it's ratings, and although I feel that this movie does not live up to all of its hype, I still feel that this was an excellent film, with an exhilarating final act. So I have yet to watch a single Rocky movie, which is probably something I should've done before watching this film. But, this film does a pretty good job of being its own stand alone movie, while also catering to any fans of the Rocky franchise. First off, I want to start out by saying that this movie isn't perfect. The first act of this movie was not so great, the pacing was choppy, and the editing could've been better. They skip through so much time in the first act, and many of the scenes just cut off really quickly. Nothing in the first act made an impact on me, and I actually wasn't really enjoying the movie. I didn't even like the camera work in the first act, as in one of Johnson's first fights, the camera work felt awkward and bland, and it really didn't capture the intensity or the realism of any situation. So at first, I was actually dissapointed with this movie, but that didn't last for too long. By the time Johnson (Creed) moved to a different city to start to build his legacy, that's when things started to pick up. We started to get introduced to Rocky and Bianca, and when the movie started to dive into a deep character study, that's when the movie started to grow on me. The second act of the movie really focuses on the characters, and the actors manage to build great chemistry on screen. I really like how this movie focused on the characters, rather than the boxing aspect of the movie. I heard that the first Rocky film did the same thing, so it was nice that we got to know our characters more and build an attachment to them .When the third act rolled around, I was honestly excited and invested into this movie. This is when the character development payed off and was one of the better third acts I've seen from a boxing movie. It was exciting and exhilarating all at the same time, the pacing felt perfect, the editing was cleaned up, and my emotional attachment to the characters made the ending really perfect. I mean, the third act was as good as it was ever going to be, and there was more than one memorable scenes in there.Michael. B Jordan is really proving himself as one of the upcoming stars of Hollywood today, and he gave it all in this performance here. He's quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, and hopefully, this will save his name from the mess that was Fantastic Four. Sylvester Stallone also shows that he still has the acting chops, and he might have been one of the best parts of the entire movie. It was great seeing him back on the big screen in a quality movie, and both he and Jordan were standouts in this movie. Tessa Thompson was also really excellent, and I loved seeing all three of these characters interact together. I loved the chemistry between all of them and the relationships that they built together truly made it feel like they were a family. Keep in mind that when you watch this movie, it isn't a movie solely about boxing. It's a film that focuses on the characters, and who they really are. It shows us that although the family's legacy and past may define your reputation at first, you are here to carve your own destiny and create your own legacy. In this movie, Creed has always had a tough life, and although he lived in a huge mansion, and had a great job, none of that mattered if he couldn't prove his worth to the world, and to himself. In his mind, he wanted to create his own legacy, rather than let someone else create it for him. He shows us a great example of working hard and pushing to become your own individual, and this movie really focuses on those aspects in the story. The boxing parts are just there to show us an end result, and to entertain us with some action, but it really is a movie that focuses on a bigger picture in life.In the end, this movie isn't perfect. The first act has poor pacing, an awkward flow, some uneven camera work, and a slow start. But when the movie picks up in the second act, we are blessed with some amazing performances, excellent character development, emotional and intense moments, and a memorable third act. This movie really did a great job of building upon the relationships between the characters, and in the end, you'd be missing out if you didn't see this movie. If you never saw Rocky, this film does a decent job of standing on its own, and there were plenty of memorable moments here.",

    "review": "  Let me start this little review by saying that I am a HUGE fan of the Rocky film series. The original 1976 Rocky is not only my favorite sports film ever made, but it is also one of my favorite movies of all time. That being said, I DID NOT WANT this movie to happen at all. In 2006, Sylvester Stallone released his 6th and seemingly final film in the series and it was a perfect ending to the franchise. So when they announced a spin-off film about the son of Apollo Creed and Rocky taking over as the trainer, let's just say I was not jumping for joy. This film was...FANTASTIC! Seriously, this movie was far better than it should have been. Don't go into this expecting to see Rocky 7...this is definitely Creed! Not only does this movie do a wonderful job of fitting right into the Rocky universe, but it also stands on its own as a standalone film. If you have never seen a single one of the 6 Rocky movies, you will have no problem seeing this. The focus is primarily on Michael B. Jordan playing the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed (Rocky's friend and opponent in the series). He is trying to become a fighter like his father while also trying to make a name for himself to avoid the pressure of the family legacy that has built up before him. When you throw aside all the Rocky attributes, it is really just the story of a young man trying to find his place and be somebody. He doesn't know his father, but he wants to honor him at the same time. Don't get me wrong though, Sly Stallone (showing that he can beautifully play this character in his sleep) delivers the best performance of his in almost a decade. He is most definitely a strong supporting component and if you are a fan, you will love how Rocky is handled as you have the feeling of catching up with an old friend. About 40% of the film is devoted to him. Paulie and his wife are long gone and he has lost contact with his son. Everything he loved in life has moved on and he is trying to find some sort of purpose to fill the void of being a has-been. First of all, the performances and the chemistry between the two stars is flawless. The film does a wonderful job of keeping you in the Rocky-mood while also delivering new characters that you will fall in love with. This is the perfect example of how to make a spin-off film and hand off the baton to the next arising story. You will laugh, cry, and cheer during this story. And yes, there are some great callbacks to the previous Rocky movies but not so many that it feels forced or cheesy. As a huge Rocky fan, I loved this movie! Go and see this as soon as you can. It is debate-ably the best film in the series since the original. 4.5/5",

There are several scenes in this movie where you can see they are either trying to pay homage to the original or possibly recreate some of the magic, but in my opinion these moments fell flat The fights in this movie were OK but felt predictable to me. I think this movie could have been done much better. One other point, if you are going to have an apponent that is supposed to champion of the world, then for crying out loud, find an actor who looks like he spend more time at the gym then he does at the bar. The looked flabby. Better casting choice would have made this all more believable. The story line of the singing girlfriend going deaf was also just a distraction in this movie. The performance by Stalone alone in this movie is worth the price of admission. The performance by M Jordan was good. They should have definitely used Raschad more in this movie. She acted almost like a disinterested bystander she could have been used to much greater effect. It would have also been good to see Jordans character fight at least one more time on his way to the title fight. It would have made the whole thing a lot more believable. Probably a rematch with with Andre Wards Character as the fluke win that suddenly puts him in the ring with the world champion. That would have been better than \"he gets the fight because of his name\" story line. My last name could be Bush, but that does not make me our next president. The whole story line made no sense.",

Every scene that could have been used as pandering to fans of the \"O.G.\" franchise was instead used to build this films title character into one that can stand on his own. By giving us a familiar story with modern elements and well developed characters, Ryan Coogler's vision for this film does honor to the series. Combine that with great fight choreography, camera-work, and knock-out performances by the lead cast. Creed gives us a memorable film to help close-out the year of 2015.",

The film centers not on the iconic character which made Sylvester Stallone a house hold name, however, and instead focuses on the offspring of the man who he defeated to become the champ. The second we get a glimpse of this young man, Adonis Creed, son of the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, we know that he has a drive for something. The narrative that Creed weaves tells us that for the whole of Adonis's life, he has been drawn to the world which his father found fame, fortune and tragically destruction, which means escaping from the shadow of his father's name. A character with such a complex goal and a premise infused with so much thought and commitment make Creed extremely entertaining and uplifting. Michael B. Jordan is phenomenal as Adonis Creed, a being full of rage, resentment and life. Jordan expertly portrays the harsh and personal struggles the young Creed faces in accepting his heritage and that he can be his own man without having to embrace something he isn't. Returning in one of his best performances to date is Sylvester Stallone in the iconic role which almost anyone could recognize him from, accept not in Creed. Stallone is transformed from a young and vibrant life force with endearing quirks and some trouble being heard into a broken and desolate man who we never believed the character could become. Rocky is reluctant to take on the role of his old trainer, Mick, not believing he is truly capable, which provides another layer to what remains of Rocky Balboa. Everyone he cared for has left him or passed on, leaving him an old sick man without a purpose. He is content to allow himself to leave the earth and not have to be a prisoner of his own isolation. Luckily, Adonis won't let him. The contrast between the world-weary Rocky and the newcomer Adonis is perfect. The cinematography is very impressive, especially in the fight sequences, and the ending leaves you with a feeling that anything is possible and that the human spirit drives us forward to greatness.",

    "review": "  Creed is a knockout even if no punch landed. For it is a movie that deals with the human psyche that is surrounded by the sport of boxing. It takes you deeper in the mind and surroundings of the sport then any of the Rocky movies have done in the past. To be honest the movie didn't grab me until the 1st round but once it started moving I didn't want to leave till the ending credits. Yet even if one is not a fan of boxing the need to fight our own battles is a message that should ring in all our hearts. Creed **** (I added a 1/2 star because I'm a big Sylvester Stallone fan.",

    "review": "  What a knockout! Creed has the \"Eye of the Tiger\" in successfully passing the torch down to the next generation. You don't have to be a huge Rocky fan like myself to appreciate the masterful execution of writing, cinematography and acting. Stallone puts on his best performance in decades alongside Michael B Jordan's phenomenal performance. Very surprising to see this in a franchise that one would have expected to run its course. New director Ryan Coogler brings the series back to full form. It's also the best \"Rocky\" movie since the original yet stands on its own paying homage to it's roots without relying on nostalgia. The formula pioneered by the original is still relevant almost 40 years later to a generation with new struggles. This is up there with Mad Max as my favourite film of the year, let's see if Star Wars can join these ranks next month. I can't believe the best films of this year are connected to franchises from the late 70's",

    "review": "  Absolutely fantastic! I was already sold after hearing that \"Fruitvale Station\" director, Ryan Coogler, will be helming this Rocky spin-off. In all honesty, I had no doubt in my mind that this film would be nothing short of extraordinary and boy was I right on the nose. Not only is this a very well directed, well written film (major props to both Coogler and co-writer Aaron Covington), but it is also powerfully acted. Michael B. Jordan has been an actor that I truly believe has an immense amount of potential as being one of the most bankable rising young stars that can captivate an audience with his acting since watching his work in films like \"Chronicle\" and the aforementioned \"Fruitvale Station.\" He has a lot of promise and after seeing his performance in Creed, my respect for him as an acting talent has only increased. Along with his supporting co-star Tessa Thompson, who does a superb job as Bianca, Jordan's love interest. She makes a wonderful addition to the pantheon of beloved \"Rocky\" characters. Now I cannot talk about the acting of this film without discussing the brutally emotional performance by Sylvester Stallone who has been given some serious Oscar consideration for his role in this movie (a sentiment that I also agree with). It's truly incredible to see Stallone strip down all the macho bravado commonly found in his action roles and view a completely different, yet genuine side that audiences have not witnessed in a long time from him. I have grown up watching the Rocky movies (minus Rocky V) so I do consider myself to be a big fan and Stallone gives a career-best in his seventh outing as the iconic Rocky Balboa.Creed holds a lot of similarities to the first Rocky, but it's more of a homage than a blatant rip-off as there is a lot of sentimentality and love for the franchise behind the film as this is a deeply personal story for director Coogler. And with that level of inspiration, Mr. Coogler produces one of the best films of the year. Some of my most memorable moments from Creed includes the boxing match shot in one-take (mesmerizing isn't enough to describe how epic and awesome an experience it was). Another were the training montages that were able to fuse both the old and the new by which I mean certain clips from Adonis's training to the musical score remarkably done by Ludwig Goransson, taking over the reins of former composer Bill Conti.This is a marvelous example of how blending the traditional Rocky tropes with the more modernized grittiness of today's urban world can be done right if in good hands. If I had to rate this film, I would adamantly reward this film with a perfect 5/5 stars! Well worth watching even if you've never been introduced to the Rocky series before, although it would only benefit you if you did.",

I'm liking the new trend in Hollywood to do sequels a decade or two after the original in real-time (such as Jurassic World and possibly the recently announced Gremlins 3). Michael B. Jordan carries this movie and at times Rocky himself (literally). This rising star (see Friday Night Lights, Fruitvale Station, don't see Fantastic Four) is given a real world nod with a quote in the movie (\"You're the future of this field\"). The entire cast impresses as does the direction, especially with a long one-take shot that will make you realize you haven't blinked in minutes. And let's not forget about Sly, who excels in his supporting role and reminds us what the Rocky franchise tries to teach us, that you don't have to win to be a champion.",

When I first heard about this film, I thought the idea of it was a joke and thought it was going to be panned critically.I'm not too sure if Creed started off as an ordinary boxing film and then the idea of Rocky was added to sell it more. It tries hard to be it's own thing, while trying to please the Rocky fans by going down a checklist such as Stallone himself, music cues, locations etc. Just like the character Adonis Creed being in the shadow of Apollo Creed, this movie is in the shadow of Rocky.Michael B. Jordan gives a good performance, but nothing special. For me the entire film relied on the performance of Stallone, who is still able to give all the heart and soul of the Rocky Balboa character.Overall Creed to me feels like a better made Rocky V. It's entertaining, but not much more to justify its existence. The film Rocky Balboa, for me was the better way to end the series.",

This is not only the best performance he has ever given, it is one of the best supporting performances of the year. It is a beautiful thing to watch and I had tears rolling down my cheeks on more than one occasion. Honestly, the film dips whenever he isn't on screen (Rocky is a much more interesting character than Adonis, in my opinion) and I was much more emotionally connected to his story arc than Adonis or Bianca.

    "review": "  This movie first came to my attention as a trailer to the somewhat (IMHO) inferior Southpaw. Co-writer / Director Cooger knows this formula. The nature of the sports movie is self-aware and it rides the inner conflict of the protagonist. So this one kicks in the real drama a little late. Michael B Jordan does well. Phyliicia Rashad is consummate veteran. While it is a bit focus stealing from Jordan's starring role, the performance to talk about is that of Sylvester Stallone. He is not just one of the most Razzie winning actors ever and director/star of the Expendables. He can act the heck of the Rocky persona. Lest we forget he was nominated an Oscar for it. And unless the Academy is cranky, he might be due another, this time as best supporting actor.",

Former prize fighter Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is now an old, broken down, restaurant owner, out of the boxing limelight, who takes under his wing, training the illegitimate son (Michael B. Jordan) of his former rival, Apollo Creed. Coogler respects the formula but he doesn't cheapen it as the sequels did. By telling this story from the black experience, fraught with paternal identity crises, Coogler elevates the myth for a younger, more multicultural generation and announces his presence as a major commercial movie director. Jordan is a rising star with the charisma and forcefulness of a young Denzel Washington. Tessa Thompson is affecting as a hearing-impaired musician and Cree's love interest. Stallone gives possibly his finest performance in his most iconic role. He underplays beautifully and expresses shades of regret, mortal recognition, and sorrow, but also the triumphant spirit that made his character so popular. Written by Coogler and Aaron Covington based on characters by Stallone. With Phylicia Rashad, Tony Bellew, and Wood Harris.",

    "review": "  Honestly when this film was announced I didn't care much, sure I like the Rocky series (even though I have seen only Rocky & Rocky Balboa), Michael B Jordan is one of the most promising young stars in the field right now, & Ryan Coogler directed Fruitvale Station two years ago (one of my favorite films of that year). But something about another installment of the series didn't excite me, maybe because I am not a fan of Boxing & had my fill of boxing this year with the excellent Southpaw. Frankly, this film is actually more of a 'Rebirth' for the Rocky franchise a passing of the baton in a way. Cut from the same cloth maybe, this film is much more than just the seventh installment in the Rocky film franchise. As a no-holds-barred sports drama, this is every bit an exceptional crowd pleaser with a lot of heart, plenty of amusing jabs to the ribs, and an unexpected but emotional haymaker to the gut. And a lot more. Trust me, missing out on the previous Rocky films will not harm your experience with this film. This is definitely not a 'Rocky movie', it definitely stands on its own and the main focus of the film is Adonis Creed. Of course, being in the same universe and featuring the series' main protagonist does lead to many callbacks to the other Rocky films. But these callbacks (apart from the obvious) are not crucial to the plot and really are just there for die hard fans of the series. Yes! Director and writer Ryan Coogler's spinoff is awesome. Director Coogler brilliantly reinvents the \"Rocky\" saga for the hip-hop and cyber versed generation. Coogler with his film is beholding to heart, love, and the journey of rediscovering our innate greatness-what made the original \"Rocky\" so special. Visually the film is staggering, light, texture and motion all draw you in. Ironically the fight music from the Rocky franchise is called, \"Alone in the Ring\" at least twice I was drawn into this film deeply that I would have swore I was in Adonis's corner if not in the ring myself. The story follows Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan), an illegitimate son of Apollo Creed (played in the first four Rocky movies by Carl Weathers), born shortly after the latter's death in Rocky IV. Appolo's widow Mary Ann (Phylicia Rashad) rescues young Adonis from what is certain to be a life on the streets and raises him as her own in the plush Creed estate in Los Angeles. Cut to present day and Adonis is a corporate executive half way up the ladder. Like Rocky, Adonis (calling himself Donnie) knows he is destined for something else, so heads to Philadelphia to meet his late father's rival turned best friend. His search lands him in his father's old Philly stomping ground, where he pesters one Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) into training him. He pulls every angle to get Rocky to help him since his pop and Rocky were combatants and close friends before he died. Once Rocky begrudgingly gives in, things begin to coalesce. Adonis finds balance as he falls in love with beautiful musician and singer Bianca (Tessa Thompson), who is also dealing with her own adversity. Jordan displays a gentle and playful side with Thompson. In a funny twist, Bianca outs Adonis for not telling her that his Uncle is Rocky Balboa. As stories collide reigning Light Heavyweight Champion Ricky Conlan (real-life former champion Tony Bellew) has one more fight before serving a prison sentence. His anger costs him a fight with the top contender. Suddenly, he needs to find a legitimate sacrificial opponent. So would that be the son of Apollo Creed? Rocky gets a call and this is all too familiar. Also Adonis and Rocky poignantly deal with mortality. It is life. Time is undefeated. Co-written by director Ryan Coogler, there's no doubt that this film is a passionate love letter to the first film, which in itself is a poetic love story about fighting the good fight. Although boxing is the central theme, and often frowned upon as a brutal blood-sport that causes serious injuries, it's never been about the fight but more about what you are fighting for. This film is an excellent example of mixing newcomers with established names on both sides of the camera and having the end result come out perfect. The crew and cast turn in great work. Coogler had the fortune and skill to work with people who know what it takes to put together a film that would appeal to critics and audiences alike. There were a couple scenes that are \"wow\" moments, not just fight scenes, which are are amazing, but little scenes that are set up, shot (by Maryse Alberti) and acted that will have a lasting effect on the viewer. Maybe classic isn't a stretch. The meeting with Rocky is one of several great moments in the film while also serving as a nostalgic homecoming occasion for every fan of the franchise. It's a fascinating intersection of the past but none better than the fact that in many ways, this film is an inverted mirror image of Rocky. And before sending this film off on its own pulsating trajectory, Coogler reveals a full hand of spades. One of which is the legacy Rocky bestows on Donnie, and in essence, Stallone handing over the franchise baton to Jordan. We may not realize this at first and that's because we are already smitten by the father-son relationship developing between Donnie and Rocky. Their character study is the most significant aspect of this film. Donnie has always been an orphan and the reason why he never took on his father's name is an emotional revelation. Who he is and why he wants to become a professional boxer is his darkest secret. Having Rocky Balboa in the film and being a mentor and coach for Adonis was a really great aspect of the film that worked in every way. This could have easily been a very forced element where they just threw Rocky in a few scenes occasionally to make sure people know \"Hey come see this film because of Rocky\". But he really was an integral part of the film and contributed to the plot, bought a slight tad of humor to lighten the mood occasionally and also really emphasis the emotional weight of some of the films key moments. Sylvester Stallone was great in the role, i can't speak for whether it compares to the other Rocky films but you could see that he was a very experienced boxer who has definitely been through a lot in his life. If anything, this film made me want to go and see the other Rocky films because even seeing him at this stage in his life was fascinating and i wanted to know more about the character. But despite the big name and the fact that he is so loved by film fans, he did play second fiddle to Michael B Jordan, and i don't think anyone should be mad about that. There was also one incredible moment in the film that was made even more amazing by the camera-work in this scene. There was a fight that was filmed so amazingly I was mesmerized and totally sucked into the scene. The entire fight was filmed with one continuous tracking shot that takes you all around the ring and made you feel like you were literally in the ring with these fighter, truly incredible film work right there. Apart from the story within the film, we see the real-world torch passing metaphor work as we observe Stallone's role in the franchise that he created noticeably diminishing - both on screen and behind the scenes. Just as he hands off the main role to rising star Michael B. Jordan, he has handed off writing and directing duties to Ryan Coogler (who Jordan served very well in 2013's \"Fruitvale Station\"). In less talented hands, this transition could have resulted in the dropping of the torch, but Coogler's updating of Stallone's legacy proves effective and entertaining and should appeal to fans of the original Rocky movies as well as fans of both Coogler and Jordan. Both equally emotive and with comic interruptions, Jordan and Stallone deliver impressive performances. Stallone in particular gives what has to be his career best performance since Rocky Balboa, and if this is his franchise swan song (owing to a devastating but befitting plot device) that's all the more reason why this film must be seen. Sylvester Stallone is excellent as the \"Mickey\"-esque Balboa. Although he didn't write the screenplay for Creed, he is one of the producers and his presence is felt. The dynamic between his character and Donnie is perfect. The right combination of old school and new school. One scene is indicative when Adonis takes a picture on his phone of Rocky's workout routine then tells him it's \"in the cloud\" to Rocky's bewilderment. Here, director and writer Ryan Coogler is reunited with Jordan. As titular lead, Jordan's performance is on part with Stallone's. He imbues his character with just the right amount of bravado, not cockiness, just confidence, hunger, and drive. He also trained and bulked up for the role. But he's not all fierce competitor, he has funny, sensitive sides as well. Coogler's team decided he should have a love interest. The relationship he forges with a local neo- soul artist played by Tessa Thompson (Dear White People) could have been syrupy, but thankfully it doesn't overshadow the main theme or feel forced. Frankly, some of the scenes with Thompson and Jordan are very good and so is their chemistry. Tony Bellew does well. On the whole, Creed is an gritty, emotional & exceptional crowd pleaser for Rocky fans & the new generations alike. If you have watched the original Rocky and think it is a near classic, then Creed is close. Maybe not a classic, because only time will tell. But it is close in terms of look and feel. There are scenes, tempo, performances, music, and of course the setting (Philadelphia) which harkens back to the award winning 1976 film. This is not a comparison piece, but Creed is what the earlier release of this year Southpaw was close to being; the best gritty, modern day boxing film of this decade.",

Being a fan of the Rocky series, this entry is one of the best. I hope to see more boxing matches with Aldonis Creed in the future. The fight(s) are way more entertaining than the Mayweather Pacquiao fight. Hope this one is up for some awards because it is that good.",

    "review": "  Does it pass down the torch? Yes. Does it share similarities with the original \"Rocky\" film? Yes. Does this film stand on it's own? Absolutely! \"Creed\" follows the son of the late Apollo Creed as he hunts down Rocky Balboa to train him. In hopes to continue his fathers legacy while still maintaining his own name, young Adonis Creed will do whatever it takes to get into the ring. As he meets a young girl along the way, you completely buy into their connection and you never once think that it feels forced. This film is essentially about fighting for your name, but at its core it really is a release from the \"Rocky\" films and an introduction into the new generation. Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan share amazing chemistry, bringing me to tears on multiple occasions. \"Creed\" is easily one of the best entries in the franchise, even comparable to the original. With a great script, incredible performances, a story worthy of the title, and direction that puts you in the front row, \"Creed\" is fantastic! If I had one complaint, it would be that it might just share a few too similarities to the first film. By the end of the film I felt I was just accepting the conclusion. In the end, I loved this film from start to finish and I recommend seeing it in the theatres for the full experience. Terrific!",

    "review": "  The seventh entry in the Rocky franchise is the best since the first Rocky and it doesn't even have Rocky's name in the title. Stallone literally passes the gloves to Michael B. Jordan, who plays Apollo Creed's son. Young Creed wants to be a boxer, but wants to do it without his father's name. He seeks out the now retired Rocky Balboa to train him Rocky is reluctant because of what happened to Apollo. But soon enough Rocky agrees to train him. The film mirrors the first Rocky, but the story is fresh tanks to director Ryan Coogler who seems to respect the franchise and the Rocky character. Stallone has never been better as an aging boxer who has lost everything in his life. He needs Creed as much as Creed needs him. It is like a father-son relationship the two have. The cast is great with Tess Thompson playing Creed's version of Adrian. But, she is more than just a love interest. Her character also has to go through some hard times as well. Jordan and Stallone are great together and for Jordan, this surely makes up for Fantastic Four. The final match is as thrilling as the first match between Rocky and Creed. But because the characters are written so well, the boxing felt second nature to the storylines. You care about these characters and you care what happens to them. This is a testament to the young director's respect for the source material and the cast's great chemistry and acting. I am not sure if this is going to start a new set of films, but Rocky has never been better.Grade: A",

    "review": "  Creed is a film that from the trailers can be looked at as a continuation of the Rocky franchise, but it is actually more of a 'Rebirth' for the franchise and a passing of the baton in a way. My experience with the Rocky franchise is limited to half of the first film and bits and pieces of iconic moments and characters, but missing out on the previous Rocky films will not harm your experience with this film. This is definitely not a 'Rocky movie', it definitely stands on its own and the main focus of the film is Adonis Creed. Of course, being in the same universe and featuring the series' main protagonist does lead to many callbacks to the other Rocky films. Now i didn't know the significance of every reference, but i knew enough to know when they were referring to a past event. But these callbacks (apart from the obvious) are not crucial to the plot and really are just there for die hard fans of the series. The main focus of this film was the journey of Adonis Creed and his rise to hopefully live up to the legacy set by his father with help from Rocky Balboa himself. The story, this journey was incredible to see. There were not too many BIG moments in the film but it really didn't need any because this whole film was a progressive sequence of events that were building up intensity to a big finale. There were many intense training montages and very interesting and emotional storytelling sequences that all tie together the events of the film really really well. There was never a dull moment in its 2 hour runtime and i was glued to the screen and really interested in Adonis' story. He is a very strong minded, likeable and determined character who you really get behind and want him to succeed in every way. Michael B Jordan definitely redeemed himself for that Fant4stic disaster that wasn't necessarily his fault, but at least it can't be held against him now. He embodied the role and you really bought his character, wasn't over the top in any way and played a very grounded, realistic character. He conveyed emotion and determination very well and managed to eclipse the presence of Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa at times. Having Rocky Balboa in the film and being a mentor and coach for Adonis was a really great aspect of the film that worked in every way. This could have easily been a very forced element where they just threw Rocky in a few scenes occasionally to make sure people know \"Hey come see this film because...... Rocky\". But he really was an integral part of the film and contributed to the plot, bought a slight tad of humour to lighten the mood occasionally and also really emphasis the emotional weight of some of the films key moments. Sylvester Stallone was great in the role, i can't speak for whether it compares to the other Rocky films but you could see that he was a very experienced boxer who has definitely been through a lot in his life. If anything, this film made me WANT to go and see the other Rocky films because even seeing him at this stage in his life was fascinating and i wanted to know more about the character. But despite the big name and the fact that he is so loved by film fans, he did play second fiddle to Michael B Jordan, and i don't think anyone should be mad about that. There was also one incredible moment in the film that was made even more amazing by the camera-work in this scene. There was a fight that was filmed so amazingly i was mesmerised and totally sucked into the scene. The entire fight was filmed with one continuous tracking shot that takes you all around the ring and made you feel like you were literally in the ring with these fighter, truly incredible film work right there. In the end, this was an incredible Boxing film, one of the best if not the best that i have ever seen that if you are a fan of the genre you should definitely see. Fans of the Rocky franchise will love this film for it's callbacks to the other films but as it is a passing of the baton per se, even if you are unfamiliar with the previous films it doesn't lessen the amazing experience you will have with this film. - 9.1",

Sure he's a supporting character here, but in this particular movie Stallone gives his most powerful emotional performance than in all the other Rocky movies combined. Michael B.

When Adonis is running through the streets of Philly, gangsters on dirt bikes and four wheelers are riding next to him doing wheelies. They tried to copy the DMX video. Adonis randomly switches training gyms. He only has one fight prior to the final. The finally fight scene is awful. The champion looks out of shape and noting like a champion boxer.

Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. Mr. Jordan shows that he can be top of his own game and Mr. Stallone gives one if his best performance as Rocky Balboa since he reprise his role on the first movie \"Rocky\" back in 1976. Now Mr. Stallone nails the role perfectly back then and he continues to show that he can play the role even today... Personally, I hope that he gets on Oscar nomination.\" The directing by Ryan Coogler is very good with clear vision. The screenplay also by Ryan Coogler and Aaron Covington is is well written. The cinematography and choreography is very good. The score is works great. Finally, the effects works perfect for my opinion. \"I'm raving that \"Creed\" is a must see and is a movie that for my opinion you will be sitting in your seat watching outstanding entertainment.\"",

It is built from the pieces of his world and in some ways it feels like the first Rocky. But it is not a Rocky movie. It is Creed, and it is amazing. Whether or not there are more of them, it is definitely worth the trip back into this world.",

    "review": "  I'm fairly certain that many people thought it was impossible for Stallone to milk his \"Rocky\" franchise & find another movie in it, but I am so glad he did. Stallone has long been completely overlooked and underestimated by the Hollywood machine, yet he returns yet again to the storyline that made him a star an not only find a story but makes his best \"Rocky\" movie since \"Rocky!\" I'm not going to go into the plot, to prevent giving away spoilers, but I will say that \"Creed\" is a movie that works on different levels and also tells two different stories to audience members depending upon their ages and life experiences. Older audience members (like me, who saw \"Rocky\" in the theatres & rooted for it to win Best Picture) can & will see the story through Rocky's eyes. Younger audience members, especially young adults struggling to make their own way & their own name, can & will see the story through Donnie's eyes.  It's also high time to stop making Stallone the butt of everyone's jokes & recognize himi for the extraordinary talent that he is. He *WILL* make you cry in \"Creed,\" & he won't be overly-showy about it, either. There he'll be, just doing his usual \"Rocky\" shuffle, then *BAM* the audience is in tears. I was one of maybe 2 women in the theatre yesterday, so it isn't a girly thing. Guys were crying too.  Of course, a good story needs a good cast & everyone in \"Creed\" is just that. Michael B. Jordan is amazing & a possible Oscar contender, although my money is still on Jonny Depp. If I didn't already think Paul Rylands had a strong shot for \"Best Supporting Actor,\" I'd strongly recommend the Academy announce that category is closed & hand the statue to Stallone. If Stallone doesn't even score a nomination for his performance, well, screw the Academy. While it would be nice for the establishment to finally acknowledge Stallone's talent without winking or crossing their fingers behind their backs, he's long since proven he doesn't need them--THEY need him.",

This isn't just about boxing, it's more about pursuing a passion, even when this passion may not seem to make sense on the face of it. You see this in the young Creed and in his love interest, Bianca. Brilliantly acted by Michael B. Jordan, it's difficult not to feel some of the frustration and pain as his mentor, Rocky, seemingly abandons him and the sense of pride and promise after the last fight. Here too, the writer emphasizes how important it is to have a support system and how even the strongest character can fall when this support is taken away. But, it's not about how many times you fall down that determines character, but how many times you get back up. Creed's character becomes stronger as the binds of the ongoing relationships build, but don't we all experience this as well? Frankly, one of the best films of the year, not to be missed.",

    "review": "  Rocky is one of the greatest sports movie put on the big screen. Not only was it one of the highest grossing films of 1976, but it also won an Oscar for Best Picture. So how could this successful Boxing film surpass the original. While Rocky II and III were decent sequels, Rocky IV was a but cheesy and V ruined the entire franchise over the next fifteen year until the release of Rocky Balboa. The film was good, but not as good as the first Rocky. People thought that the sixth film would end the Rocky franchise, but they were wrong. I first heard of Creed from an article I was reading on Facebook and casting Michael B. Jordan as Apollo Creed son was a fantastic idea, with Sylvester Stallone returning as the Italian Stallion. My little brother and I were anticipated about this film getting release. Then the film came and I decided to see it over the final Hunger Games movie, which I will sometime soon. After watching Creed, my thoughts changed about this film. Not only is this the greatest spin-off/ sequel, but one of my favorite films of 2015. Creed learns how to be its own movie without confusing the audience of seeing the previous films. The movie learns how to execute the typical underdog story that the audience have seen from the first Rocky. I actually cared about these characters of the struggles that they were going through. Michael B. Jordan plays as the son of Apollo Creed, Adonis Johnson, who wants to be a professional Boxer like his father, but doesn`t want to be known as the son of Apollo Creed. Johnson goes to Sylvester Stallone character Rocky for training and advise about going into the Boxing Ring. The relationship between these two character is incredible to follow. I actually felt emotion toward these two character together on the same screen. It`s a old vs new which is well balance out. For example, there`s a scene where Rocky makes a training list on a piece of paper and gives it to Adonis, but Adonis takes a picture of the list on his phone and goes off to train, making Rocky confuse on how much has change over the past forty years. This is both a spectacular and comedic scene in the movie. There is also a love interest for Adonis in this movie name Bianca, played by Tessa Thompson, who is a musician who is about to become deaf. This is a perfect love interest for this movie because she has character instead of the typical love interest who motivates the character through the struggle of the plot. The cinematography is glorious. There are moments when the film uses one shot for an entire scene. An example could be Adonis first fight when the camera was moving around the entire without switching to the next clip, similar to the cinematography in Birdman. The film was incredibly well shot in Philadelphia. It makes the audience feel like they are in the same urban environment with a mix of some ghetto environments since this is directed by Ryan Coogler, who previously directed Fruitvale Station, which had the same gritty environment as Creed. I adore the music score done in this film since its a mix of the original Rocky music with some background beats from the hip-hop genre. Its well compose and well executed that I`m actually of listening to it over and over again. I have no flaws with this film because everything from Creed is perfectly done that its actually a bit better than Rocky. The fighting is gory and glorious to watch, that it actually gave me an adrenaline rush every time there is a boxing scene. Creed is a strong movie to stand on its own and thats how most sequels and spinoff should be about. I hope this movie gets an Oscar nomination cause this is a perfect movie that deserves one.",

    "review": "  CREED is a KO! Director, Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station) has created a modern masterpiece that honors all the best of the venerable Rocky franchise while introducing a deep new layer that stands fully on its own. Once again, Michael B. Jordan (who's middle initial stands for \"Bakari\" or \"One Who Will Succeed\") delivers yet another exceptional performance, this time as Adonis, the complex and troubled spawn of Rocky Balboa's late-great nemesis, Apollo Creed. Sylvester Stallone has never been better and easily earns Award recognition for his aging but wise champion-of-the-underdog reprise. In true Rocky spirit, the movie CREED is less about the destination than the mine-laden pathway to pursuing a dream. Along with Coogler, writer Aaron Covington have drafted a tightly paced script that swings you up and down with just the right amount of toughness, tenderness, promise and uncertainty -- not unlike boxing itself, as it builds to a satisfying finale. Coogler and Covington give great hope for the future of Hollywood. As a long time boxing fan, I love how Maryse Alberti (A.S.C.) respects the Sweet Science with arguably some of the best fight cinematography ever (she also did The Wrestler). While there are bonafide (how did they do that) moments of amazing skill during action scenes (Jordan clearly didn't use a stuntman for critical scenes), it's not all blood and sweat. Tessa Thompson (Dear White People) brings exquisite humanity to a beautiful but gritty alternative-R&B singer from Philly who's character demands further exploration (can't believe I'm actually looking forward to a sequel). In these times of cultural disharmony with tragic endings, CREED reminds us that the heart of a champion knows no color, ambition knows no gender, and everlasting hope knows no age. See Creed on the big screen with people you love - everyone will leave feeling just a little better than when they went in. Yes. -CC",

Michael B Jordan is fantastic, the fighting/training scenes are intense, and,as a whole, the film is extremely well-shot. Overall, this is a superb film that both fans of the Rocky franchise and newcomers can appreciate.",

    "review": "  First off let me say that I have been a life long Rocky fan. With that being said I went into this film very cautious as almost the entire cast and crew were brand new. The trailers looked good, but today a good trailer is not necessarily an indicator of a good film. Sylvester Stallone killed it as a much older and more breakable Rocky. Michael B. Jordan's performance was as good if not better than Sly's. I think that from this day forward anytime I see Jordan, I will think of him as Creed and not whatever character he is playing. The story was engrossing and well thought out. The film pays a great amount of respect to the Rocky films while at the same time carving out it's own place in boxing film history. Honestly I have no idea how accessible this film would be to someone who's never seen a Rocky film, but I think the way the story flows it wouldn't be too much of an issue. Again, highly recommended.",

Growing up and in my adulthood I must've seen the entire Rocky series 10 times all through my life. Creed represents the passing of a torch to a new generation. Creed finds rocky very older and once again tryint to leave his fighting days behind him. He still has his small restaurant named after his deceased wife \"Adrian\" and he still makes frequent visits to her grave and now Paulie's too who it says died in 2012. Rocky beyond all is a loyal and loving person, which makes it impossibe in the end for him to turn his back on a new boxer named Adonis Johnson (Creed) who seeks his help. The illegitimate son of his former opponent turned best friend Apollo Creed. This movie is about Adonis's rise in the boxing circuit and Rocky finding his will to face a new kind of fight. This is definitely worth checking out if you grew up on Rocky and if you didn't its a great way to meet a classic character for the first time.",

The fight scenes are still a bit over-the-top, but the way they are shot is refreshing and gives Creed its own vibe versus its predecessors. Michael B Jordan is well-suited to the role of a man trying to come to terms with his famous namesake. Tessa Thompson is mesmerizing but underused in the second half. It still has a bit of that Rocky rah-rah element and perhaps would have been better with a little less Stallone, but overall the movie works because it pays homage to the earlier films (especially III and IV) while forging its own path. The writing is on the wall for sequels. Rocky fans will appreciate this outing.",

Even more, the story is not really that good; the new characters are poorly developed; and the movie made cheap attempts to look like something from 40 years ago. Yet....It worked. CREED kept me interested the entire 132 minutes--it never got boring, and I never looked at my watch. The action is spaced out, but there's enough for us boxing fans...and the boxing itself was done with more than a reasonable amount of reality. The real gem IMO, is Stallone's acting. I think had Stallone never found so much success in action movies, we might have seen an actor wit ha career more like that of George Clooney or Jeff Bridges....a career with some acting roles that deserved praise for acting itself....this movie provided a dose of that.

    "review": "  Emotions ran high for me during this film. As a young man who has experienced his fair share of life struggles and tribulations, CREED was a refreshing reminder to me, and many others in the theater, that every person alive today is in control of their own destiny. A film that is dominated by it's two lead performances, CREED is not just another ROCKY film. It, like our hero himself, establishes it's own unique identity that is almost completely separate from it's predecessor, Director Ryan Coogler struck gold yet again, and with a familiar face appearing as our titular character. Now, the performances.Michael B. Jordan delivers his finest performance in a film since his role in the critically praised TV show, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS. Jordan never comes off a pouty or cynical, despite his characters \"silver spoon\" background. Adonis \"Donny\" Creed is portrayed as a confused but determined young man, eager to prove himself and to make it to the boxing world that his father dominated, to confirm his place in the world but also to prove that he exists. If Jordan were a pitcher; he just pitched a shutout.There isn't much to say about Ol' Sly Stallone's performance in this film. After finally realizing that the franchise had a better chance at surviving in more capable, younger hands, Sylvester made perhaps the greatest move he's made so far in his post-80's career, He. Actually. Acted. Acting again as the beloved (but incredibly creepy as far as box office bomb ROCKY BALBOA goes) Rocky Balboa, Stallone gives a breathtaking, emotionally exhausting performance which is without a doubt the best of his career. I can't put into words how incredible this performance is without shivering at the keyboard I'm sitting at right now. While many actors and actresses and actresses of yesteryear have provided us with an accurate look into chemotherapy and the effects of cancer, none struck truer to the core of me than this performance. If Stallone doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for this performance, I think it might be time to seriously reconsider what it means to have the words \"Oscar Award Winning\" attached to your name. Bravo, Sly. Bravo.",

    "review": "  I saw an early screening of Creed a week ago, so I thought with it releasing today I would give ya'll my opinion on it! As a big Rocky fan I came into Creed with some relative high expectations. They were met and then some! Creed centers around Adonis Johnson (Michael B Jordan) the bastard son of Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). Adonis has constantly lived with a chip on his shoulders. When he was young he bounced around to orphanage to orphanage until he was found by Apollo's wife Mary (Phylicia Rashad) and brought to live with her. Several years later Adonis is working at an office, but secretly travels down to Mexico to box. Fightings in his blood and he's really good at it. He decides to quit one day and travel to Philadelphia to seek out Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). Adonis want's Rocky to train him much like his father trained Rocky (during the events of the third film after Mickey died). Rocky is reluctant at first, but soon see's a fire in Adonis that reminds him of Apollo. Rocky trains Adonis and get's him set for a fight which eventually leads to an even bigger bout...for the both of them. Not spoiling anything here, but the fight scenes in this film are the best I've seen out of all the Rocky films. It's faced paced and realistic looking. The two main leads in Adonis and Rocky work off each other so well. It's a great chemistry between the two and I just loved the nods to the older films. The film also stars Tessa Thompson as Blanca, Adonis's neighbor that's a musician that he eventually falls in love with. This part of the movie is probably the weakest aspect because of the lack of screen time between the two, but it didn't take away from anything for me. The movie raises the question what's in a name? Adonis doesn't go by the Creed name because he feels people don't think he's earned it and that's the only reason he get to fight, but by the end he soon realizes that there's more to a name than just the fame or popularity. Regardless, this movie was a blast and I highly recommend checking this out during this holiday week!",

    "review": "  Ryan Coogler's Creed delivers on everything that a great boxing film should, and represents a full return to form for Rocky. Directed by superstar in the making Ryan Coogler, and starring powerful performances from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone the film is amazing. Creed is exhilarating, beautifully acted, while honoring the previous Rocky films lovingly. The film may be a little too familiar at times, but at least approaches it's overused plot lines with a different take. From the opening scene the film captures your attention, showing us a glimpse into who this character is \"a fighter.\" The film remains an exhilarating journey with this character, who is easy to connect with. As the film progresses, Coogler mixes old techniques like the famous Rocky slow motion sequences, with newer (less used) techniques like very intimate fight sequences, where the camera helps the viewer feel like they're standing in the ring. The film will draw you in from the moment it starts, to the moment it ends. One reason the film is so exhilarating is the terrific acting of Michael B. Jordan, who leads this journey. Once again teaming up with director Ryan Coogler Jordan anchors the film, and in the process creates a relatable, and human main character. On this note, after seeing \"Creed\" and \"Fruitvale Station\" I would be willing to make the bold statement that I think Ryan Coogler is on his way to becoming the next Scorsese. All of this being said what may be even more satisfying is seeing Sylvester Stallone return to form as Rocky Balboa. Some may criticize the movie for not bringing a lot of original plot lines to the movie, they would be right. However, while not very original the film handles these plot lines from a different perspective. No longer are we watching the nobody rising up against the odds, now we see a man trying to get out of the larger than life shadows of a man he never knew. Those who love the Rocky films recognize the slow motion moments in almost every film, and the iconic way the boxing matches were choreographed. Creed departs from the overuse of slow motion and more adapts the fight choreography of Raging Bull, while still mixing the essence of the Rocky fight scenes.  The way Coogler mixes old with new in many different ways helps make the whole film feel like the story it's telling. Coogler captures the tone of the older Rocky films, while also making a film distinctly different. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone deliver, and Creed ends up being exactly what fans hoped it would be. In the end if you have the time go see Creed, it's a terrific 2 hours to spend.",

The directing and cinematography is excellent, Michael B. Jordan is a diva, and Sylvester Stallone is a lock for an Oscar nom (he's that good).

    "review": "  Back in 2013, first-time feature director Ryan Coogler wowed the independent film world with his harrowing and extraordinarily thoughtful movie about the 2009 murder of Oscar Grant III�by Oakland transit police, entitled�\"Fruitvale Station\" (after the Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, station where Grant was killed). Born in 1986, Coogler is not yet 30, and here he comes with a second - much bigger - movie,�\"Creed,\" about the son of the great fictional boxer Apollo Creed (from the�\"Rocky\" films). Starring Michael B. Jordan (Grant in�\"Fruitvale Station\"), the film treads much the same territory as that of�every other boxing film ever made (you know, stuff about how your most dangerous opponent is YOU), recycling materials (and character arcs) from the original�\"Rocky,\" as well, yet has such heart and spirit that in spite of its lack of originality is terrific fun to watch. Unless you don't like boxing movies. In which case, what are you doing in the theater?It's an unusual step for a relatively young and untested director to take, for sure.�\"Creed\"�is not quite a franchise film, yet does qualify as a spin-off, even bringing Sylvester Stallone back as Rocky; quite a feat, considering how happy the Italian Stallion was with the way�\"Rocky Balboa,\" in 2006, had concluded the series (according to�\"The New York Times,\" anyway). At first it may seem far-fetched to imagine the filmmaker behind such an intimate drama like�\"Fruitvale Station\" tackling well-known universe, but as the film progresses, it quickly becomes clear that the protagonists of both stories share a lot in common, and not just because they're played by the same actor. Adonis Creed - Apollo's son - is a boy in a man's body, struggling to mentally grow into his physical size and join the adult world. Where Jordan's Oscar Grant has his mother as a needed mentor, his Creed has Rocky; both need guidance to navigate the pitfalls of responsibility. And both have a supportive woman (of course, what successful cinematic man doesn't?) by their side (as did Rocky). Anyone who doesn't know�how�this particular film is going to end has not been paying attention to the signpost markers.�Just as in the first�\"Rocky\" film, there's a preening self-involved antagonist for our hero, who refuses to acknowledge the underdog's validity as a contender. Just as in the first�\"Rocky\" film, there's the woman urging her man to be better. And just as in the first�Rocky film, there's a trainer doing his best to get the young wannabe ready for the big fight. There's no question that it's a great twist that Rocky is now the grizzled veteran, but lay the first film side by side with�\"Creed\" and it's hard to distinguish the two. Except, you know, that now our main guy is African-American, which�could have allowed Coogler - African-American, himself - to discuss issues of race in the boxing world. But he doesn't. So what we're left with is an entertaining riff on a popular boxing legend, but a riff compromised by formula (aren't riffs usually more improvisatory?). Coogler and Jordan (and even Stallone)�most definitely confirm�their talents here (though poor Tessa Thompson, from�\"Dear White People,\" has nothing to work with); I just wish that talent had been used in service of something truly new and fresh, upholding the promise of their first collaboration.�Here's hoping for Round 3!",

I've seen hundreds of movies in the theater, many of which had me on the edge of my seat. But this was the first movie where I literally jumped out of it. The boxing matches were dare I say, more exciting than real life matches. They're that good! Michael B. Jordan was great as the son of Apollo Creed, but Stallone will be taking home a bunch of supporting actor wins once awards season rolls around. Great movie, and whether or not you're a 'Rocky' fan...

I was also very curious to see where the franchise would go after Rocky Balboa (which I haven't seen). Well, Creed was utterly incredible, making it one of the biggest surprises of 2015!Michael B. Jordan delivers yet another fantastic performance as Adonis Creed. He is so likeable and relatable, and his emotional range is huge. The rest of the supporting cast work well, including the clich�d British villain. However, Sylvester Stallone is the real star here. Just when you thought he had become a parody of himself, he comes and gives a possibly Oscar worthy performance as Rocky Balboa! Though the plot of Creed is your clich� boxing movie plot, it actually works in its favour! I won't reveal anything, but some moments almost had me tearing up. The fighting scenes were incredibly filmed, with many long-takes that were expertly directed. The finale of the movie also had my heart-pounding like no other film has done so far this year!The editing, cinematography and writing were all excellent, with many memorable moments. The musical score also lives up to the Rocky standard!Overall, Creed was a huge surprise! It had excellent acting, fantastic fighting sequences and a very intriguing story. See it!RATING: 9.5/10",

They fill you in the first few minutes for those that haven't seen the other movies but this really works as a stand alone spin off. Michael B. Jordan is great and could really drive another franchise and do it well. The big revelation in this movie is Sylvester Stallone himself. Look, I have not seen most of Stallone's films so saying this is his best performance isn't saying much. He puts so much compassion and humor into this performance and it is unlike I've ever seen him before. The awards buzzers have started whispering Stallone's name and I wouldn't complain about that one bit. Tessa Thompson is also wonderful as Jordan's love interest. Some of my favorite scenes were the quite scenes that were just Jordan and Thompson bonding. But of course the other great scenes are the motivational scenes from Stallone training Jordan plus some other heartfelt scenes that I won't give away. The writing is quite great here plus Ryan Coogler's direction. He really gave this franchise new blood and judging by the reviews of 2-6, it was much needed. This is definitely the best boxing movie of the year over Southpaw and a great crowd pleaser",

Yes, there are some moments in the movie that are as predictable as a slow right hook, but Creed manages to rise above. This isn't a film for the art house movie snob and you may see some reviews that thumb their nose at it. For the person willing to plunk down ten bucks or more to get two hours worth of entertainment, this is well worthy of the investment. Lastly, I expect Sylvester Stallone to earn an Oscar nomination for his supporting role in the film. The one real surprise in the movie was that he was allowed to act again, maybe for the first time since the original Rocky. And he nails it.",

    "review": "  Boxing movies generally have a lot of the same plot points, and this one is no different. Before I give my thoughts on this film, I would just like to mention that I saw this at a very early screening. This is important because seeing a film with no official reviews lets you form a opinion much easier. Now, we all know and love Rocky movies. They are inspirational, and a huge part of the 80?s. Creed was a success for me because it followed the traditional boxing movie formula well. Yes, it was cliche at times but overall it was enjoyable. Michael B Jordan was a great lead/Rocky character. He had the acting chops, the look, and the heart. It's not easy to pull off heavy, emotional scenes, and he did with ease. The chemistry between Jordan and Tessa Thompson was very good as well. I totally believed their chemistry and all the love scenes. Now, the character you have all been waiting for. Rocky fricking Balboa. He is an American hero and beloved by all. How is he in this film? Great. As usual Rocky is so damn lovable and gives great advice to all. Stallone added humor to the character which I did not expect. I loved it though! The story of this film is fine. It's a typical boxing movie plot, which is good, but could have been better. Ryan Coogler, the director, really did a great job. I liked his overall direction and style for the movie. Same style as his previous film, \"Fruitvale Station\" which was fantastic. As for negatives, the story was fine, but nothing special. I feel Coogler could have gone deeper into Creed's backstory and his relationship with his mother. Also, some scenes dragged on way too long and felt very unnecessary to the story. I did like this film and you should see it in a theater near you.",

    "review": "  First film in the Rocky series not to be written (or directed) by Sylvester Stallone, but wow, Ryan Coogler definitely made a knock out, pun intended. This isn't just a reboot as the trailers might suggest, this is Rocky VII and Balboa's story arc has just as much meaning as Creed's, if not more. Yes, it's still a passing of the torch, but come one, Stallone is 69 years old, and they did in the best way possible.Also, no spoilers, but the cinematography of Creed's first pro fight is Jaw droppingly good.",

    "review": "  Passionate and powerfully acted, Creed serves as a celebration of life, a tale of redemption while honoring the past it's truly a triumph for star Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. Ryan Coogler is the real deal, offering a raw, gritty feel that pays tribute yet respect the past predecessors of this franchise. Michael B. Jordan shows sincerity as a hard working, obstacle fighting \"Square\" who overcomes odds giving you that glimmer that you're staring at what seems to be a parallel to a young Sly in Rocky. Worthy of the legacy of Creed and remains faithful to the legacy of Balboa. One fighting for their life the other fighting for \"A life.\" One of the best films I've seen this year. Already amped to see where this franchise goes next.",

I have never seen any of the Rocky movies but I am definitely open to watching them now. Glad I went to go see the screening :)",

    "review": "  No, it's not Rocky VII, although it is a continuation of the franchise. In my opinion, this is an attempt to reboot the franchise. It's pretty predictable, but fun to watch, although there are some lulls. But there's quite some humor, although Stallone's Balboa is harder to understand, than ever, with his constant mumbling. (Note to remind Pops to get the closed captioning device.) But that's the character. And as good of an actor that Jordan is, even with a buffed-up physique, I don't see him as a prize fighter in reality, much less going up for the title, and even less of a chance of winning. But, the storyline builds on that premise, which ends up becoming yet another Rocky movie. However, unlike the other, earlier Rocky movies, I didn't find myself moved to root for the underdog in this one.",

    "review": "  Just watched an advanced screening for \"Creed\". This is not only a worthy sequel to the \"Rocky\", but a great way to continue the franchise. All of the acting was fantastic across the board. The characters are fully formed and the directing is perfect. Some of the fight sequences had be choreographed so well that continuous stedi cam shots without breaking the action left my jaw on the theater floor. SPOILERS: DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT THE FILM RUINED> YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED>>>>>>The character of Rocky in the film comes full circle. I honestly had a lump in my throat and held back tears for the second half of the film. A well written send off for the character. I could see why Stallone made the film. If you love this franchise you will not be disappointed. The film ended with a round of applause as the credits rolled. If you want to see a positive uplifting film this Thanksgiving then get your tickets to \"Creed\", sit back, and be entertained. Real heart and soul on par with the original film.",

    "review": "  Sylvester Stallone is back as the punchy not so good talking Rocky, he even has a scene where he demonstrates that he can actually act a bit, which I felt he nailed. While not as moving as Up, the scene was pretty moving. Others may call it formulaic but, definitely worth seeing if you enjoy the Rocky franchise. As the title suggests this movie isn't about Rocky he just happens to be in it (a lot), but it really is Michael B. Jordan as Adonis who carries the movie. As with any other Rocky movie there aren't many female roles, two, but both are played as strong people. Tessa Thompson as Bianca especially plays the role of a strong person who has her own life, goals, and drive. While you only see her when her life is intersecting with the life of Adonis, it is made clear that her life is not about being a cheerleader in need of support in his.",
