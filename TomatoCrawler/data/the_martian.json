    "review": "  A great movie all around, which should be expected when Ridley Scott is dealing with excellent source material. My only criticism is that Scott did not invest enough in the actors. The film could have been much more powerful if Matt Damon had been allowed to play up the personal, emotional struggles of isolation and fear his character must have been going through -- as he has proven he is able to do -- rather than having him appear to be chipper and relatively confident throughout his harrowing ordeal. Daniels, Ejiofor, Chastain and Mara also have proven abilities to dig deeper than the characters Scott gave us. The sole cognizable attempt at emotional expression and conflict was in Sean Bean's character, and it was a complete misfire. This is likely to be the only movie I'll ever see where Kristen Wiig is the deepest well of emotional expression. \"The Martian\" is a very good film but it could have been -- and should have been -- even better.",

    "review": "  The Martian Review:There are some movies you know going into them that they're going to be great. The Martian was not only great but exceeded all my expectations as well. A return to form from director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) who directed last year's abysmal \"Exodus: Gods and Kings (which I adeptly gave 1/5 because I was happy that it ended), The Martian soars to the heights of a great space epic. In fact the thing that I loved about the Martian more than Alfonso Curon's \"Gravity\" and Christopher Nolan's \"Interstellar\" is its optimism. Botanist Mark Watney played by an incredible Matt Damon, plays his character to a tee without depressing or alienating viewers. It is through this lens that we see plausible science (well somewhat plausible) succeed and the audience truly root for Mark Watney to be rescued by his Ares III crew creating a palpitating suspense during the rescue launch. That aside the supporting cast is impeccable, literally every single character feels important and is given enough screen-time to shine, from Jessica Chastain's Commander Lewis to Chitwetel Ejiofer's Vincent Kapoor. Also to be highly commended is the diversity of this cast- where every character is simply just equal- just the way it should be in every film.Finally the cinematography and soundtrack is also used brilliantly with breathtaking visuals of the simmering sun making it's way below the mountaintops of Mars and a soundtrack that utilises Abba's \"Waterloo\" to great effect also scores some brownie points in my eyes.All in all a fantastic film and so far my favourite film of 2015:5/5",

    "review": "  An astronaut/botanist is stranded on Mars and must rely upon ingenuity to survive.It's hard to divorce my opinions about this film from my opinions of the book, for after the film I thought that they had adapted the book but left out all the good parts. The cut that bleeds most is the final chapter, which gives the whole story a philosophical significance that is both poignant and naively inspiring. Nevertheless, what remains is a fine tale of how science, wit, perseverance, and intelligence are greater weapons than anything else. Mark Watney's humor survives in the film, even if the film strips him of his vulgarity, all in the service of obtaining a PG-13 rating (really, we must reexamine why one \"fuck\" corrupts thirteen- to seventeen-year-olds so much more than ten, twenty, or 100 \"fucks\"). Mark Watney's intelligence survives the film version, even if the film's story presents him with fewer obstacles to \"science the shit out of,\" all in the service of giving director Ridley Scott the opportunity to show beautiful Martian sunsets in the time allowed. That Mark Watney character is quite a survivor. Overall, please watch the film - it's good and it's values are inspiring - but read the book too.",

    "review": "  Personable sci-fi flick from Ridley Scott that updates the old Robinson Crusoe stuck on a desert isle (and how he learns to survive) trope. First off, make that a deserted planet. Mars. And the background and the hope this film presents is grounded on is our quest to reach beyond the limits of Earth's gravity (and so it loudly parades that we'll overcome every adversity). Now there's science here but let's not get too excited. The emphasis is interestingly on the personalities involved, interestingly because while the characters are the primary focus of this tale on one hand, on the other hand they are only the flimsiest of constructs with zero time spent \"getting to know them\". We only watch while they react to danger. Who they are or who they might be outside of these situations, we never get to see. This momentary drawback weakens the film, but only by a bit. Its worth a watch, Jessica Chastain and Jeff Daniels leading a deep bench of secondary players.",

    "review": "  Equal parts fun, smart and thrilling. The Martian is a survival story that doesn't ramp up melodrama but instead chooses to humanize Watney's struggle with entertaining laughs.A love letter from Ridley to fans of the book, it's simply flawless in pacing, dialogue and characterization. The only element missing is visual style, there's nothing iconic to look at that'll let us recall the film in years to comeStill it's beautifully directed and perfectly acted, an exciting ride through and through. Most definitely a piece of hard fiction that'll leave a mark for 2015 rivaling the success of genre-similar \"Interstellar\" of 2014 yet completely different in approach of tone.",

    "review": "  I really like how this film relied more on story than on action and special effects. Goddard manages to keep the screenplay interesting, and sometimes funny, throughout the entire 2 hours and 14 minutes. One of my pet peeves in movies, however, is an isolated man talking to himself and explaining all of his actions as if he knows he is being watched by an audience and is obligated to amuse them. I know that sounds a bit like saying \"Hey Matt Damon, be less entertaining,\" but what I am really saying is that I wish the film's entertainment came from a more natural place. Other than my personal bete noire, the film is very well directed, acted and written. A broad range of moviegoers will enjoy it, I would recommend it to anyone.",

    "review": "  Based upon Andy Weir's nuts-and-bolts scientific \"what if\" tale, The Martian is the movie equivalent of Apollo 13 crossed with Cast Away. Just far less personable volleyballs. But there are potatoes. Space potatoes.After a powerful storm on Mars forces NASA's crew to flee, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead and left behind. He wakes up hours later, shrapnel in his gut, and retreats back to the Mars mission base. He has to survive close to two years of he has any hope of being rescued on the hostile world. Before that, he has to establish some kind of communication with NASA, and even before that he has to somehow grow food in the arid Martian soil. Back at home, NASA is debating their limited options to bring back Watney and whether or not they should tell his cremates that he survived. In conversations with my friend and critical colleague Ben Bailey, he said that The Martian was the opposite of Gravity, a film he subsequently loathed, because it was smart people making smart decisions. There is an inherent enjoyment watching intelligent people tackle and persevere over daunting challenges, and this sets up The Martian for lots of payoffs and satisfaction. We see both sides of the problem and it provides even more opportunities for challenges and payoffs. Naturally the stuff on Mars is more compelling because of its extreme dangers and isolation, but the Earth scenes are also enjoyable as the NASA determines the soonest they might reach their lost astronaut. Just like the similarly themed Apollo 13, there are challenges to be overcome and the solutions are not without risk themselves. I enjoyed how the screenplay kept throwing out new obstacles; just when you think you can breath for a while the status quo is upset again. The slew of new obstacles doesn't feel contrived either but rather realistic setbacks. It's a wonderful storytelling structure that constantly keeps things moving forward and ramps up the urgency. As a result, we don't ever feel safe right until the climax, and even then you're still sweating it out because of all the complications and adjustments. It's revitalizing to watch a movie that treats science with a sense of reverence. Mark Watney endures in the most hostile of environments through his ingenious use of the resources he has because of his understanding of science and math. Just as MacGyver proved there was something satisfying about watching a guy make a bomb out of a toilet paper tube, some chewing gum, and a bobby pin, it's entirely enjoyable watching Watney think his way out of problems, and this starts early on. Watney's first problem after he regains consciousness is to remove an embedded piece of shrapnel in his gut. The scene plays in a methodical fashion without any obtrusive edits, allowing the full task to settle in with the audience. The man has to perform surgery on himself and dig inside himself, and if he doesn't get this done soon, sepsis might set in (no doctors without borders here). From there, the situation only gets more serious as Watney's food supply, even when generously rationed, will only last a fraction of the time it would take NASA to send a rescue team. He has to grow food on an alien planet. That itself could be its own movie, a glossy crossover special from the SyFy Channel and the Home and Garden network. This is a survival story that doesn't rely upon coincidence or some sort of divine intervention but on the understanding and admiration of science and its possibilities. Though America's favorite astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson says that in this movie universe, all the science decisions are being made by science professionals rather than, you know, politicians who adamantly open ignorant statements with, \"I'm not a scientist.\"Another aspect I wasn't quite expecting but took hold of me is how uplifting The Martian turns out to be. It's a celebration of human endeavor and particularly cooperation, as the United States reaches out to other nations for assistance. Watching the determined souls risk their lives to retrieve one fallen man is the kind of thing that represents the best in us. Sure, there's something to be said about the fact that it's one prized American life that countries are spending billions of not trillions of dollars to rescue and perhaps that money would be better spent helping more lives on Earth. There's also the curious fact that the world has spent a ton of money rescuing Matt Damon in movies. From Saving Private Ryan, to Interstellar, and now The Martian, we seem to value Damon above all else. This isn't exactly a one-man show with half of the running time flashing back to Earth but Damon's star quality and acting chops makes it so you don't mind being marooned with this man. Watney's recorded messages are a slick way to deal with the internal thinking of its protagonist while giving the character more opportunities to charm thanks to a rich sense of gallows-level humor. At no point is Mark Watney flippant about his unique predicament but his sense of humor goes a long way to further engender the audience's good will. He's not moping and having existential crises; he's getting to work, and it's through the problem solving that we get to know this character, his ingenuity, his personality, his fears, and his distaste for disco music. Damon steers clear from playing the character too large and bearing his soul as the metaphorical representative for all of humanity and its place in the cosmos. He's just one guy who happens to be lost millions of miles from his home planet, and he's making the best of it. Being a Ridley Scott film, naturally the film is downright impeccable from a technical standpoint. The photography is great, communicating the frightening and awe-inspiring scope of the alien topography, especially when compared to maps for scale. The visuals find ways to further help communicate Watney's dilemma and diminished resources. Scott's visual sensibilities are so naturally attuned to developing tension. I was holding my breath at times from the suspense of certain sequences even though I long assumed that Watney would make it back home safe and sound. A scene with a desperate need for duct tape was a real nail-biter. There isn't a bad performance amongst the star-studded cast of actors who must have been grateful for even a tiny morsel of screen time. I have no idea what Kirsten Wiig really does in this movie as the NASA PR person besides fold her arms in rooms, but hey, she's there, along with Donald Glover as a socially awkward physicist. Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) gets to pour over the regret of leaving a friend behind, Jeff Daniels (Dumb and Dumber Too) gets to once more practice his skill of being an authoritarian blowhard he honed from The Newsroom, and I even was able to tolerate Kate Mara (Fantastic Four), so that's something. The Martian is a natural crowd-pleaser. It's engineered from the start to engage an audience with its survival thrills, present a series of increasing payoffs with new challenges and solutions, and by the end of our journey we're treated to a rousing finish that carries a poignancy and sense of inspiration about the best in all of us, what can be accomplished through grit and cooperation and sacrifice. It's a movie that let's the science of survival be the ultimate star, with Damon serving as a handsome host to guide us through the marvels of the universe and duct tape. When dealing with the vastness of space and the vulnerability of human life, it's easy to feel insignificant in comparison, but that's where the human will to endure and to work together comes in and reconfirms the possibilities of the collective inhabitants of this giant blue orb. The Martian is a sci-fi thriller, a potent human drama, and one of the best times you can have at the movies. Nate's Grade: A-",

I can gladly say, \"The Martian\" is not only his best film in a very long time, but it is also one os 2015's best overall pictures. After presumed dead and left on Mars by his crew, botanist Mark Watney must use his scientific skills to savour/grow food to last him up to four years. Filled with unexpected humour, this film is able to balance a light-hearted tone while digging deep into the emotion when necessary. This film had me chuckling quite a bit, and I give full credit to Drew Goddard d Andy Weir who penned the script. This witty sic-fi rescue mission is also as intense as it needs to be, ramping up to the conclusion. From the visuals to the directing, from the writing to the cinematography, and from the acting to the believability of this film, it really is one of the biggest achievements of the year by far. I was enthralled from start to finish. Although I have to fault the film for ending a bit too abruptly, I can forgive that for being the only true thing to bother me. In the end, \"The Martian\" is a damn fine piece of filmmaking. Fantastic!",

It was also heartening to see some international cooperation. This movie shows how space exploration is really a team effort in every way. It takes a lot of dedicated people working together to make it happen, most of them behind the scenes, and the work they do makes a difference as to whether the astronauts live or die.Stranded astronaut Mark Watney survives on the red planet in spite of a lot of close calls, one day at a time, helping himself while a team back on Earth tries to figure out how to save him. While waiting to be rescued, Watney uses both humor and ingenuity to survive. The habitats and equipment seemed realistic, although I was a bit skeptical about a single layer of plastic or canvas or duct tape being utilized in a few instances, but hey, it could work. Maybe...The beautiful rocky and sandy Martian landscape was reminiscent of images taken by real life Mars rovers that have been exploring the red planet for years. Ultimately, Captain Lewis and the crew have to make a decision whether or not to put their own lives on the line in order to try to save Watney's. Naturally, they do right by him and the rescue is on. I expected the final no holds barred attempt to save Watney to be over the top, and it was, satisfyingly so.",

I ended up giving it a go because it was the only movie I hadn't seen yet that I would be ok with letting my daughter watch as well. I am surprisingly glad I did, it's so refreshing to see a \"feel good\" movie that involves being stranded in space where they leave out all things tedious and keeps up a good pace without fluffery so everyone watching understands what's going on (and i don't have to keep explaining it). I wasn't expecting funny and Matt Damon seemed to have a lot of fun with it. His narrative often explained plot holes before I could point them out in a rather tongue in cheek way that I enjoyed. This is a good one to add in anyone's collection and a much better every-nation in the world unite movie than anything.Independence Day.",

    "review": "  A Ridley Scott film - starring Matt Damon - tells a story of a stranded austonaut in Mars. The film was compared with Nolan's Interstellar, which later I will share my thoughts about it.The film was GREAT sci-fi film - touching, inspirational, funny, but with high suspense, and mostly accurate with science.Matt Damon was incredible. He made the character looked very much alive and surviving. The scenery or the visual effect was incredible and well placed. I saw a lot of movie with fucked-up visual effect - especially sci-fi. But, the really nailed it with this movie!.The scoring - which was made by Harry Gregson-Williams - was also great. I mean when you hear it, the score feels like it was made for an every day living drama. But, how amazing Williams put it on another planet! Also the soundtrack! HAHA! They're hillarious!Now, I'm going to compare it with Interstellar (2014).Overall - for me - Interstellar was still winning with its genius director, Christopher Nolan. The Martian (2015) can't defeat Intertellar's puzzle and mind-fucked situation. But The Martian won because of the characters - they are easily identified. We usually know what our next emotions would be as the film ran. Interstellar lacks of this, we don't know what the emotions are next. Because of the puzzle of course.On the technical side, Interstellar used traditional technology - which is still very effective. The actors can feel more of the real atmosphere. The Martian used green screen - nuff said.Also the scoring. How can you defeat Hans Zimmer? I still like to hear Interstellar's ORIGINAL music. The Martian lacks of its originality of music.But I still like both of them as sci-fi movies. These two movies proofs themselves to me that they are both intelligent. Even though they lack at some point.THE VERDICT:The Martian is smart, funny - with high suspense - with strong cast and very effective use of science.*note: if you like Interstellar (2014), I think you will like this.",

The main thing audiences will be surprised about is how gripping, compelling, tense but overall how enjoyable this film is. In large part due to a definitive performance by Oscar hopeful Matt Damon. Damon's Watney offers audiences a great scope of entertainment at one moment, auto-biographical narrator, another science-action hero and then dejected survivalist, Damon's performance is one that gives audiences everything without ever seeming too much. At its core The Martian is a home-coming odyssey in the vein of the popularised Cast Away, and like its predecessor it never loses sight of this despite scientifically heavy rhetoric, a large cast and out of this world cinematography all of which is cemented to support and not drown out Watney's story. A journey into space that will leave everyone touched in some way, The Martian is one small step for man but one giant leap for cinema",

For what!? Suck it up, do some experiments, say thank you, eat the food you have and then clock out you fool. It's what you signed up for.But, okay, that's the story. It's a movie, I get it.

    "review": "  \"The Martian,\" the story of a man who is left in Mars by his crew only because they think he is dead, and his will to survive until help arrives. With a strong performance by Matt Damon as the lead, as well as a great supporting cast, Ridley Scott delivers one of his best in years.Damon stars as Mark Watney, astronaut and botanist that is all alone on the desolate planet of Mars, with enough food to last him a bit, but not enough until help arrives, which would seemingly take approximately 4 years. Using his skills as a botanist, he is able to grow a supply of potatoes on a planet that doesn't grow anything at all, as well as produce water. Damon does a swell job in the role, he's smart, charismatic, likable, and you definitely root for him. He doesn't have to show too much emotion in the film, up until pivotal points like the end when all seems lost and unfortunate. Not to take anything away from him, he did a great job, especially including humor considering the circumstances. The supporting cast is great as well. Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, even Donald Glover with his small role. I think my favorite performance here comes from Chiwetel Ejiofor though, who plays Vincent Kapoor, the man who finds out Damon's character is still alive and is willing to do his utmost to bring him home to Earth. I guess he just impresses me in general, but his acting is nothing short of compelling. You get the feeling that he actually cares, and plays the role perfectly.The plot and cinematography is great, using the landscapes of Jordan and Texas for Mars, and doing a great job making you believe that Damon is stuck on that god awful planet. The plot is simple, with minor plot twists and unfortunate events that set him back and forward at the same time. It's nothing jaw dropping, but Ridley Scott uses smart directing to make this a sort of Science Fiction film we aren't used to. There's no aliens or anything like that, it's man vs. time, and it's great.Overall I see why this film is nominated for 7 Oscars, it has all the intangibles for such credit. The acting, the cinematography, the directing, even the soundtrack selection, which may come as a surprise fits well. It's a film you should see, and it doesn't feel like 2 and a half hours because you get sucked into the plot hoping he returns home. Well done Ridley, this may be your best in a very long time, if not ever. 4/5 JD",

That said it come close enough that there is no reason to nitpick on any little thing just to find fault with it. This coming from someone who read the book before the film was even announced. Adaptations always have a disadvantage to the book reader audience but they pulled it off well enough that I have no complaints even if the improvised measurement of \"pirate-ninjas\" was left out. :PAn enjoyable and engaging film throughout!",

    "review": "  Rating: 4.5 out of 5 When someone tells you the synopsis of this movie being \"Matt Damon is stuck on Mars and they need to bring him back\" you instantly think of Tom Hanks in Castaway... but this movie (which I didn't see in the cinema) is more than that and one I regret not seeing on the big screen. Matt Damon portrays a botanist \"Mark Watney\" in a movie where due to bad weather on Mars is left for dead but survives. It's up to him and his whit to work out how to survive on Mars and find a way to get back home. While no one has never been to Mars, You can't help thinking how plausible everything Matt Damon does in the movie. Generally you go \"Bullshit, this would never work\" but through out this movie you are completely satisfied in thinking that everything he does could work if those issues presented themselves. The storyline of the movie keeps you wanted to cheer Matt Damon on and the acting from everyone is first class. I've heard the book takes it to another level and worth reading, but this movie while 2 and half hours long, was enjoyable from start to finish. So much so, I would have watched it again 10 mins after the end credits! A must watch!",

The cinematography is really impressive, the script is equal parts intense drama and really funny comedy (something that's massively underutilized in space movies) and the rewatch factor is pretty high, at least for me.

Lately he's been the director that always brings two things to the table (Cinematography, and amazing Sound), and with The Martian he brought a great cast and plot. Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is stranded on Mars and has to do whatever he can to survive the harsh cold and heat. The movie seems like it might be your average drama, but it was surprisingly funny with Matt Damon's wry humor, and selection for the musical score. Amazing cinematography, interesting plot, great acting, easy to follow and understand. Definitely worthy of an Oscar unlike Gravity. 4 1/2 out of 5",

The Martian forces us into a graphic confrontation with the mechanics, biology, psychology, physiology, programming and physics of a survival-and-rescue mission: so it suffers when the pieces don't add up.The biggest piece is that Mars does-and-does-not have an atmosphere of note. An horrific storm is the catalyst to the story, yet a parachute is all that is needed to cover his craft for launch - and a tarp is all that is needed to sufficiently pressurise his cabin. None of this adds up.Where does he get his oxygen from? His oxygen tanks are always full, the rover always has air and the cabin is able to restore its atmosphere after expelling everything into the vacuum. This doesn't make sense.Donald Glover appears to give us caculations-ex-machina (literally), we see he's used a supercomputer to crunch the numbers yet the numbers are wrong. These \"numbers\" are confirmed twice more by other scientists - yet the information is withheld that the only way the numbers can be adhered to is for drastic modification of the craft - and even then, the calculations are wrong and both the Hermes and Damon have to take drastic measures to course-correct. So really, it was crazy to go with this plan unless you could bank on some Hollywood magic.Otherwise interesting and beautiful to look at.",

    "review": "  \"The Martian\" is emotionally gripping and notably funny, and is not only accompanied by prodigious visuals and an astounding cast, but is one of the best movies of 2015. \"The Martian\" is a tale of a manned mission to Mars, and in the event of a terrible storm, one of the astronauts (Mark Watney) is struck by debris, and presumed dead. Turns out, Watney survived, and its up to him to science the s*** out of the situation, while the whole world bands together to show us that humanity is not dead after all. I have to start out by saying that this movie was flat out gorgeous. The scenery, the set designs, and the CGI were all very pleasing to the eyes, and it felt like I was actually on Mars. I loved the background and the visuals, and this movie just looked great. Considering its a movie that takes place on another world, it's surprising to say that there were many other factors that were even more notable. I even liked the camera work, and the creative use of different camera angles to capture different perspectives. Again, it makes everything feel so real, and even if you don't like this movie, that doesn't stray from the fact that it looks and was shot great.The actors in this movie were perfect across the board. There really were too many great performances to talk about each one individually, so I'm going to focus on just one. Matt Damon as Mark Watney was a revelation. He showed us why he's considered to be an amazing actor, and he put on an inspiring performance in this film. His ability to portray the character's personality and emotional states were a sight to see, and there was no one I would've rather casted for this role. I'm glad he won a golden globe for this movie, as he truly deserved it. Since everyone here did a great job, I'm just going to say props to the whole cast. I loved everyone from the protagonist, down to the supporting roles, and the acting in this movie really made it a great experience. There are plenty of big named actors who don't even play a big part in this movie, and all of them were standouts. When watching the trailer for this film, you'd expect it to be a more darker and grittier story, but in reality, this movie was actually pretty funny. The comedy is actually a big part of this movie, and it actually kept things light and enjoyable. There was a perfect blend between comedic relief and dramatic moments, which was perfect because it helped us, the audience, really feel like we were there with the characters. It felt like Watney always had something clever to say, which was great because it really created a positive tone within the movie. I really laughed throughout the movie, and it was actually a nice twist from your typical dark and depressing isolation movies. I think the message behind the comedy was to stay positive, even when times get tough, because if you do that, not only can you come out of the situation a better person, but you can really turn your life around for the better. Even though this movie was full of laughs, it was also full of intense and emotional moments. This movie manages to relay the severity of the situation to its viewers, but in the end, it really keeps a positive tone, and this movie is about something much more. This movie is about humanity, and the people on this earth, and how when tragedy strikes one man or one nation, there is still something within us all to band together and help each other. Like Watney said in the trailer, when a natural disaster hits a nation, people from all around the world come together to send over medical supplies and rations. When one man is left on another planet millions of miles away, people from all around the world come together to support said human, throwing away any conflicts between them of any kind. This really shows that there's still humanity in this world, and to always have hope. The strong message of hope is definitely present here, and it is awe-inspiring. The film teaches you to have hope, even in the worst of situations, and that if you stay strong, everything will be okay in the end. So in the end, I truly loved \"The Martian\" and every aspect of it. This was one of the best movies of the year, and I would actually consider it to be in my top 10 movies of all time. I can say that this movie can make you happy and hopeful, even when there's not much to be hopeful about. In the end, this was a perfect film, and a perfect film deserves a perfect grade.",

Being stranded on Mars, Watney must of had the mental strength of a 10,000,000 ton weight, Being able to cope, and watching the fantastic acting blew me away! I never really realized until this movie but Jessica Chastain (Lewis) is pretty damn cute and sexy. THe movie made #1 on my list, not because of her, but because of the realism. It felt real, like we actually sent people to Mars and shit goes massively wrong.",

There are several actors movi fans will recognize and they all do a really good job. The characters are also very likeable and you do find yourself rooting for Matt Damon to keep fighting till the end. Definately this movie should make Botonists proud.

With stunning visuals this movie, clearly pleases at a very basic and fundamental level. The performance of Matt Damon is probably one of his best, following a steady buildup to the climax. However, the movie has little to offer in terms of new cinematic experiences. Overall a fun movie to watch, but can be skipped.",

    "review": "  Definitely one of the BEST films of 2015. I'm so happy that there is finally a film that makes science, space, NASA, and Mars cool again. The script sizzles (Thank you Drew Goddard), the acting is great all around (with the standouts being Matt Damon and Chiwetel Ejiofor), and the soundtrack is tops. Despite some real serious subject material (We're dealing with a man's struggle to survive despite almost insurmountable odds), The Martian manages to be a very funny and fun film. It's thoroughly enjoyable. It's also a notable film because we get to watch Ridley Scott rise like a Phoenix from the ashes. Could this be a new start for the once great director? Only time will tell, I suppose. The Martian is a phenomenal, moving, and touching film that is one of the ultimate tales of man vs. nature (Yupp, I'm gonna say this one is WAY better than The Revenant). It's handled like it's telling a true story, and indeed it does feel real. Not only will you laugh, you'll also find yourself on the edge of your seat, and heck, you may even shed a few tears. SCIENCE!",

The film could have been much more powerful if Matt Damon had been allowed to play up the personal, emotional struggles of isolation and fear his character must have been going through -- as he has proven he is able to do -- rather than having him appear to be chipper and relatively confident throughout his harrowing ordeal. Daniels, Ejiofor, Chastain and Mara also have proven abilities to dig deeper than the characters Scott gave us. The sole cognizable attempt at emotional expression and conflict was in Sean Bean's character, and it was a complete misfire. This is likely to be the only movie I'll ever see where Kristen Wiig is the deepest well of emotional expression. \"The Martian\" is a very good film but it could have been -- and should have been -- even better.",

    "review": "  The Martian was deemed a comedy by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for the Golden Globe awards. It is definitely one of the most fun Ridley Scott films to date, even if it doesn't reach the sophistication of his films Alien and Blade Runner. This film is definitely not trying to be a comedy, however - it is a drama with a fun tone to it.Contributing to this fun tone is an ensemble made up of actors with great comedic chops such as Kristen Wiig, Donald Glover, and Michael Pena. Matt Damon recording his log while on Mars also proves to be funny throughout most of the movie. His character is great and shows a wide range of personality - he is a smart-ass and sarcastic when he is optimistic, and he is rightfully pissed off the next moment. In both of these situations Damon plays it so perfectly to come across as funny in both instances.His performance does get more dramatic though. As he spends more and more time on Mars he becomes desperate yet optimistic that he will be rescued. It is also unclear whether Damon had to lose weight for part of the performance, as weight loss in the character was noticeable but seemed almost unnatural upon viewing - heavy chance cgi was involved. Either way, Damon's performance in this film proves to show talent on a wide range of the spectrum.The shots are constructed very well in this film. The editing proves to be interesting as well. A lot of point of view shots are used and are labeled as such - most notably there are shots that represent directly the video log Damon's character is recording, and shots from inside his helmet and over his shoulder are used and labeled along the lines of \"suit camera - Watney.\"There's also a huge focus on technology - most notably screens - in this film as well. It is how NASA must communicate with Watney - first by satellite images, then by a camera on Mars with Watney, then through what is essentially e-mail. When NASA is communicating with other people on Earth the communication is done through the use of screens as well. It is unclear whether this is simply because technology allows for this way to communicate in our day and age, or if this is a commentary on the way we use technology. Or perhaps this is to compare and contrast to Watney's struggles - he is constantly recording video logs, but those logs are not used for communication.In the third act of the film it seems very similar to Apollo 13 since the focus is to help an astronaut come home. Since the struggle is to retrieve a lone survivor rather than to figure how to land on Earth safely, it proves to be more interesting and a lot more complex. Looking over the other great films of 2015, this film is amongst them, but not quite towards the top. This was an unexpectedly really fun movie from Ridley Scott.3.5/4.0",

The science fiction survival genre has become a big hit recently with 2013's 'Gravity' and last years 'Interstellar', both exciting and thrilling films, the latter which was in my opinion awe-inspiring, but 'The Martian' is something truly different. From the hands of sci-fi connoisseur Ridley Scott, the mastermind behind 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' comes the thrilling screen adaptation of Andy Weir's novel that follows an astronaut left behind by his crew on the surface of Mars after being presumed dead. Within the first few minutes, the audience are already on the edge of their seats in this gripping thriller that stars Matt Damon at the top of his game in an Oscar-worthy performance. Mr. Scott is back, and in full fury with this well-executed, thrilling and surprisingly humorous science fiction thriller.",

    "review": "  Let's get one thing out of the way right off the bat. True science has pissed in Ridley Scott's face. The Martian is about an astronaut who is left behind on Mars by a team that thinks him dead. He isn't. And now he is alone on an alien planet with dwindling food and oxygen resources. Where science screws the movie over is in NASA's recent announcement that there is evidence of water on the red planet. In The Martian, which mostly takes place there but was, I would assume, not filmed on location, there is no water or evidence of it, just rock and sand. Obviously when Ridley made the movie, we didn't know Mars had water, and by the time we found that out, the movie was in the can and ready to roll, leaving no time for a last minute addition to the plot. In fact, a major plot point in the film is the eponymous astronaut's efforts to grow food on a planet that has no water. So there you go, you've been warned. Don't go into this movie scoffing at the filmmaker's lack of scientific knowledge as some people have been doing. Cut them some slack. There seems to be a sub-genre gathering steam these last couple years. First we had vampires, then everything was zombies, now it seems Hollywood is preparing to beat to a pulp the person vs. space movie. You could even go so far as to say the sum of The Martian's parts is Gravity with a side of Interstellar. And while it doesn't achieve the visual elegance or pure spectacle of Gravity, or have the intelligence and scope of vision of Interstellar, it does feel like a worthy bedfellow. The Martian is based on a book, a book I didn't read. I don't read the book before the movie, I've explained this before, but the long and the short of it is I'd rather experience a story in a movie than on a page. Call me illiterate or unrefined, I can take it. I'm assuming much of the technical mumbo came from the book, rather than the (still very witty and smart) head of screenwriter Drew Goddard. In that case, my hat goes off to Andy Weir, who wrote it. The story has a lot of complicated (well, I found it complicated) scientific problems it needs to solve to keep Mark alive and get him home. I was impressed with its wit in this regard. I don't know how much of it is scientifically accurate in the real world, truthfully, I don't care. It worked for the film, so it worked for me. Matt Damon is very well cast as the poor fellow left alone on planet Mars. He carries much of the movie on his shoulders and if he wasn't up to the performance task, the movie would've failed. But this is Damon, he's proved himself capable of almost anything an audience could ask of him numerous times and he slides comfortably into the role of martian botanist Mark Watney. Back on earth, NASA is using its biggest brains to get Mark home. A parade of characters march through the film, each tasked with overcoming impossible obstacles and circumventing morale pummelling drawbacks. These characters are well acted, but some feel underwritten and provide the film with little more than a bridge to get from one arc or narrative beat to another (ahem, CNSA). I've been thinking about this movie a lot since I saw it. It's entertaining, it's gorgeously filmed (mostly on green screen I'm sure, but still), it's well acted and it has a lot of nice things to say about our planet's ability to unite under a given cause. And while the plot is very much the three act structure, with all the climaxes and obstacles in all the proper places, and it has more supporting characters than it can keep track of, it's still a good story and a fun adventure. I give it a hearty four stars and wait patiently for the next human vs. space movie to come rolling down the red carpet. Maybe Matt Damon can head back up there, this time with Ben Affleck for Good Will Hunting 2: How Do You Like Them Space Apples? It writes itself!",

It's crazy how easy it is to follow the complex science going on in the story and how entertaining the story continues to be throughout - even though NOT THAT MUCH happens really. The majority of the decisions are made pretty quickly by Matt Damon in Mars and his scenes are typically pretty fast-paced, but everything on Earth takes a couple scenes for each decision to be made and things to be discovered.Every scene in this film is important and integral to the development to the story - it's insane how lean this script turned out to be. And we still end up with pretty developed main characters (less so on the supporting cast, but they're all still interesting without the extra dev). It's mind-blowing. On top of that, the shots are gorgeous, the story beats rock-solid, and the dramatic action incredibly moving.Fingers crossed for those Oscar noms.",

    "review": "  The Martian is gonna be this season's \"Did you see?\" movie. People will be discussing at work and school and so forth. Being based on a popular book and being both family friendly and brainy enough that just about anyone can enjoy it, it was bound to be a hit. It doesn't hurt however that this is Ridley Scott's best film since his director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven and his best sci-fi movie since Alien. Damon also does some of his best work here. Really, any good actor could've played the part, but Damon also has the advantage of being very likable. Had they placed someone with less behind-the-scenes grace like Christian Bale or Russell Crowe in that spacesuit, the audience may have found it more difficult to identify with him. Damon is one of our good ol' American boys and he is easy to root for.Some may stay away from The Martian because they, like me at first, feel it all looks a little too familiar after Gravity in 2013 and Interstellar in 2014. While those are both good movies (Gravity in particular), The Martian is actually more akin to something like Apollo 13. The obviously fictional tale is presented so believably it almost feels like a true story. Very little about the film feels far-fetched. Also, a lot of the flaws that were noticeable in those recent films I mentioned are non-existent here. It's almost like Ridley Scott watched Gravity and Interstellar and said \"Ok, lads, you did good, but let me show you how this is done\". I can't stress enough that Scott is really at the top of his game here. I've heard people comment that his films have been hit and miss lately (they've been more hit for me), but this is Oscar-caliber directing and I hope he makes that short list of nominees.If the trailers didn't make the plot obvious enough-a group of astronauts must abandon their Mars mission early when a dangerous storm approaches their research site. Mark Watney (Damon) is struck by debris and lost in the storm. His crew does attempt to find him, but with a narrow window for escape they must assume he is dead and leave. Watney actually survived the injury and now must find ways to survive alone on Mars until he can make contact with NASA and a rescue mission can be executed. The film then shifts between Watney trying to stay alive, scientists on Earth researching ways to rescue him and his crew aboard the home-bound ship dealing with the guilt of leaving him behind.The supporting cast is quite a list: Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, Donald Glover, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sebastian Stan, Kristen Wiig, Mackenzie Davis, Benedict Wong and Aksel Hennie. Everyone is good, everyone. But this is Damon's show and they all know it. The other big star here is Mars itself. The visual & special effects teams, the production & art design teams, and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski have all put forth a good effort to make Mars a realistic, almost familiar, place to us. I attended a 3D screening and as far as that is concerned, I would recommend just seeking the largest screen you can. The story is so enthralling that it really doesn't need the 3D gimmick, but there a couple scenes like the storm at the beginning that utilize it well. But more important than 3D, this is a big screen movie. I don't care how fancy you think your home entertainment center is, this should be seen in the theater.The final quarter of the movie feels a little rushed compared to sections before it that took so much time obsessing over every little detail. However, I have not read the book and that may be more a fault with the source material than the movie itself. Then again, knowing Ridley Scott, there is bound to be a 4 hour director's cut at some point (or a few of them). This pacing issue is such a minor complaint though in a movie with so much to enjoy. The Martian is the best film I've seen so far this year and it will not be easy to top. 9/10?",

    "review": "  A great film, one of Ridley Scott's best. It's too early to say, but this optimistic, sane, science-based, solve-the-problem-with-your-smarts attitude might turn out as influential as the dystopian visions of \"Alien\" or \"Blade Runner\". This vision of the future is surprisingly convincing. It's a design masterpiece. It's refreshing. If I didn't know \"Apollo 13\" and \"Cast Away\", I might have been even more enthusiastic, but this is a better film than \"Cast Away\" and on the level of \"Apollo 13\". A rare family entertainment that looks awesome and makes you feel good.",

If you have not read the book and are looking for an honest review that will not have to do with why the book and so much better, look no further. So if you move past how the book is infinitely times better or whatever, this is actually a very good movie. The plot is moving and the character development is great. Matt Damon delivered another great performance as well as Jessica Chastain. The less major roles also had solid performances (I especially liked Donald Glover's part.) The only knock I would have on the movie is that while I enjoyed most of the dialogue, some of his personal logs on Mars seemed a tad forced to me, but the areas where I noticed this were few and far between. Anyways, it's a good find that you should definitely check out.",

Oh yes there are some cliches and you will at least see a NASA control room all whooping and high fiving once about something or other, but the vast majority of this concentrates on two very interesting stories: On the first hand we have Matt Damon making the journey from finding himself abandoned on Mars to overcoming obstacles of every variety so he can survive the many years his rescue may take. This story is the centre piece and is delivered with perfect directional pace and a number of sciency ideas that are well explained through the script. This keeps his plans interesting rather than baffling, or worst still, obvious, and it is easy to feel attached to the struggle rather than expecting deus ex machina to solve it all hollywood style. Damon makes a brilliant lead here. The second story here is of the team at NASA on earth, overcoming the many publicity and scientific issue involved in saving him. Once again, this is well paced and told in a believable and interesting manner. Between the drama and emotion, there is even some well placed humour meaning the Martian is a very rounded viewing experience. With a fantastic all-bets-off style ending, this is one of the most rewarding space based movies of all time surely.",

Whether it stands up to repeat viewings is debatable, as the central draw of finding out how Mark Watney will survive is gone. (That doesn't figure into my star rating)",

    "review": "  Matt Damon is left for dead during the rushed evacuation of a small-scale Martian expedition. It's like Apollo 13 on steroids, mixed with short dashes of 127 Hours, MacGyver and Survivorman. Much less of a one-man show than I was expecting, which gives the film a little more spirit but also a more conventional structure. I think it would've been a far more interesting, daring picture if we'd seen more personal video journals from space and less debate around a round table at NASA, if just because we've seen the latter film several times already. Damon is excellent, bringing a blend of hopeless desperation and punchy good humor that gives him credence as both a technical expert and a likable, relatable everyday guy. The supporting cast is scattered with some strange choices, though - Kristen Wiig in a dead-serious role and Sean Bean as a kind-hearted supervisor are particularly out of place - which left me enjoying the scenes with Damon alone in the red landscape much more than the rescue effort. Still, the epic moments far outweigh the sub-standard ones, there's a strong sense of humor beneath all the suspense, and the visuals are really pretty incredible. Bonus points for getting so much of the science right, too. I'm conditioned to expect a lot of flaws when I dig deeper into sci-fi like this, but apart from one notable exception (the weather on Mars), the experts looked at this one and said \"Yeah, that could actually work.\" Cool stuff.",

This movie pulls that off and in no small part by Matt Damon. I'd say I'm a neutral fan of his, can't say I find anything spectacularly well done or poorly done that I have seen but he keeps this story moving well despite the perception that it would go prettly slow.Hints of the 1972 flick Silent Running with Bruce Dern which still keeps the viewer interested despite the fact he's the only actor for the bulk of screen time.I like this movie....but not entirely sure why..... Perhaps because from a scienced level this story is almost believable and portraying a believale story well is the whole point of a movie and the job of an actor.",

    "review": "  I do not want to have anyone get the wrong idea. There are many aspects of The Martian that thrilled me...and Matt Damon certainly captured my attention. However this is the kind of movie that lets the air out of my tires a bit. Ridley Scott who wonderfully directed Gladiator and Alien...is certainly skilled, yet he stretched out the movie for too long. I love the process of trying to survive in outer space...how could you do it? Well, you must have a brilliant mind to work it all out. There were moments when I thought there is just too many long moments on this red desert that looks like it was filmed in New Mexico with a red lens. Also the science does not always back up what you see in the film. No spoiler alert needed, but sometimes my need for a reality check would have been welcome. Yet this is an entertainment and certainly intelligently put together. Yet all the characters on Earth are stock characters that you would see in any B science fiction movie...and there is not emotional depth to the characters. How many scenes of people looking disappointed or waving their hands in the air as they cheer can we see? Apparently quite a few. It sounds like I did not like this picture...yet I remember Silent Running and I thrilled over the existential Gravity last year. Too many aspects of the film were derivative of other movies. And one last aspect. I hate a narrative that is constant. Silence is all right. Remember The Artist or perhaps Robert Redford's performance in All is Lost and lastly 2001 A Space Odyssey. All can say is I wanted less at times because that could be more. The approach left me a bit cold. Still a well made film.",

    "review": "  Words to describe this film is \"Ridley Scott + Sci-Fi = perfection\" As we know, Ridley Scott always does hit nor miss as a film maker. But when he does Sci-fi films, it will always be a nailer. And this proves why he's the best. The movie caught me by surprised in such many ways. I never thought it could be this fun and humorous. And you know, a film like this ends up in a very dramatic way I can sense it. A story that involves team work ends up pretty epic. This is one of those films that keep you on track and interested, A character driven story with great survival. Very fictional yet it could happened in real life. Wondering how would you survive in one planet, calculating the amount of sources you got. I really like the whole narrative thing as the main character talks about the situation and do something about it. Movie is clever too, it also shows how to handle pressure on certain situations that us viewers could also think about it. I love the cast, especially Matt Damon he deserves any accolades on this film. He's always a fantastic actor. An unusual Ridley Scott film, funny, intense and epic. Before I forget, I love the LOTR reference it is still funny though. And Lewis' disco tracks, those things are some funny sh*t. Definitely one of the best films of 2015.",

One has to suspend belief in the goings-on in the film. I arrived a few minutes late, so I don't know if they started it with a specific year in the future. Still, it was suspenseful and some of the cultural commentary had its humorous moments. Considering all the \"high\" ratings this has received, I guess I was expecting a WOW kind of movie. I also am getting real tired of the vulgar profanity use being more and more used. Still, it's entertaining for what it is.",

I initially did not want to see this, because I felt it would be too similar to movies like Castaway or Life of Pi, where one man has to carry the entire movie. What a surpre then, when it turned out that the film has more in common with something like Apollo 13 or Armageddon where the film equally spends as much time on the ground at mission control and with another space flight crew as it does with Damon by his lonesome on Mars. I also enjoyed that the film has an overly optimistic tone: that there really is no \"woe is me\" moment for Damon in that it seems like surviving is a totally workable task as opposed to some impossible odds. Finally the film has a nice comedic tone that keeps everything fairly lighthearted. It's a pretty great movie.",

It's about a group of astronauts who are just finishing the mission on Mars, but when a ferocious storm hits, Damon is hit by debris, his crew assumes he is dead and leaves him behind. The Martian is fantastic. Great cast (Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wig), Damon gives one of his best performances since the Bourne series. Its crazy this isn't a true story because the movie made the situation feel so believable. The plot is so interesting and fascinating that it draws you in and doesn't want to make you leave. Every point in the movie is set up perfectly for the next. Nothing is out of place, no plot holes, it feels right. The movie is filled with beautiful cinematography, this is honestly one of the best looking films I have ever seen. Space looked great, Mars was amazing, even inside NASA. It's hard to keep your eyes of the screen. The film was also hilarious! A lot of quick one liners that are laugh out loud funny. A great finale, despite its long run time, The Martian's ending brings a satisfying ending and wraps up the film perfectly. The Martian is well written, exceptionally entertaining, and intelligent film. I loved this film so much and was so happy it was good. One of the best movie watching experiences this year. The Martian is a film any Sci-Fi fan will enjoy.",

I regret to say I was a little bit disappointed.The Mars landscape is beautifully rendered en very credible with dust clouds and all. This is the main attraction of the movie.The main problem that there is nothing novel about this movie. There have been better movies for every aspect of the film:Human aspect/psychology of being marooned in a strange place: Cast Away did it so much better; set in space: Matt Damon's role in Interstellar was more credible than his performance here. Space action scenes: Gravity had me on the edge of my seat Ground control scenes: Apollo 13 already set the standardIn summary, the movie is a beautiful, funny, but nothing new or breathless.",

I loved the ingenuity motivated by desperation and all the tension steadily growing because of this. Nicely portrayed by Damon which is no surprise. It seemed to the second half of the movie was hijacked by Hollywood. It shifted gears from a survival flick to a kind of international UN tale of feel goodery. Way to syrupy and hackneyed to anything close to interesting. Even getting China into the mix. I'll give them credit that's a new one at least they could have made it the Russians since the seem to be the space race leaders right now.

Matt Damon has really come around to being a leading man and they could have kept most of the attention on him and it would have been better. I thought it was a pretty big plot hole to go unexplained in that Damon's guy is supposed to be a botanist and yet the Mars team brought no seeds or fertilizer or a mini-greenhouse for experiments (Why bring a botanist to Mars then?!) and he has to resort to poop and potatoes to survive. The ending too was pretty ridiculous. Just suspend disbelief and you'll be fine. I'd like to read the book as I've heard it was much richer in pertinent detail.",

    "review": "  At one point in The Martian, Matt Damon's character mentions that he hasn't bathed in quite a while. My wife said, \"He must stink!\"I replied, \"Almost as much as this movie.\"I've seen worst movies to be sure. But I would have expected more from director Ridley Scott and certainly a great deal more from one of the better known planets in our solar system.Damon plays astro-botanist and electromechanical whiz Mark Whatney. This guy makes McGyver look like a five-year-old dealing with an incomplete Tinker Toy set.I suspect that Mr. Scott, while screen testing Jessica Chastain, said something to the effect of, \"Yes! That's it! That's the kind of acting I want in this film! I want everyone to simper and smirk and give me that \"can-do\" attitude. We'll do over two hours of just that! As well, we'll pepper the film with crummy pop music from the seventies. And we'll have none of that four-letter language that I've used in my superior films such as American Gangster. This is going to be a movie that the whole family can suffer through!\"The effects are great. And although I haven't been there yet, the Mars landscape looks real enough. But this is typically oveblown Hollywood schmaltz (and you just KNOW how it's going to end).I should finally mention another notable scene in this film where Damon is sitting in his Martian abode watching a video of a Happy Days episode. It raises the question, \"Would I rather be 225 million kilometers away on a cold and barren planet watching Happy Days, or subject myself to another movie like The Martian in the comfort of my living room?\"Tough call.",

Some of the lightheartedness shone through, but most of the jokes / humorous remarks were constrained. The plot is far-fetched, to say the least. Yes. I know. It's science fiction, but you are meant to believe the mundane stuff (like needing food, water and oxygen) but expected to believe some of the more absurd moments in the film. I was also horribly disappointed that someone (I can't believe Ridley would do this) lifted a great line right from Ron Howard's Apollo 13, when someone refers to a young astro-dynamics wunderkind as a \"steely-eyed missile man\".

    "review": "  \"The Martian\" is the kind of crowdpleaser that causes one to rejoice - not in the mood for underestimating audience intelligence or overdoing sentimentality, it is an attention-grabber of the \"Apollo 13,\" \"Gravity\" category, slightly concerned about its setting but not as much as it is with the textures and colors of its characters. Surprising is how we don't question the fact that it is, basically, a shipwreck movie set on Mars; we are too consumed by its authentic drama and droll humor. It feels like the first time in ages where a blockbuster's strengths have relied on its humanistic elements and not on its effects. This is one of the best movies of the year. Matt Damon, an apparent successor to the Paul Newmans and Robert Redfords for most of his career, was born to play the role of astronaut Mark Watney, whose humility and unforced charm cogently match his own. As the film opens, he is a part of a manned mission to Mars, which entails the study of the planet's 31 Sols, him as the ship's botanist. The journey is cut short, though, when a massive storm derails anything by means of safety, forcing the troop to return to their orbiting vessel without Watney, who was hit by debris and is assumed dead.  Not so. Hours later, he awakens, impaled in the stomach by an antenna and without much oxygen in his tank, but still very much alive. Well aware that he has no contact with NASA or his crew, Watney maintains a cool exterior and works with what he has, which, luckily, includes a sizable amount of food and shelter stable enough to withhold Mars's harsh elements. He calculates that his only chance of rescue will arrive in four years at the latest. Fortunately, improvisation and quick-wit are characteristics that set Watney apart from his peers, and, before long, he is growing crops on the otherwise desolate planet. Business keeps him away from a deep depression. But as \"The Martian\" is the crowdpleaser of the year, discovery of Watney's well-being auspiciously makes its way to NASA sooner than expected through satellite photographs. Initially unsure of how to handle the situation (the agency quickly informs the nation of Watney's situation but leaves his crew in the dark for sake of them keeping level-heads on their journey back home), they soon begin the process of a rescue mission, which, despite being of utmost importance, is not necessarily an easy piece of planning. \"The Martian\" is, arguably, the first optimistic, full-hearted, and naturalistically funny space movie to ever travel onto the screen. Without the sharpened melodrama of its aforementioned rivals, its earnest predictability adds to its buoyancy and offhand diversion. We sit at the edge of our seats, only this time the thrills stand next to comic undertones welcome in an otherwise self-serious genre. Drew Goddard's screenplay is one of the best of the year, as easily able to conjure suspense as it is humor and proficient characterizations. Veteran filmmaker Ridley Scott directs with unsurprising steadiness - as an adaptable artist with a, more often than not, chameleonic sneakiness toward adjusting to different material (he's directed everything from \"Blade Runner\" to \"Thelma & Louise\" to \"Gladiator\" to \"American Gangster\"), \"The Martian\" is among the finest additions to his oeuvre, visually stunning, genuinely human, and thoroughly likable. The starry-eyed cast is as remarkably well-rounded, the tender Michael Pe�a, the perpetually nervous Mackenzie Scott, and the by-the-book but also empathetic Chastain being the standouts. \"The Martian\" is warm and cerebral entertainment, better than most of what the Hollywood mainstream has given us this year. Undoubtedly, it is a gem likely to emerge as a classic in later decades. Everything about it - its direction, casting, and writing - is nearly immaculate. You might want to see it again, not because you might have missed some details but because an experience so inviting is often a rare occasion in the cinema.",

    "review": "  Space operas and superhero films aside, we seem to be getting spoiled with better than decent sci-fi films on an almost regular basis.For the genre, I consider once a year (sometimes two or three, including smaller films) to be an abundance of riches. Bonus points for that sound that marks each date, either being a sample or inspired by a sound used in Pink Floyd's Echoes, or one of the songs from Pompeii. Also for taking one of the cast members of the Fantastic Four and actually sending her into outer space. Extra bonus points for having her married to The Winter Soldier. Not to mention giving Matt Damon's character from Interstellar a really interesting backstory. A cast that includes Kristin Wiig, Donald Glover, and Eddie Ko from Heroes Shed No Tears (John Woo flick) and hundreds of other HK kung fu movies and TV series (a Chinese subplot inserted, no doubt to ensure distribution in China). The movie, itself? It's good! Watch it.",

For some reason, I didn't feel the loneliness of the character on Mars. I guess the director didn't want the movie to have too many slow paced sequences, and I can understand that, with all of the book's story that had to be implemented in the movie.",

    "review": "  A stunning triumph that takes the art of 3D to a new level. The Martian is visually stimulating, from beginning to end. And even though it arrives shortly after other outer-space blockbusters (Gravity and Interstellar) The Martian is fully capable of standing on it's own. It successfully carves out it's own niche within the genre. The captivating plot has a beautiful mixture of humour, suspense, and problem solving. It contains a heavy dose of science, for sure, but because it's so brilliantly presented and articulated, it doesn't overwhelm the viewer (or even the plot for that matter). From botany to particle physics to the environment on Mars, the science all checks out because author Andy Weir allowed the relevant experts within each field to verify the scientific validity of the plot.The star of the show, Matt Damon, is able to evoke a sense of empathy from the viewer like few others in Hollywood are capable of. From Rounders to Good Will Hunting, and from Green Zone to the Bourne trilogy, he is able to get the viewer to root for him and believe in his cause. The entire cast is able to portray their characters in a manner that feels genuine and real. Jeff Daniels as NASA Head Honcho Teddy Sanders is able to successfully channel all that we love (and hate) about Will McAvoy. Donald Glover makes a name for himself now as an actor in addition to being a Grammy nominated artist. And a particular treat was watching Michael Pena absolutely nail one of the most heart-warming scenes I've had the pleasure of viewing this year, in a subdued yet obviously emotional exchange with Matt Damon.As movie fans we've unfortunately had the displeasure of watching Hollywood fall flat on it's face time and time again in it's attempts at turning a best selling novel into a worthy big screen adaptation. Hence Ridley Scott and Drew Goddard deserve to be singled out and praised for successfully transforming Andy Weir's page turning book into a blockbuster movie. It's not every day that your favourite book becomes a fantastic movie. Especially one that takes your breath away by using 3D technology in a manner that it was made for.",

I was going to start in the beginning of the year, but since there are some great movies coming out in the last weeks of December, I'll start early. On that not I'll start with the Martian. \"During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring \"the Martian\" home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible rescue mission.\" This movie has to be Ridley Scott's best movie over the past 8 years. I didn't have much confidence in him, especially after The Counselor. The cast does an incredible job, especially Matt Damon. Not since Tom Hanks in Castaway has one character been able to capture our attention, The only thing is Matt Damon does a better job and actually brings some comedy to the performance. I didn't read the book, but many said that Scott did a great way of bringing the story to life. I would recommend this film if you can still catch it in theaters. 4.5 out of 5",

    "review": "  Ridley Scott's The Martian (2015) is a return to form for one of our greatest directors (Alien, Blade Runner, etc.). Strong performances from an excellent cast (Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, etc.) propels the taut story about survival and rescuing an astronaut mistakenly left behind, which is ably supported by excellent production design/special effects in a realistic depiction of Mars exploration. In many ways, The Martian is a companion piece to last year's Gravity but it is starting to worry me that all of our best, least fantastical films about space exploration (Apollo 13, Gravity, The Martian) are about overcoming unmitigated disasters. It is understandable since films have to have a story and stories where everything goes right are boring but, nonetheless, it is troubling that Hollywood films are less about expressing the awesome wonders of realistically exploring space and more about channeling our fears about doing so even if, in the end, we overcome those fears to triumph over disaster. Some director/writer must be able to construct a more positive portrayal of space exploration. Mark's Grade: A-",

Matt Damon once again shows his credible versatility as an actor, giving a very relatable and natural performance, portraying life with only a camera for company. Space travel and science aspects were very well done (the production team worked closely with NASA) and the choice of vistas are something to behold.Cons: I am not a fan of the style of comic relief in Rich Purnell's character (played by Donald Glover), which is best compared to the 'IT nerds' in Transformers, nor the over-exertive 'American pride' in parts.",

    "review": "  Where previously over-wrought space dramas like Gravity and Interstellar faltered, The Martian exists at the other end of the spectrum; crowd-pleasing, mostly feel-good drama with some well positioned lightness to the proceedings. It also represents a highly enjoyable return to form for director Ridley Scott.The plot is uncomplicated; unfolding with minimal fuss but maximum sophistication, smarts without the condescension. Damon's Watney is the film's everyman; he has the \"science the shit out of this\" intellect combined with a down-to-Mars personality that anchors the film in all the right places. Damon effortlessly strikes the right balance of humility and confidence without the cockiness that usually creeps in here.But what The Martian really excels at is providing yet another showcase for the ability of science-fiction to tell truly human stories without feeling like a science nerd. Damon and Scott both bring their A-game to the table to truly give this the broadest appeal without dumbing things down, and it's the result is an absolute triumph.",

    "review": "  Critics have been praising The Martian, calling it the best film Ridley Scott has done in quite some time, that's a fair enough comment, however it doesn't stop it from being a reasonably timid and beige science fiction adventure all round. When a team of astronauts are forced to evacuate a manned mission to Mars, botanist Mark Watney is injured and presumed dead, the crew set a return voyage to Earth and no one else is any the wiser. That is of course until Mark wakes up on the surface of Mars, with limited food and no form of communication. The Martian is essentially a survival romp, which to be brutally honest, could have spent more time with the survival aspect and less time trying to become everything its not. Scott is a visual genius, which is why many, including myself, got reasonably excited to see what he would do with our sibling planet. Sadly Mars is completely uninteresting and lacking any atmosphere or soul, The Martian never really looks special, it never stands out and if it werent for the constant reminder of the situation, you would be forgiven for forgetting your on another planet all together, that however is the least of this films worries. Scott manages to enlist an all star cast and its always welcoming to have a roster of this pedigree delivering lines, and that sadly is what is happening here, apart from Matt Damon, no one feels memorable or stand out, they just go through the motions. You cant blame the actors however as not only are they handed a pretty blase script from Drew Goddard, but Scott doesnt manage to ever focus in on a solid structure, leaving you miss the films saving grace when hes not on screen. Matt Damon is that saving grace, it should be his show and at times the film allows you to think that it is, having him pour his heart and soul out during video diaries and essential survival tasks, Scott continually loses all the effect Damon's work does to create character by thrusting through time at such a pace, the true test of Watney's struggles never latches on. It's a continual struggle for the viewers more than it should be, it appears to have a crisis of identity, its average at best to look at, Matt Damon doesnt get enough of our time and the film just spends far too much time hanging around areas we just dont care about. There are nice moments throughout its excessive run time, Watney's continual torment about the collection of disco music he has to keep him company, his determination to grow crops from martian soil and crafting a mode of communication with NASA is all very gripping and heart warming stuff, but just as we start to shine towards him, we are thrown back onto earth to talk technology for too long a time. The Martian is not a complete failure of a film, it has moments of heart and soul and Damon does a fine job trying to hold the film together. But it looks boring, its pacing is problematic and its run time is way too self indulgent. This will no doubt please people, but anyone looking for something deeper with any form of spectacle is not going to get it here.",

    "review": "  Many are calling \"The Martian\" Ridley Scott's return to form. I think this is ridiculous, as I hold the minority belief that his recent work has been of high quality. Nevertheless, \"The Martian\" is Scott's best film in years. One of the largest criticisms of Sir Ridley's films is their often overly dour nature. I find such a criticism reasonable as hardly any of the Englishman's films contain even an ounce of humor. I never thought this would change since Scott, now 77, is a fairly old man. They say old people are set in their ways, but in Scott's case, that clearly isn't true. Scott, notorious for his ever grumpy demeanor, reinvents himself with \"The Martian\". It is a film that shockingly contains just as much, if not more, humor as drama. And all of the humor works; the way this film manages to balance its frequently shifting tones is rather remarkable. Ultimately, \"The Martian\" serves as both a reaffirmation of Ridley Scott's brilliance, as well as a refreshing rebuttal to the more serious astronaut films (such as Gravity and Interstellar) that have been released in recent years. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention Matt Damon. His performance is fantastic; it might actually be the best of his career.",

A return to form from director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) who directed last year's abysmal \"Exodus: Gods and Kings (which I adeptly gave 1/5 because I was happy that it ended), The Martian soars to the heights of a great space epic. In fact the thing that I loved about the Martian more than Alfonso Curon's \"Gravity\" and Christopher Nolan's \"Interstellar\" is its optimism. Botanist Mark Watney played by an incredible Matt Damon, plays his character to a tee without depressing or alienating viewers. It is through this lens that we see plausible science (well somewhat plausible) succeed and the audience truly root for Mark Watney to be rescued by his Ares III crew creating a palpitating suspense during the rescue launch. That aside the supporting cast is impeccable, literally every single character feels important and is given enough screen-time to shine, from Jessica Chastain's Commander Lewis to Chitwetel Ejiofer's Vincent Kapoor. Also to be highly commended is the diversity of this cast- where every character is simply just equal- just the way it should be in every film.Finally the cinematography and soundtrack is also used brilliantly with breathtaking visuals of the simmering sun making it's way below the mountaintops of Mars and a soundtrack that utilises Abba's \"Waterloo\" to great effect also scores some brownie points in my eyes.All in all a fantastic film and so far my favourite film of 2015:5/5",

But before long, slick, intelligent and contemporary hurtles into lazy, predictable and 90s.Scott is brilliant at creating authentic worlds and, no stranger to space, he has again imbued the realm of The Martian with a true sense of believability - the planet, the science, the engineering, the innumerable obstacles etc. The design of all things ?space? is sexy; beautiful and credibly functional. The NASA space command center is suitably grand, high-tech and well populated with extras. Everything else about Earth, however, is sadly two-dimensional.The Martian is pretty much Cast Away on the Red Planet without the depth of existential interrogation. Like Tom Hanks, Matt Damon is perfect in the lead role. Before botanist/astronaut Mark Watney has even opened his mouth, we?re totally with him. It?s Matt Damon. Who doesn?t like Matt Damon? Unlike other stars, Matt keeps his private life private so we all believe he is the funny, smart, strong, good-guy he plays on screen and this role totally exploits every inch of that persona. But that also presents a challenge for the film: how do you maintain tension when everyone knows you?re not going to kill off such a likeable, capable hero? Sorry, Spoiler Alert!This dilemma extends beyond the central protagonist because if the concept is ?an everyman survives against incredible odds because of his incredible guts and ingenuity? it implies that no one else can die attempting to rescue him either. If they did, it?d be a Phyrric victory.Of course, plot endings are almost invariably known when we walk into a cinema and that?s just fine as long as the writer and director make you question your prediction and/or make you care more about the protagonist?s evolution rather than his achievement. Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard regrettably do neither.?Thin? is the order of the day when it comes to character development. Sure, Mark Watney is charming, courageous and super smart, but who is he really? He has parents but clearly no partner or kids. Why not? He?s clearly in his 40s. We?re not even given the sense that he?s ?married to his work? or that he?s sacrificed a personal life for career. Granted, it?s refreshing that he doesn?t have some beautiful wife and toddler back home anxiously hanging on every nail-biting development but perhaps if there was a scene where, in the face of death, he regretted a love he?d lost or never embraced we would?ve had another level on which to care about him and his inevitable return home.I?m guessing the beautiful and talented Jessica Chastain wanted to pull on a space suit after remaining on Earth in Interstellar but she really should?ve waited for a better role. Like Watney, she plays a brave and capable type but her only character distinction is limited to a maligned penchant for disco and ABBA. Jeff Daniels gives a ?look-no-hands!? performance as Teddy Sanders, Director of NASA. Kate Mara, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Pe�a and Sean Bean are similarly wasted in dull roles but I felt genuinely embarrassed for Kristen Wiig as NASA?s publicist.Her dialogue is bad exposition and watching her participate in the cheesy climax of hugs, high-fives and ?You-done-good-kid? nods stretching from Times Square to Red Square via Leicester was painful. I swear in her eyes I could read, ?Just think of the money Kris. Think of the money. The Money. The Money?? I mean, seriously, it?s 2015. Are we still doing that around-the-world-we-come-together-to celebrate shit? And if so, where were the Aussies jumping up and down at the Opera House?Kristen Wiig is at a point in her career where she should?ve played the lead in this film. It would?ve been that much more interesting. But apart from Jessica Chastain, pretty much all the female characters were subordinates to males. Has Ridles forgotten Sigourney Weaver?s Ripley?Another aspect of The Martian that feels somewhat anachronistic is the man-in-space effect. Scenes of people floating around, gulping droplets of water, or being jerked to rude halt by a cord tethered to a space craft are old hat now. We?ve been there done that better with Sandra. And I?m gonna put it out there and say that I don?t think 3D is all that. The colours are muted, the image is dark and today?s 3D effects no more convince me of being ?right there? than Alf Silliman?s 1969 criminally underrated classic The Stewardesses made me believe I was in their motel room binging on sex and acid.Having said all that, would I recommend The Martian? Sure. It?s still a mostly enjoyable ride, even if we have been on it a few times before. Let?s just pray that Scott is saving his best for the next instalment in the Alien franchise: Alien: Paradise Lost. I?d hate for it to be the Terminator Genisys of the Alien series, further sullying the reputation of Scott?s original, near-perfect space thriller.",

The cut that bleeds most is the final chapter, which gives the whole story a philosophical significance that is both poignant and naively inspiring. Nevertheless, what remains is a fine tale of how science, wit, perseverance, and intelligence are greater weapons than anything else. Mark Watney's humor survives in the film, even if the film strips him of his vulgarity, all in the service of obtaining a PG-13 rating (really, we must reexamine why one \"fuck\" corrupts thirteen- to seventeen-year-olds so much more than ten, twenty, or 100 \"fucks\"). Mark Watney's intelligence survives the film version, even if the film's story presents him with fewer obstacles to \"science the shit out of,\" all in the service of giving director Ridley Scott the opportunity to show beautiful Martian sunsets in the time allowed. That Mark Watney character is quite a survivor. Overall, please watch the film - it's good and it's values are inspiring - but read the book too.",

    "review": "  **** GoodRidley Scott's \"The Martian\" is pretty much a marginally great movie, but I would rather insert it in the \"marginally really good movie\" category. This sci-fi light comedy focuses on astronaut Mark Watney. Poor Mark was left for dead in Mars by his fellow astronaut crew members when a mission to Mars had an accidental explosion. However, NASA eventually found a mark that revealed that Mark is really alive, and now their challenger, I mean challenging mission is to bring Mark back safely. A good chunk of \"The Martian\" resembles the \"Castaway\" makeup: a man stranded alone and fighting for not just physical survival but psychological survival; differences: one is an island, and the other one is in a planet, and also one talks to a volleyball named Wilson, and the other one talks to a video screen named... wait Mark did not give the video screen a name, maybe he should have called it Screenie. Anyways, Scott's directorial vision is out-of- this-world and is deservant of Best Director nomination love; it really moved me how he was able to incorporate disco music in a sci-fi flick. Drew Goddard's screenplay worked on the comedic fare, but lost me a bit with the way-too-much scientific technical verbose. Matt Damon was excellent as Watney. The supporting acting was also not spaced-out in acting proficiency; which included outstanding work from Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Michael Pe�a, and Sean Bean. You Should Be Dancing, I mean seeing \"The Martian\"; there is some really cool hot (yes, I am disco oxymoron)stuff for you to discover.",

    "review": "  The annual big budget space movie. So this is about a team of astronauts that go to Mars on a research trip. After an accident in a giant storm, a botanist by the name of Mark Watney (Matt Damon) gets left behind for dead. The rest of his team is already going back to Earth, but it turns out that he is actually still alive, and has to figure out what exactly he is going to do as he is the only man living on Mars. I thought this looked pretty good, but it wasn't something I was actively excited about. But then the reviews started to roll in, and this has gained so much traction that there are even rumbling of this getting a Best Picture nomination. While I'm not necessarily drinking the Kool-Aid to that extent, I will say they've made a film that is very worthy of your time. As of yesterday, this just got a Best Picture nomination for Best Musical or Comedy... I don't know if there was a song or tap dance that I missed, but I have no idea what they're talking about. There are good moments of comedic relief to break up tension, but that is about it. That is one of the good points about it is, though; while almost anybody else put in this man's shoes would give up (and you wouldn't blame them, either), Watney has moxie, and the way he stays lighthearted given the gravity of his situation is an element that allows you to form a tangible connection with him. He's also extremely resourceful, and he is able to make excellent use of the limited amount of items that he has at his disposal. Another thing this film does well is the science of it all; it's not like this is incredibly tight or anything, but they never breach the realm of being unbelievable. It's the Jurassic Park effect; by keeping the science simple and not trying to gloss over everything with some technical mumbo jumbo, it manages to dumb it down without being getting stupid, which allows you to buy into it more. To expand upon a previous sentiment, I liked this a lot, but it's going to be low on my best of the year list if it makes it at all (and I usually do somewhere around a top 25 - 30). It's well paced, and it's a really good story. There's not a thing about this that you don't buy, and Matt Damon does great at selling this because he's a quality leading man. That said, this was sold to me as a potential \"movie of the year\" and I never thought of this as that at any point during the runtime. I don't think this is groundbreaking, and in fact, I think this is very straightforward, and it plays out how you think it will almost to a fault. Still predictability isn't necessarily a deal breaker, and this has way more good in it than bad. One thing I am more than okay with is having one of these giant blockbuster space movies every year, and between the success of this, Interstellar and Gravity, I am looking forward to seeing more of these movies for years to come.",

    "review": "  Ridley Scott must love space! After Alien and Prometheus, he has now brought another visually stunning space adventure to the big screen. The Martian tells the story of Mark Watney (a very solid Matt Damon) who's left for dead on Mars after his team has to abort their Ares III mission on the red planet due to an extremely heavy storm, his inventive struggle for survival and the rescue mission(s) that are set up to get him home alive.It's become an interesting cross-over between geekish science-fest and sci-fi action, with the science actually coming across as very realistic (even though the events aren't) and the action being relatively low-key. And that's what actually works here... Over the top action would've entirely overshadowed the story of Mark Watney's deprevation during his +500 days on Mars.Scott has delivered a film with room for action, tension, excitement, drama, character development (What does it do to a man to be alone for so many days? What does it do to the teamleader to decide to leave him behind?) and a vehicle for some good performances, especially Damon and Chastain.Since Sir Ridley Scott is so good at space stories, I can't wait for Prometheus sequel Alien:Covenant (due in 2017).",

    "review": "  Loved the movie but a couple of things kept me from giving it a 5 star rating. First, the pros: Obviously it was visually stunning. The Hab, Rover, MAV and Hermes all came to life for me. Matt Damon was a perfect Mark Watney. There was a technicality and humor in the book that (while wonderful) didn't let a lot of the rawer emotions through. The pain, fear and overwhelming desolation that Watney (at times) should have been emoting in the book really came clear in the film. Kate Mara (Johansen) and Michael Pena (Martinez) did great jobs as well. Now the cons: Jessica Chastain's acting and portrayal of Commander Lewis just fell flat for me. Actually I'll amend that to say that her character, as written, was off. The book portrayed a confident, thoughtful and capable commander who knew her team's abilities and trusted them to do their jobs (in regard to the rescue attempt scene). Instead, what we saw was the Commander leap out of her seat and arrogantly tell the teams EVA specialist to not perform an EVA so she can go outside and grab Watney herself thus selfishly erasing her personal guilt about giving the order to leave him behind (which was the correct decision anyway). And Mitch Henderson! In the book, he was a no-nonsense, egotistical, self-righteous jerk who didn't give a crap what people thought of him, knew his stuff and was fiercely dedicated to keeping the crew informed and getting them home. The movie turned him into a simpering, whining, morose man who just kept moaning \"we should tell the crew...\". He looked enough like a whipped puppy that I wanted Teddy to whack him on the nose with a rolled up newspaper.To finish on a good note, I loved what they did with Watney at the end, perfect way to end the movie and honor the book.",

Recently he has created some forgettable films (The Counselor, Exodus: Gods and Kings). Now he takes on the film adaption of Andy Weir's 2011 novel The Martian. With the support of an all-star cast and thrilling plot, Scott has once again achieved greatness. The Martian follows astronaut, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who is stranded on Mars after being presumed dead by his crew mates. Watney must \"science the shit out of\" his situation in order to survive. Luckily he is a botanist. Back at Earth, NASA is hard at work in getting back Watney safe and alive. Through the news, the whole world is able to stay connected to Watney's story. As the viewer, we are able to witness the everyday struggles of Watney on Mars and NASA on Earth. The film puts the viewer right in the middle of the events taken place. Although Watney may be alone on Mars, movie goers will feel like they are accompanying him during his stay. The film only slightly stumbles during scenes that were intended to be intense. Particularly the scenes involving the crew. The scenes seemed a bit rushed, lacking build-up.Unlike many space films, The Martian does not have some underlying deep message. It is a rescue film. It's simplicity is what makes the film work so well. The film is thrilling, but features very humorous dialog. Mars may have taken away years of living on Earth, but his humor remains intact. Watney is a man you root for. Many people in his situation would give up, but Watney has the will to live. He becomes a symbol of the \"no man left behind\" motivation that fuels NASA just as much as actually fuel. For a film with a run length of two hours and twenty-two minutes, I can honestly say I was entertained every minute. Not sure if Watney can say the same about his time on Mars (but disco music must help kill time right?). The Martian is one of the best films of the year and an out of this world blast (pun intended)!",

    "review": "  I've often cited the old saying that good books tend to turn into disappointing movies while mediocre books often turn into excellent films. Meet \"The Martian\".The novel of the same name was originally self-published online by author Andy Weir, and the chapter-by-chapter released story turned into a word of mouth event and ultimately got turned into a bestselling book.I found Weir's book technically fascinating and at times quite funny, but not a fully formed novel, so flat was the language and haphazard the structure. Yet screenwriter Drew Goddard has adapted the Weir's work extremely faithfully into a script that comes alive as an excellent film in the hands of legendary if quite uneven director Ridley Scott.The story is about Mark Watney, a lone astronaut who is assumed dead in a Martian sand storm by his crewmates and left to survive alone on the red planet, making things up as he goes as he must make do with insufficient resources. In the book I was especially put off by the narration of the astronaut, which was nicely witty and nerdy, but never became the voice of a real person. There's a lot of that narration in the movie as well in the form of video reports. Lead Matt Damon spends a fair amount of time looking at a camera, going through the monologue.I found the best parts of the novel to be the humor, although there was too much hit-and-miss there, and the technical aspects, which are what I think Weir was intentionally focusing on. Both have been reduced in the script in order to give way to what was sadly missing from the book: a sense of wonder and humanity.Scott gives us beautiful Martian vistas where he has inserted tiny Watney. Detailed, personal space coexists with grand, eternal space. This alone has been done with such vision it grands the story depth lacking in the text, which showcases the universe merely as a problem solving exercise. Scott gives us the endless, humbling dimensions of it all with the tools of cinema he has at his disposal. The small and the grand fit together seamlessly. A delightful disco soundtrack (!) gives some retro aesthetics a perfect boost.We also get a solid cast that does well with very little. I would have hoped they'd have gotten someone with more charisma to play Watney who is still left too thin, but Damon is adequate in animating Watney's inner life with means not found in the dialogue. I'm a big admirer of Jessica Chastain and again- just as in very recent \"Crimson Peak\"- she outshines a more central character who has better lines by pouring all of her presence into a vaguely written role. She plays the mission leader who left Watney behind, a character full of potential completely looked over in the source material.I had quips about the whole humanity-unites-to-save-one-man-no-matter-the-cost -romanticism of the novel, and that all is still present in Scott's version. It is the one thing that breaks an otherwise completely competent mold of the film, but doesn't manage to do all that much damage. So realistic, heartfelt yet epic the picture is.",

Since Damon hasn't had such a role in 18 months, it's easy to forget his acting prowess. The Martian was the big monetary winner of the fall 2015 season, and it's not hard to understand why-its originality cannot be denied. Landing on Mars isn't unprecedented in cinema, but the way in which director Ridley Scott pieces together the bits is an impressive feat.",

The triple layered storyline is intertwined with the stranded astronaut, the Martian crew, and N A S A trying to slove the mutual problem of how to bring him home? Scott (director) gives a good feel and pace for the social, political and science problems for The Martian's story. The Martian is brilliantly acted. Damon can perfectly physically act in solitude scenes with no dialogue. Bean and Daniels create a great dueling N A S A bosses who try and fix a difficult situation. Chastains shine as the strong personality as the crew leader who left Damon behind. The Martian uses science and deductive reasoning which makes for a fresh new compelling story. Four stars.",

    "review": "  77%Watched this on 2/10/15First of all, it's not even comparable to Interstellar, slightly better than Gravity and easily the best sci-fi film based on plain reality, ie it's better than Apollo 13. Martian has plenty of comedy, but the film is shamelessly made ultra PG-13. Matt Damon gives a good performance, but on the whole the film lacks emotional resonance as well as psychological tension that one is supposed to feel when he or she is left behind that too in a fucking lonely planet. The scenery is great and the visual effects are good and the last 30 minutes of the film are gripping. The film however lags a lot here and there especially when Damon is not in screen. The film is too full of unnecessary characters who simply deprive Damon of his valuable screen time. Kristen Wiig's character is one of the most dumbest female characters ever written in the recent times as a result of purely sexist writing and many unwanted characters like that of Sean Bean's, Kristein Wiig's, Kate Mara's and the rest of the crew's simply waste valuable time.",

    "review": "  A deft storyline with a strong lead character, The Martian is a slick sci-fi thriller that relies on whiz-bang scientific calculations, but is undone by shallow characters straddling stereotypes. The most egregious short cut? That the writer was unaware of or worse, discounted the warrior ethos leaving a man behind. Weak insights, lead to weak characters, who inevitably, make bad decisions.",

    "review": "  I found myself surprised when I realized how long The Martian was. At almost two and a half hours, The Martian does a great job of keeping you interested for the entirety of the lengthy flick. I found myself only realizing its length after the last shot and checking my watch. Scott accomplishes a lot with his pacing in this film. A formula of \"Exposition - Execution - Crisis - Resolution,\" does wonders for the experience. The story is furthered seamlessly, we grow quintessential to love and care about our Characters, we laugh and cry. While all of this makes for a pleasurable experience, it certainly cannot be said that The Marian is innovative. With his story arc, message, and characters laid out for him from the get go, Scott decides to play his cards close to the chest. Even down to his signature introduction, The Martian makes it clear that Scott believes himself to have a personal formula down for consistent filmmaking: The Martian seems like a signature film more than anything else. Scott plays to what he knows he can do and it pays off for a film that is worth the see, especially for Sci-Fi, NASA, and Survival lovers.An all around satisfying film, The Martian will never leave you with a lack of beautiful, red and mountain-filled panorama shots to gape at for a few seconds, as well as a phenomenal use of space to not make the audience claustrophobic in tight spaces. With contenders such as Interstellar and Gravity to compete with on the space aspect, Scott puts his stock instead into his writing and landscape shots. It's simply beautiful.The Martian's script is a well crafted, feel good story of hope and ingenuity. Damon's exposition through the use of Log Entries gives a creative way to further the plot, and develop his character. Humor is used effectively to \"spice up\" tech talk that gets exhausting quickly. Well placed jokes relieve tension and humanize NASA, which is portrayed with a high amount of respect in the film. A refreshing, pro-government agency view for a mainstream movie is welcomed in this story. Matt Damon gives a likable and talented performance as Mark Watney: The Genius Who Fucks Everything Up And Still Lives. Though vaguely disappointed in the lack of his death, Sean Bean gives what can be called the quintessential performance of this film: believable, but undoubtedly forgettable. I was pleasantly surprised by Donald Glover's (AKA Rapper Childish Gambino) casting in this film, and he did a superb job in his role.For those who read the novel it was based on, you will most likely find yourself incredibly pleased with it's continuity to the book up until the last 15 minutes. For some reason or another, the script adds little to no \"outside the book\" material to the film up until the last few minutes. As such, the ending is naturally riddles with out-of-place, overly-hollywoodized logic holes and scientific errors. While Watney \"Iron Man\" flying through the air is fun, it feels out of place in a film that has tried to stay true to practical science for the rest of the film. Luckily, this last portion of uncomfortable writing is followed by a spectacular ending to the film, with Watney's last bit of exposition tying up the film.",

It is such a great space movie, doing a better job of what \"Gravity\" from 2012 and even 2014's \"Interstellar\" wanted to accomplish. It is a fantastic thriller, drawing you in with a suspenseful countdown to disaster, but it is also surprisingly funny, with a lot of great jokes to break up the tension. Everyone in the film offers incredible performances that sink deeply into the roles, with special mentions to Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain, of course. It is also really cool to not only watch these characters solve and think about their problems, but we as an audience actually get to see how they go about completing those tasks. Although I have some minor nitpicks that bother me when they pop up within the film (\"How come we don't see Mark Wattney's family and their reaction to his predicament?;\" man, the crew of the \"Hermes\" really seem to take this situation, and the fact that they left their supposedly-dead-but-not-really friend behind, calmly), but the movie is still worth watching and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in a truly grand space adventure to sit alongside \"2001: a Space Odyssey.\"",

    "review": "  As a book, The Martian serves to show just how amazing it is for one human being to overcome the obstacles of an entire planet against him and the movie, though heavily condensed, does the same. From the very beginning, audiences are forced to watch as Mark painstakingly must dig metal from his skin and then staple up the wound. This scene lasts a very long time for those who are squeamish and it ends with him only being able to look around at the empty Mar base around him. As the movie goes on, we get to continue to see amazing CGI of the planet and, of course, many, many different angles of the same white tent that Mark is forced to spend most of his time in. Mark communicates to us through his journal at on several occasions talking to himself. While this does leave a little bit of dissatisfaction to exactly what is going on in Mark's mind, the on point expressions of Matt Damon are a big help. A crowning jewel to this movie was the time spent on Earth as NASA attempts to recover from the blow that accidentally leaving an astronaut stranded on Mars can unfortunately cause. The actors do great jobs at embracing their characters and how their characters are forced to react as the situation changes. And believe me, do the situations in this movie change. Don't expect any easy answers in this movie. You will be left thinking \"Is he dead yet?\" on multiple occasions and you will love it the entire time. Unless your squeamish because that scene with the stapling will get you.",

Note to Directors: Please stop having characters lip sinc while driving, mopping the floor, or taking a shower!!!! The rescue at the end was replete with syrupy scenes of onlookers all over the world watching it on jumbo screens while clutching their children tightly.

    "review": "  Overall I thought the movie was great, thoroughly enjoyed it. I've been on bad terms with Ridley Scott ever since Prometheus, but my faith in him has been fully restored. The Martin is an intelligent, funny, gripping and often poignant celebration of humanity ingenuity and perseverance in the face of all the odds. This might sound very familiar, and in fact one of the movies principle drawbacks is that this kind of ground has been covered extensively. We've seen stories, many of them based on true events, of individuals who found themselves face to face with death and, of course, fought tooth and nail to survive. 127 Hours, Touching The Void, Cast Away, Apollo 13, Gravity, the list goes on. But that's not to say that every single one is the same, and that something new can't be brought to the table, and happily The Martian does just that. Our central character is likable and engaging, and the movie does an effective job of putting us in his shoes, allowing us to assist in aiding in his struggle. The planet Mars is made to look not like a completely barren wasteland, but almost like the site of a former civilisation, with the giant rocky structures resembling ancient, timeworn buildings. We don't spend much time in space, but when we do we're given the sensation of not soaring, but floating through it. One scene in particular contains a sneaky homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey, which I think all modern sci-fi movies are required by law to include.Anything bad I have to say about the film is honestly just nit-picking. If you're looking for action, it does have its moments, but not nearly enough to satisfy the Bay crowd. For everyone else though, The Martian has interesting concepts, gorgeous cinematography, a fun soundtrack, a wry sense of humour and everything else you need to make 2 hours and 20 minutes simply fly by.",

However, after studying the book's written style, I knew Mr. Scott was going to do some memorable things.The film opens with Mark Watney, who was the character Damon was born for and waiting to play for all of his life, being stranded on Mars after his crew are forced to abandon him during a wind storm. An aspect I love about Scott's movies is that while you'd assume the film would be a ''boy's movie'', he makes it open for all genders, which really makes a difference. The characters in this movie were perfectly casted and performed, and the cinematography was well done. Also, I thought the film had an impressive soundtrack, myself.For being a film adaptation, the film was quite the experience, and honestly opened me up for space videos on YouTube.

When they are retreating, astronaut Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) is hit by debris and is lost. The team leaves Watney behind on Mars and he is presumed dead. He, however, survives, using his skills as a botanist and the supplies left behind on Mars. When NASA discovers that he is in fact, alive, they decide to rescue him as soon as possible. Will Watney be brought back home?To my surprise, I enjoyed this film a lot. Damon's portaryal as Watney is brilliant, and we were kept in suspense, rooting for him to survive and return to Earth. We feel his pain when things go wrong. The supporting cast were great too, particularly Chastain's character. The movie is not gloomy throughout, as there are several funny moments that I didn't expect. It reminds me of the 2013 film \"Gravity\", another movie that involves an astronaut trying to return back to Earth (it won several Oscar awards).In conclusion, \"The Martian\" is a great survival movie even though it was a bit draggy at parts. I'm going to give this a strong 8 out of 10 and a recommendation. If you like science-fiction movies such as \"Gravity\", then this is for you.4/5 starsPros:Matt Damon's portrayal as the protagonistEngaging survival theme that allows you to root for MarkSome funny jokesCons:Movie is a bit too long (though still a great one to watch)",

The second half was full on Hollywood schmaltz with bad dialogue. Worse i'll chosen soundtrack. Abba and other assorted disco period music was bad but even worse did not fit the period of the movie and was completely wrong for situation. Puzzling to say the least. Don't want to give any spoilers so all I will say is that the ending space scene was laughable. Was also amusing how the movie ticked all the PC correct boxes even down to the Chinese helping the US space program. Really? Like they would give a crap. Anyway, I thought they were going to break out the old Coke ad jingle from the 70's disco period \" I'd like to teach the world to sing\" I guess they came kind of close with \"Love Train\".

    "review": "  Ridley Scott may of had some harsh criticism for many of his films as of late. 'The Martian' based on Andy Weir's best selling sci-fi novel however, surpassed my expectations by a long mile. This incredibly polished, fast-paced, smart and evocative film may be one of the most finest ever films Ridley Scott has ever directed. While it's hard to ignore what Hollywood has been trying to do with Matt Damon being a victim in both 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Interstellar' and now this, Damon is almost pretty much a one man show throughout his character's entire arc to survive on a planet where nothing grows and many of his circumstantial nature can be fatal. The plot takes viewers on such a thoughtful, exciting, thrilling and touching ride, it's hard to not be invested with every character at play whether on earth or in space. In saying that, the film also offers several different types of moods whether it it be dramatic, thrilling or hilarious it's almost the biggest pieces of requirement for every great film script. Last but not least every other cast member on board this film is just as much a fine performer invested in their character within every moment of the film. I can't recommend this film more than enough, it may as well be this year's equivalent to 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar' if not a whole lot better.",

    "review": "  The Martian is one of the finest examples of what a Hollywood sci-fi blockbuster should be. Smart, entertaining, funny and bolstered by the outstanding performance of Matt Damon and the whole supporting cast, this Ridley Scott delivery is a most welcome return to form for the esteemed director after the disappointing Exodus: Gods and Kings.The story is pretty simple and it serves as a perfect showcase (and possible Oscar aspirations) for Matt Damon. When a Martian storm forces a team of astronauts to evacuate the planet, Damon is left behind and considered death. Shortly after that it becomes clear that he is alive and it is only up to him and his inventiveness to stay alive. As of this moment The Martian becomes a tensed sci-fi drama in which the fight with the time is mixed with good humor, stunning visuals and extremely pleasing supporting performances by Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean and Chiwetel Ejiofor.Of course, comparisons with other sci-fi classics such as Interstellar and Gravity are inevitable. When it comes to pacing The Martian is slower than Gravity, but this slower pace helps Damon to shine. In comparison to Interstellar, Ridley Scott's movie is funnier, more mainstream and clearly less philosophic. Yet, Damon could not quite bring the impactful performance which Matthew Mcconaughey.In conclusion, The Martian is almost a classic and definitely a must see delivery. Sadly, what deprives it from reaching the level of Interstellar or Gravity is in the details. If an experienced viewer is more focused he/she would certainly notice some plot issues and sequences which do not match the overall realism level which is expected from the story. Nevertheless, The Martian is a top delivery and certainly one of the best movies of 2015 !",

    "review": "  The film is NOT called Bring Him Home in case you were wondering. 78 year old Ridley Scott returns to science fiction, the genre he is best known for (Alien/Blade Runner/Prometheus). Though this scifi is much more based on real world science of the near future (2030) than the aforementioned movies. The book on which it's based got a lot of critical acclaim but I didn't read it so I can't say how well the story made the translation to the big screen. The Martian is a rather uplifting -yes dare I say feel good- film despite the apparently grim fate that befalls Mark Whatley (the astronaut stranded on Mars played by Matt Damon). You could say it's a testament to the resourcefulness of humans in dire situations and how you have to keep a positive attitude and not give in in spite of all the hardship that comes your way. Visually the movie is -as most Ridley Scott films are- pure eye-candy. The VFX looks hyperreal and are top of the line and the cinematography is superb. The music is mostly disco music but there is a reason for that in the story and it actually works well as a comedic effect. The film is actually similar to Apollo 13 which was better but was also based on true events. The Martian is a bit long at 141 mins and there is maybe a bit to much problem solving and sometimes not enough character background (e.g. what motivates Whatley to survive?). A very good film and worth the trip to the cinemas. It does however feels like it is lacking something to make it to classic status.",

The Martian is Ridley Scott's return after his last good movie, Prometheus (2012).Picture this one as a combination of the science of Apollo 13 (1995), combined with the survival element of Cast Away (2000) and the lost in space fun of Gravity (2013). After the recent success of Gravity (7 oscars for an all-right sci-fi adventure movie) it seems that space adventure movies can combine Academy Awards' appreciation with ticket selling.The Martian is very well made, Ridley Scott's direction is impressive at some points and Matt Damon tries his best, but the movie is obviously not thought provocative.

It doesn't feel like a set, it feels like you're actually looking at Mars, it feels like they are there. There's not one moment where it's not believable.Matt Damon is SO very good in this movie. One of his best performances of his career. It's such an emotional and powerful performance, you're with him for the majority of the movie and you feel every triumph, every downfall, every emotion. It's such a good performance, a nomination worthy performance. He is so good. The other actors are all good too. Jeff Daniels is really good, Jessica Chastain is really good, and Michael Pena is great as well. All the supporting cast do a good job with what they have. But Matt Damon just powerhouses his performance and it's just so very good. It's his emotional and real performance that carries this movie.The story is so well told and it's so very intriguing. The concept alone is brilliant. Hats off to the author of the book for coming up with the idea. The movie is such a good tale of human will, survival, ingenuity and overcoming the impossible. It's masterfully told and inspiring. It's one of the years best movies! The only slight gripe was the last 5 minutes I thought were unnecessary and it could have either been left out or changed to a different kind of scene, but it's just a small gripe from an otherwise masterful movie.

I believe this could easily be the movie to win Damon his first acting Oscar at least it should be in my opinion. My only flaw with this movie is one long amount of time towards the end that takes place only on Earth. The most entertaining parts of the movie are by far with Damon on Mars. There was about a half hour at the end that was all on Earth, but even that is not a big deal because the script and performances keep you so invested that you barely even notice how long it is. This movie is damn near perfect if you ask me and a great movie for all film lovers, or anyone who just wants a good time at the movies.",

There was very little emotion or tension, considering the situation, not enough 'humanness' added to enable us to connect with the characters at a deeper level. And the choice many of the songs was strange and didn't work, only making some long scenes even longer. I felt like I had seen many of the elements done a lot better in other similar movies.",

    "review": "  Matt Damon (Cpt Watney) is stranded on Mars when his fellow astronauts think he is dead and leave the planet at the start of a devastating storm.Initially the film seems to be a Robinson Crusoe-esque survival story in space and given Matt Damon's character is alone, we watch entertaining videos he makes for himself on his progress (quite unrealistic to expect he would do this or maintain his bonhomie for these - but I guess there's no other way to explain what he is doing to us - given that he is not even in contact with anyone else).Thankfully, many of the facilities left behind are working and the first part of the film has science problems that Watney has to solve to stay alive. Quickly though the film starts to focus on Earth and his crewmates - and does very well at fleshing out their characters. I particularly liked the involvement of the director of media relations from the moment they know of Watney's survival - an amusing, realistic touch. From then on, NASA tried to solve its own problem of how to rescue Watney. This seems to have been done with a degree of realism unmatched in other portrayals of the organisation. Eventually with the help of the typical scruffy loner scientist and international collaboration (I was impressed that a Hollywood film has the Chinese space academy helping out the USA - was this to maturely reflect changing geopolitics or a marketing strategy?). Less impressive are typical tropes such as the scenes of everyone around the world watching for hours to see if Watney is rescued!In the end, it is a very satisfying, very intelligent and action-packed film about space. It does not get dull as Interstellar frequently did, no artificially unexpected twists, and no ridiculous science. Even the credits sequence was excellent (the first time I've seen this) - with the film continuing on as the main cast are shown.",

    "review": "  It seems there's now a new trend in the film industry to be realized at this point after a few years of successful narratives going out of this world from one's journey. It started with \"Gravity\" in 2013 when Sandra Bullock was stranded in Space and it's important for her to reach a working craft that's orbiting around Earth and land home. A year later, Christopher Nolan released a post-Dark Knight masterpiece \"Interstellar\", which launches Matthew McConaughey, with Anne Hathaway tagging along, to journey through unexplored space to search for a new home for humanity. Now for this year's space story comes from a source material by Andy Weir under the adapting direction of Ridley Scott (\"Alien\"), \"The Martian\". This film is at the same entertainment level as the previous two cinematic space missions, but it's the most enjoyable on its own footing.\"The Martian\" sets place in the slightly futuristic 2030s, chronicling astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) working on surviving a stranded life on planet Mars after being thought dead and left behind with what's left. The mission of his crew has now become a solo mission for him to survive and grow his own crop until a solution rises that'll managed to get him home with the help of NASA back on Earth after he'd finally got in contact with them. The film spans nearly two years of Watney surviving on Mars and impressing everyone on Earth with his unique survival story while NASA tries to get him home, with Watney's crew notified on his surprising status. They will try anything to bring him home where it's more suitable, despite an educational experience as a survival test.\"Gravity\" benefits from the thrills and cinematographic direction, while \"Interstellar\" benefits from Nolan's masterful taste in originality and visionary at an epic scale. For \"The Martian\", this sci-fi is actually calmer, even it's thrilling with gripping moments - as they can't be left out when it'll be against the atmosphere's rules - when it provides humor to lighten any sudden complications that heightens the current situation. It's part of the film's beneficial craftsmanship on the tone and the intellect survival skills displayed, as well forms of communications and occasional elegancy in music (ironically criticized by the characters in a joking friendly matter). The intellect craftsmanship is what makes this sci-fi space story with the most probable accuracy the most enjoyable than the other two.Not only the craftsmanship, but the performances from the great cast contributes to the film's ranking position. As Matt Damon's performing at his best when displaying the survival skills with some humor added, he's greatly supported by Jessica Chastain (\"Interstellar\" and \"Zero Dark Thirty\"), Chiwetel Ejiofor (\"12 Years a Slave\"), Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pe�a (\"Ant-Man\"), Kate Mara (\"Fantastic Four\"), Sebastian Stan (\"Captain America\") and Sean Bean. They all performed nicely and contributed to the film's cheerful spirit and heart. Damon stands out above the cast's ranks, and he's definitely an Oscar contender for Best Actor (even though Leonardo DiCaprio seems to be attracting more Oscar Buzz in \"The Revenant\" - seems to be a tough competition).I honestly haven't read the book yet when I'd planned on reading it before the seeing it on the silver screen. I'm still planning on reading it when I got the time, and I know without a doubt that it's a really good read as I also heard it's excellent. If the movie's that good, then I know it's faithful to its source material. So if you've read the book and enjoyed it, then you'll enjoy the movie more. But if you haven't read the book and you still planning on treating the movie as a typical moviegoing experience, then you can be assured that it won't be a waste of time as it's a worthy experience to see on the big screen. (A)I wonder what space story will be up next to be told next year.",

    "review": "  Ridley Scott occasionally strikes out from time to time but just like having a delicious bisque, future orders may not live up to your expectation but you keep ordering it because you know you might get something sublime. Mr. Scott rewarded those who stuck with him by hitting a home run with his most recent film The Martian (2015). Ridley Scott has built his reputation on sci-fi world building and depicting the epic scope of a location/setting. The Martian (2015) has Mr. Scott certainly playing to his strong suits. In his latest outing Ridley Scott may not be a recreating the Roman Coliseum but he is still creating a vast epic world. The Setting/Landscape of Mars is imposing and its scale is very tangible to the audience. One couldn't help but think of the John Ford westerns that had Monument Valley as their backdrop. Man vs. Nature and the imposing desolate power of Mars is made clear early in this film. Mat Damon's Mark Watney sums up how he feels about the red giant when he says, \"fuck mars.\" Ridley Scott is known for his world building. He earned that reputation directing films like Blade Runner (1982), Alien (1979), and Gladiator (2000). He reasserts his reputation as one of Hollywood's preeminent world builders in The Martian (2015). It's not just the breathtaking exteriors of Mars but his depiction of the space program of the near future and the familiar yet futuristic tech. of the space program. The Martian (2015) is an action movie whose hero Mark Watney played by Matt Damon never fires a gun. The inhospitable Martian environment is Mark Watney's enemy and science is his weapon. Math and other sciencey type montages are kept relatively cinematic and definitely exiting. The film's variety of quirky scientists and astronauts help add levity and help break up the relentless struggle that Mark Watney has to endure while marooned on Mars. Despite Mat Damon doing most of the heavy lifting after all he is playing the titular Martian the supporting cast is sizable in both talent and numbers. Jeff Daniels, Benedict Wong, Michael Pena, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Donald Glover, Sebastian Stan, and Chiwetel Ejiofor all shine when they are on screen. Despite limited screen time the supporting cast is able to create distinct interesting characters. The Martian (2015) is a unique film. It's a science-fiction film that both genre fans and non genre fans can appreciate and enjoy. It's a thrilling action adventure romp yet there is no violence. Ridley Scott joins George Miller as a director who not only released one of the best films of his career in 2015 but he did so after 7 plus decades on planet Earth.Get stranded at your local cineplex for an hour or two and enjoy The Martian (2015).",

The Martian must also be commended for its scientific rigour for the most part and directly grapples with the genuine problems of a human mission to Mars. The film is also helped by easily finding Matt Damon's character to be likable and remain amazed at his ingenuity stranded on the red planet. The film utilises humour brilliantly as relief from the vicariousness of the stricken astronaut and it possibly has a higher number of funny lines than many comedies. At its heart it is simply a survival-and-rescue mission, but one which is beautifully told.",

    "review": "  Based on the best-selling novel by Andy Weir, the star-glossed latest blockbuster by Ridley Scott, titled simply The Martian has been making waves at the box office, and earning rave reviews by the critics. There's a lot of good stuff to talk about this \"Robinson Crusoe on Mars\" (as how director Scott intended to depict Matt Damon's character) flick, I'll still insist to do so without giving it away too much. So no spoilers, just like how I always prefer in my reviews.The theme is rather straight forward. Damon's character Mark Watney, is a NASA astronaut who is incorrectly presumed dead by his crew members and left stranded alone on planet Mars. But what follows in this 141-minute adventure is an astounding and eye-opening journey by Watney which is nothing but simple; where the clever use of Science, Technology, Math and Engineering will be helping this man stay alive. First off, Scott's film has been praised for getting the crucial science right. The 77-year old director who has helmed numerous cinematic gems including Alien (1979), Thelma & Louise (1985) and Gladiator (2000), has taken serious measures to ensure he gets his science accurate, including getting Dr Jim Green, the director of NASA's Planetary Science Division to be one of his advisors on the film. Audience will revel in the series of \"MacGyver-moments\" pulled by Watney to survive on the Red Planet. Creating his own water. Building an entire garden to grow crops using Martian soil and his own feces as fertiliser. These are all inspiring yet appropriately accurate, scientifically. The Martian has even earned the approval from astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who expressed appreciation on how much the film respects science. As far as comparisons with the novel, aside from Gone Girl (2014) Scott's film has been lauded as one of the most loyal book adaptation that Hollywood has produced to date. Even most of the dialogue used was lifted straight from Andy Weir's 2011 sci-fi novel.With co-stars like Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids), Sebastian Stan (Winter Soldier in Captain America) and Donald Glover (NBC sitcom Community), the film boasts a stellar cast; but Damon's performance single-handedly turns an epic tale of survival in space into something intimate and human. On his own he has to hold the screen for long stretches, talking to himself into the many cameras that serve as his daily log and in a way his refuge, and the Bourne-actor's performance is all convincing and engaging. He has managed to reap admiration for his eureka moments and yet becoming an empathetic everyman who audience will be rooting for.The recent sci-fi blockbusters have all stretched themselves rather long, and my problem with the much raved-about Gravity (2013) was that it contained too much exasperation and literally hard-breathing and gasping moments and it somehow diluted a lot of other emotional angles of how the film should and could've been; hence making it felt rather long. I found myself thoroughly entertained throughout watching The Martian. There were comical moments as well, coupled with its feel-good 70s disco soundtrack, great performances by the cast collectively; and not to mention that Scott has not only captured the visually stunning landscapes of Mars, but cleverly filming the intimate landscapes of the main cast's faces, the film is profuse in both marvel and emotional achievements.",

    "review": "  Fantastic movie! The best movie I've seen this fall! Ridley Scott (Director) is back after a few less than stellar (recent) films. Matt Damon is fantastic in the lead role as an astronaut who was presumed dead but fights to survive. The rest of the cast is stellar to include the dependable and highly underrated Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) and the phenomenal Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years A Slave). I'm not usually a Sci Fi film person, but I really loved this movie's ability to play the opposing emotions of despair and hope with the power of the human spirit (albeit in a Sci Fi context). Highly recommended!",

    "review": "  Sometimes, films don't have to push boundaries or revolutionise cinema in order to be really good. They can, in fact, just be neat and polished; do everything they're supposed to correctly and do it well. The Martian is the latter. More science fact than science fiction, The Martian brings a very human drama to alien surroundings with great success. The very neat and tidy screenplay shows it's novel origins throughout and it never once drags. It's paced brilliantly through the highs and lows of the drama and is genuinely gripping from start to finish.The fabulous ensemble cast do fine work too. Matt Damon hasn't been this good in a while and he's got fine support from everyone involved. Some of the characterisations are a little clich� but, as I say, it's all done rather well. So you don't care.The gravitas of the situation is superbly undercut by the disco soundtrack, which brings a welcome degree of levity to proceedings. However, it also makes you acutely aware of the paint-by-numbers nature of such a man-against-adversity story. We know Mark Watney is going to survive. No matter how much we're teased with otherwise outcomes, the story is always winding toward the inevitable. It's a paint-by-numbers thorn that won't leave The Martian's side.It's a minor gripe, but one that robs it of a 5 star rating.It was recently pointed out to me, to my agreement, that Ridley Scott's reputation is based on only three truly great films. He does a fine job here and his efforts can certainly be considered more Alien/Gladiator than A Good Year/Robin Hood. 4 and a half stars.",

It includes Mark rationing food, listening to disco music at the HAB on the planet mars, growing potatoes in the garden so he doesn't run out of food, wait until the supply of food arrives. The way that Mark thinks of a way to grow potatoes, and finds a way for the plant to grow is brillant.

    "review": "  To accurately express how much I loved this movie, I must first post my effusive praise which I gave the book on Goodreads:How do I love thee? Let me count the ways:I love thee for thy intelligence.For thy sarcastic eloquence.For thy manifestly scientific Grace.For this lyrical ballet in deepest space.For the tension and the humor at speed of light.For tossing the fiction, and making the science right.I love thy purely sense of adventure.I love thee with the passion of a cosmos nerd.I love the author's self-made venture.And admire his moxie, for what it in me bestirs.I love thee for my breathless tensure,Smiles, tears, as not ever ere! Emotions ablurred.I have enjoyed thee as I have never a book before.The movie experience was pretty much the same: awesome on every level. Let me be clear at the outset, instead of neatly summarizing at the end: this may have been my most favorite book/movie experience ever.Here's why I love most of the movies I love to death: everybody is smart. My favorites are littered with people who are thinking, thinking, thinking. This movie is rich and rife with smarts and intelligence pouring out of every pore.It's basis begins with a smart writer, doing smart research, marketing his book smartly, selling the rights smartly to a smart movie production company who hired a smart director, a smart scriptwriter, and hired smart, perfectly cast actors.The movie was not as detailed as the book, but it couldn't be, else it would have been 4 hours long - and even if it was, the entertainment value would not have been diminished a single iota. What they left out, and what they modified were smart decisions.It is flawless, genius, mastercraft moviemaking, and Damon and his crew are aces in their performances. Those quibbling against Kristen Wiig's role know not what they speak of. She acted exactly as her character did in the book.I am also emboldened by the apparent culture in NASA: people hold themselves accountable for their actions and decisions, and there is nobility throughout the film. There are no nefarious, bogus, bad guys. No, the bad guy is nature itself, who always acts rationally, and can be harnessed and countered.Oh, the science! The science! The science is SO good! So good, it was delicious! I followed all of it and wasn't lost! I have to go see it again. Who's coming with? Smart people only.",

Trata acerca del astronauta Mark Watney y como se encuentra solo en marte, luego de que su equipo, luego de una misi�n fallida lo da por muerto y se van. Watney despierta y est� completamente solo. Con recursos limitados, tiene que conseguir la manera de sobrevivir, hasta que la NASA env�e una nueva misi�n en un par de a�os y pueda ser rescatado. Lo bueno, es que Watney siendo tan ingenioso y un respetado botanista logra lo imposible y sorprende al mundo entero.The Martian es una pel�cula s�lida. Me gusta que tiene un aspecto de comedia, que una situaci�n similar a esta, nunca tendr�a. Un hombre solo en marte con la incertidumbre si va a sobrevivir, no es exactamente un panorama gracioso o esperanzador, pero la historia logra que esto sea posible, y es �nica. Con tantas pel�culas en el espacio que son similarmente dram�ticas, esta se destaca en ese aspecto. Tambi�n est� el hecho de que esta llena de modismos cient�ficos, y no es necesario explicarlo al p�blico, entonces se siente realista.La direcci�n de Ridley Scott es impecable como siempre. Me sorprendi� saber que dirigir�a una adaptaci�n, ya que �l es uno de los prodigios quien es capaz de imaginar y ejecutar mundos ut�picos y de magnitud incre�ble, pero lo logr�, sin poner en riesgo su integridad como artista. Igualmente, la historia se mantuvo fiel a el libro, y de hecho creo que se traduce mucho mejor al medio audiovisual que en escrito, lo cual es uno de los mejores cumplidos que podr�a darle a esta pel�cula. Especialmente ver a marte en todo su esplendor, con esa vastedad naranja, es incre�ble.Es The Martian una obra maestra de Ridley Scott? No. Pero es una pel�cula bien ejecutada, que cuenta una historia interesante y mantiene tu atenci�n durante 2hrs.",

A bad main character can severely hurt a movie and here, unlike in \"Elysium\", Matt Damon oozes likability and charisma.After getting separated and presumed dead by his crew during a severe sand storm, Damon is left behind and must figure out how to survive on the planet Mars until a rescue team can come for him, which could take years. This is where the movie truly shines. Most of the film focuses on Damon using his knowledge of science to survive; growing food, making water, contacting NASA, and maintaining mental stability. Watching him struggle while maintaining a hopeful and playful attitude all while video logging his daily activities is a lot of fun to watch.The other side of the story is the NASA team trying to figure out how to bring Damon home. This is one thing I a really admired about the film. Just about every conflict and/or obstacle that happens feels natural and not contrived. I believed every source of drama would likely happen in real life. The pace of the NASA brainstorming scenes do drag a bit towards the end of the second act, but not for too long.The scope of the movie is very interesting as well. It looks big and epic during the outer space sequences and Damon's exploration of Mars. At the same time, it also feels very claustrophobic, for Damon is all alone and can't step outside his lab without a spacesuit and that every breath he takes, every step could be his last. And last, but not least, director Ridley Scott. This is the first film of his that I've enjoyed since \"American Gangster\" in 2007 and his best work since \"Gladiator\" (2000) and \"Black Hawk Down\" (2001). I still may not be overly excited for his upcoming \"Prometheus\" sequel, but it's nice to see that he can still make great films. The Martian is the feel-good movie of the year, at least until \"Creed\" comes out.",

    "review": "  \"The Martian\" and \"Red Planet\"I'm kind of surprised that no one has noticed the similarities \"The Martian\" has to \"Red Planet\" with Val Kilmer, released in 2000. Here's a few noteworthy plot devices that were first seen in \"Red Planet\" that seem to have coincidental reappearances in \"The Martian\".1.RP - Val Kilmer, by accident marooned on Mars (with other guys who get killed off, leaving him alone),and a female commander of the mission up in space (who eventually saves him).TM - Matt Damon, by accident marooned on Mars, alone, and a female commander of the mission up in space (who eventually saves him).2.RP - Val finds the Sojourner rover (which luckily just happens to be nearby) and modifies it to call for help.TM - Matt finds the Sojourner rover (which luckily just happens to be nearby) and modifies it to call for help.3.RP - The female mission commander makes the decision to stay in orbit and try to save Val.TM - The female mission commander makes the decision to go back and try to save Matt. 4.RP - Val must make a long arduous journey to get to a Russian sample return launcher.TM - Matt must make a long arduous journey to get to a NASA mission return launcher.5.RP - Val has to modify the sample return launcher to make it work, leaving him exposed to space when it launches.TM - Matt has to modify the mission return launcher to make it work, he ends up being exposed to space when it launches.6.RP - The return launcher fouls up as it goes into space with Val aboard, requiring his mission commander to go out on a tether and retrieve him.TM - The return launcher fouls up as it goes into space with Matt aboard, requiring one of the crew to go out on a tether and retrieve him.** Of course Matt didn't have the inconvenience of the robot dog who was trying to kill him as Val had to contend with; but Val discovered he could breathe the Martian air that was generated by the seeded algae. So things even out pretty well.No one else noticed these because likely no one saw \"Red Planet\", which while not a big hit is not without its own goofy personality charms.",

There were a lot of flaws and Matt Damon appeared waaaay to comfortable on Mars. The screen play was somewhat flawed because it left out some key road blocks to getting to the MAV and ares landing site.. He was more than worried about food not just running out of ketchup. I did enjoy the 70s music and the cinematography.",

    "review": "  You have to spend a lot of time alone with Matt Damon. He has to be likable, funny and engaging while talking to the camera (the audience) by himself. If you had any reservations on why hes a movie star this has to be proof enough for anyone he has \"it\". There is just the right amount of science in the martian, enough to make you feel like you get it but not so much it becomes convoluted. The pace is wonderfully broken up with cuts back to the crew that left him a lot to NASA on earth. side note: if it came out years from now that NASA embezzled a couple million to the producers of this film in an effort to get more public support for NASA i would not be surprised at all. It will inspire people to believe in science and exploration and inspire you to stay positive and never give up when your situation seems hopeless.",

Director Ridley Scott takes on a book adaptation about an astronaut left stranded on the desolate and unforgiving red planet, Mars. Matt Damon was singularly excellent as the optimistic and very likeable Mark Watney, stuck in a sticky situation, yet still managing to remain sanguine. The \"disaster in outer space\" narrative has been done before, but The Martian manages to execute in such a way where in melodrama and overdone thrills are substituted with wit, flawless back and forth dialogue and an uncanny ability to humanize Mark's situation.The Martian was a fantastic sci-fi drama, and even a humble comedy. It had me captivated to the very end, leaving me satisfied with the brilliant climax and the incredible survival film that I had just endured.",

    "review": "  The Martian is the story of a fictional NASA mission Ares III that is forced to abort during a massive storm. Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by debris during the evacuation and presumed dead and left on the planet. However, he didn't die and is forced to find a way to extend his supplies and create food and water and oxygen to sustain himself for the presumed 4 years before a rescue mission would arrive to get him.Things I Liked:Matt Damon. Damon is one of my favorite living actors today. He continues to have that all American quality and screen charisma that keeps him interesting to watch. He goes through a lot a emotional moments including: Shock, Sorrow, Fear, Joy, Anger, the list goes on. He holds your attention for the entirety of his screen time and does so with all the talent that we have come to know from Damon.The Story. The Movie has a really interesting twist on a simple story. The moments that make it compelling are watching the process of discovery and seeing how Watney creates all the different elements that attempt to keep him alive. And then back on earth there are a tons of people doing a similar thing to figure out how to get him back. It's a really compelling story.The Visual Elements. The film looks incredible but it also does things in a way that makes you feel like it is not outside the realm of possibility here. The ships, the rovers, the facilities, all work and they all feel like this movie could exist right now. It's really neat to look at and nothing ever feels absurd or out of place.Things I Didn't Like:The Size of the Elements. While the whole cast gives a lot of really good performances, it just feels like there are too many people in this film, especially in the scenes on Earth. There are about half a dozen people at NASA working together and you feel like a couple of them could be removed and the movie would almost lose nothing. Additionally it feels a hair too long and has a few too many complications. There are a lot of obstacles thrown into the picture and after a while it seems almost comical at times how many things go wrong before they get back on track.Overall:Overall. The movie is an amazing piece of art. The look is both incredible and believable. The cast give fantastic performances and even though it feels like there are too many people in works, no one feels like they were phoning it in or on a different level than anyone else. The story is compelling, and even though there are a few too many complications, it's still interesting from start to finish. The movie is one of, not only the most well made movies of the year, but also one of the most fun movies I've seen this year.",

    "review": "  A wonderful adaption and an important movie, in the landscape of today's exceedingly pessimistic science fiction. There is a real trend of fear of science, in today's science fiction -- something that stems from the coldness of the subject. There is a trend of fear of scientists and intellect. In this movie, science is shown to be what it is: not a weapon or whatever the public fears it to be, but a tool. A scientist is shown to be no more than he or she is: not an evil genius, but a person, who happens to be a cool scientist. A woman is a captain of a space voyage. A black man is a leading director of some big department within NASA (the name of the department escapes me). There is no \"token\" role for any race of gender. The roles in the movie are split evenly between race and gender. Countries work together... enormous sacrifices are made by both sides to save one man. The movie is about coming together to use science and engineering to save one man, as a metaphor for using science to save all of man. There is some expository dialogue that wouldn't make sense as a conversation between scientists, but they're not populous. Danny Glover's acting is strange and does not fit the tone of the rest of the movie. I feel like the director should have told him something. I read the book before watching the movie and noticed a few things right away. Half of the book seemed to be missing, but that shouldn't take away from the movie. This should only be incentive to read the book or listen to the audiobook (the audio book is my preference) after watching the movie. The tone of the book is quite different.

The visual part of the film is gorgeous. A couple of good jokes is still there, but the dramatic element was not felt. In the book it just a little, but it is also very important. When viewing I realized that not really empathize main character. The actors did their best. Matt Damon is handled excellently, secondary characters also coped well. Glad that after a series of setbacks, Ridley Scott still able to make a good movie. Decent fiction, which is not only much inferior to last year's movie about space, which also was Damon.

It's essentially Matt Damon's film, demonstrating once again his broad range as an actor and ability to both engage and entertain. Otherwise, \"The Martian\", whilst occasionally brilliantly shot and with moments of grandeur, comes off as disposable entertainment and is ultimately forgettable. Like most blockbusters, this feels designed to manipulate the audience and despite the setting there isn't enough stillness or space to make this film really breathe. That there is musical score in just about every god damned scene, the camera is always zooming and dollying, and that there is nary a static shot is par for the course for most big budget films made these days, but for Ridley Scott to be making films in this manner demonstrates that he's lost his ability to tell a story without smoke and mirrors.

    "review": "  This film tries to be smart and it nails it. The acting was decent. Matt Damon, on the other hand, absolutely nails his role. The movie began to get a little boring after the first half, but the intelligence never tended to die. The music was not memorable, but I don't remember it being bad at all, it's just not something I would really remember very easily. Near the end, the film began to become smarter than it's own good, and as I tried to follow along I just felt stupid trying to rather than the positive smart feeling you get like Deathnote or Good Will Hunting. This was not a good part of the movie I particularly enjoyed. The sound effects were fantastic. Nice ending that made me smile, and the film sets were well made, too. Overall, it was an okay movie, nothing painful or overly bad making this not necessarily a bad movie, just not in my opinion a very memorable one.",

    "review": "  While it is not among the best science fiction movies, The Martian is surprisingly witty and funny for a space misadventure revolving around a single character. Matt Damon's lone some adventure is a thrill thanks to his optimistic characterization, while keeping in mind the reality of things, the visual and sound effects, and the editing and flow of scenes.On a mission to Mars, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) and his crew are caught in a sand storm. His crew manages to escape and leaves him behind, believing him dead. Instead of going through the usual depressing phase, he does just the opposite; he analyzes his situation and starts thinking how he can use what he has to survive.Directed by Ridley Scott, The Martian brings out the strange optimism one rarely finds in a space misadventure. Matt Damon challenges his situation from the very beginning by saying \"I am not going to die here\", and keeps a light tone throughout the rest of the movie. However, while Matt Damon does a great job in portraying his emotions, the viewer is never able to forget the situation thanks to the amazing visuals and set design.Even though the movie moves a little too fast, it is understandable since it develops in a long period of time. It would be impossible to portray this day by day without ending with a boring plot. More importantly, the problems are explained emotionless intriguing the viewer in the science involved and letting us know what is going on at all times (with a bit of suspense, of course), which is always a challenge when a movie is based on a book written in first person.While the basic plot is not anything out of the ordinary, the personality of the protagonist is something rare in a space thrill. This along with beautiful visuals, awkward but funny jokes, and an amazing way of explaining each and every scene, The Martian will have you rooted to your seat, not waiting for the moment on when Mark will survive, but on how he will do it.",

    "review": "  The Martian is the glorious return to form for Ridley Scott after a string of questionable projects and this movie blew me away on every level, largely due to the realistic science the film portrays and the captivating, nearly one-man-show performance from Matt Damon. Based on the book by Andy Weir, and adapted by the rising star, Drew Goddard, the story follows a botanist who is assumed dead during a catastrophic solar storm and left to fend for himself on Mars using his brain and ingenuity to keep himself alive until he can be rescued. First off, the film is absolutely stunning with gorgeous cinematography and extremely impressive visual effects, not to mention the fact that I completely bought the fact that he was stranded on mars; that's how real the sets looked. Second, the acting is off-the-charts impressive with one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen with the likes of: Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig, Donald Glover, Michael Pe�a, and of course, Matt Damon who owns this movie from the get-go. And lastly, this film's biggest secret: it is HILARIOUS! I have never been more pleasantly surprised that a film could be so clever, witty, intelligent, and exciting all at the same time and there are NUMEROUS laugh-out-loud moments. That's not to say there aren't harrowing moments as well; I found myself on edge throughout hoping the character would make it through his ordeal and it's quite suspenseful at times. I LOVED this and I haven't seen a practically flawless film like this in ages where everything clicked and it surpassed all of my expectations! Ridley Scott has delivered his best film in years and I hope he is on the up-swing because this is A+, quality filmmaking!",

Simply hearing him talk about how he's going to try and survive is almost always interesting. There's something about the vast desert landscape of Mars that lends itself well to cinematography, and the CGI is very convincing. Unfortunately, there are a couple of lazy storytelling techniques, many of the Earth centered scenes near the end get a bit dull, I couldn't have cared less about the subplot involving Damon's old crew members, and I'm not sure if this is a movie that needs to be two hours and forty minutes long, but it's pure entertainment that should please general audiences and lovers of film (though, to varying degrees).",

    "review": "  A super fun and hearty film that showcases a return to form for Ridley Scott. The Martian's strongest point is it's protagonist Mark Watney, played by Matt Damon. In a time where most all films with this type of subject material would be dark and gloomy, Damon's character brings a humorous and light hearted feel to this movie, despite it's seemingly bleak scenario. This movies primary driving force is problem solving. This is essentially a movie about a man using science and critical thinking to solve a string of problems in an attempt to get him back home to earth. Watching the interesting turns of events unfold is quite entertaining, though it does feel as if the \"Solve the problem with science\" is being overused by the end of the films runtime. This whole problem solving mantra is what presents the main conflict within this film: scientific accuracy. Now, this is NOT the film to watch if you want an accurate space movie, I knew that going in to this, but this film presents itself in a way that takes it's science-filled problem solutions too seriously to then turn around and pull the (Small spoiler) Glove-Propulsion trick. Despite a very skillful placement of truly gritty and emotionally heavy moments, the general happy-go-lucky feeling overstays it's welcome just a hair. I would definitely give this movie a watch!",

    "review": "  With Ridley Scott returning to science fiction after two cinematic failures, The Martian Sounded like a promising return to form for the legendary director.The Martian was a very surprising film. Some of the themes appeared to be very reminiscent of Interstellar, and considering that the film shows Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain returning to space there is certainly a sense of familiarity there. As well as that, the film seems to capitalize on the trend of recent survival-themed films such as All is Lost, Riddick and Gravity. Gravity especially seems like a familiar film due to the concept of surviving in space as well as the fact that some of the scenes in the film's final climax have very similar imagery. But I guess that's to be expected.What isn't so familiar about The Martian is just how intelligent it is. Perhaps one of the most impressive things about The Martian is its direction. Ridley Scott is the director, and The Martian establishes that the man truly is at his best when working in science fiction, if that wasn't already clear for his efforts on Alien, Blade Runner and Prometheus. What's interesting is that the direction of the story is clear, it is very straightforward. As the tale centres around the survival and rescue of the titular Mark Watney, all the cbaracters in the story know it and don't mess around with it. As a result, the story remains very focused on this clear objective and doesn't mess around with melodramatic subplots or tedious character conflict. The story keeps on moving forward once it builds its mood even though it moves at a pace slow enough to let everything develop properly yet fast enough so that there is essentially no periods of boredom over the course of the 141 minute running time. The focus of the story attempts to fit everything and everyone into the the film so that it captures the true scope of the events and scale of the spectacle which is very respectable. Admittedly, there is a feeling that there could have been more in-depth exploration of Mark Watney as a character, but at the same time the fact that he is so ready to fight for his right to survive is impressively heroic.There is an effective balance between intelligent yet comprehensive language which respects the audience enough not to oversimplify it yet also expects them to divert their focus into it, and since the feature is naturally entertaining it is easy to keep engaged with it all. The language is smart, the characters and conversations are intelligent, and there is even a sporadic sense of humour in the film which adds a lighthearted touch to the experience and makes it more enjoyable without detracting from the serious nature of the rest of the story. The Martian is a film which is touching, intense, intelligent and funny. The writing is brilliant, and Ridley Scott knows how to treat the story properly so that it maintains a strong sense of character and spectacle the entire time.Historically, Ridley Scott has proven time and time again to have a brilliant eye for intensively atmospheric imagery. In The Martian it is interesting because there is intense dedication to detail thanks to Wadi Rum's production design of Mars which he has achieved many times before, yet it isn't the main focus. This is because the setting is so convincing that it actively feels natural, making the fictional nature of the narrative forgettable and drawing viewers into the story very well. The dedication to detail is spectacular and it is all captured with cinematography that incorporates in both epic techniques to capture the scale of it all and western techniques to emphasize the dry, dead horizon. The visual effects are also excellent, particularly in portraying the space journey of the characters. And yet, there is more than enough genuine narrative heft to ensure that the film never falls back on relying on its visual elements, rather moderating them with a story in a very practical fashion. Frankly, The Martian is one of the first science fiction films in a long time which relies on genuinely intelligent writing to succeed without relying on visual effects even though it has them there and ready to present impressive imagery whenever it is necessary.And riding the success of the brilliant screenplay, the cast in The Martian have no problem delivering their greatest talentsMatt Damon delivers his greatest performance in years. Once again needing to be rescued and in space, Matt Damon has essentially created a trend for two narratives which converge into one for his role in The Martian. He is alone on a planet talking to himself and the camera essentially the entire time, and it could not feel more real. Though there is clearly a sense of humane frailty to him, what's more impressive is how genuinely intelligent he seems in his understanding of and physical engagement with the set. He is impeccably convincing, but more importantly he is able to hold the screen on the basis of his natural spirit. Matt Damon has an intelligent but lighthearted mood to him in The Martian, successfully bringing a sense of humour to the film which keeps it consistently more optimistic and more enjoyable which means that it serves as a strong testament to his ability to hold the screen even when he has nobody else to engage with directly. Matt Damon's natural charms and intelligent character tenacity are remarkable assets to The Martian, making the human edge of the film unexpectedly funny in the most delightful manner.Jeff Daniels is also great. Playing the director of NASA, Jeff Daniels has the responsibility of being very blunt with his character. It's impressive because I expected him to be an emotionless archetype, and yet he was exceptionally professional and human at the same time. He had to look out for the interests of his professional career first, but you can tell he wants Mark Watney to survive as much as anyone else which makes him a likable figure even if viewers don't always see eye to eye with his decisions. Jeff Daniels has a very sophisticated line delivery in The Martian, limiting his emotional input to an appropriately restrained extent so capture an ideal nature for the character. Jeff Daniels' supporting effort is an effective reminder of his extensive dramatic talents and establishes his career resurgence in dramatic cinema.And in a refreshing turn of events, Donald Glover makes a cinematic transition very nicely. At first I got mixed feelings out of him because his spaced out nature as an astrodynamicist is first played off for comedic effect in a manner very much like his iconic role as Troy Barnes in Community which isn't precisely the most sophisticated or original element, but at the same time I do admit that I have long missed him since his departure from Community. His role later proves to be very brief, but the way he talks about the scientific material in the screenplay is brilliant. He comes off as being very smart, and is so natural about it that he doesn't have to force any persona to go with it. Donald Glover delivers what fans have grown to love about him while also depicting an innovative step forward for a cinematic career.And though their supporting roles are essentially all of equal importance and impact, the efforts of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Michael Pena and Sean Bean are all effective. Even the lesser known Benedict Wong delivers an intelligent effort.So The Martian may have similar elements to some recent science fiction films, but it brings the best of them to an original and intelligent film with a brilliantly sophisticated and funny screenplay, brilliantly atmospheric and stylish direction from Ridley Scott in his best genre and Matt Damon bringing his most charming effort in a long time.",

Mr.Scott, has done it yet again with \"Martian\", a really fun and enjoyable Sci-Fi thriller. It stars Matt Damon as the man stuck on Mars after a terrible Ares mission. This movie is definite must see and you would probably never want it to end.��Mark Whatney (Damon), is left on Mars after a bad storm and a awful mission named Ares 3. His crew is certain of his death and reports it to NASA, the lead of the mission. It turns out that he really is alive, and he is making a living. The rest of the movie is about how he gets back home.Now, let me say that this movie is around two and half hours. It's usually really hard to keep people engaged the whole time, but this movie does it perfectly. It has its own blend of science, comedy, and action, at the same time developing the plot. The screenplay and performances are amazing, and You can definetly say that Chiwetel is one of the best actors of our time. Not saying the pat Matt Damon isn't good, but his character is very plain and ordinary, even though he pulls of the smart-look very well and is mostly taken care of with CGI. The way that this movie is put together, edited, and executed is just fantastic, and it's really really engaging. The soundtrack in this movie is just amazing and keeps you very satisfied throughout the whole movie.�� This movie albeit is very predictable and boring at some times, which is ok, considering that it is really long. Matt's humor really works well, and is absolutely spectacular when you need to relieve tension. This movie has a strong message that is given in a different and very amazing way. They show you survival, tension, and love. It is hard to understand at times, but you have to understand that Hollywood tried its best to make it super simple and understandable. Al of the science references were neat, and all the characters looked and behaved very sharp, except for Kate Mara who just struggled. Jeff Daniels in this movie doesn't really fit as the director of NASA and always reminds me of \"Dumb and Dumber\". Seeing him looks like a joke, and doesn't really fit the serious role at times.�� The characterization and description for each character is very well done. You would really really care about the characters and worry about them, as if you were really dragged in to the movie. The CG is mindblowing, even if there is a short resemblance to the Grand Canyon at many places. The shooting, setting, and character time placement is very well done and is surely not a miss.�After going through two-years of development hell, this movie definetly lives up to the hype and does justice. Ridley Scott, is the man for this movie even though he isn't as consistent. When seeing movies like \"Exodus\", you'll probably lose touch for him. But this movie is smart, executed well, sharp, and has some really really good performances. Like I said, it's really really hard to engage people in a movie for two and half hours, but this movie does that perfectly. \"The Martian\" should not be a miss, and is a visual-popcorn thriller treat for the audiences.Rating: ****�",

    "review": "  Despite an incredible cast, one of my favourite directors at the helm and a relatively charismatic Matt Damon, the only act that truly shines in this film is the last. With a script heavy first two acts, the dialogue needed to exceed the audiences knowledge and have us meet it halfway, instead opting for a far safer and friendlier script. A far greater film lies within a very superficial script, unfortunately tugging neither at the strings of the heart or head.",

    "review": "  \"The Martian\" is an epic fantasy film that transports us to a planet that has always been enshrouded in mystery. In most situations, I would automatically rank this film at a 10 for its impeccable acting, well-written script, and awesome special effects. Unfortunately, 2013's \"Gravity\" and 2014's \"Interstellar\" set an unfair expectation, unintentionally branding this as \"2015's Token Space Movie.\" With the inevitable comparisons, this film seems weak; still, it deserves a high rating for the aforementioned reasons. \"The Martian\" is worth seeing solely for Matt Damon. The story ranges from comedy to drama and from action to mindbender, all within Damon's one-man-show. Everything from Damon claim of being the best horticulturalist on Mars to his communication using the hexadecimal alphabet makes his character likable and enhances our desire to see him return home. A second story counters Damon's experiences on Mars. This story brings in A-list actors Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, Michael Pe�a, and Kate Mara, all of whom support the strong emotional content of the story. One of the strengths of this screenplay is that it remains believable. I have been told that the Damon faces many more issues in the book, but any more than what is contained in this film would make his survival seem farfetched. While fans of the book may view this as an injustice to the source material, I believe it to be a victory. Whether you are interested in science fiction or not, \"The Martian\" is believable enough that any audience member can enjoy it.",

Although the narrative itself does not necessarily present anything new - we've seen this scenario before - and the story is quite predictable, Ridley Scott's latest benefits from both a strong script that keeps momentum flowing and an especially nuanced performance by Damon; it carries a much different tone than other recent space dramas and for that, it is justified and comes highly recommended.",

And most importantly, in my mind, it respects the intelligence of the viewer (usually) to figure out certain things without it having to be explicitly spelled out, while still being careful to keep them apprised of the higher level science that goes into surviving on Mars alone.",

    "review": "  (68%)A well made space survival adventure that mixes Apollo 13, Castaway and Interstellar in a very watchable treat that marks a lighter entry into Ridley Scott's filmography. The pacing is sharp, the performances from the strong cast are solid and this never becomes anything other than a likeable sit. Unlike something such as Castaway the plot is more required to follow both the captive (Matt Damon) and the rest of the cast who's only objective is to try and help rescue him, so there is a fair amount of switching between the two focal points rather than pure Matt Damon in space trying to get by. Without doubt this is a band apart from the lesser films of the year, but I doubt it will top my list mainly because for me it came and went without hardly any lasting impact. So by the end it is enjoyable while it lasts with plenty of heart and entertainment value, but it didn't send as many shock-waves upon me as it did so many others. Nice throwback soundtrack though.",

Damon is terrific and might get some academy attention for this role, it feels so realistic as if you are watching a film based on a true story, which of course you're not. The martian is funny as hell, but maybe a little too lighthearted at times. There are certain scenes where it should be very serious but instead they inject humor to keep the film from being tonally inconsistent. that is the price you pay i guess. The Martian is one of the best films of the year so far and will likely stay that way. 4.5/5",

    "review": "  The Martian is a fun spectacle of a film. The 3D is decent enough to actually add something to the film without ever coming across as a gimmick. The performances, cinematography and direction are all top notch and can't be faulted. Where the film doesn't work for me is that I never ever get a sense that astronaut Mark Watney is truly stranded or helpless. Throughout the film, whenever a problem arises or is fortold, the solution comes about either withing the same dialogue, the next piece of dialogue, or the next scene (or two). There is no sense of dread or despair really present in this film. Considering this astronaut is stranded on Mars, one would think that him never getting home would be a primary theme in this film but a film about a dude on an island with a volleyball for a friend managed to do a much better job of that somehow. The Martian is but a small step above a popcorn flick but thanks for some stunning visuals, that step can feel like a giant leap.Worth checking out in 3D or Imax (or 3D Imax if you can) to truly get the full visual experience of the film.",

    "review": "  Impeccably made and with a great, charming performance from Mad Damon, The Martian suffers from a similar problem as other \"stranded disaster movies.\" The biggest issue here is that any time the film returns to earth, it loses any and all momentum is had built up. The mars scenes are gorgeous, effecting, and surprisingly entertaining and when the film returns to Earth countless times, everything comes to a screeching halt. Even the scenes on the space station Hermes, who are in a unique position to possibly rescue Damon's stranded Mark Watney, are formulaic. Scott's visuals, though, remain as potent as ever and I can't stress enough how gorgeous and well put together the Mars scenes are. Another problem I had was the completely predictable plot. At one point, Jeff Daniels' NASA chief says something to the effect of \"I hope nothing else goes wrong!\" and, what do you know, the next scene shows a supply ship headed for Watney explode. WHO COULD HAVE SEEN THAT COMING?!?! I also never thought for a second that he wouldn't be rescued, training much of the tension of the movie. The Martian is really only worth it for, like I said, Damon and Mars. Everything else drags the movie down into a formulaic mess.",

Reminiscent of Zero Dark Thirty in the sense that it depicts a series of events in realistic detail. There is no plot here in the dramatic sense, no internal conflict, no moral dilemma, no tension between different worldviews or competing desires, no strong plot twist, and, worst of all, no real suffering. Sandra Bullock in Gravity (essentially a better version of the same story) at least seemed genuinely afraid for her life. In short, there is nothing here that makes art interesting. The film's biggest flaw is that it relies wholly on the viewer's fear and sympathy for Matt Damon.Ironically, at one point in the film the protagonist explains that in space, sooner or later, things will go wrong, and you just need to \"get to work\", to solve one problem after the other, and if you solve enough problems you may survive. That is all there is to this film, and series of problems; when they solve them, it ends.Is it really surprising that someone accused the creators of the Martian of plagiarism? There are enough stolen ideas here for a class action lawsuit.",

Kudos also to Matt Damon, who delivers a funny(yes funny)relatable and brilliant performance, assisted in no small measure by an outstanding supporting cast. This is the film of the year, at times humorous, suspenseful, dramatic and dire, well executed, adapted and cinematic, The Martian is the reason we go to the movies. Bravo. Mr. Scott and Mr. Damon best have a seat close to the Oscars stage come February and they best be looking sharp! Applause Mr. Damon, many applause and welcome back Sir. Ridley, we missed you.",

    "review": "  \"Cast Away in Mars\"The Great Director Ridley Scott is Back, The Man who brought Gladiator, Alien and Kingdom of Heaven is back with a New Masterpiece.This Movie is Incredible, it's a very uplifting story about survival The Performances Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and every single person in this cast is excellent.The Music by \"Harry Greyson-Williams\" is excellent, this is the man who crafted the incredible score for Kingdom of Heaven and he is back with yet another great score that suits the movie perfectly, (also, the use of disco music is surprisingly good).The Script is Perfect, the dialogue is not just a \"movie dialogue\", you believe that someone in that situation would talk and act like that, you sometimes feel that is inspired by a true story because everything seems so real.The Cinematography is Incredible, Dariusz Wolski is a man who knows how to shoot a great film even if its not a \"Real Location\" He proved this with films like: The Walk, Prometheus, Pirates of the Caribbean and Now The Martian.He's Style here is very similar to his style in Prometheus, anyone paying attention will know this is thee same cinematographer.The Editing is Excellent (I'm Very Excited to see the Extended Cut when it comes out).This is a very uplifting film that no one should miss.4.5/5",

Aussi dr�le que passionnant, le dernier film de Ridley Scott �vite de distiller des r�flexions philosophiques pour faire comme les copains et se concentre sur l'aspect scientifique et ironique d'un homme coinc� et bien vivant sur Mars. Aux c�t�s de l'excellent Matt Damon, on retrouve un ensemble cast parfaitement bien g�r� par un Ridley Scott qui n'avait pas fait un aussi bon film depuis pr�s de 19 ans.

It had the right balance of action, storytelling, character development, great acting and enough of a crescendo that I was gripping my seat.

    "review": "  Personable sci-fi flick from Ridley Scott that updates the old Robinson Crusoe stuck on a desert isle (and how he learns to survive) trope. First off, make that a deserted planet. Mars. And the background and the hope this film presents is grounded on is our quest to reach beyond the limits of Earth's gravity (and so it loudly parades that we'll overcome every adversity). Now there's science here but let's not get too excited. The emphasis is interestingly on the personalities involved, interestingly because while the characters are the primary focus of this tale on one hand, on the other hand they are only the flimsiest of constructs with zero time spent \"getting to know them\". We only watch while they react to danger. Who they are or who they might be outside of these situations, we never get to see. This momentary drawback weakens the film, but only by a bit. Its worth a watch, Jessica Chastain and Jeff Daniels leading a deep bench of secondary players.",

This is sci-fi with an emphasis on science, and the layperson does have to take a fair bit on faith. Still, it's a testament to Ridley Scott's status as a modern master that even though you know where it's going and you're pretty sure you know how it's going to get there, this one remains engaging if not fascinating pretty much to the end.",

I loved the balance of prestigious award-nominated actors and comedic ones, with Matt Damon perfect in a role that required both. While there was not nearly as much tension as you'd expect for a story like this, especially when compared to Gravity or Interstellar, which it undoubtedly will be, the witty and well timed humor more than make up for it. I was enthralled in this story for every second and while some parts might occasionally seem unbelievable, I bought just about every decision, performance, and beat throughout. Easily one of my top 5 theater experiences this year, and excellent in IMAX3D! ~ A-",

Obviously we can't give Scott all the credit because the performances were top notch. Matt Damon was both hilarious and electric in his role as Mark Watney. Also Chiwetel Ejiofor was so good in this movie, and i can definitely see him getting a supporting actor nod for his role. Now lets attend back to my hard on for Mr.Scott. One thing you can always expect when walking into a Ridley Scott film is that it will be visually stunning, and this film is GORGOUS. Mars is a character of its own in this film like Mount Everest is to \"Everest\". The planet looks like the coolest sandbox you'll ever visit and probably had people checking Expedia for one way trips. The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way is that i they try and tie in his parents at one point late in the film and i just wish there was more to that. His parents seem to be the only family he has on earth and i believe that if they were able to just touch on their relationship just a bit more then that would add a scoop of give a **** for the viewers. Overall the film is great and that con is really just nit picking at what was a well acted, directed, written and shot film.",

Due to the amount of science and tech artifacts they had, and also the amount of logos used, and seemingly accurate space talk. I have to say this is a 180?�flip from how films have been portraying near term space travel. Usually, space is depicted as cold, confusing, hopeless, spinning, pressure losing, void. Pros: What this film did was actually make space travel look fun and appealing. Which brings me to this: is the industry gong to stop making \"space\" looking like an ice cold spinning void, and start making it look like a long trip on southwest airlines? Cons: I would have liked to see outside of Matt Damon's botany lab and car VLOGs, and to see more adventurous stunts like him climbing, finding caves, and showing some of the actual life that is on Mars now. Instead I felt like we were a little cooped up in his small labs, and we didn't get a feel for home much adventure is actually awaiting us on Mars. Another con is they kind of made Damon's character look like a wimp, I think the more likely people to colonize mars would be a group of USMC types who don't mind welding 10 hours a day and who have experience surviving crazy conditions.",

But Ridley Scott manages to fuse both the spectacle of space with characters that are humanly fleshed out, and adds another jewel to his filmography after half a decade of frustrating work. The film rest on 2 key features, Drew Godard's Script and Matt Damon's character. Drew Godard makes a great script, full of fun quotes and one-liner's which helps sell the appeal to Damon's acting. Damon also does a great job as the character, fighting for his life on Mars. The science of the film seems to check out overall well and i love how the problems they have affect everything. The cast is an all star crew, from Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor, to Jessica Chastain &Kristen Wiig, everyone in the cast does a great job. The cinematography especially some of the shots on Mars look gorgeous as well , and the old boy Ridley Scott with great material and talent, comes away with another gem in his filmography. The Martian works because i can buy into the characters, buy into the science, and buy into the fun of it all. The Martian has the perfect mix of everything. Recommended",

It did the book justice, Matt Damon was able to bring this character to life, do justice to what the book brought to life in our imaginations. While there will always be that room to contemplate if a scene could have been fit in here or there, for the sake of time or hollywood may consider necessary or not. The movie did the book justice. That's all you gotta know. Truly spectacular movie, can't wait to own it for my own personal devices.",

    "review": "  Held up by the performances, which are great across the board. Lotta life and humor in incidental moments. The effects are great (apart from a few Mars-scape flyovers that look like Google Earth footage), the sound design is fantastic, the sets are fantastic, the music is cool, etc, super cool production all around. The only thing holding it back imo is the super controlled plotting. It becomes apparent very quickly that this isn't a space thriller a la Apollo 13, or even really a survival movie a la Castaway, but a space procedural. It becomes apparent very quickly, from the bright tone and broad perspective, that there's no real question whether or not Matt Damon will survive his ordeal. Which would be fine, but the plot keeps throwing survival thriller-esque challenges at the characters as soon as the previous one gets resolved, forcing itself to deal with the technical hurdles to survival instead of the much more interesting social and political challenges it brings up. I liked the bureaucratic drama, the web of technical and political jugglings faced by the teams on Earth and in space, but it didn't go far enough with them, never producing any lasting drama out of tough decisions. Every problem, large and small, gets resolved very quickly and competently, usually by a deus ex machina'd brand new genius character (Donald Glover) or organization (China's space program) or conveniently remembered piece of equipment (Pathfinder) that shows up halfway or more through the movie. There ends up being no real sticking drama at all, whether from the survival side of the story or the political one. So, it's still a good movie, fun to watch and be inside of for a couple hours, but it really misses its potential imo.",

    "review": "  THE MARTIAN brings us the best film of the year so far. After a few misses (Robin Hood, Prometheus, Exodus: Gods and Kings) Ridley Scot returns to form with this epic story of Mark Watney. After reading (and absolutely loving) the novel by Andy Weir, I went into the theater with extremely high expectations and the film delivered on all of them. Matt Damon was the perfect casting as he portrayed Watney with all of the wit, humor, and optimism that was he showed in the book. Damon's performance makes Mark Watney one of the most relatable characters in recent cinema. The supporting cast was also outstanding, from Jeff Daniels, Kristin Wiig, Sean Bean and Chiwetel Ejiofor as NASA scientists, to Jessica Chastain, Sebastian Stan, Michael Pena and Kate Mara in space, every character was as I pictured them while reading the book. The characters being loyal to the book is not what makes the performances good though. What makes them excellent is the way that they are written and portrayed. The chemistry between the members of the crew of the Aries 3 demonstrated the way that a group of people would be after spending do many months with no one but each other for company. What was so amazing about THE MARTIAN was that it was not only able to keep the the audience enthralled with simply one character on Mars, but that those aspects of the film were the most enjoyable. It took what could have been such a depressing idea, and turned it into a thrilling and humor filled mission of hope. Also, the Earth aspect showed ther realism of actually having a man stranded in space. I demonstrates the fact that as much as we would want to, it is not necessarily possible to do what ever it takes to save someone. There is a lot of paperwork and weighing of scenarios that make it difficult to decide if it is even possible to accomplish such a feat. However, in the third act, there is a portion of about 25 minutes that are spent on Earth that feels unnecessary and drawn out for a 2 and a half hour movie. Further, THE MARTIAN is a beautiful movie to watch. The visuals are absolutely outstanding. The vast, dusty and barren Mars landscape made it feel more like an actual character than simply a setting. For a second I had to step back and remember that it was not actually filmed on Mars!The only reason i would rank the book slightly higher than the movie is that there was some events left out (I know how cliche that sounds). In the book there were several more instances and events in which it made me feel more danger for Watney. However I do not blame the movie for this as it would draw the run time out even more.Everything about this movie hits; The story, the characters, the performances the humor, the visuals all come together to create a breathtaking film that is just as good as the novel in which it is based. (5/5)",

Once Watney realizes he was completely alone he decides to make the best of it and figure out a way to survive on Mars until NASA finds a way to pick him up.Whatever Watney feels, you feel: boredom, disappointment, hunger, loneliness. He can make a potato go a long way and deals with disco music better than most. Damon did an excellent job. The Martian was not only visually amazing but it had several parts that were laughable. There was a good balance between isolation and humor. I can see myself watching this movie over and over again and cheering for Watney every time.",

    "review": "  Really great. Not quite in Alien or Thelma and Louise league for me, but definitely one of Sir Riddles' finest. A big reason for this is the unexpected humour. I haven't read Andy Weir's book, so maybe the humour came from there. Riddles sure ain't know for it himself. And, granted, he sneaks yet ANOTHER gross-out \"extract-a-foreign-object-from-your-body-in-sci-fi-scene\" sequence into The Martian. But this isn't the typical grim, bleak, intense Riddles. The Martian is FILLED with wry, funny dialogue, observations, moments - and with a very optimistic vibe. Yes, the film is impeccably produced, perfectly cast (and WHAT a cast!!!), flawlessly performed (not a rotten apple here at all, but some standouts like Daniels) and just fantastically put together. Damon (the most affable megastar at the moment?) nails the lead role - essaying a tenacious, intelligent, funny, smart (smart ass) of a character with his usual relatable charm. I thought this film could've used a touch more resonance by showing exactly WHAT Mark Whatney was desperate to get home to (Family? Friends?) - he was a bit of a blank slate there. But the only REAL negative of \"The Martian\" is the slight overlength/pacing - the film drags a bit at the end of the second act/start of the third act, and it maybe validated a smidge more padding in the rear end (although arguably the shots under the main closing credits compensate for this).Overall it's an extremely polished Hollywood product. In the league of recent space flicks, The Martian is perhaps not as heart-pounding suspenseful or kinetic or well-paced as Gravity. But it's certainly warmer and more accessible (if less philosophically ambitious) than Interstellar. A really great film. But what makes The Martian special is not just the light, humorous vein running through a very serious narrative - but the fact that that this is a story about fighting tooth and nail against the odds in a situation where NO violence is required. No superhero smackdowns, no die hard cop shoot-outs, no last minute knockouts. Yes, the film has few bursts of thrilling physical \"action\" - but it's not based (like most Hollywood blockbusters) on characters fighting each other. The film's optimistic (yet someone realistic) heart is derived from the suspense of simple survival, and rescue. The film reminded me of \"Castaway\" in many ways, although Damon doesn't have a volleyball like his Private Ryan saviour - instead he's got a laptop diary. Yet the vibe is not dissimilar. Instead of fish and coconuts we've got recycled shit and potato plants. Instead of \"man make fire\", we've got \"man make water\". Instead of building rafts, we've got building camera-systems. But unlike \"Castaway\", \"The Martian\" balances the stranded-man scenes with \"get him home\" rescue-plan scenes. All with fantastic ensemble work. All with decent to great suspense, and all with the sense that SAVING a person (even just ONE person) is a human quality that should always be valued. And these scenes - and Damon's - are all about scientific ingenuity. Using knowledge for survival instead of violence. Never giving up hope. Playing disco music. And always dropping one-liners along the way.The Martian is a great metaphor, and a great example, in so many ways. You should get your ass to Mars. And see it.",

That and the universal praise of the critics put seeing this one at a high priority.\"Star Wars\" proved a global love for space movies. \"Castaway\" did the same for survival films. It's likely \"The Martian\" draws from both audiences along with readers of the novel. It's already being given \"Blockbuster\" status in the press. In the story, a manned mission to Mars goes wrong and an astronaut, thought to be dead, is left behind. He uses his ingenuity and tenacity to survive.

Alone and with barely enough supplies to last, Watney struggles to survive while everyone else on Earth aspires to bring him home (after a \"cover-up\" of his presumed death). You know you're watching a great movie when every second nails you to your seat with riveting rawness. Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN is one of those movies. Magnetic from the start and highlighted by a tour-de-force performance by Matt Damon as the title character, THE MARTIAN could in some ways be considered like CAST AWAY in outer space. This is arguably Scott's most intense movie ever; frightening as his previous ALIEN was, it was above all a science-fiction fantasy with its scares marked toward the visceral. Here the subject focuses on a man whose only major opponent on Mars are intense weather storms that at times tear apart his only survival makeshift camp. This lends of feeling of chilling realism, and, at least one point, grisliness (one early scene in the picture involves Damon performing surgery on a wound he receives from a broken antenna). THE MARTIAN is all the more convincing for it. The supporting cast is terrific, but as mentioned, it's because of Damon's compelling turn that the audience roots for his survival. While Ridley Scott's track record can be uneven, he has on occasion delivered great results. This is one of his best by far.",

The Martian is not as ambitious as Interstellar but it is definitely better than the overrated Gravity. The science is much more understandable. In the grim backdrop of a lone astronaut trapped on the red planet, Scott infuses surprising wit and humor thanks to Matt Damon's prowess as an actor. Strangely though not surprisingly it is a fact that many of the actors didn't even cross paths during shooting yet the film looks so coherent. The film benefits from the fact that it doesn't muddle up the story in want of gorgeous 3D or special effects though there is plenty of it to keep it balanced. The climax would have you clutching your seat as the scene unfolds in some really well shot action. There is probably just one hitch. Though we know how adverse the situation is, The Martian puffs it away with ease and humor. Maybe a little bit of Gravity's impending doom was required!",

And they added some nice emotional notes about why we venture into space at all. Essentially they took a book written at the college level down to about the 8th grade reading level. So if you want the full experience, definitely read the book!",

    "review": "  When I first saw trailers for \"The Martian\" I was instantly hooked. The story of a castaway... on another planet? Sign me up! Then I heard reactions from the trailer, how the plot is ludicrous, that there's no way NASA would attempt a rescue mission because those astronauts know what they're getting into and such an endeavor would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Rest assured, there's nothing about this movie that's ludicrous. It all makes sense and as an extra kicker, it's one heck of a ride. This is the kind of movie where you better make sure to apply some deodorant beforehand, otherwise your neighbors' attention will be diverted by your perspiration.Matt Damon plays Mark Watney, an astronaut who finds himself stranded on Mars when a sudden storm forces the crewmembers of the Ares III to abort their mission. While the world watches, he must find ways to survive using every bit of ingenuity at his disposal.While the main character is undoubtedly Mark, there's a lot more going on here than you expect. This film is like your average \"Cast Away\" story, with the amount of danger cranked up to a nearly unfathomable level. It's one thing being stuck alone on a rock you can't escape, but our hero isn't even on a planet that can sustain life, the average temperature on the surface is a cool -55�C, there's no water, no air, limited supplies and only because they were left behind when everyone else left in a hurry and on top of all that, he has to figure out a way to contact NASA, who assumes he died. This is a story that doesn't need a villain because the odds are stacked so high that you have no idea how he's going to make it past the 30 day mark, never mind find a way home. The titular Martian is just a fraction of what you have to look forward to. What the previews don't show you is the other side of the story, the part where everyone on Earth is scrambling to figure out what to do. When is it the right time to release images that prove that Mark Watney survived? Oh wait, there's no choice because NASA is a government organization and they only have a 24-hour window before they're compelled to divulge the information. How do we figure out how to break it to the world that X is going on, that our plan is Y or that our solution to that thing that went wrong is Z? It's a maze of bureaucratic decisions, PR nightmares, stressed-out departments attempting to work in unison with punishingly tight deadlines... and all that while trying to coordinate actions with someone whose answers take 24 minutes to reach Earth.What had me gripped about \"The Martian\" is that this is a story that's filled to the brim with intelligence. Everyone has to think on his or her feet at all times. It's about making calculations to ensure that the trajectory of this shuttle will be just right so they don't have to expend too much fuel, or about doing the math to figure out exactly how long supplies can last. Our protagonist becomes a real Robinson Crusoe, using every little stray bit of plastic wrap or discarded piece of Earth technology to last that extra day. You're always sitting there wondering \"what are they going to come up with next?\" in the most excited way possible.This movie celebrates intelligence; it shows you the dangers of space travel and makes you feel unbridled terror as you realize the loathsome void that is the universe outside of Earth's atmosphere. It's a story where a piece of duct tape folding onto itself can mean death by suffocation. And it's also quite often very funny. The last thing I expected was to laugh out loud, but I did, and frequently too. You know how even in the worst situations you can find humor in things? Well that happens a lot here. It's because this film by Ridley Scott is a masterwork of character development and relationships. We have 14, yes that's right 14 characters prominently featured at one point or another, all of which have real life to them, personalities and real interacts between the other people their interact with. I was also impressed with the fact that we have major characters of different ethnicities present... and the fact that they are Chinese, Black or Latino in no way shape their characters. It's really is a world in itself because there's so much going on here, even when it's just two people talking via email or making a decision about something that's going to happen millions of kilometers away.\"The Martian\" is above all else, fun. It's thrilling, it's funny, it makes you think and it's all based on real science! I can't explain why or how, but I almost felt as if I wanted to be in Mark Watney's shoes, showing to the entire world how ingenious I could be by pooling together every last bit of relevant information and surviving on a distant world. I'd be dead in a few hours but that's the great thing about movies, they allow you to live vicariously through these fantasies brought to life. I almost forgot to mention that this is a great looking movie, one that shows off the beauty of a desolate world ruled by the solar system's largest volcano and populated by endless craters and canyons. Even if you're not a space travel enthusiast like myself, it's well worth your time. (3-D theatrical version on the big screen, October 20, 2015)",

There is an ok race and gender mix, with plenty of sharp wit, though the film doesn't follow through. Evidently Hollywood remains afflicted by the notion that \"diverse\" characters are there for contrast and light relief, and that the all-American, white boy and girl must be at centre. By the way, it is only a discredited, old, English law of empire that says you can colonize land merely by cultivating it; the imperialists applied this in order to seize vast amounts of land from native peoples, who hunted for food. Apart from the film's potted territorial ideas (p.i.), it crafts a fairly congenial hero concerned not with aggression, but with inventiveness - though he doesn't match MacGyver's quick sophistication.",

    "review": "  Listening to \"I Will Survive\" during the end credits, I almost gave this film a full five-star, almost. This film is almost perfect in every sense - a well-balanced script, tight directing and editing with excellent tempo, a superb cast of which every single actor/actress has his/her own chance to shine, and shone brightly they did indeed. This is maybe Ridley Scott's best action film that I have watched since \"Gladiator\" (the director-cut version of \"Kingdom of Heaven\" is rather a historical drama/epic) - extremely entertaining, surprisingly funny (and witty), and profoundly emotional. It is very very difficult to reach a balance between such different aspects of human feelings within one single film, even more difficult for a sci-fi action film, but Ridley Scott, finally, after numerous failures recently, was able to marvel such feat, the film feels so humanistic despite its futuristic setting and fast tempo (and definitely the best Chinese propaganda piece since it became to reach out to Hollywood with its limitless pocket). It is really unfair for this film not receiving five-star from me, given the fact that I did give \"Gravity\" five stars, and \"The Martian\" seems to be superior in most aspects. Except one, the depth of the story and character development. The film was so well done that most of the audience, in my opinion, will forget that there is almost no character development in the film, its characters stay mostly the same during the course of the film, despite the fact that this type of near-death experience will definitely have transformation impact on human's characteristics. Having an all-nice cast is not a bad idea (I have longed for films with all-nice cast, so that I can have some time to relax with films, rather than scratching my head not knowing what I am watching). But giving their \"niceness\" only one dimension without further difference is a little bit disappointing, such potential characters totally deserve a bigger playground. Of course an action film can also excel by being \"Mad Max: Fury Road\", but the emptiness of the universe really need some colours for the characters other than the colour of nicety. Still, this film deserves all the praises it has got so far, and watching this film in IMAX 3D will be another unforgettable experience for me (after \"Gravity\", which has simpler plot but better cinematography).",

Obviously, the most praise are for Matt Damon (Mark Watney) for his connection with the character. \"The Martian\" have a excellent interpretations (Matt Damon - Jessica Chastain - Kristen Wiig), good scene sequences and the accurate and precise manner to show us a NASA story (Ares III).The soundtrack was very particular (Disco Music) but worked perfectly.The Special effects are a masterpiece of new technologies and give us a majestic 3D and 2D. In summary Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation won the lottery with \"The Martian\". \"The Martian\" is one of the best movies of the year because is absorbent, unique, intuitively perfect, in a nutshell 'Excellent'. \"The Martian\" had, have and will have everything to be a Hollywood masterpiece. \"The Martian never be erased from their minds\"",
