    "review": "  A newbie soldier sent to Dublin during The Troubles gets separated from his unit while in hostile territory and must make his way back or die. What's interesting is the tension between those simply trying to survive versus the ruthlessness of policy makers. The movie fan me kept waiting for the soldier to be more proactive, ala John Wayne, and was constantly disappointed. And the ending is too predictable.",

    "review": "  A remarkable and compelling tale of a British soldier left behind rebel lines in a 1970's Northern Ireland rife with corruption and treason. The impact of the violence and extremist views on future generations is artfully and smartly played out making \"'71\" an effective message flick. Good costumes, sets and very good, engrossing acting by up-and-comer Jack O'Connell make this period film well worth watching.",

    "review": "  Instead of being stationed in West Germany in 1971 as he previously was informed, Private Gary Hook(Jack O'Connell) and his squadron are instead sent to Belfast due to rising tensions. Their first assignment from Lt. Armitage(Sam Reid) is to assist in rounding up some suspects but without riot gear. That almost instantly goes horribly wrong as Gary is left behind to fend for himself while another soldier lies dead.Not only is '71a riveting and harrowing tale of survival in what could be thought of as hell on earth and not just for a lone English soldier but also those living there, caught in the crossfire, but it also proves that sometimes the simplest approach is the best, even when approaching complex issues while also having the confidence not to attempt to resolve everything. Overall, the movie serves as a master class in dispensing a great deal of information in the smallest amount of time, as a wide variety of characters are fully formed, allowing for many varied points of view. Some of whom directly intersect Gary; others incidental. They may seem like little stories on the surface, but that does not mean they are any less important.",

    "review": "  The title refers to the year 1971, the year that Gary Hook (Jack O'Connell), a private in the British army, funds himself alone on the streets of Belfast. That predicament makes him a sitting duck for the warring forces of Catholic nationalists, already embroiled in their own internal conflicts with the notorious IRA and other insurgents, and Protestant loyalists.Basically, Gary is in deep shit. '71, a barcing, hard-charging debut from TV director Yann Demange, makes sure we feel every wincing, violent moment with Gary, the threat of death lurking around every corner. Director Paul Greengrass brought documentary-like immediacy in his telling of the Troubles in 2002's Bloody Sunday, but Demange's film, starring an outstanding O'Connell, is seeking to make the personal more political. It can be a bit much, but why harp on an ambitious film that provides so many knockout moments? You don't.",

    "review": "  A British soldier gets isolated from his unit in a street battle in Northern Ireland, and spends a harrowing night evading the murderous thugs determined to kill him. Although it is a thriller about one ordinary man caught up in the maelstrom, it also heart-breakingly shows how the cycle of violence and the shifting loyalties among the factions of \"The Troubles\" brought misery and terror to the people of Belfast, and how traditional military training ill-prepared young soldiers to handle hostile civilians and mobs. I wished for more of this soldier's home story (I wasn't sure if the boy he left behind was his little brother or a son), but it was enough to make us care about him. I had a hard time figuring out who the plains-clothes soldiers were (intelligence officers?) and their role, but perhaps that was the point - the soldiers didn't really know what they were up to, either; and once they found out, they were powerless to make a bad situation any better.",

It is a \"confused situation\" to be sure, and we are privy not only to the soldier's experiences but also the backroom conversations of members of the IRA and the Ulster Rifles. Our soldier (Jack O'Connell) becomes a bloody pawn in the political machinations of the times. And those times are very nicely recreated with cars, outfits, hairstyles, furniture and wallpaper. In some ways, what we have here is the inverse of Carol Reed's Odd Man Out (1947) which saw injured IRA man James Mason passing the night (and from life to death) on the run from the law/Brits also in Northern Ireland. Similarly, we meet an array of characters and situations as O'Connell moves from location to location in and around the Catholic tenement flats but the focus in '71 is less on creating a parable and more on gritty pulse-pounding action done well.",

    "review": "  A claustrophobic, violent and straight-forward action-thriller, '71 is a true story of a British soldier left behind the enemy lines in Belfast during one of the darkest moments of the British-Northern Ireland conflict. A classic story and a concept of \"behind enemy lines\" the movie differs from other similar deliveries by the fact that it remains relative true to the actual events and that is successfully depicts the different nuances of times of \"The Troubles\".The story takes places in Belfast on a single night, when Gary Hook (Jack O'Connell) is left behind by his unit. Injured, disoriented and without a clue who is on his side or who wants to kill him, he needs to survive a night in which everyone is searching for him. Confusing, less focused on the character than one would like to see, Yann Demange's movie is as messy as the events that took place on that particular night in 1971. While this is a negative for the '71, it could also be perceived as the charm of it. Grim, violent and minimalistic, the movie remains a true exploration of a young man's desperate attempts to stay alive, of a society deeply divided by its religion and national identity and of \"hidden war\" that has cost the lives of many.Despite its action-thriller appeal, '71 is certainly not a mainstream delivery which would be enjoyed by Hollywood fans. It is a dark, art-house story of a soldier's hopeless nightmare happening in a place where time has stopped and he is left out of friends.",

    "review": "  Jack O'Connell is going to have a good career. I didn't see \"Unbroken,\" but it certainly introduced him into the mainstream. Now, with \"'71,\" O'Connell delivers a blistering performance that demonstrates how easily he can carry a film. \"'71\" is a seat-gripper- you really have no idea what's going to happen as a British solider is accidentally abandoned in Belfast during \"the Troubles,\" which saw extreme violence between the English and Irish over religion. O'Connell brings an immensely humanity to his character, as he struggles to survive off the reluctant kindness of some Irishmen. The entire cast helps tie the story together, with love, bloodshed, and a lack of trust that makes this thriller easily one of the strongest this year.",

Now he must try to stay alive and make it back to his barracks. Knowing who his friends are and who his enemies are turns out to be quite difficult...Riveting drama. All through the movie the soldier's life hangs in the balance. Behind every corner could be a foe. And just when he thinks he's safe...Good plot. Not perfect though. Some segues aren't entirely consistent and occasionally things happen more for effect than solid plot development. While the situation in Northern Ireland is seen from the eyes of a British soldier, the movie is reasonably balanced. The British are far from perfect...Good performance in the lead role from Jack O'Connell. Good support from Sean Harris.",

You'd think this movie about the IRA/British conflict will take a side on who's right but it does a great job showing both sides with an equal brush. Once it gets to the 2nd half it's where it really shines. Maybe because it takes place in the 70s, but It had a French Connection feel to it too. Overall, it's pretty damn good.",

    "review": "  Featuring a performance by Richard Dormer and critically acclaimed for its action and drama, '71 sounded like a brilliant and exhilarating film.No matter how many films I've seen, I still find myself without sufficient knowledge on the Northern Ireland conflicts known as \"The Troubles\", and with every film I piece it together more and more. But as '71 is a largely low budget production, it does not aim to reach the sufficient scale to explain everything in fine detail. But I wouldn't have expected it to. Instead, the story cuts out the need for context and pulls it back to being a small scale thriller focused on the harsh subject matter that is violence without being a conventional action movie.Hollywood has told so many war stories throughout history with various perspectives and degrees of success. The thing that makes '71 stand out is that it is a British film produced on a low budget and focused more on the experiences of a single character than how many people he can kill. And though '71 is a film without the best extent of context, it becomes dramatically powerful fast because of how it forces the viewers to confront violence really early on. Most war films have a tendency to take a black and white approach to whose side the audience must take, but '71 shows excessive violence on both sides of the conflict which leaves viewers struck by unsuspecting intensity. '71 breaks down the commonly glamourized concept of violence to depict it as it truly is and point out that there are no winners in war, only victims. The violence in '71 is not excessive, but its dramatic effect is so powerful that viewers are going to want to run from it rather than wait for it to come. This adds an unexpected level of dramatic depth to the film, and it becomes expanded upon in the narrative very well because all the characters are essentially either perpetrators of violence or people on the run from it. This puts them in a neutral position where the importance lies not around who they are, but rather the fact that they are human beings who do not deserve to be victimized by crimes of violence. That reminds us what war is really about, human beings and the violence they suffer at the hands of both sides. Frankly, the use of violence in '71 is a brilliant piece of its subject matter which fuels the film with a powerfully intense atmosphere, serving largely as a distraction for the fact that the narrative is intentionally a simple one. I will admit that since the violence is the most powerful theme in '71, by contrast the scenes without it have a tendency to drag on. But even then, the dialogue in those scenes remains consistently fierce. Still, it does not have the same level of effect that the competently structured action scenes in the film do. The action is gritty and violent to match the demands of the subject matter with a slight touch of blood to it, but it is most importantly realistic and far from glamourous.But since the story is simple, after the climactic presentation of violence at the start of the story, viewers are likely to adapt to the mood of the film. This means that for the rest of the feature, the violence does not have the same level of striking effect. The atmosphere remains intense, but it is not as shocking for the rest of the film and does not fill in the narrative as much as it did at first. Because of this, the general movement of the story in '71 slows down and makes the simplicity of much of the narrative seem a lot more clear. There is a general feeling of inconsistent pace in '71 because it starts out fast, then slows down before mediating between those two sporadically until the end of the film. Ultimately, what begins as a story about a soldier caught behind enemy lines progressively drops in scale and ends up feeling like a crime thriller above anything.But there is no denying the technical competence of the production. As '71 does not have much music to it, the sounds are predominantly composed of silence, gunshots, echoes, footsteps and rain. This adds realism to the experience, making the general feeling of it all grim, particularly in the action scenes. Like I said, the action in the film is strong, and this is partially because the cinematography is consistently atmospheric over the entire film, zeroing in on the focus of the story with close-ups and appropriately steady shaky-cam at times, all edited at a quick but smooth rate. And it captures a notable colour scheme in the process. Due to the clever use of lighting, the grim scenery of the film is monochromatic yet easily comprehensive while benefiting from a moderated use of shadow. There is a general sense of sepia in '71 which gives the film an older feel to reflect the time of its story context.And although the genuine characterization in '71 is inconsistent, every cast member in '71 is dedicated to bringing the intensity of the atmosphere to the attention of audiences. The standouts are Jack O'Connell and Richard Dormer.Jack O' Connell is a strong casting decision for the lead in '71. Known for playing angry and troubled youths, Jack O'Connell steps up to a much more mature role in '71 where his youthful nature is changed into a sense of young innocence that becomes shattered by the violence he faces in the film. His emotional tension is due to the fact that he is constantly shaking or darting his gaze around at the slightest hint of noise, and his innocence shatters early on in the film before he develops into a desensitized soldier on the run. Jack O'Connell doesn't have to say much for his role even though his line delivery is powerful simply because his physical effort carries him the entire way through, and his everyman nature makes him an easily sympathetic protagonist.Also, after seeing Richard Dormer's amazingly charismatic and hilarious performance as Terri Hooley is Good Vibrations, it is an incredible chage of pace to see him in a dramatic role which is so fierce in nature. Richard Dormer keeps most of the intense power in his role deep inside, making it clearly an internalized effort. And matching the atmosphere of the film, Richard Dormer is consistently tense on a physical level with swift movements as a reaction to the aggressive world around him, and his cold stare of fear makes his status all too clear on a consistent basis. Richard Dormer proves his worth to the cast of '71 excellently.So '71 has a powerful cast and is rich with atmospheric tension thanks to its exploration of violence, but the story can prove rather simplistic and inconsistent with pacing.",

    "review": "  Even though there's very little character establishment or exposition, '71 succeeds because it puts you right in the center of the action. The film doesn't take sides on the war, understanding that both sides face the burden of circumstance and that no life is more valuable than another simply because it's on one side of a battle. By not delving into the politics around the war, the film focuses on the value of humans, not what they're fighting for. Yann Demange's direction keeps the film thrilling and gritty, but the director is not only concerned with crafting a mere thriller. He is concerned with the emotional aspect of war as well. As Private Hook runs around the war divided city, there's a purposeful sense of urgency and confusion. Hook didn't do anything wrong to get there and those who are chasing him are not in the wrong either. We root for Hook because we want him to survive, but as the film goes on we begin to sympathize for those threatening our protagonist's life. MINOR SPOILER: ////// In one incredible moment of the film, Hook has no choice but to kill someone to save his own life. The way that the two look at each other as Hook kills him speaks volumes. \\\\\\\\\\\\By the end of the film, we have witnessed the chaos of war. There's an endless confusion and lack of humanity, and to consider the value of human life is tragically futile in the face of war. To a fault, the film masks itself as a thriller more than I think it really is. It's emotional in bursts that color the entire film with their power, but I wish it was a bit more consistent. Still, the film gets at the humanity and truth of war as well as the best war films.",

This film is based on British soldiers and their ordeal in Ireland in 1971. Gary (Jack O'Connell) is basically caught behind enemy lines and is trying to get back to his barracks.This movie is brilliant. I'm not usually the biggest fan of war movies, which is what I expected when I started watching this, but boy was I wrong. This film really did feel more like a gangster film, like The Warriors (1979); it was gritty, dark and thrilling. For the most part of this movie I could not take my eyes off the screen. You honestly feel worried for the main character and you never know what's around the next corner. Jack O'Connell is brilliant, as is the direction of this movie. It shows you what Ireland was really like at that time and makes this film so powerful and real. I give this movie a 4/5 a must see!",

    "review": "  During the 1960's through the 1990's, an ethno-nationalist conflict known as, the Troubles, took place in Northern Ireland. Many of Ireland's residents there consider it to be a war. This film deals directly with this conflict. \"'71\" is directed by Yann Demange and stars Jack O'Connell, Richard Dormer, Sean Harris, Sam Reid, Charlie Murphy, Paul Anderson, and Paul Popplewell.Th film follows a young inexperienced British soldier, named Gary Hook (O'Connell). He finds himself in a extremely dangerous situation, when he gets trapped behind enemy lines. As he seeks shelter, several IRA members attempt to hunt him down. Chased all over the city, Gary must find shelter, before he gets himself killed.First of all, there isn't too much dialogue in this film. It's very quiet at times. However, Jack O'Connell's performance is outstanding. His performance is incredibly intense. As a character, he isn't too deep or well written. However, he doesn't need to be. Basically, he is a witness into the horror of the the Troubles during 1971. It was a brutal conflict, and this character is the audiences eyes into this horrific event.Yann Demange does a fantastic job in the directors chair. The movie is directed with precision and intensity. The film was shot by cinematographer Tat Radcliffe-who is unknown to me-and his camera work here is astounding. Weather it be beautiful steady shots, or intense handheld shots, the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. It really added to the tension of this film having the handheld cam. During street chases and riot scenes, the hand held cam works very well.71-movieThis is a very thrilling film. It is also a very violent one. As far as the action goes, it was incredible. It doesn't glorify the Troubles-as it could easily have done so-but rather it shows how horrible the conflict was. There is allot of tension throughout the entire movie. While watching it you feel like your actually there. You fear for the main character and you feel his paranoia. There is a constant feeling of growing tension and fear, and it works perfectly. The action is brutal, not to mention tragic. It isn't entertaining. I don't want to give it that impression. It just really well made. Perhaps \"action\" isn't the correct word to use.\"72\" is a brutal, tension filled, and well made film. It takes it's subject matter very seriously, never glorifying the real life events. The central performance from O'Connell is superb, the cinematography is stunning, and it's a gripping film from start to finish. One of the best films so far of 2015.",

Doesn't take sides and lets you make your own mind up about everything. Shows the horror of what went on then. But very very violent - not excessively because it stays true to real life, but very very violent. A MUST WATCH (unless your squeamish or easily offended)!",

    "review": "  One of the best British film productions of the year, along with Pride, and the biopics of Turner, Turing and Hawking. I watched this film in London Film Festival 2014 where it had a very good reception.The intense action-packed narrative follows a British soldier's behind-enemy-lines entrapment over a single night during the riots at Belfast in 71. With breathtaking action sequences and thrilling moments in the deadly streets of Belfast, the film did a very good job in conveying the sense of isolation; being on the run for most of the film time with continuous sheer intensity. However, I had the feeling afterwards that the film could have reached greater heights with more depth for the side stories and supporting characters, one of which was the Irish doctor who saves the soldier's life at some point. A bit of that and more background information could have turned it into an classic that lingered in the minds long after leaving the theatre, and possibly made some of the audience reconsider their stances on what's happening around them.A compelling performance from the leading actor Jack O'Connell deserves praise, as well as the editing of the action sequences. A film that is definitely worth watching for fans of the genre and those interested in the history of civil conflicts, and a promising debut feature film for its director Yann Demange.",

Not too many Old Geezers Who Go To The Matinee Alone, just very large Marge and Sullen Husband and lady in the incredible electric wheelchair; however she seems to buy a single ticket and then go to as many movies as she can before they catch her. No big names in this and that really helps the authenticity. Jack O'Connell plays the young soldier who is the focus of the movie. It is about what is probably the dumbest 'war' in history; the Irish fighting the Irish and the English. No one then or now can explain why people committed these atrocities against each other because one side was the 'wrong' kind of Christian. The film makers avoid any judgements here; all three sides are depicted in the worst light. Not an easy movie to watch, but well worth your time and money.",

The set-up, with an English solider abandoned alone in IRA-run Belfast, conveys the claustrophobia of civil war far better than most efforts. The big problem is the production design's commitment to historically authentic blandness. To be fair, it's easy to see why the protagonist's army uniform can be overlooked so easily when everything within sight is roughly the colour of manure, but the same beige-ness means the near absence of visual cues to assist with recognition when the story gets complicated. The kind of frustrating effort that's alright, but should have been better.",

The fact the soldier has little understanding of the conflict or the various factions, reflecting the reality of what very few UK citizens understood at the time or, for that matter, to this very day. The work itself carefully constructs the complexities of the factors involved in the subject matter into an easy to grasp chase thriller (with some scenes bordering on horror in feel). The filming, utilising both digital and film cameras, has an interesting effect on the general feel, that, coupled with some tremendous acting by all the cast but especially Jack O'Connell, makes for an excellent piece of work.

    "review": "  Tracking a young British soldier who fights for his life after being stranded by his unit on the vicious streets of Belfast, this 1971-set thriller is as grubby, tense and frenetic as the Northern Ireland conflict itself. Debutant Yann Demange does a sterling job in the director's chair, bringing a Paul Greengrass-esque urgency to the action with a combination of regular close-up shots and (not-too-shaky) handheld camera work. Demange wisely opts for a quality over quantity approach to the brutal violence too, resulting in a few impactful events of savagery and gore that enhance the tension and dread rather than exploit it. Occurring over one night only, Demange - working from Gregory Burke's sparing, taut script - wrings suspense from moments as small as an uncomfortable conversation in a bar, and as big as a cat-and-mouse set piece in an apartment complex or the dazed aftermath of an explosion. It's not all smooth sailing though. The relatively unexplained bookending scenes are a tad cheesy and add little, whilst the bulk of the supporting characters are rarely more than stereotypes, albeit played with gusto. But this movie unmistakably belongs to lead actor, and recent BAFTA Rising Star winner, Jack O'Connell. His Private Gary Hook is resilient yet fragile, strong-willed yet frightened, making him a relatable everyman who will do anything to stay alive. It's not a film you could call \"fun\", but it's a riveting watch that rewards those willing to be immersed in its gritty and uncompromising survival story.",

But I disagree that '71 is a great movie, its a good one at best.First time director Yann Demange is not well versed in directing the action scenes, so the shaky cam is very amateurish and cheapens the film. This is really sad, because the movie has an intriguing concept.First time screenwriter Gregory Burke has done two television movies and his debut movie is not as polished. Protagonist Gary Hook gets separated from his unit during a riot, and seemingly keeps getting deeper and deeper into trouble, sometimes too conveniently. In addition to this, the movie is less focused on the lost soldier and more on the other characters, mostly a trio of undercover men and the IRA who are after Gary.The result is a movie that isn't as thrilling or interesting as one might have hoped. Some of the plot contrivances are very obvious, and stay with you, not in a good way. Despite its accolades, '71 has great performances, but with a terrible title, an uninteresting plot, bad direction, all in my own humble opinion.",

That predicament makes him a sitting duck for the warring forces of Catholic nationalists, already embroiled in their own internal conflicts with the notorious IRA and other insurgents, and Protestant loyalists.Basically, Gary is in deep shit. '71, a barcing, hard-charging debut from TV director Yann Demange, makes sure we feel every wincing, violent moment with Gary, the threat of death lurking around every corner. Director Paul Greengrass brought documentary-like immediacy in his telling of the Troubles in 2002's Bloody Sunday, but Demange's film, starring an outstanding O'Connell, is seeking to make the personal more political. It can be a bit much, but why harp on an ambitious film that provides so many knockout moments? You don't.",

    "review": "  71 (A) Jack O'Connell the actor who starred in the movie Unbroken is the lead in this fantastic uncompromising unflinching look at the brutal violence in Belfast Northern Ireland in 1971. Jack plays Gary Hook who is a British soldier who is about to be transferred to Belfast. Gary has a younger brother who is at a home for children. He tells his younger brother what his superior officers have told him, \"Do not worry, at least you're not leaving the country.\" Nothing could be further from the truth. He actually might be better off going to another country. To understand the movie you have to understand some of the background. The Protestant citizens of Northern Ireland are basically at war with the Catholic citizens. The Catholics many of them members of the IRA (Irish Republican Army) hate the British soldiers who have an uneasy alliance with Protestant fighters. The IRA wants Northern Ireland to be independent from England. The movie quickly becomes exciting when British soldiers are brought into Belfast to find IRA weapons. You see a crowd of young Irish Catholics forming who start spitting, cursing, and throwing rocks at the British soldiers. Very similar to the current Israeli Palestinian conflict. Soon the situation quickly unravels into full scale violence. The British soldiers try to show restraint but soon a British soldier is shot by radical Irish teenagers. Gary starts to chase the IRA youth who has stolen a gun. Soon Gary (British soldier) is injured and separated from his troops in what is basically a war zone. There is a fantastic chase scene through the alleys of Belfast. This series of events leads to terrifying scenes of Gary fighting to survive.There are so many fantastic elements to this movie. Treating Gary's wounds without any painkillers. A good Irish family trying to do the right thing for Gary but being terrified as being identified as collaborators if they take him to a hospital. The younger more radical IRA members trying to kill him versus the older more reality minded IRA who are trying to save him because they fear a full scale British onslaught if the British soldier is killed. Now the Protestants are supposed to be helping the British but they also want to kill Gary because Gary has seen them make a bomb that has exploded. He can identify them. Meanwhile you have the British troops desperately trying to find Gary thinking that the Protestants will help them.If this all sounds complicated, it's meant to be. It's hard to tell one side from the other which is the point. The Protestants and the IRA hate each other. They supposedly have very different beliefs but the reality is they are incredibly alike. Both sides hate each other. They supposedly have very different beliefs but the reality is they are incredibly alike with regard for their deep hatred for the other. Both sides are willing to kill in the name of their extreme radical beliefs. They are two sides of the same coin who think they are different but if they looked carefully at the other, they would see their own reflection. Hatred for no good reason. Stuck in the middle is an innocent British soldier who doesn't even know if he's Catholic or Protestant. You assume that he went into the army because he grew up in some kind of home for orphans and that this is his way of escaping. The army is more a convenience for him rather than something that he's that dedicated to.There are all kinds of war movies. You have the ones that glorify violence with unrealistic scenes meant to entertain. Then you have great war films like American Sniper that show the horrible effects of war but have some commercial overtones or Hollywood in them. 71 is a terrifying totally realistic look at a warzone. Young children are just as dangerous as the adults. There is nothing contrived or commercial about this terrifying look at prejudice and hatred. A fantastic film but a must avoid for people upset by realistic war films that refuse to compromise or tone down reality. If this type of movie doesn't upset you then you should run to see it.",

Loyalties were consistently tested, no one could distinguish friend from foe and it was unclear who wanted what.

Within minutes I was hooked.I feel I must add I read many comments (mostly from individuals outside the UK) regards it's realism, painting \"good and bad\" and the supposed stereotyping. It might not be shot for shot accurate but to me on a personal level the sinister, gritty, grimey confusion sums up what it was like to live during a time when every day - for decades - would not go by without the death of a Protestant/Catholic/Unionist/Loyalist/Paramilitary/British Soldier/Policeman in Northen Ireland or later on the regular IRA bombings of British civilians on the mainland UK. It was a truly horrid time, and there was no glory or wrong or right side or argument to justify it. It is sad to see the Fox news esque re writing of history effecting peoples ability to judge this film. The scars are still felt across Northern Ireland and the UK even to this day.",

    "review": "  The young British soldier Gary Hook (Jack O'Connell) is accidentally abandoned by his unit following a terrifying riot on the streets of Belfast in 1971. Unable to tell friend from foe, the raw recruit must survive the night alone and find his way to safety through a disorienting, alien and deadly landscape...Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan called ?'?71 \"a tense thriller from Britain that so adroitly joins physical intensity, emotional authenticity and political acuity that you may find yourself forgetting to take a breath.\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times singled out Jack O'Connell for praise, saying, \"Mr. O'Connell runs away with ?'?71, in which his character's every emotional, psychological and physical hurdle makes for kinetic cinema.\" '?71 won Best Director at the 2014 British Independent Film Awards, after receiving nine nominations.'71 is powerful, intense, gripping, emotional and well crafted. You can feel the tension through the screen, smell the fire and gunpowder as the film shows atrocities from both sides of the conflict. The direction is fantastic from Yann Demange, this being his directorial film debut, for which he received the British Independent Film Award for Best Director. Well deserved in my eyes. Jack O'Connell is great as well in the leading role and he manages to portray everything that might go through you in such a difficult situation. The historic turn of events, the Troubles, which is the backdrop of the movie is truly tragic and a dark spot on Ireland. Belfast has been the capital of Northern Ireland since its establishment in 1921 following the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It had been the scene of various episodes of sectarian conflict between its Catholic and Protestant populations. These opposing groups in this conflict are now often termed republican and loyalist respectively, although they are also referred to as 'nationalist' and 'unionist'. The most recent example of this conflict was known as the Troubles - a civil conflict that raged from around 1969 to 1998. Belfast saw some of the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, particularly in the 1970s, with rival paramilitary groups formed on both sides. Bombing, assassination and street violence formed a backdrop to life throughout the Troubles. The Provisional IRA detonated 22 bombs within the confines of Belfast city centre in 1972, on what is known as \"Bloody Friday\", killing eleven people. Loyalist paramilitaries including the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) claimed that the killings they carried out were in retaliation for the IRA campaign. Most of their victims were Catholics with no links to the Provisional IRA. A particularly notorious group, based on the Shankill Road in the mid-1970s, became known as the Shankill Butchers. In all, over 1,600 people were killed in political violence in the city between 1969 and 2001. Sporadic violent events continued as of 2014, although not supported by the antagonists who reconciled in 1998.",

    "review": "  Instead of being stationed in West Germany in 1971 as he previously was informed, Private Gary Hook(Jack O'Connell) and his squadron are instead sent to Belfast due to rising tensions. Their first assignment from Lt. Armitage(Sam Reid) is to assist in rounding up some suspects but without riot gear. That almost instantly goes horribly wrong as Gary is left behind to fend for himself while another soldier lies dead.Not only is '71a riveting and harrowing tale of survival in what could be thought of as hell on earth and not just for a lone English soldier but also those living there, caught in the crossfire, but it also proves that sometimes the simplest approach is the best, even when approaching complex issues while also having the confidence not to attempt to resolve everything. Overall, the movie serves as a master class in dispensing a great deal of information in the smallest amount of time, as a wide variety of characters are fully formed, allowing for many varied points of view. Some of whom directly intersect Gary; others incidental. They may seem like little stories on the surface, but that does not mean they are any less important.",

    "review": "  '71 falls just short of being a truly great film. For the most part, it is a superbly constructed thriller, one that uses the backdrop of a fascinating moment in history as the launching point for a focused story about one man trying to survive behind proverbial enemy lines. There is a blistering intensity to much of the goings on, a visceral quality that drops the audience right into a vividly-drawn portrait of what must have been a nerve-wracking, scary time for the U.K. and Northern Ireland, in particular. The cinematography gives the movie the look of a seventies-era film; indeed, there's very little to indicate that it was produced at any time other than the period in which the story is set (save, perhaps, for the effective musical score, which reminds one more of the 1980s, if anything). Jack O'Connell is very good in the lead role (between this film and UNBROKEN, the last year was pretty grueling for his characters), but the character is also the source of the movie's biggest issue; the character as written is kind of a blank slate; some lip-service is paid to his home life, but he's almost entirely a reactive character. I admire the intention (not bothering with deep character development gives the movie a more lean and mean feel), but the audience is asked to invest in him mostly because of his frightening plight rather than anything particularly compelling about the character himself. That said, the movie is still a tense and effective ride.",

    "review": "  4 out of 5 stars. An impressive debut by British filmmaker, Yann Demange, who has already been hired to direct the next Brad Pitt film. \"'71\" is set in Belfast, Northern Ireland, during the political turmoil of British occupancy and is about a young British soldier accidentally left behind by his unit after a Catholic neighborhood riot breaks out. He is hunted down by IRA members, citizens who get involved and undercover British military officers who have complex motives of their own. The film never panders to the audience, who must keep guessing who is on what side, while the all night pursuit results in violence, bombings & increasing mayhem. Jack O'Connell is on the verge of international stardom with \"Starred Up,\" \"Unbroken\" and now this film in just a year. He's excellent as the hero trying to save his life during an increasingly faster and frightening all night chase. Filmed in Northern England due to sensitivities still lingering in Ireland, this is a breathtaking and exciting film worth seeking out. Be warned that the extreme violence may too much for some audiences, but for most, this complex thriller, set against a real political backdrop, will be worth the intense experience. Winner of several international awards including Best Feature Film and 4 out of 8 Independent British film nominations this year. Check it out in this season of much less interesting films.",

Maybe of its uninteresting plot. Though this guy, the protagonist, was a soldier, accidentally abandoned by his unit following the riot happening in Belfast 71. Till such, he was chased by a number of civilians and make his way through survival. The only part I was interested in, where he was chased, the bombing scene and the last part of the film. That's it. I thought this was more of a \"sleeper thriller\" that should have been better. It's okay, I like the 70's look of this film. Just a one time watch. 3/5",

    "review": "  This film follows a British soldier who gets left behind in Belfast and has to survive the night whilst being hunted down by the enemy. '71 had some moments of intense action, thrilling suspense and plenty of emotion, meaning it had something in it for everyone. When i heard it was another war film, i instantly got an image of what i thought it was going to be but to my surprise it was very different from your average war film. In some ways better and in some worse. The best parts of this movie were when it was focusing on your main protagonist played by Jack O'Connell and showing the different emotions he was going through. You really get o see how certain experiences damaged or changed him and forced him to find ways to survive. This powerful performance is why i liked the first half of this movie more than the second, after the soldier gets lost in Belfast i felt that the film focused a little too much on the secondary characters. They just weren't as well developed and interesting to keep me invested. The second half although did have some intense edge-of-seat moments that helped me get through it. The main downside of this film is that the plot really wasn't all that interesting, it tries to engage you by setting up multiple characters, some of which have ulterior motives but none of them except for a young boy were that interesting. There was some shaky cam in this movie also that at some times was effective but at other times felt a little annoying and unnecessary.This film was a little bit of a disappointment for me after hearing so many good things about it. Despite the let down with the plot the performance by Jack O'Connell will still get you through the movie just enough to be able to enjoy it. - 6",

    "review": "  Despite Hook being up front and center in '71, the narrative is one that chooses to focus more on the situation that he is dragged into, rather than one which focuses on his character at an intrinsic level. As the coveted person of interest for both the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the British Army's Military Reaction Force (MRF), Hook's presence in Belfast - separated and alone - forces not only the hand of Captain Sandy Browning (Sean Harris) of the MRF, but that of the opportunistic Quinn (Killian Scott) and his motley crew of would-be IRA terrorists, as both attempt to secure and/or kill Hook.Delivered with a barrage of thick, at times incomprehensible mixture of British and Irish accents, '71 has director Yann Demange and screenwriter Gregory Burke impeccably capturing the highly volatile situation in Belfast, as the aforementioned in turn causes the narrative to be largely hit-or-miss, as it does little to expand on the violent ethno-nationalist Northern Ireland conflicts, especially for those who have little to no knowledge on the almost thirty years of violence. Despite being lopsided towards those familiar with history - or that of Northern Ireland's -, '71 at the very least incites within the lesser informed audience a calling to look up 'the Troubles' out of the curiosity that the movie sparks, and fails to be self-contained in a sense due to it.But '71 delivers outstandingly on its thematic connotations that has to be dug deep to be relished, particularly the \"Us vs. Them\" social mentality, which Demange nails across early on in the movie in an exchange where Hook replies \"I don't know...\" when presented with a question on whether he was a Protestant or a Catholic. This deeply embedded and subtle theme is one that Burke continues highlighting throughout the night as Gary Hook fights for survival in an environment where everyone in the conflict seems to be at odds against each other for a spectrum of at times contrived reasons, with characters such as the conflict between Provisional IRA senior Boyle (David Wilmot) with the younger IRA members, or the top-down organizational problems that Hook's CO, Lt. Armitage finds himself in with the MRF captain, Sandy Browning.As composer David Holmes supplements Demange's intense direction with a tense score, one is left with a craving for a heavier story, or at the very least, having the character of Hook expanded even slightly, as O'Connell is largely underutilized despite how well he performs in scenes that demand his presence. Billed as a historical action film, '71 seems to lean towards being an action thriller set within a historical context, even with there being very little action to go around. Though to its credit and with what little action it has, the movie succeeds with its action delivery, particularly a rather long, visceral chase on foot that nails the beginning of Hook's desperation to survive, and the desperation of his pursuers to capture him.",

The murky and gritty visuals are matched by the support cast (especially David Wilmot & Sean Harris) as a done-to-death man behind enemy lines plot is churned out.I say churned as, although there are decent moments of suspense and action, it's nothing new and any tension quickly fizzles out, due largely for the fact that we're not really given much reason to care about any of the characters. Casual viewers certainly won't care about the convoluted details of the socio-political situation in Belfast during this period of The Troubles, no matter how hard the plotting tries!The two elements, the political aspect and the straight tense drama, eventually hinder one another to the point where we are left with neither a great depiction of either. There are fleeting moments of interest in both camps, but I quickly succumbed to boredom.I had heard good things and, although it started with power and intrigue, it soon ran out of steam toward the end.",

Set in 1971 in Belfast, the film focuses on an inexperienced British soldier who becomes separated from his platoon during the chaos of a riot, and is left to fend for himself in a strange and frightening environment. The film captures the terror and brutality of war, as members on both sides willingly relinquish their humanity while others struggle to retain it. There's one particularly memorable scene that I won't soon forget, focusing on a shocking and unexpected bombing, and its protracted, bloody aftermath. Demange's camera lingers on the devastation, as the ugly reality sinks in both for his characters and his audience, and it is one of the most memorably chilling images I've seen in cinema this year. This is a film of raw visceral energy with a keen eye for sensation and emotional insight, and it is a spectacular achievement for independent filmmaking.",

    "review": "  Set against the complex backdrop of the beginnings of Northern Ireland in 1971 this is an extremely well made thriller. Sent into the front-line urban warfare, Hook's regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Armitage (Sam Reid) is quickly bombarded with a small public outrage. Then quickly followed by one of the most realistic, violent and dramatic riots that has ever appeared in film. The story of a young soldier Gary Hook recently deployed to Northern Ireland who finds himself out of his dept when going on his first patrol thanks to the incompetence of his CO (Sam Reid) & soon separated from his unit and lost in a city he doesn't know he's forced in a fight for survival as a lone-wolf in the devilish-toned IRA hostile territory as its hard to tell who is friend and who is foe in this extremely well written piece of drama. All quickly intensifies to an incredible Bourne-style chase through the streets of terror; what with the cars alight at each corner, crisp cinematography - everything feels authentic. The plot was not confined to the story of a lone soldier lost in a strange and hostile city, but luckily went a few steps further by bringing up the topic of good versus bad and who to trust if someone is offering to help. You never knew which side someone is on, and whether there is a hidden agenda or not, in spite of showing interest in your well being and offering to help you out of a situation you can impossibly cope up with. The main action takes place among the dim streets & the dull creepy looking concrete blocks of 'social' housing, all washed with rain and lit by the eerie glow of neon street-lights. The writer here has taken care not to paint one side entirely good or bad and that is how it was. Wounded and armed with nothing but a knife Hook has enemies closing in from all sides as the film draws to a bloody climax. The camera-work is also quite brilliant; for example, as Hook staggers and stumbles through the streets the camera staggers and stumbles with him, carrying us right into the action. Everything combines to yield an absolutely convincing depiction of human lives reduced to something 'nasty, brutish and short'. Led by Jack O'Connell (Starred Up, 300 Rise of An Empire), his performance is uncanny & relate able. Co-starring alongside, Sean Harris and Paul Anderson play undercover superiors, yet are as corrupt as Bad Lieutenant. It's also the feature debut of Yann Demange who handles the material, while paying homage to Paul Greengrass. He has crafted the thriller elements superbly in such a way, the audience is forced to indulge the proceedings taking place. On the whole the best thing about '71 is on point as everything is there for a reason, and it shows on screen & Jack O'Connell prospers and carries the film even when it is unneeded and secures it as one of this year's best shocking, gripping and captivating thrillers. #71 #JackOConnell #YannDemange #SeventyOne",

    "review": "  Set in Belfast just before the troubles intensified. Most of the British army's newest recruits are thrown into the deep end and sent to Ireland to ease the tension. Unprepared for urban conflict they lose control of a situation involving an angry crowd of protesters and Jack O' Connell gets lost amongst enemy lines in West Belfast.Yann Demange does a great job at making the story as neutral as possible and serves up a quality anti-war film. From, the build up banter with the soldiers comparing the city to various cities across the U.K. and friendly banter with the local piss throwing youth to the first riot when they truly realize that they really are in over their heads and the inevitable game of cat and mouse with the PIRA. Burke's script also touches on the many realities of the troubles. Collusion, the fued between the officials and the Provos, the fear in nationalist communities of the PIRA and the hatred between both the Catholic and Protestant communities. A quality cast in the always excellent Sean Harris, David Wilmot, Paul Anderson, Sam Reid and in particular Jack O'Connell. The film is best summed up by Richard Dormer's character \"War is just rich cunts, ordering thick cunts to kill poor cunts\". A fantastic film.",

    "review": "  A gripping and visceral thriller and a confident debut from the director while Jack O'Connell proves himself to be a star/actor to watch out for in the future after the equally captivating Starred Up earlier the year. And he is pretty easy on the eyes too. The script sometimes feels like it is trying a little too hard to be politically correct but overall, manages to achieve that delicate balance between the factions. It is only until the last 15 mins or so that the so far effective and realistic thriller unravels a little and tips into sentimentality. Escape From Belfast, if you like, with additional historical and political context.",

    "review": "  I found the plot tedious and like the main character, it limped from one scene to another. The scenes just after the explosion on the Shankhill were contrived. We got the message after about five seconds that the soldier was in shock, deaf and confused. It seemed to go on forever. The best acting I thought came from the young Loyalist lad who was killed in the explosion. As for the captain in charge of the sneaky beaky squad, from personal experience I have never met a serving officer who spoke with a broad accent, with the exception of all the officers portrayed by Sean Bean in Sharpe's Rifles. The ending was weak and just seemed to fizzle out. This film could have been much better.",

    "review": "  Tense, tense, tense! This film throws you right into the heart of the turmoil of living in Belfast in the 1970s. It opens your eyes in an unbelievable way, so that you turn every corner and hide down every alley along with this young green soldier. Not knowing who is friend and who is foe, which are hostile lands and which are not, you have to grit your teeth, and hope along with Hook. It is hard to imagine how it felt living in Belfast during these troubled times, but this film gets you as close to imagining as possible. Gritty, tense often savage, but above all humbling and highly credible. Another film that may fall under the radar for many this year, but will no doubt become a highly rated British classic over time.",

Paints a grim picture that war is hell; doesn't matter who you are, what side you're on, or how old you are. In war, there is no sides, no winners...just death. Well acted. 7.5/10",
