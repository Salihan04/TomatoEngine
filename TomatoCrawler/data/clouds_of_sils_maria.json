    "review": "  On her way to honor a playwright who gave Maria Enders(Juliette Binoche) her first big break, she learns through her dutiful personal assistant Valentine(Kristen Stewart) that he has died suddenly. Still, the show must go on, even as the tone has changed radically. So, while Maria does her best to avoid a fellow actor she loathes, she also learns of a proposed new version of the same play with Maria playing the older character this time around.At first, I very much enjoyed the interplay between Kristen Stewart and Juliette Binoche which makes up a large chunk of \"Clouds of Sils Maria.\" But at the end, as I stood up from the art house theatre where I saw this, I began to realize how preachy the entire movie had been. Just because I agree with how unfairly certain young actresses like Kristen Stewart(see also: Heigl, Katherine) are treated by the media did not make me feel any better. And then there is the shrill way that writer-director Olivier Assayas goes after superhero movies which is ironic considering it looks like he has not seen a science fiction movie since about 1979.",

    "review": "  ALL ABOUT ALEVE - My Review of CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA (4 Stars)Writer/Director Olivier Assayas, whose work on CARLOS I greatly admired, has returned with the quiet, meditative CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA. Featuring a trio of fantastic performances by Juliette Binoche, Kristen Stewart, and Chloe Grace Moretz, this backstage showbiz drama takes on issues such as aging, identity, relevancy, honesty, feminism, agism, and the inevitability of change. Think of it as a modern day ALL ABOUT EVE, but with headier concerns.The hushed tones of the film are not for everybody and are highly reminiscent of the late Eric Rohmer's work. Very talky and complex, with overt themes spelled out in nearly every conversation, the film tells the story of Maria Enders (Binoche), who accepts a part in a play revival which made her a star decades earlier. Now, however, she's been cast to play the older character, with her original role going to a Lindsay Lohan-esque actress Jo-Ann Ellis (Moretz). For the bulk of the film, Maria holes up in the chalet of the late writer to better absorb the part and rehearse with her incredibly competent personal assistant, Valentine (Stewart). Soon the lines get blurred between reality and the play they're picking apart, whose subject and circumstances seem to mirror what's right in front of them. The chalet is in the shadow of a Swiss Alpine weather phenomenon called the Maloja Snake, which also is the name of the play Binoche is in. Essentially a rolling fog/cloud formation that works its way through a mountain pass, the metaphor of its mystery and reliability to charge ahead will not be lost on the viewers of this film. That's because the script goes to great lengths to make sure you get it. Regardless, this is is a truly engaging film, but not without its flaws. Nearly every male role in the film is awkwardly performed and somewhat thankless. There is a very strange interlude in the film in which Valentine takes a road trip that defines ambiguity and will lead to after-movie discussions. Same goes for a late-in-the-movie scene with Binoche and Stewart; the less said the better. Trust me, you'll be talking about it. Sometimes the dialogue is highly stilted, yet our two leads always find a way to ground it in reality with their considerable chemistry. Stewart won the Cesar Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first American actress to ever win France's equivalent to the Oscars, and it's easy to see why. Stewart is assured, complicated, and so entirely present in her scenes. She and Binoche work up such a lovely rapport, prickly one moment and affectionate the next. It's by no means a showy role, bereft of that big scene actors chew on in order to win statuettes. Instead, Stewart is focused, presenting a highly accurate depiction of the assistant's life. This isn't a wisecracking Thelma Ritter performance. Valentine must be a jack of all trades, as proficient in rehearsing as she is in making travel plans, and Stewart invests herself so completely in this role. With her performance here and in STILL ALICE (and let's not forget she's done stellar work before in PANIC ROOM, INTO THE WILD, and ADVENTURELAND), she may just yet succeed in making me forget the TWILIGHT SAGA. Binoche has always been great. I look back on an incredible career with her star-making turn in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING and subsequent stellar performances (ok, we can pretend GODZILLA never happened!), and see that the role of Maria is a meta-critique of her own experiences. Everything that Maria experiences clearly has a counterpart in Binoche's own life, and her brave, tough-as-nails portrayal is a career highlight.Moretz doesn't appear until very late in the film, but she leaves her mark as a character with impressive duality. One moment, she's the strung out starlet we're used to seeing stumbling panty-free out of limos on TMZ, and the next she's lucid, highly articulate,and pulled together. There's either scenes of scary ambition in her squinting eyes or no doubt a half bottle of Visine in others, and it begs the question, \"Which one is the real Jo-Ann?\" The fun of this role is finding out the answer, and her final scene with Binoche is a knockout. Yorick Le Saux's cinematography is simple yet effective, but the real technical star here is Production Designer Fran�ois-Renaud Labarthe, whose stage set for the play-within-the-movie alone is something he needs to put in his highlight reel for the remainder of his career. Contrasting so sharply with the nature photography that comes before it, the set is a jaw-dropping, highly imaginative realization of a modern office. If only the stage musical to 9 TO 5 had Labarthe on their team!Again, this isn't a film for those who need action, loud soundtracks, or explanations. It's small, haunting charms, however, will resonate with moviegoers who have grown tired of the BOOM BOOM POW.",

Another thing is how great Kristen Stewart is in this movie. With solid performances recently in Still Alice & Camp X-ray, she is really surprising a lot of people. I think she has always been capable of this, but the Twilight movies kind of sent her off track for awhile. Hope to see more good things from her in the future. Binoche & Stewart are just so much fun to watch together on screen. Clouds of Sils Maria is very much worth seeing.",

I find it a little funny for that Kristen Stewart seems to be getting so much buzz and praise for her performance, neither her character or performance is all that good or memorable. I don't mean to say she's bad, just merely competent. That's where I find the humor: finally Kristen Stewart gives a competent performance, and it blows people away to see her give an average performance after years of having less emotional range than a block of wood.",

    "review": "  I'm always fascinated when a film's subject is film itself. The actors conflicts, fame, the making a play, show business in general. In \"Cloud Sils Maria\" is a French movie by director Oliveier Assayas, about an actress Maria Enders (Julliete Binoche) and her relationship with her loyal American Assistant Valentine (Kristen Stewart) At the beginning of the movie Maria and Valentine are traveling by train to Zurich for an event to honor a famous writer Wilhelm Melchoir who gave Maria her first opportunity in the industry, playing a young role in Maloha Snake. Maria received the news that Melchoir passed away, but the event will happen as plan. During the event a theater director approached Maria to play a role again in the play Maloja Snake, but this time the older character, Maria decided to spent the following months in Wilhelm Melchoir house in the mountain to prepare for the role, the house name Sils Maria\"Cloud Sils Maria\" is a deep exploration of fame in the film industry as well the theater circuit. The film divided by chapters present a conflict, young vs old, from Mari to Valentine, they argue on how important celebrities are portrait themselves in the media to be relevant. This is when Jo-Ann Ellis (Chlo� Grace Moretz) appears, which is the new younger antagonist she is a reflection of Maria at her younger years as an actress. Maria is famous but is not relevant as Jo-Ann is. The film is powerful, with great performances and a very unusual structure that makes the audience question the reality of the characters and their actual presence on film.",

    "review": "  Imagine Bergman directing All About Eve and that should give you a general idea of Clouds of Sils Maria, which is a terrific film spiced with wit and acid, and a penetrating look into the female psyche, a running theme for director Olivier Assayas, who gave Juliette Bnnoche her first starring role as a young actress in 1985's Rendez-vous. Assayas is again collaborating with Oscar-winner Binoche, where she plays a 40-something film actress seeing coveted roles slip out of her reach because of her age.Binoche is simply award-caliber in the role. Trouble begins when Maria is offered a part in the stage adaptation of Maloja Snake, the film that launched her career 20 years earlier. Maria is no longer the hot young thing since she is being asked to play the part of the middle-aged assistant with an erotic fixation for her young boss.It's Val (Kristen Stewart), Maria's personal assistant, who encourages her boss to accept the part. Val also encourages Maria to take a closer look at Jo-Ann Ellis (a wonderful Chloe Grace Moretz), the new Hollywood It girl who is tapped to play the role that made Maria famous. In a stingingly funny scene, Maria looks on as Jo-Ann stars in a cheesy sci-fi epic and ponders what business this teen starlet has acting.Watching art and life collide so tantalizingly is a kick. Stewart knows form what she's playing, even as the lowly assistant. Stewart's role is a challenging one, and she meets every one of those challenges with sharp eyes and timing. She nails the role, so it's no wonder her sensational performance earned her a Cesar award, the French Oscar that before Stewart, was never awarded to an American actress.Stewart and Binoche mixing it up onscreen as Val and Maria engage in power games to prep Maria for a role she fears, whether running lines or comparing high lives in a chalet in the Swiss Alps, where they get to see the actual Maloja Snake, a meteorological phenomenon that happens when clouds move between mountains in the form of a serpent. No need to get too hung up on the metaphors, just dive into the pleasures of seeing two dynamo actresses go toe to toe, as well as the beautiful artwork Assayas has made of them as he puts the things that define womanhood under the knife.",

    "review": "  There is something within the craftsmanship of an artist, notably one of an actor or actress, to view and understand the strokes of their skill, to witness the progression of their journey as they either come into grips or further alienate in the roles they commit, to penetrate the facade built upon the voyeuristic perspectives of the roaming and hunting members of the tabloids, shedding light that allows for its in-lookers to share empathy.Olivier Assayas distances Clouds of Sils Maria's perspective from grand satire, its heart remains with the protagonists in focus; an established actress, Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche) returning to the stage production that stimulated and stamped her career, the foundations that has brought to where she is now, now embarking on the role that was once opposite her, now the woman of perceived success, emotionally and psychologically turmoiled by the entrance of a younger woman into her life, a role embodied by the up and coming Jo-Ann Ellis (Chloe Grace Moretz).This play becomes the catalyst of its reflective mirrors, it reveals the truth in Maria's current state, her place in the modern world, exposing the difficulties in her ability to reach acceptance, dwelling upon denial as she clings on to her pride and vanity as it slowly decays to fragility, pulsating in quiet tension as we anticipate the delivery of her prognosis. Primarily it travels in the preparatory and enduring phases of Maria's transformation, viewing her trials as she is aided by the contrasting presence of her personal assistance, Valentine, played by the dense but fitting Kristen Stewart. Assayas refuses to assemble his film with a calculated agenda, he willingly ensures indulgence in favouring the natural justifications of his characters, to encapsulate its viewers with a steady and unforeseeable pace, unshakeable in its grasps, compelled by the exchanges of its seemingly banal scenes.Upon every moment, it reveals something critical of its characters, it highlights the spiritual connection between the performers and the roles they embark, cohering Valentine into the studied material, a conflicting perspective to Maria's, highlighting shades and natural forces that was once blinded from or ambiguous in their form, inching us in closer to the souls of these characters. It is in the prideful blindness of Maria and its radiating toxicity towards a once firmly healthy relationship, dissolving the joys and tolerance that was present underneath. Furthermore, my fascination persists as such ideas and emotions are dwelled upon moments of insightful observations in the craftsmanship of their profession, to incorporate the principles and tropes of modern show business, a satire that never deviates from its purpose.Clouds of Sils Maria is aware of its significance in the cast that it has assembled, it shines on them and equally demands of them, providing its viewers with portrayals that deprives itself of extreme theatricality, planting its roots on more identifiable foundations, a reflection these characters are indeed, leaving us in awe in the process. Binoche delivers an assured performance, a role that more or less fits, never reaching a state of self-awareness as for example the casting of Michael Keaton in Birdman; she conveys extensively upon moments of subtlety, refusing to expand on them in simple exposition, a growth that is plausible from its start to end.Kristen Stewart further dampens such elements of theatricality, relying on the more stoic aura that is commonly associated with her performances, but utilised here with efficiency, delivering moments of shared thoughts or clarity that never intrudes on our plausibility, to avoid the tendencies to preach, with our attentions instead locked in the reactive banter in her chemistry with Binoche. Chloe Grace Moretz, despite embodying a role of great relevance to its greater themes, evidently reveals herself in a role micro-size to he point of almost invisibility, simpler in its construction and far less demanding in the actress delivery, Moretz relying on her true stature as art begin to imitate life. Much more could have been fleshed out from such a character, especially one as malevolent.There is much to be desired in the calming nature of Clouds of Sils Maria, it leaves enough gaps for our own thoughts to fill, it exposes its characters that never ceases to fascinate, it is anchored by magnificent performances and resonant themes that becomes further invigorating upon retrospect or subsequent visit. Does it earn the compliment of perfection or pure excellence? Probably not, but it certainly comes close.",

I started feeling almost like the assistant (Kristen Stewart) had a secret agenda when she was trying to persuade Maria (Juliette Binoche) to take the new role in the play. It also felt like Maria (Juliette) was actually becoming the character Helena who she was asked to portray in the play. It may just be me but I kept feeling like Kristen Stewart was up to something. I'm also surprised at how naive Maria's character was after having been in the business for so many years.",

Another thing is how great Kristen Stewart is in this movie. With solid performances recently in Still Alice & Camp X-ray, she is really surprising a lot of people. I think she has always been capable of this, but the Twilight movies kind of sent her off track for awhile. Hope to see more good things from her in the future. Binoche & Stewart are just so much fun to watch together on screen. Clouds of Sils Maria is very much worth seeing.",

All the performances are exceptional, but the scene-stealer here is Kristen Stewart. Valentine is by far Stewart's best role to this day, and she handles the drama and comedy with wit and quiet elegance. Clouds of Sils Maria is intelligent, powerfully acted, and undeniably beautiful to look at, but I must say the twist involving Stewart's character does not work quite well. The movie is still great and Binoche is terrific, but not sure how I feel about the \"twist\".",

    "review": "  The only good part in this film was the last 15 minutes. They wasted the first 80% of it on the rambling insecurities of Binoche's character while she prepares for the role in her play, and Kristen Stewarts performance FINALLY warmed up halfway through. Then, in the last 15 minutes, they decide to actually move forward with the plot and introduce the New Sigrid to the Old Sigrid. It would've been a much more interesting film if they had expanded this portion, rather than using the relationship between Binoche and Stewart as a metaphor for Sigrid and Helena. The pervasive product placement of iPhone and facebook and youtube throughout the movie are surprisingly even more frequent and obnoxious than Stewart's attempts to sound and appear 'natural.'",

    "review": "  \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" was one of the last films I was lucky enough to see in the arts theatre district of Washington DC, but damn was it a way to go out. Films with meta-commentary on the film or acting industry are among my favorite films, and \"Clouds\" delivers wholeheartedly. Starring Juliette Binoche as an actress passing her peak and Kristen Stewart as her personal assistant, \"Clouds\" shows how difficult life can be not only for an actress, but for an aging actress. Binoche's Maria Enders has been asked to appear in the same film that created her career, but this time as the older woman that played her opposite in the first film. Jo-Ann Ellis (played exquisitely by Chloe Grace Moretz), an up-and-coming but troubled young actress, has been cast in her original role. Throughout the film, Enders must come face to face with her age and the new role she has been tasked with playing- and it all falls apart around her as she realizes how ill-equipped she is to deal with age. The scenes in which Binoche and Stewart confront each other are pure gold: Stewart proves once again that she is one of the best actresses of her generation. \"Clouds\" is certainly one of the best dramas of the spring season- I doubt it will get awards attention this year, but for any fan of film meta-commentaries, this isn't one to miss.",

    "review": "  Excellent film- I missed this in theatres and saw it on Amazon. As usual JB is superb, both JB & KS gave great performances as did everyone. There is so much going on in this drama about multiple relationships, youth and maturity- between Valentine and Maria, as well as the characters in the play, as well as journeys of self exploration. One thing which stuck out in my mind was how unhappy and lonely they all seemed a lot of the time, in spite of their supposed successes, affairs and clammering for the spotlight and so on and how the only thing that seemed to matter was either the media perception and or their own perception of their careers and the takes on the roles/characters/dramas etc. I didn't see strength in CSM's character Joanna or in her version of Sigrid. She seemed to be a heartless, superficial, uncaring person who would step over anyone and anything to get to the top. Maria & Valentine seemed to be the opposite in many ways.",

I find it a little funny for that Kristen Stewart seems to be getting so much buzz and praise for her performance, neither her character or performance is all that good or memorable. I don't mean to say she's bad, just merely competent. That's where I find the humor: finally Kristen Stewart gives a competent performance, and it blows people away to see her give an average performance after years of having less emotional range than a block of wood.",

    "review": "  It's slow, but it pays off thematically with thought provoking ideas about generational transitions. To a slight fault, the dialogue carries these ideas more than emotion or events do, which is why the film feels slow. I like when you can feel the message of a movie as well as understand it intellectually, and this is certainly a more intellectually driven film, but it's a very good one.The natural performances are excellent in their restrain from each actor. Kristin Wiig and Juliette Binoche play off of each other very well in disputes about the meaning of the play Binoche is preparing for, their interpretations varying in which generation they belong to. When the two read the script, the themes of which clearly reflects their lives, it can be difficult to tell if they are reading a script or just having a conversation, all to great effect. Chloe Grace Moretz's presence later on perks up the film in a welcome way. If you want something thought provoking, this is a highly reccomendable watch. Don't watch this movie if you are looking for something entertaining.",

    "review": "  I'm no literata (ai?) but it looks to me as if the play within this film--and in the end the film itself-- depicts Maria as a pathetic loser, manipulated by her costar and the play's director into playing the older woman character in the play that way--the way they set it up. That depiction was what Maria wanted to avoid at all costs, and the tension over whether it would turn out that way separated her from her young assistant, whom she seemed to love. Valentine the assistant, despite urging and talking Maria into doing the play, still said to her near the end of their discussions on it: \"youth is better than maturity--that's all there is to it\"--which belied her earlier statements that the role was not the loser stereotype typically foisted on older women characters. I think this male-directed film failed Juliette Binoche and older women in general by arriving at that tired old trope. I wouldn't recommend someone else see it, though the performances persuaded me to hope for better, more honest content till the very end. Age is not the end of worth for most women, but the beginning of wisdom. We learn perforce that looks and youth aren't what life's about: just a nugget but a start.. But maybe vanity and shallowness are the only values a male director can see in even the finest older women. For which we should pity him. And sigh that we still don't see the truth about older women in film but see it in each others' eyes.",

This is an exceptional display of his gifts -- and those of his leading actor, Juliette Binoche, and the supporting turn by Kristen Stewart. Stewart's performance is a true game-changer. She can display more than sullen or sulking! She matches the great Binoche at every turn. Most interesting is that their entire relationship is constantly encaging in a sort of \"role-play\" that evolves to a deeper level. And, the best sign of any film is when you hate to see it end.

In \"Cloud Sils Maria\" is a French movie by director Oliveier Assayas, about an actress Maria Enders (Julliete Binoche) and her relationship with her loyal American Assistant Valentine (Kristen Stewart) At the beginning of the movie Maria and Valentine are traveling by train to Zurich for an event to honor a famous writer Wilhelm Melchoir who gave Maria her first opportunity in the industry, playing a young role in Maloha Snake. Maria received the news that Melchoir passed away, but the event will happen as plan. During the event a theater director approached Maria to play a role again in the play Maloja Snake, but this time the older character, Maria decided to spent the following months in Wilhelm Melchoir house in the mountain to prepare for the role, the house name Sils Maria\"Cloud Sils Maria\" is a deep exploration of fame in the film industry as well the theater circuit. The film divided by chapters present a conflict, young vs old, from Mari to Valentine, they argue on how important celebrities are portrait themselves in the media to be relevant. This is when Jo-Ann Ellis (Chlo� Grace Moretz) appears, which is the new younger antagonist she is a reflection of Maria at her younger years as an actress. Maria is famous but is not relevant as Jo-Ann is. The film is powerful, with great performances and a very unusual structure that makes the audience question the reality of the characters and their actual presence on film.",

    "review": "  A former film critic, French writer-director Olivier Assayas is one of the best contemporary international filmmakers. His new movie, a sophisticated drama about actors, a loose, modern retelling of \"All About Eve,\" has some thematic similarities to Ingmar Bergman, but not as ponderous and more simply rhapsodic. Juliette Binoche is an aging actress accompanied by her assistant (Kristen Stewart) to the Swiss Alps to honor a director friend. After learning of his suicide, she is approached to act in a play, \"Maloja Snake,\" about a young girl who drives an older woman to suicide, which made her a star. Having played the young girl twenty years ago, she is now asked to play the older woman. Chloe Grace Moretz will now play the younger woman. Binoche is reluctant to play the part, and is confronted with her own aging. In read-throughs with her assistant, Assays merges fiction with reality so that the relationship between Binoche and Stewart blurs with the characters and comments on them. The three actresses are excellent. Binoche, always among the most daring of modern actresses, is extraordinary at expressing her character's egotism, vulnerability, insecurity, jealousy, and the unspoken amorous affection she feels for her assistant. Stewart has never been more natural and unself-conscious; she and Binoche have a beautiful equilibrium. Moretz shows great restraint and avoids caricature as a Lindsay Lohan-type, self-destructive star. Beautifully photographed on location in Switzerland by Yorick Le Saux.",

    "review": "  It's a movie about a young actress outshining her aging mentor, and the drama and frustration this creates in the older woman. I couldn't help but make the connection between the movie's plot and reality. A younger actress draws all the accolades and upstages her much more talented counterpart in a movie. It's basically a movie about itself. If you can get past Kristen Stewart's blank stares, there is actually some good material here.",

    "review": "  Clouds of Sils Maria is not a movie for anyone. Oliver Assayas has crafted a deeply rich and complex film that demands repetitive viewings, yet its density and heavy-handedness make it a special treat for some viewers only.The story, described in the briefest way possible, is about actress Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche) who became famous by playing a 20-year-old assistant who seduces her 40-year-old boss and then destroys her in a play called Maloja Snake. Twenty years later, the playwright responsible of her success has died, and Enders accepts to play the 40-year-old boss in the remake of the play against a Lindsay Lohan-esque actress called Jo-An Ellis (Chloe Grace Moretz). To prepare for her role, Enders goes to the deceased playwright's house in Sils Maria alongside her assistant Valentine (Kristen Stewart)The movie focuses on the conflicting relationship between Enders and Valentine, and it does through discussions these characters have about fame, acting, character studies and art interpretation. It's almost meta, because the movie is, basically, a character study about character studies. And what characters! In Enders and Valentine, Assayas has written two thoroughly complex and different characters, whose opinions are as thought-provoking as the movie's clear metaphors about aging and generational breaches. Binoche eats this role up. She is flawless as the aging actress, who is a bit of a stubborn jerk but also a bit of a genius. Stewart also nails her role as the actress' assistant, in a performance that suits her nuanced qualities (Kristen Stewart can act!). The dialogue, also, has a reflecting contemporary feel, that makes the movie only more interesting to watch inside out.Moretz does what she can with the character she is given, but the truth is that compared to the characters of Valentine and Anders, Jo-An Ellis is a clich�d stereotype that is very one-dimensional. Yeah, she is a brat, but can't there be more to it? In a movie that challenges the perception of artistic values, it sure seems like a conflicting puzzle piece. Also, as I said before, this movie is dense. It is divided in three acts: Act I, which is a great opening; Act II, the longest of the three, and the Epilogue, in which the movie closes with bittersweet perfection. Act II suffers from repetitiveness and exhaustion. It is still interesting, but it's a bit stretched and the pace slows down significantly.Assayas has done a beautiful movie, nonetheless. Binoche and Stewart have never shined so bright in a movie that takes the audience's brain for a strongly philosophical ride about life and art and the links between the two. It's more an admirable idea than an enjoyable movie, but the feat is nevertheless impressive.",

    "review": "  There comes a point in the life of a middle-aged actor when young self-confidence turns into wrinkled doubt. With the exception of the Meryls and the Daniels, a lack of relevance can mean roles suited to complement the likes of more exciting, recent actors - the fame captured earlier, perhaps by an Oscar or a culturally significant movie, can eventually mean nothing, as magazines get tired of your face and the public finds a new personality to live vicariously through.  Film doesn't touch on this issue very often - the actor generally needed for the philandering generally is a has-been themselves, thus unwilling to play the part - but the best examples, like Bette Davis' career shattering \"All About Eve\" or Gena Rowlands' underrated filmography peak \"Opening Night\", work so well because the actors playing actors going through a prolonged existential crisis seem to be putting a part of themselves into the role, whether they mean to or not. It can be difficult to admit that you're Bridget Fonda and not Jennifer Lawrence. Juliette Binoche, one of the greatest actresses of her generation, has never seemed to face career troubles in the way Joan Crawford did in her fifties, the way Ava Gardner did the second she turned forty. Binoche, if anything, has become more engaging of a presence as she ages, continuously drowning herself in challenging roles that only cement her status as a transcendent talent. Her films generally aren't blockbusters, but so respected she is among cinephiles and critics that she, no doubt, will live on as a legend (though she, in some ways, already is).  So \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" comes as a surprise in her career, not because the part isn't arduous but because the idea of Binoche emulating Bette Davis seems preposterous. Whereas Davis made a series of turkeys before hitting a high mark with \"All About Eve\", Binoche has never made a project, entertaining or not, that didn't earn her some sort of respect. But an actress doesn't need to be the part to play it with remarkable pathos, and Binoche, unsurprisingly, give one of the finest performances of her career. In \"Clouds of Sils Maria\", Binoche is Maria Enders, a French actress at the climax of her long, gigantically commendable career. She found her breakthrough twenty years earlier through her portrayal of Sigrid in \"Maloja Snake\": the role is so iconic in her career that it bears the same sort of luster S�verine gave to Catherine Deneuve in \"Belle De Jour\". The playwright behind both the screen and stage versions of \"Maloja Snake\" is Maria's Howard Hawks to her Lauren Bacall. If not for his early guidance, she would hardly be the woman she is today. So when news travels that the man has died, Maria finds herself crippled by self-doubt, her age and relevance suddenly revealing themselves to be more fragile than she ever knew they were. During a ceremony meant to pay tribute to the man, Maria is offered a part in a revival of \"Maloja Snake\". Only this time, she won't be playing Sigrid - she will be playing Helena, an older woman that Sigrid romances and ultimately drives to suicide. Maria is understandably reluctant (she doesn't want to ruin her cherished memories), but she accepts, realizing that she doesn't have much to lose. But as she goes through agonizing readings with her assistant (Kristen Stewart) and finds herself alarmed by the casting of a troubled young actress (Chlo� Grace Moretz) for the part of Sigrid, it becomes ever apparent that the play is beginning to reflect Maria's life more troublingly than she'd like to admit. As Maria slips through the cracks burdening the sidewalks of the real and the fake, \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" grows stronger, more tumultuously mysterious. A fascinating drama of clinking fa�ades, subtle insecurities, and confessionals, the film has all the makings of a juicy backstage drama, but Olivier Assayas, in a career highlight, chooses profound subtlety over soap operatic ticks. Dialogue covers the premises like a silk blanket draping a leather love seat, ever traveling, but details, minute or revelatory, flesh out the compelling slabs of character expos�s and make them thrillingly human. Reminiscent of the performances that adorned the films of John Cassavetes, the figures in \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" leave their innermost insecurities out for us to feast on. The dynamic between Binoche and Stewart is what makes \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" the masterpiece that it is - Assayas' writing provides them with immensely intelligent conversations to chew on, but such cerebral passages can only mean something when in the hands of performers delicate with their material and knowing of their abilities. Toward the beginning of the film, Binoche, short-haired and covered in Chanel, looks like the embodiment of glamour, the kind of star that covers \"Vogue\" and doesn't seem human or emotional in the process. Scenes later (when the film transitions into a more secluded setting), her hair shortens into something mannish, her makeup cleaned off, her clothing meant for comfort rather than looks. This transformation is fundamental in the believability of the film, as it strips away all distractions and really showing us how Maria (and possibly Binoche) feels inside - worn out, defenseless, melancholy.  Stewart, as Maria's assistant Val, never undergoes a conversion as jarring as Binoche. But the way she stays a grungy, enigmatic figurehead of Maria's faith makes her an intellectual counterpoint to the apprehension of her employer. As the relationship between Maria and Val begins to fog out the rest of the noise seen earlier in \"Clouds of Sils Maria\", the more potent the film becomes. In exquisite scenes set in the barren, titular region of Sils Maria, Maria rehearses for \"Maloja Snake\", she as Helena and Val as Sigrid. The sequences are so thoroughly convincing and so vague about when they're ending that we begin to question the reality of the situation - how much does Maria see in Helena, how much does Val see in Sigrid, and vice versa? \"Maloja Snake\"'s story is nearly parallel to that of Maria and Val. Though Maria doesn't quite see her assistant in the romantic way Helena fancies Sigrid, she depends on her. She has few friends, hardly interacts with the public, and isn't quite sure how to express herself outside of acting. With Val, an old soul more mature than her age would suggest, she is able to voice her hesitations loudly, without a filter. But it is suggested that Val isn't as fond of Maria as Maria is of her: she humors her through deep conversation, but how much of it does she consider to be a part of her job and how much of it is she actually invested in? The way Val remains an ambiguous figure throughout the film makes her all the more fascinating: when she disappears like Lea Massari in \"L'Avventura\" toward the conclusion, we can only speculate her existence. Stewart, who won the French equivalent of the Oscar, sledgehammers any questions regarding her acting talents. I've always found her to be a magnetic presence when without \"Twilight\" in her clutches, and films like \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" suggest an actress uninhibited and unafraid. One of the best films of the year, \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" further proves why Assayas and Binoche are incomparable talents of the silver screen while also giving Stewart a reason to flip off the haters that have marred her career for so long. While the film is understated, don't expect it to leave you any time soon. It is haunting, icy, and full of questions. It ain't \"Mulholland Dr.\", but it ain't \"All About Eve\" either. It's a classic in the making, a gem in the filmographies of all the talents involved.",

That would be the under utilized Chloe Grace Moretz who steals every scene she is in which unfortunately isn't enough. Instead, the world's worst actress Kristen Stewart hogs the story giving another excruciatingly flat and boring performance giving nothing for Juliette Binoche to work with. Binoche holds her own and schools Stewart constantly on how to give an actual performance with every scene. I couldn't even tell you a scene that would warrant her Cesar win last year. But Binoche and Moretz are worth your time with some really gorgeous shots of the mountains that are much more interesting to watch than Stewart's dull performance",

    "review": "  Olivier Assayas delivered the well-received TV mini-series Carlos and has worked as writer and director for some time. Clouds of Sils Maria is a crowning achievement sure to capture the attention of actors hungry for rich, complicated work and will surely give the French director more opportunities to work with A-list talent. Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche (The English Patient; Chocolat) plays Maria Enders, a famous, award-winning actress, forced to look back at her career by playing the role of the older woman in a play in which she previously starred as the young assistant who destroys her mentor. This forces her to come to terms which her own issues about relationships, aging, betrayal and jealousy. Two young women in her life become the focus of her growing anxiety over accepting the role. One is Valentine plays by Twilight's Kristen Stewart. Stewart has been much maligned - maybe deservedly so - for her angst-ridden role as the jittery Bella Swan in the successful vampire series. She lays all critics to rest here. Stewart is on fire as Valentine matching Binoche in every scene. She recently became the first American Actress to win a Cesar Award - the French Oscar equivalent - for this supporting role. Chloe Grace Moretz - best known for her role as Hit-Girl in the Kick-Ass films - plays Jo-Ann Ellis, a Lohan-style train wreck who stars in superhero movies and flashes her crotch for the paparazzi. Binoche is baffled by the success this enfant terrible has achieved in such short time and appalled at her immature, destructive behavior. Debuting in limited release this week after enjoying a successful festival run last year, Clouds of Sils Maria is likely to be forgotten by the end of the year when awards season opens. It should not be. Critics should rally around Binoche and Stewart for their remarkable work in this intriguing, masterfully constructed character study.",

So, while Maria does her best to avoid a fellow actor she loathes, she also learns of a proposed new version of the same play with Maria playing the older character this time around.At first, I very much enjoyed the interplay between Kristen Stewart and Juliette Binoche which makes up a large chunk of \"Clouds of Sils Maria.\" But at the end, as I stood up from the art house theatre where I saw this, I began to realize how preachy the entire movie had been. Just because I agree with how unfairly certain young actresses like Kristen Stewart(see also: Heigl, Katherine) are treated by the media did not make me feel any better. And then there is the shrill way that writer-director Olivier Assayas goes after superhero movies which is ironic considering it looks like he has not seen a science fiction movie since about 1979.",

Its centred around an actress in the peak of her career and asked to play a character that made her famous 20 years earlier. The film was too moody with alot of talking without making it interesting and I felt nothing for the characters or the story as it felt really rigid. Kristen Stewart however was really good in support just a shame that the movie wasnt great at all",

    "review": "  There must be some middle ground between the summer blockbuster blow'em-up sequels and the European borefests that my local movie theaters have been offering lately. This is one of those stories within a story that also follows a seeming trend that none of the characters should be likable. On top of all that none of the lines sound like anything humans would say. There was momentary relief whenever Binoche laughed or the travelogue views of tSwiss Alps brought the screen alive. I could imagine this as the first effort of a high school playwright in love with symbolism and fond of gimmickry but nothing more, sigh an abuse of my time.",

    "review": "  This is often shamelessly glacial in pace but this is never to its detriment; Anchored and perhaps reliant solely on the thunderous lead performances from veteran Binoche and an increasingly impressive renewed Kristen Stewart, bringing some of the most outstanding acting committed to film in recent memory. This won't be for everyone, that's for sure; in my screening, least three people walked about before the second half and those that remained were largely restless. For me, though, this was near-perfection: a fearlessly intelligent, assured and consistently challenging character study, full of depth, humanity and nuance, all finished off with flashes of insightful satire. In fact, this could be seen as an understated, female-fronted Birdman - equally exquisite cinema.",

    "review": "  Clouds of SIls Maria has been frequently called a Melodrama, which is fair, but I hope those who have done so don't mean to be derogatory, as it is also the best film of the year so far. Clouds of SIls Maria follows famous actress Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche) and her assistant Valentine (Kirsten Stewart), as Maria prepares to act in the play that began her career 20 years earlier in a new role, as an aging sad office manager rather than the charming young assistant she played 20 years before.  The film is like a play, in more than its content. It contains two parts and epilogue, which are further divided into scenes by fades to black that resemble a curtain opening and closing. Director Olivier Assayas uses the added structure to tame the film's winding narrative, which offers far more than most movies do. The whole thing seems true to life, as characters disappear never to reappear and things never quite feel wrapped up. When, I sat down to think about what the movie I actually saw was and what happened and what it was about. All I can think is that it is about almost everything a movie can be about from how we constantly caricature those around us based on our biases, about how are world view is limited by our experience and how states of being that are lost even when we don't think we lose them. All of that sounds abstract, but I don't want to give much away.  I can't help, but think about Milos Forman's Amadeus when I think about The Clouds of Sils Maria. I keep dwelling on the way that Mozart seems to will his own death by writing his funeral. Clouds of Sils Maria is equally about the way works of art overcome us and shape our lives rather than us shaping theirs, but in Assayas's film unlike Forman's the characters don't create the play. It is written for them.",

    "review": "  This is an artful item, with intricately woven dialogues, and layers of significance. It plays rather obscurely, like the clouds of the title, which are a winding and not altogether attractive theme, together with the formidable-looking, but dead playwright Wilhelm, whom we never get really to know. The landscape vistas seem forbidding; Switzerland feels claustrophobic. Binoche speaks mainly in English, and she seems self conscious, which renders her character sketchy. The problem eases later in the film, perhaps because her indistinct accent becomes more familiar to the ear. Pairing her with Stewart seems odd, because Stewart is all directness, self-possession and edge, and tends often to overshadow Binoche. Stewart's performance gives much interest to the film, but even this tends later to a monotone, at about the time that Binoche comes to the fore. The film is full of unease. It flirts vaguely with the idea that the play, for which Binoche's character is rehearsing, about two lesbians engaged in a power struggle, could be echoed in reality with Stewart's character. However, there is little such chemistry between the actresses. There is a mild critique of internet scandals and the paparazzi, and the callousness of youth focused on social media. To some extent, the film reveals the craft of acting. On the other hand, it also comes uncomfortably close to being a vanity piece for Binoche. In fact, its main attraction is voyeuristic - to see exclusive settings, clothes, cars and especially Binoche and Stewart, to compare the actresses, and perhaps to discuss, over the coffee you are waiting for, which of the two is your favourite performance.",

    "review": "  Like plays, books or paintings, films as an art form can be open to interpretation and be highly symbolic. Some moviegoers don't care for that type of cinematic experience, but for those with an open mind and an adventurous intellect, films that require a little imagination can be a rich experience that stimulates the mind and broadens the audience member's view of the world. \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" (R, 2:04) is such a film. Unfortunately, marketing a movie like this can be quite challenging. How do you get people interested in a movie which produces enjoyment on a more intellectual and less visual level? In this case, the filmmakers made a trailer full of scenes that actually reflect the drama of a story within the story. In other words, what you see in the trailer is not what's really happening in the movie's plot, at least, not in the literal sense. It's a little dishonest, but I understand it. While some moviegoers might consider a film like this boring, others might find fascinating, but portraying such a film's appeal, without guns, explosions or seduction (or revealing the film's secrets) in the trailer is next to impossible. So, in this review, I'm going to do what the trailer didn't do - tell you what this film is really about, but, I will refrain from doing something else the trailer didn't do - I won't spoil the film's big reveal, the moment that gives it its meaning.French actress Juliette Binoche, known to American audiences for her roles in 2014's \"Godzilla\", Steve Carrell's dramedy \"Dan in Real Life\" (2007), co-starring with Johnny Depp in \"Chocolat\" (2000) and her Oscar-winning role in \"The English Patient\" (1996), stars as Maria Enders, a French actress known to American audiences for roles in both art-house films and big-budget blockbusters. Yes, it's a bit of art imitating life, as with Michael Keaton's award-winning turn in 2014's Best Picture Oscar Winner \"Birdman, Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\". And, like that movie, this one takes a fascinating look behind the curtain at the world of theater and film and meditates on the meaning of getting older, while playing with the question of what's real and what is merely symbolic. As the story unfolds, we hear talk and see images of low hanging clouds which regularly snake through the Alps in the Maloja region of Switzerland near the village of the film's title.Maria is in Switzerland to accept a lifetime achievement award on behalf of an old friend, the playwright and director who gave her her big break in theater. Maria is traveling with Valentine (Kristen Stewart), her personal assistant, who convinces Maria to meet with a young director (Lars Eidinger) who wants to stage a revival of \"Maloja Snake\", that play that made Maria famous. The play is about a young woman named Sigrid, who seduces and manipulates an insecure older woman. Maria had played Sigrid to much acclaim at the beginning of her career, but now she is being asked to play the older woman. Maria struggles with this decision because of what it says about her age, but also because her interpretation of the play is that the older woman kills herself at the end - and the actress who played her in the film version died a year after the movie came out. As Maria runs her lines and debates the play's meaning with Valentine, she gets to know the talented, but troubled scandal magnet (Chlo� Grace Moretz) who has been cast as Sigrid. This film is more than a female version of \"Birdman\", but also has elements of the 1950 classic \"Sunset Boulevard\" and the French-British film \"Swimming Pool\" (2003).At one point in \"Clouds of Sils Maria\", Maria turns down the offer of a film role saying, \"it's too abstract for me,\" something that some moviegoers may feel about this film, although I hope not. Moviegoers more astute than I am will notice symbols and hidden messages throughout the film, but most will understand much more about what they've seen after the big reveal late in the story. And even then, much of the film is open to interpretation. As you're watching the story unfold and contemplating the meaning of it all, you'll enjoy outstanding acting from every member of the cast, especially the nuanced performance of Binoche, the emotional depth that Stewart brings to her character and the many-faceted realism from Moretz, an underappreciated young actress who seems to get better with each film. Those performances, along with the script and directing of Olivier Assayas, allow us to easily follow the action, but then to discover that the real joy of this film is thinking back on it after you've left the theater and assigning your own interpretations to what you've just experienced. \"A-\"",

    "review": "  Imagine Bergman directing All About Eve and that should give you a general idea of Clouds of Sils Maria, which is a terrific film spiced with wit and acid, and a penetrating look into the female psyche, a running theme for director Olivier Assayas, who gave Juliette Bnnoche her first starring role as a young actress in 1985's Rendez-vous. Assayas is again collaborating with Oscar-winner Binoche, where she plays a 40-something film actress seeing coveted roles slip out of her reach because of her age.Binoche is simply award-caliber in the role. Trouble begins when Maria is offered a part in the stage adaptation of Maloja Snake, the film that launched her career 20 years earlier. Maria is no longer the hot young thing since she is being asked to play the part of the middle-aged assistant with an erotic fixation for her young boss.It's Val (Kristen Stewart), Maria's personal assistant, who encourages her boss to accept the part. Val also encourages Maria to take a closer look at Jo-Ann Ellis (a wonderful Chloe Grace Moretz), the new Hollywood It girl who is tapped to play the role that made Maria famous. In a stingingly funny scene, Maria looks on as Jo-Ann stars in a cheesy sci-fi epic and ponders what business this teen starlet has acting.Watching art and life collide so tantalizingly is a kick. Stewart knows form what she's playing, even as the lowly assistant. Stewart's role is a challenging one, and she meets every one of those challenges with sharp eyes and timing. She nails the role, so it's no wonder her sensational performance earned her a Cesar award, the French Oscar that before Stewart, was never awarded to an American actress.Stewart and Binoche mixing it up onscreen as Val and Maria engage in power games to prep Maria for a role she fears, whether running lines or comparing high lives in a chalet in the Swiss Alps, where they get to see the actual Maloja Snake, a meteorological phenomenon that happens when clouds move between mountains in the form of a serpent. No need to get too hung up on the metaphors, just dive into the pleasures of seeing two dynamo actresses go toe to toe, as well as the beautiful artwork Assayas has made of them as he puts the things that define womanhood under the knife.",

The first half hour they are on the mobile on the train, or Kirsten is checking the ipad, looking this way and that and the viewer has to infer what it going on and by the seriousness of the in-talk we can tell it is serious and intense, but we don't feel it. This is pretentious Euroarthouse cinema at its best. The director wrote and made it (he said) for JB, but KS although playing accompaniment, is the centre of any frame she is in, visually speaking. AB looks like she is acting, which is say she is unconvincing even though she is playing herself basically. To look at the cinematography is awful, even unbearable, it looks like one of those youtube videos that if you expand too much looses sharpness. I don't know why that is So if the camera is on JB and KS is leaning in the door behind her, you can't see her detail, or any detail of the background. So when they are on a mountain looking at the view and the valley its just a digital fuzz. Its like being having bad eyesight to watch this film. There is no character development to speak of. We just have to believe these names being dropped at the beginning are meaningful and that JB has been hurt and such and such a bad guy but what the hell and all that. But it is all so self-conscious. If it was you tube (which is where it is destined) I wouldn't give it 5 minutes, however I left after about an hour and was glad to get out among real people where I could see clearly.

    "review": "  ALL ABOUT ALEVE - My Review of CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA (4 Stars)Writer/Director Olivier Assayas, whose work on CARLOS I greatly admired, has returned with the quiet, meditative CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA. Featuring a trio of fantastic performances by Juliette Binoche, Kristen Stewart, and Chloe Grace Moretz, this backstage showbiz drama takes on issues such as aging, identity, relevancy, honesty, feminism, agism, and the inevitability of change. Think of it as a modern day ALL ABOUT EVE, but with headier concerns.The hushed tones of the film are not for everybody and are highly reminiscent of the late Eric Rohmer's work. Very talky and complex, with overt themes spelled out in nearly every conversation, the film tells the story of Maria Enders (Binoche), who accepts a part in a play revival which made her a star decades earlier. Now, however, she's been cast to play the older character, with her original role going to a Lindsay Lohan-esque actress Jo-Ann Ellis (Moretz). For the bulk of the film, Maria holes up in the chalet of the late writer to better absorb the part and rehearse with her incredibly competent personal assistant, Valentine (Stewart). Soon the lines get blurred between reality and the play they're picking apart, whose subject and circumstances seem to mirror what's right in front of them. The chalet is in the shadow of a Swiss Alpine weather phenomenon called the Maloja Snake, which also is the name of the play Binoche is in. Essentially a rolling fog/cloud formation that works its way through a mountain pass, the metaphor of its mystery and reliability to charge ahead will not be lost on the viewers of this film. That's because the script goes to great lengths to make sure you get it. Regardless, this is is a truly engaging film, but not without its flaws. Nearly every male role in the film is awkwardly performed and somewhat thankless. There is a very strange interlude in the film in which Valentine takes a road trip that defines ambiguity and will lead to after-movie discussions. Same goes for a late-in-the-movie scene with Binoche and Stewart; the less said the better. Trust me, you'll be talking about it. Sometimes the dialogue is highly stilted, yet our two leads always find a way to ground it in reality with their considerable chemistry. Stewart won the Cesar Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first American actress to ever win France's equivalent to the Oscars, and it's easy to see why. Stewart is assured, complicated, and so entirely present in her scenes. She and Binoche work up such a lovely rapport, prickly one moment and affectionate the next. It's by no means a showy role, bereft of that big scene actors chew on in order to win statuettes. Instead, Stewart is focused, presenting a highly accurate depiction of the assistant's life. This isn't a wisecracking Thelma Ritter performance. Valentine must be a jack of all trades, as proficient in rehearsing as she is in making travel plans, and Stewart invests herself so completely in this role. With her performance here and in STILL ALICE (and let's not forget she's done stellar work before in PANIC ROOM, INTO THE WILD, and ADVENTURELAND), she may just yet succeed in making me forget the TWILIGHT SAGA. Binoche has always been great. I look back on an incredible career with her star-making turn in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING and subsequent stellar performances (ok, we can pretend GODZILLA never happened!), and see that the role of Maria is a meta-critique of her own experiences. Everything that Maria experiences clearly has a counterpart in Binoche's own life, and her brave, tough-as-nails portrayal is a career highlight.Moretz doesn't appear until very late in the film, but she leaves her mark as a character with impressive duality. One moment, she's the strung out starlet we're used to seeing stumbling panty-free out of limos on TMZ, and the next she's lucid, highly articulate,and pulled together. There's either scenes of scary ambition in her squinting eyes or no doubt a half bottle of Visine in others, and it begs the question, \"Which one is the real Jo-Ann?\" The fun of this role is finding out the answer, and her final scene with Binoche is a knockout. Yorick Le Saux's cinematography is simple yet effective, but the real technical star here is Production Designer Fran�ois-Renaud Labarthe, whose stage set for the play-within-the-movie alone is something he needs to put in his highlight reel for the remainder of his career. Contrasting so sharply with the nature photography that comes before it, the set is a jaw-dropping, highly imaginative realization of a modern office. If only the stage musical to 9 TO 5 had Labarthe on their team!Again, this isn't a film for those who need action, loud soundtracks, or explanations. It's small, haunting charms, however, will resonate with moviegoers who have grown tired of the BOOM BOOM POW.",

    "review": "  Not so long ago, when Kristen Stewart was still turning in listless performances in the unbearable \"Twilight\" saga, it would have been very hard to imagine her winning a C�sar (the French Oscar) - or any acting award, other than a Razzie - but win one she did,, playing Valentine, personal assistant to Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche, last seen bringing much needed quality to the opening of last year's \"Godzilla\"), star of stage and screen. It is well deserved. I have not always appreciated the films of Olivier Assayas - his well-regarded \"Clean,\" a movie about overcoming addiction, was particularly off-putting - but I have always admired the ambition of his intentions and his refusal to stay trapped in any one genre. Whether working in period melodrama (\"Les destin�es\"), stylish neo-noir (\"Demonlover\") or television biopics (his absolutely terrific \"Carlos\"), Assayas constantly tests the boundaries of visual storytelling. And now, in \"Clouds of Sils Maria,\" with the help of Stewart and Binoche - both at the top of their game - he gives us a profound meditation on time, memory and art.The movie opens with Valentine and Maria traveling, by train, to Zurich, where Maria is due to accept an award at a tribute to Wilhelm Melchior, the man who, 20 years earlier, launched her career by casting her in the starring role of his play \"Maloja Snake\" (the title refers to a cloud-based weather phenomenon in the Engadine valley of the Southeastern Swiss Alps), and later in the movie adaptation, which he also directed. Before they arrive at their destination, however, Wilhelm dies, of an apparent heart attack, and so the tribute turns into a memorial service. In Zurich, a young theater director, Klaus, approaches Maria about acting in a new version of \"Maloja Snake,\" but with a twist. The play has two female leads: Sigrid and Helena. Helena is the older woman who hires the much younger Sigrid as her personal assistant, falls in love with her, and then commits suicide when Sigrid abandons her to move on to greener pastures. Maria originated the part of Sigrid, but now Klaus wants her to play Helena, and claims that Wilhelm, at the time of his death, had been working on a sequel to his original play in which Sigrid eventually became Helena. Initially repulsed by the idea, Maria - who we see otherwise being asked to star in Hollywood CGI blockbusters - eventually comes around, and the bulk of the film centers on her rehearsing for the new production, with Valentine doubling for Sigrid as they read lines.Doubling. That's a big leitmotif here. As Maria and Valentine rehearse the new production, art and life intersect as the intensity of their own relationship begins to mirror that within the play. Life imitates art. Art also imitates life, as Stewart plays a character looking, outside in, at the world of movie stars, including not only Binoche, but also Chlo� Grace Moretz (\"If I Stay\"), who plays Jo-Ann Ellis, the Hollywood ing�nue set to star as Sigrid in the new stage show. Jo-Ann's blockbuster movies, as well as her relationship scandals, mirror those of the real-life Stewart. Not only do the boundaries of art and life collide, but the film often seems to suggest that life means nothing to these people unless it is framed by art and artifice: we see them on their iPads and other devices, and even when Maria and Valentine sit in front of majestic alpine views, all they can talk about is the play. The first time we see the actual \"maloja snake\" phenomenon, it is through a 1924 silent documentary by Arnold Fanck, a copy of which Wilhelm owned and watched repeatedly. Life means so much more when artistically composed.Time and memory are also major themes. Past and present converge as Valentine and Maria hike the mountains of Sils Maria - they are staying in Wilhelm's house, which his widow has vacated to allow them to perhaps feel his spirit as they rehearse - walking paths, both literal and metaphorical, that Maria once trod as a younger woman. We're never sure how much of Maria's feelings for Valentine - mostly platonic - come from her own experience playing Sigrid; from her new relationship, as Helena, to the text; or from the actual dynamic of boss to employee, friend to friend. It doesn't matter. What does matter are the constant echoes of time past, present and future (and we're in the Alps, so there are literal echoes, as well). Stewart, as the repository of all of this projection, holds her own against Binoche, and then some. She still has those awkward gangly movements that made her such an unlikely love interest for vampires in the \"Twilight\" films, but here, combined with the burning intelligence of her eyes, that awkwardness serves to showcase a young woman on the verge of finding (and asserting) herself. In another universe, she might have even been Maria, taking a different path.And speaking of other universes and recurring time, Sils Maria just happens to be where Friedrich Nietzsche came up with his seminal idea of the eternal recurrence (is it just a coincidence that Maria Enders takes her first name from here?), which adds yet another layer of meaning to deconstruct. It's an extraordinarily rich film, a meta-text ripe for analysis. I highly recommend.",

    "review": "  I saw Olivier Assayas' CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA twice in order to fully absorb the breadth of this complicated, though seemingly simple, story of a forty something actress Maria Enders (a radiant Juliette Binoche) who is asked to be in a revival of a theatrical production titled Majola Snake that made her famous twenty years earlier when she played the ingenue Sigrid, filled with the confidence and callousness of youth who seduces her boss Helena, an older woman; their subsequent love \"affair\" incinerates the very ground that Helena stands on propelling her to suicide. The twist here is that a new director is asking Enders, a now celebrated actress to perform the part of the mature woman devastated by desire. Generational differences extrude into every aspect of Maria's world - physical and psychological boundaries become blurred and the fictional script blends into reality, past memories and present relationships. This is a film about film as well as life. Does a great actor lose oneself utterly in a part? What happens when you take on another persona and grope to come up for air to retrieve the you that you once were?We sense the power of Sils Maria a hauntingly exquisite municipality in the Swiss Alps, where the actress and her young assistant Valentine (Kristen Stewart who masterfully holds her own in every scene with Binoche) go to rehearse to prepare for the upcoming play in a house cradled in the snowy valleys of the majestic mountains which belonged to Maria's beloved mentor, the playwright William Melchoir, who dies unexpectedly at the beginning of the film, literally setting the stage for the ensuing drama. Against this breathtaking backdrop the individual is subsumed by the beauty of the surroundings; the upcoming stage production, Majola Snake, refers to the clouds which slowly wind through the valleys blanketing the view with a blindingly beautiful soft white mist - foreshadowing the fog and confusion of the two women who are wrestling with a dialogue which gets unhinged from the pages of the script and infiltrates their precarious realities.Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart's interactions both fuse and clash as their role-playing illuminates each one's frailties and strengths. From the onset of the movie we see what an efficient and capable personal assistant the lanky, beautiful, two-cellphones-in hand Valentine is, always making sure that Maria Ender's busy professional activity runs smoothly. Once they start reading scenes together, the delicate hierarchy begins to transform, and the gap between their years becomes a source of differing tastes and outlooks. There is an undercurrent of sexual tension which is verbally unacknowledged, but at the same time obviously acknowledged visually; Juliette Binoche, her hair now closely cropped, dresses more severely - the wardrobe revealing her amalgamation into Helena and the disorientation and turbulence of her own yearnings. On the Internet, we catch our first glimpse of the \"scandalous\" 18 year old, Jo Ann (a blooming Chloe Grace Moretz,) - the stereotypical Lindsay Lohan-type actress who will play Sigrid, her videoed exploits being Googled by Maria Enders. The Bette Davis classic All About Eve comes to mind, but this upstart is a contemporary version, self assured and fearless - with a belief in youth's immortality trumping those whose futures are shortened by the labyrinth of passing time.The men in this movie are ancillary - a writer, a director, a former lover - all functioning as vehicles in divulging snippets of the plot's history, but all subordinate to the women who are portrayed with an intimacy unveiled through the emotional archaeology of attachment, passion, and the apprehensive challenge of ambiguous entanglements.",

    "review": "  \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" operates with a meta-narrative that might be several layers deep, using the realm of celebrity to question the nature of age and the subjectivity of art. This kind of material is practically tailor-made for pretension, but (miraculously) the film remains relatable due to its compelling characters and the level of distance the audience is kept from the on-screen happenings, the characters' lengthy monologues centering around their interpretations of a work offered up for critical thought instead for the sake of overpowering the spectator. The performances are layered, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the script is both rewarding and thought-provoking; it's a wonderful film, especially for those who love to dissect pieces of work to find gems hidden in those ambiguous crevices.",

    "review": "  Clouds of Sils Maria is one that benefits from having no expectations beforehand. Given that I hadn't so much as seen a trailer, I didn't really know what I was getting myself into other than its basic setup. Less than that, actually--I really knew keywords from the plot's synopsis and who the movie stars. It also probably helps that I don't mind slow movies since this is one of the slowest of the year. It's also one of the best of the year so far, being a beautifully shot and meditative exploration of how art parallels life and how life parallels art. It's a little surprising to see a movie as meta as Clouds of Sils Maria that doesn't bother going w humorous route. There are some giggles in the characters' realistic interactions, sure, but the movie is definitely a drama. It finds different ways to explore the falling celebrity of Juliette Binoche's character by treating its plot like the other half to its themes instead of a counterpart to its themes. There are moments in which Binoche's character is shown running lines for the main upcoming play that make it confusing whether her character is truly distraught or just giving a convincing performance within the film's universe. Kristen Stewart further disproves the myth that she's nothing more than Bella Swan, and Chloe Grace Moretz gives humanity to child star that easily could have become a caricature. The filmmaking compliments this as well, given how each scene ends with a fade to black as if its characters are existing within a stage production that drops the curtain at the end of their conversations. The story divides itself by title cards--part one, part two, and epilogue--that deny the audience the closure that the characters themselves are striving for. It could easily come off as incomplete or lazy, but it works wonderfully. The movie isn't without its flaws, though, as its pacing has some issues. It starts off well enough but feels a little lost from the 15-minute mark to the 35-minute mark in where it's trying to go or how long it should take. The last fifteen minutes are also a bit spotty and despite its strong end note, the film feels like it has false endings. Otherwise, Clouds of Sils Maria is a hidden gem with a sense of beautiful confusion that is likely to stick with me for a while. 8.4/10, great, one thumb up, definitely above average, etc.",

    "review": "  really well done. The trio of ladies at the helm of this all give fantastic performances. Juliette Binoche takes this movie by the reins and doesn't let go. Maria (her character) is facing an uncertain point in her career. She's getting older, movies are changing, the man who helped launch her career passes away, and now she takes on the older character in the play that made her famous. She's faced with a lot, and Maria hides behind the text of the play instead of really confronting her fears. She blames the play and says she can't connect to the character when really she doesn't want to. And Binoche lets us see all of that. Kristen Stewart as her personal assistant makes an excellent scene partner for Binoche. The scenes where the two of them are running lines form the play are fascinating to watch. The line between them running lines and talking normally blurs constantly. Stewart's Val constantly tries to push Maria into seeing new ways of looking at not only the acting world, but the world in general. Throw in Chloe Grace Moretz as the young superstar that's going to be playing Maria's old part, and we have ourselves a movie. It meanders a long a little bit, but the conversations are almost too fascinating to care. I really enjoyed this, and I think not only is it a great movie for theatre people to watch, but also in general as a really interesting character study.",

Casting veteran actress Juliette Binoche with the younger generation of Kristen Stewart and Chloe Grace Moretz, the film is a very transcendent look at generational gaps, and how aging can be the most unwanted inevitability in the acting world. The trio of actresses all deliver remarkable work here, and in many ways mark the culmination of Olivier Assayas' career as a (potentially) feminist director. Bolstered by lush cinematography, and a script that's both surreal and palpable, Clouds of Sils Maria is quite unlike anything else you'll see in theaters this year.",

    "review": "  As with all French films, I offer a degree of leniency when it comes to the overall pulse of the film. French movies are notoriously boring and despite the fact that films should not be so, I am happy to offer passes to films like Rust and Bone and Two Days, One Night. Clouds of Sils Maria however, takes advantage of my good graces, offering a boxed in two hours of what is honestly some of the most lifeless film I have had the displeasure of watching. A great deal of this centers around the Stewart casting. Although many a director has attempted to take the credit for rescuing young adult actor's careers, there is rarely credit to take. As was the case with Daniel Radcliffe, Stewart is an inherently bad actress. She has no range, no emotion and poor vocalization. Despite the fact that Clouds does its best to fit Stewart into a role that matches her drab exterior, her inability to emotionally connect with a scene still shines through bright and clear. Binoche is strong individually, although her abilities are somewhat lost in the doldrum created by the film. The attitude overall is painfully pretentious, with unwarranted cuts to black and pristine Alps shots to remind us to tune in on Oscar night. Chloe Grace Moretz, hyped by the trailer as a major player in the film, turns out to only have a few minutes of screen time that offers one semi-decent line. Her role is minimal and the dynamic that is attempted between Stewart and Binoche goes on for far too long without really assuming the emotional gravity intended for it. As a final damnation, the film, coming in on the coat tails of the fantastic Birdman, really feels like a free loader, offering a similar look at an aging thespian with many of the same conflicts. The hinted (and undelivered) lesbian spin is really just decor on what really is a shameless awards bait copycat. Clouds of Sils Maria is altogether overhyped, overrated and underwhelming in all aspects.",

    "review": "  Probably to crittique it simply Clouds of Sils Maria is best considered as the feminine version of Birdman with a middle aged actress played by Juliet Binoche, going to a tribute to the filmmaker who made her a star, being seduced/obliged to pay tribute to him after his sudden death b suicide to return to the project they did together but now in the adult role and have a young upstart, played here by Chloe Moretz, to play the young she originated which tosses her into a career and identity crisis of sorts. The acting is extremely solid, even by Stewart proving that given the material she can hold her own outside of Twilight and against Oscar winners such as Juliet, and Juliet was deserving of some more awards attention just for her emotional range here. Plus the cinematography of all of the mountain ranges were gorgeous as well. But that being said was just so meditative and introspective a look into the process of essentially workshopping a play that it was almost too mellow and quiet to a fault to hold the attention of the viewer completely. But for short bursts not bad at all.",

    "review": "  This is an english version of a \"french film\" so it is already supposed to be artsy. The scenery was beautiful which they take advantage of by spending a lot of time walking all over its trails and sitting to look at the views which is part of the story. Clouds of Sils Maria is a Swiss town where the clouds at some times of the year follow and snakes through the canyons of the alps as it moves and undulates into the mountain/lake town. The topic is also promising, it is about an aging actress struggling to still be relevant as she is being replaced by younger more outrageous, scandal/paparazzi hyped stars. The scenes spends so much time developing the characters and the conflicts that you are promised so much as you follow it...suffering through its editing techniques (it shows the characters without conversations going in and out of houses, cars, etc...just to elaborate the narrative) and filming gimmicks (filmed in 35 mm, which made the beautiful scenery flat). The actors were sufficiently effective...but it all felt so \"written\" and contrived. One of the main characters just vanishes from the story without explanation or reaction after so much time spent developing the character and the relationship. It's all set up and the end so small, it just felt uneven. It had an interesting topic but makes no lasting impression on them. So much atmosphere but ultimately as insubstantial as a cloud. It was written and directed by Olivier Assayas and it won the Louis Delluc Prize for Best Film in December 2014 but here's where the rubber meets the road: it was made for $6.6M and made $1.5M. Ahhh we uncouth viewers don't know a thing about art french films!",

It's so mysterious at times, while all the same, dryly funny with some ambiguity that works on almost every level. Flawless performances here as well. The film itself is not perfect but continuously interesting. I feel like if I was to watch this again, I would gain something more from it.

    "review": "  What a terrific film! Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart both give stellar performances. The script is nothing short of brilliant, making the story of Sigrid and Helena both juxtapose, reflect and act as counterpart of Maria and Valentine's. The use of music is very much on point throughout the film and the editing, that seemed a bit off at first, makes more and more sense as the movie progresses. For me, this was easily a 5 star movie (the 5 star-est I've seen in a long while) but I'll settle with 4,5 because the epilogue, for me, took away a little bit of the power contained in how part two ended. I don't think the epilogue is unimportant and dispensable, but I am a sucker for open ended films and I find that without the epilogue the ending was more open. It's a personal thing, not a demerit in any way.",

Juliette Binoche is great. Chloe Grace Moretz is eye opening. Kristen Stewart is mind-blowing brilliant. The screenplay is addictive and the storyline is outstanding. This is a must-see film, if only for Valentine's (Kristen Stewart) intellectual defence of the paranormal and sci-fi genres. The storyline is a touch complicated and leaves the viewer wondering in the back of one's head, \"is this an allegorical statement about Kstew?\"",

    "review": "  Art mirrors art in the transfixing \"Clouds of Sils Maria.\" Veteran actress Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche) is asked to star in the revival of an acclaimed lesbian drama that made her famous 20 years ago, but this time, she must play the older woman, instead of the ing�nue. Confiding in her personal assistant, Val (Kristen Stewart), Maria reflects on her past career and life, and the uncertainty of her future as an aging actress. Binoche captivates with her nuanced performance, balancing Maria's confidence and poise with her wistfulness and insecurity. Holding her own against Binoche, Stewart proves her formidability as an actress; she is sharp and understated, articulating every line of dialogue with unassuming veracity. The most compelling arc in Olivier Assayas's character study is the complex, interdependent relationship between Maria and Val, two strong-minded, intellectual women who care deeply for one another, but never confront their emotions directly. Playing these characters with vulnerability and restraint, Binoche and Stewart have a chemistry that's strikingly palpable. They have such an honest connection to the material that scenes of them conversing and rehearsing seem to bleed into one another, making it difficult to tell whether they are speaking in the present moment or reading lines. Despite its expository dialogue, the narrative is still rich with subtext. Assayas's meta-drama is thoughtful, layered and subtly provocative.",

He is together with Spike Lee the only A-list director with still major craft problems.
