Nina Hoss is terrific in this and in the two that I have had the pleasure to watch her in (Barbara and A Most Wanted Man). An interesting story about an interesting woman during post war Berlin.

In the aftermath of the second world war, the notion that anyone could return to a country that had committed such an egregious act of genocide at all, let alone rebuild a relationship that once was, seems futile immediately. It doesn't matter how desperate anyone is to get back a semblance of the life that used to exist before the concentration camps; there's no coming back from that. When she arrives, she notices her reflection in shards of glass. She shudders as a train goes by, hauling those awful carts. The identity of the woman and the nation in which she lives has been changed forever, and in order to move on, she must build something entirely new. She can't forget the past, but must look forward anyway.",

    "review": "  An intriguing story but contrived and it's difficult to suspend belief. It's quite slow but pretty engaging and the twist at the end is very satisfying. Nina Hoss is excellent as Nelly, the concentration-camp survivor. The best way to understand this movie is, according to some, not to take it literally. That may help to overlook the manufactured plot line. Some have suggested that it is an allegory - I'll leave viewers to decide that for themselves. Very atmospheric and explores some complex themes. A fresh take on post-Holocaust survival.",

    "review": "  After their concentration camp is liberated following World War II, Nelly, a former cabaret singer, and her friend Lene return to Berlin. Nelly has plastic surgery to reconstruct her face, which was badly disfigured by a bullet. Though she's still beautiful, the surgery changes her appearance so she's no longer recognizable.Nelly and Lene rent an apartment. Since all of her relatives were killed in the war, Nelly stands to inherit a large sum of money which the two women will use to immigrate to Palestine. In the meantime, Nelly tracks down her husband Johnny, despite Lene's suspicions that he was the one who outed her in to the Nazis.Johnny doesn't recognize Nelly, nor does she identify herself. Instead, noting that she bears a striking resemblance to his dead wife, he hatches a plan to hide her away in his basement apartment until he can teach her enough to convincingly impersonate Nelly so he can collect her inheritance. Nelly willingly goes along with this scheme and is an incredibly quick study. As well she should be, given that she's learning to impersonate herself. One might think Johnny would become suspicious when a woman who looks so much like his wife displays such an uncanny ability to forge her handwriting, but no one in this movie is particularly insightful.If I had to pick one word to describe this film, it would be \"implausible\". As one who has a difficult time suspending disbelief, this was a toughie for me. There's mood and suspense and good acting but by the time I'd finish rationalizing one improbable plot twist, the story would present me with another. I saw a quote from director Christian Petzold in response to one apparently critical interviewer that \"people who ask those questions don't like movies\". Not true, Christian, not true. We like documentaries. And slice-of-life movies. And movies that aren't so damn plotty. And despite its numerous contrivances, I even liked your movie. Didn't love it. But appreciated it for what it is.Well-acted, suspenseful, and yes, implausible.",

    "review": "  It has been a week or so since I saw this film. It is puzzling that I am still wonder about the ambiguity of the piece. It is the story of a young woman, Nelly, disfigured in the Holocaust. She survives and is rescued by a friend, Lene, who worships who she once was before. They go back after Nelly's plastic surgery to acquire Nelly's inheritance. Yet when Nelly goes back, her husband does not recognize her. She does not mind. She tries to attain her old identity as he has hired her as her own double to get the money himself. This is a haunting story...and you are never certain as to what it is really happening. This is perhaps more an examination of reclamation of Holocaust survivors identities and also the attempted escape of those culpable in the imprisonment of the many Jews. Barbara Hoss as Nelly and Ronald Zehrfeld as her husband who perhaps sent her to the camps. Mr. Pentzhold the director purposely creates a Hitchcock quality because we are never certain ourselves if Nelly is who she says. Or if her husband really did place her in the camp. The mystery comes to dramatic haunting climax. Excellent filmmaking and perhaps difficult for those who just want a plot that spells everything. Intriguing!",

    "review": "  Wow. Wow wow. This was super great. I was a little worried at first because I'd heard amazing things and from the first 45 minutes or so I was enjoying it but not invested to the point of real emotion. It was a movie I appreciated, but it's just not the kind of movie that I really cry at or truly love. As good as a prestige historical drama like this is, I'm probably never going to adore it as much as a progressive comedy like The Overnight or even just a clever constant-laughs comedy like Trainwreck. That's still true - in my rankings, this was just below Trainwreck - but in terms of genuine emotion, it hit me harder.I'm not really sure where to start. I guess I'll start by talking about the flaws, which are very few. It was a little bit of a stretch how Lene waited so long to tell Nelly about the fact that Johnny divorced her the day before she was arrested; it is a bit contrived how that only comes up after Lene kills herself. Frankly, Lene didn't really need to kill herself for the story, especially because the movie didn't really focus on her depression or anything.Most of these flaws don't matter much, though, because they're in service of something much greater. Nelly having the revelation of Johnny's betrayal late in the movie might be contrived, but it is that way for a reason for the climax to hit the way it does. Besides, it never really feels like the whole movie is wheel-spinning, even if it is delaying a lot of inevitable confrontations. And even Lene's suicide, while not exactly telegraphed, is important to making Nelly and Johnny feel truly isolated at the end, to making them feel like the only characters in the whole movie and the only people in the whole world.Every scene crackles with meaning. There are so many thematically dense scenes, like when Nelly comes out in the dress with her newly dyed hair and asks, \"Do you recognize me?\" At so many points in the movie, especially that scene, you can see Johnny's denial preventing him from truly coming to terms with the fact that this really is Nelly. Even from the beginning, he probably knows, somewhere deep down. He turns when she yells \"Johnny,\" and something about her immediately makes him recognize her as someone who could 'play' his wife.One of my favorite things about the movie is how three-dimensional everyone is. In some soap opera melodrama, Johnny would be a cartoony asshole, greedily plotting to steal Nelly's money. I mean, that is SORT OF what he's doing, but it's clear that he has some genuine love for her, and that he has a lot of guilt for what he did, like any real human. If he didn't, the final scene wouldn't hit as hard as it does.But, yeah, that final scene. Even if I hadn't liked the rest of the movie, that final scene would've been memorable. It's the best closing scene since Whiplash last year, and funnily enough, they both involve an intense musical sequence. The whole length of the scene, I was staring, wide-eyed. The film juggles these two distinct tones marvelously: quiet tragedy and thriller-like intensity. Most of the movie isn't tense in the way that a thriller is; even in a movie like Whiplash, when actual murder is never the threat, it'd still make a kind of sense to call it a thriller, but Phoenix is a drama. But it's great the way Petzold integrates these elements of extraordinary tension into the story. The scene when Nelly obediently follows the script and embraces Johnny at the train station, I was really afraid of what she was going to do. Was she going to just shoot him right there? Was she going to scream, or punch him? But no, she follows the script, waiting for an even more impactful moment to reveal the truth.Overall, Phoenix is a dark and tragic tale of a betrayal and a woman who just wants to believe things can go back to the way they were before the Holocaust. It's not one of my top three favorite movies of the year, but it has by far the best last scene of the year, filled with sadness and intensity.",

    "review": "  The German post-World War II drama \"Phoenix\" (PG-13, 1:38) has a great mix of influences behind it. The title, of course, refers to the mythological bird that is reborn when it rises from the ashes of its former self. This film's story is loosely based on French writer Hubert Monteilhet's novel \"Le Retour des cendres\", which also inspired the 1965 British film \"Return from the Ashes\". This 2015 version makes changes to the plot and sets the story in Germany. It's also influenced by other films, including Hitchcock's classic, \"Vertigo\". Underlying all of this is the oft-repeated real-life drama of concentration camp survivors restarting their lives following unspeakable personal and family tragedies. This film takes that situation and tells a fictional story of one such woman whose return from the camps is even more complicated than most. It's disappointing that this movie isn't as interesting as its impressive pedigree.As \"Phoenix\" begins, Nelly Lenz (Nina Hoss) is being driven by her friend Lene (Nina Kunzendorf) back to Germany after being liberated from the infamous concentration camp at Auschwitz. Nelly had been left for dead after being shot in the face, a situation that requires her to have plastic surgery. Although the doctor isn't able to make her look exactly like she did before, Nelly ends up with a face that many women would appreciate having. As Nelly heals, she and Lene share an apartment and talk of joining other Jews in Palestine. Nelly's entire family died during the war, leaving her with an inheritance that she could use to relocate. In Palestine, Nelly and Lene could restart their lives, feel more secure and help to build a new Jewish state in the Middle East... but Nelly has something else that she needs to do first.Nelly was married at the time that she was arrested and sent to the camps. Lene believes that Nelly's husband, Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld), betrayed Nelly to the Nazis, but Nelly isn't so sure. She searches Berlin until she finds Johnny, but thinks Nelly is dead and doesn't recognize her. He does, however, feel that she looks enough like his wife that he asks her to help him with a plan to get Nelly's inheritance for himself. Nelly conceals her true identity and goes along with Johnny as he thinks he's remaking some random woman into someone whom he can pass off as Nelly. She takes advantage of the situation to try and find out whether Johnny did turn her in, or if they might get back together and resume their lives.\"Phoenix\" shows us little seen and increasingly forgotten places and situations, using them as a backdrop for an intriguing mystery. Post-war Berlin is seen as a place of bombed-out buildings and people struggling to put their lives back together and learn how to relate to each other again. Allied troops are on hand to keep order and transition the country back to a peaceful existence, but the return of peace is only the beginning. It takes time to heal war's wounds, in all their forms. Nelly is virtually unrecognizable, not just because of the surgical reconstruction of her face, but also due to the obvious toll that the war and the abuse she suffered in the camps has taken on her body and mind. Symbolic of so many who survived the war, Nelly walks differently, talks differently and seems to have lost any pleasure that she once had in living. Nina Hoss' performance is raw and real, but the others lack energy. The script gives us one-note characters with no background and, except for Hoss, the actors play down to that script and to the uninspired direction of Christian Petzold, who also served as co-writer. And the film's minimalist score doesn't help. The ending comes in one pseudo-dramatic moment, but it depends too much on the actors and not enough on narrative strength. Audience members are fairly likely to end this film with the same look on their faces as the actors in the last scene - with both groups wondering what they just saw and what happens next. It's a shame that such a great story couldn't have made for a better movie. \"B\"",

    "review": "  Phoenix: Ziemlich gro�es Kino!Phoenix is a simple film with complicated themes of identity, survival, and loss. It is not your normal post WWII film, nor is it your typical concentration camp survivor story. The main character, Nelly, was in a camp and her trauma is reflected in the desperation of a divided Berlin. Her interactions with others are clearly influenced by her time in the camps, and Nina Hoss wonderfully portrays the protagonist. Unfortunately, the actor who plays the lead male, Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld) is relatively ineffective compared to the stunning Hoss. I am not sure whether is is the script or the acting, but he clearly isn't up to her level. Nelly's best friend, Lena, is performed with skill by Nina Kunzendorf. While not as remarkable as Hoss, she holds her own in their scenes together. The look of the film is lovely, but it is clearly made on a budget. The music is appropriate for the mood and the era, though a couple of times too loud and overly dramatic. The pace is deliberate and effective. It is a good film that offers us no answers to the questions it poses: how do we survive after everything is taken away, how do we return to a life that no longer exists, whom do we trust now when many of our old friends were Nazi or collaborators during the war, how do we react to someone who returns who we thought was daed, and where do we go when nothing is left of our former life. In the film, like life, there are no easy answers. That only strengthens the film's appeal. Rating: Pay full price. I don't want to say to much for fear of giving too much away. The film, while not shocking, is not predicable. ??Peace, ?Tex Shelters",

    "review": "  Emotionally devastating. This post-Holocaust German film defies categorization. Set in ravaged postwar Berlin, Nelly (played immaculately by Nina Hoss), a Jewish singer, returns as a facially disfigured concentration camp survivor, searches for her husband, Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld), a piano player, who is suspected of betraying her to the Nazis. Nina Kunzendorf is empathic as Nelly's candid, loyal friend with no illusions about the events that transpired. After undergoing reconstructive surgery, Nelly finds Johnny working in a nightclub, but he doesn't recognize her. Nelly assumes the identity of a doppelganger, at her husband's request, to bequeath her inheritance to him and split the sum. This seemingly preposterous conceit never feels contrived under the deliberately assured direction of Christian Petzold. It plays as a sophisticated mystery with the style of a noir. The exquisite cinematography by Hans Fromm features dark shadows and symbolic framing. Nelly's transformation into her former self suggests \"Vertigo\" in reverse. In its execution, the haunting, ambiguous ending is perfection. Petzold examines the complex psychological state of postwar Germany suffering with identity, deception, denial, and guilt. This is a rare contemporary movie that assumes the audience's intelligence. It makes you conscious of how simplistic and manipulative other movies on this subject are. A lyrical song titled \"Speak Low\" is played at crucial moments to lingering effect. Music is by Kurt Weill. Co-written by Petzold and Harun Farocki, loosely based on the novel \"Return from the Ashes\" by Hubert Monteilhet, which was filmed before as a British film in 1965.",

    "review": "  Christian Petzold, the director, has managed to take a somewhat novel concept and essentially squander it, as well as my time, on trying to impress his audience with a seemingly calculated \"ironic\" scene at the films end. The story trots lamely along carrying a burden what seems to be obvious stupidity and questionable motives on the part of the would be widower husband and his survivor wife, Nelle. Is he so stupid that he can't recognize wife who has had partially reconstructive surgery and is the wife so stupid that she can't give up on the man who may have betrayed her out of cowardice; these are some of the questions that leave the viewer confused and probably so because Petzod just can't wait to get to the end to make what he has presumably calculated to be a profound irony. The actors are also somewhat wooden in their performances and provide no insight into their psychological motivations for their behavior which again leaves the audience wondering. Nelle's friend, Lene, provides some modicum of reasonableness in the first half of the film but commits suicide nonetheless; you have to wonder if it was out of depression, which wasn't convincing, or more sardonically was it just wanting get out of this film and move on and find better director. Other reviewers have mentioned a Hitchcockian resemblance which leaves me totally baffled because I saw nothing suspenseful in the film and nothing thematically to remind me of Hitchcock's films.",

Cinematography is rich with grit and torn apart by war; every angle is off and just can't be made right (as it had to feel in post war Poland). The music is the most brilliant aspect, taking a single Kurt Weill song, Sing Low, and weaving it throughout in a haunting memory of pasts we can't get back. There is nothing about this film which doesn't perfectly fit the story. It is tough, dark and desperately needs to be seen.

    "review": "  Bizarre and strange film in which a Jewish woman survives the concentration camp and valiantly tries to find her German husband. When she finds him she recognizes him but he does not recognize her, due to two reasons. First, because of excessive guilt due to him telling the Nazis where she was hiding, and because her face has been disfigured due to being tortured in the camp. She pretends to be someone else hoping for the day he can recognize her. Meanwhile, he hatches a plan to find someone to impersonate his \"deceased\" wife in order to collect insurance and guess who he chooses !",

    "review": "  In a word: disappointing. After reading reviews comparing this film to a modern day Vertigo, I expected the cinematic experience to be rife with twists and turns, jaw-dropping revelations, and intrigue. Instead I spent an hour and a half watching a woman who somehow was strong enough to survive the Holocaust but not strong enough to leave her husband who was the cause of her arrest in the first place. Even when it was revealed to her husband her true identity she takes no action: there is no resolve or any indication of a character arc for Nina. We are only left to decide for ourselves what is to happen of this feeble woman who chose her abusive husband over her friends that were trying to provide her with an actual shot of a happy life. The only thing more unsatisfying about the main character being unable to fend for herself is that I spent 90 whole minutes watching absolutely nothing happen. This film seems to have an intriguing premise, but does not reach it's full potential.",

This movie does require you to have the patience to watch it slowly and quietly unfold, but if you give it that, it pays out in rich symbolism and brilliant acting. It?s like a fine artisan chocolate. Time-consumingly made layers of delicately crafted delights that melt so sweetly you need a moment of silence to just sit and appreciate the gift you were given.",

Nelly has survived the concentration camps, but needed some plastic surgery; when she returns to the husband who divorced and betrayed her, he thinks she's a stranger he can use to get at her inheritance. Nina Hoss is resourceful enough as an actress that you go with her in the charade, wondering how far she'll take the role playing \"herself,\" but a nagging sense of impatience is hard to dismiss at times, and though the socko climax--set to Weill's song \"Speak Low\"--has a punch, after that the movie more or less shrugs.

    "review": "  While it can be a tense and involving watch, Phoenix is, beneath the craft, a short film expanded into ninety-plus minutes. That is, at thirty minutes we'd have the effect as we have at ninety.  The film first establishes its premise, which is intriguing and deep: a woman, coming out of a Nazi concentration camp, has a face transplant due to injury. She is unrecognizable to her husband, but similar enough that, when the two reunite, he asks her to imitate his old wife (actually the protagonist) in order to inherit her property. Her motivation in not telling him who she really is is not always clear, but is justified enough by her apparent want to be identified without having to explain herself. The allegorical connection to history this plot establishes the viewer can fairly easily deduce.  What follows is, save for the provocative last scene, repetition and insistence on drawling out this plot without deepening it or taking it to new heights. So, for example, there is a sequence of events where she attempts to prove her identity to her husband by first imitating her signature and then wearing her old shoes, which fit perfectly. Each of these events, which at the film's slow pace stretch about five minutes each, say the same thing. Each deems the other unnecessary since both are to the same effect. This goes on and on, where the viewer is invested solely for the moment when he may finally recognize her. Repetitive also are the glances and gazes between the the protagonist and her husband. The acting in combination with the editing leads to brilliant minimal drama at times, but when we're seeing the same silent facial acting towards the end of the film that we also saw in the beginning attempting to create the same effect, well, it makes you question the film's integrity.  I think the film's integrity is this: It plays it safe. It establishes an interesting metaphor, and doesn't roll with it as much as it could have. It shrinks the surrounding historical events into the evocative faces of its two leads. Artful sure, but compelling only for a while. And the bottom line is that it didn't move me. The film wanted to be devastating but I wasn't devastated. The film wanted to be subtly heart-wrenching but my heart wasn't wrenched. I felt at the end, \"Alright, that was it. There it was.\" In other words I didn't feel much besides the mild and consistent tension throughout. There's only so much you can accomplish in a film with these parameters. This review is not primarily negative because the film was bad but because the critic consensus is overwhelmingly positive. An excellent short film, but only a good film.",

    "review": "  Phoenix is well done in many departments, but is flawed in its tradeoff of developing its allegory for a surface-level story that is admittedly engaging.The film's first 20-30 minutes are slow paced, but laced with allegory and metaphors for the Jews' post-holocaust struggle for getting back their former selves. I thought Nelly's physical unrecognizeableness (I know it's not a word) was a good way to represent her inner loss of identity.From start to finish, the film impresses technically with perfectly decayed walls in the art direction and finely crafted cinematography, particularly how it highlighted the Phoenix nightclub. Nelly wants to find her husband, but discovers not only that he does not recognize her (because she got face surgery from her face being holocausted), but thinks she's dead, and wants to use her to pretend to everyone else that she's Nelly to get some money. Nelly doesn't tell him it's really her; she wants him to find out himself. Suspending the disbelief that he would recognize her voice, body, or hands, it's a tense plot, with the question as to weather or not he will find out lingering over the film. However, once this plot point is established, the film stops developing its allegory altogether. Now it's just a movie about her and her husband, having lost the political context along the way.Not only does it lack political context, it lacks emotional context. The situation feels entirely Nelly's, and there wasn't anything I could latch onto as a person not having survived the holocaust and trying to rekindle with my husband who doesn't recognize me. The question as to weather or not she gets her identity back is not that engaging thematically either. If she does, then the movie states that Jews were able to get theirs back. If not, then they weren't. If in between, then it's just a question. Without developing the themes or allegory any further, the film dooms itself to being basic.This is not to say that it's a failure of a film. The acting by Nina Hoss is superb, looking into her husbands eyes, desperate for him to recognize her soul beneath her own. Ronald Zehrfeld is great as well, responding to these looks, curious with her uncanny resemblance, but still (somehow) ignorant to the truth. The facial exchanges between the two are pretty remarkable. Still, it's a bit strange how emotionally devastated Hoss is the entire movie in front of everyone she encounters and how none of them seem to notice or ask if she's okay. Petzold should have requested a bit more subtlety from his actress at times.It's also a fairly tense mystery, building on Nelly finding out things about her husband she'd never had known otherwise, forcing her to rethink her relationship. This develops the film thematically a bit because it shows that no matter the outcome, the couple's relationship may not be the same. The ending is a perfect climax to the story and a great combination of acting, direction, and editing. In the end though, the film relies heavily on allegory for its thematic heft, and then drops it, leaving me with no way to really connect the film to much at all. Strong performances and story kept me interested, but I don't see how the film is great.",

    "review": "  +\"They don't make them like the did in the old days, \" is the cry of many senior film buffs, including me. In \"Phoenix\" the director, and co-writer with Harun Farocki, Christian Petzold certainly tries. With bits of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\" here, Kander and Ebb's, with Fosse's, \"Cabaret\" there, this movie, as film noir, cries out for a Barbara Stanwyck or Lana Turner and to have been filmed in black and white.The story of a woman, Nelly, who had her face damaged by a gunshot wound in a German concentration camp has her face reconstructed after the war and goes looking for her husband Johnny. Upon finding him he doesn't recognize her and tries to get her involved with a get rich scheme by having her impersonate his late wife so he can get her inheritance that was left by her relatives who died in the war.\"As Time Goes By\" is an important part of \"Casablanca\" as are \"Again\" in \"Road House\" and \"Que Sera, Sera\" in \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" and this movie too has a song that becomes an important part of the story, by Kurt Weill and Ogden Nash, called \"Speak Low\" which is heard throughout the film and impacts the ending.Nina Hoss, as Nelly, may not have the sexuality of a Lana Turner, and is a beauty in her own right, but she is the equal of Barbara Stanwyck in the acting department. She can and does say a lot with a look, her eyes through bad or good and the way she holds herself. You watch her progression from a scared, downtrodden woman to the beautiful, confident woman she was before the war. Ronald Zehrfeld, as her husband Johnny, who thinks that she can pass for his wife that could help him put his scam over has doubts about who she really may be but not enough to stop him. Zehrfeld has a romantic innocence that makes him seem less the villain than he is.Another major, but undeveloped, role is Nina Kunzendorf as Lene, who does a lot for Nelly but their relationship isn't quite defined and is unceremoniously out of the film before the halfway mark.I was told by Allen that the film was an analogy of Germany after the war but I will admit it went right over my head! It might account for why I didn't like the film as much as I expected to but it did introduce me to Hoss, Zehrfeld and Petzold enough for me to want to see the previous films they have made together.\"Phoenix\" is a German film with (some poor such as 'sit up' instead of 'sit down') subtitles running 98 minutes.",

Audiences willingly sit in a darkened room, watching representations of real life because, at the very least, they expect the story to be plausible. Judge for yourself. It is 1945, and Nelly (Nina Hoss) returns from Auschwitz with her face terribly disfigured. After reconstructive surgery she finds her husband Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld), who fails to recognize her, even though she addresses him by his real, not assumed name. I feel stupid just outlining the \"plot.\" Johnny asks Nelly to pose as his wife so they can claim her inheritance. She goes along, no doubt hoping he'll finally recognize her.

    "review": "  The thin story here feels a little stretched out but it is well told and executed. How you rate the film will depend on your tolerance on the underlying contrivance on which the narrative relies. You will either see it as a distracting irritant that will taint your enjoyment of the film or, if you are able to overlook that, you will find a thoughtful and interesting film which ends with a precision that epitomize German efficiency and succinctness. For me, the film starts slow and I was in the former camp until I was slowly and eventually won over. The power of a poignant and compelling ending can never be underestimated.",

At first Nelly is trying to find herself after the concentration camp and her lose of self is reflected in her fellow jews desperate desire to believe in Israel but then she rises and she forces the ones left behind to look at what they have done. Breathtaking.",

Nina Host plays her character brilliantly and shows the brokenness of a woman who survived th Holocaust, only to return to a husband who doesn't recognize her. The audience feels her pain together with her in such a moving way.",

Una historia postguerra, que cuenta el drama de una sobreviviente del holocausto jud�o que luego de someterse a una cirug�a reconstructiva trata de recuperar su vida pasada desde su nueva identidad. Desperada y ansiosa por reencontrar a su marido, har� todo lo que est� a su alcance para volver con �l, pero el encuentro ser� muy diferente a lo esperado. CRITICA 5 ESTRELLAS, P�BLICO 5 ESTRELLAS.",

    "review": "  Nina Hoss gives a stellar performance here as concentration camp survivor Nelly in Christian Petzold's tense film that cleverly blurs the lines between suspense drama and modern noir. Going in search of her husband Johnny after undergoing facial reconstruction work, viewers are kept guessing as to whether he betrayed Nelly and what actions will be taken as a result, leading to an incredibly moving and satisfying conclusion.",
