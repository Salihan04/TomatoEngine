    "review": "  George Miller unleashes a feverish, ferocious film and it's an intense wild ride. Acrobatic \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is thrilling and treats the audience to some astonishing action sequences. But the action doesn't dull the emotional impact and that's mainly due to Charlize Theron's fierce performance.\"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is a ride worth taking. Wall-to-wall pumped-up adrenalized fun, it's ridiculously good.",

    "review": "  George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the most, lush and vivid movies I've seen in a long time. The cinematography for this film is an absolute marvel- showcasing the sprawling outback desert through hues of oranges and reds during the daytime, contrasting it with beautiful midnight blues at night. All this comes together to give the movie a very lively atmosphere. The score alleviates the sense of rush and is smartly used diegetically as well as non-diegetically. The action scenes are shot brilliantly with minimal special effect, furthering its case as a masterpiece. Finally the acting especially that of Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa is top-notch and no character is left needing further characterisation. Tom Hardy's Max is a man of little words, but the performances are so strong that the movie doesn't need dialogue in order to flourish. This movie is definitely not hyped up- go see it and then go see it again.Rating: 5/5",

Whereas the current popular political correctness deems all life as precious, this weekend jaunt through the local park with the baby in the stroller yells to differ (reminding one of exactly what planet one dwells on). Standing ovation for George Miller, whose charming eloquence about the well hidden truth of modern society is jaw-droppingly stunning. The best apocalyptic vision seen for some time.",

    "review": "  30 years after the release of 'Thunderdome' Mad Max is finally back. The lone wolf, the single warrior, the loner, the lone soldier, the outcast, the outsider, the man with no name...errr...named Max. The hype has been stratospheric for this one, I have gone into this expecting truly mind blowing things, the greatest action movie ever made? lets see, I will be brutally honest in every aspect.So the bottom line, this is virtually based around one sequence from 'Mad Max 2' and made into an entire movie. We all know which sequence, the one with that bloody great gas tanker covered in gun turrets and spikes. That sequence was epic on so many levels, a truly award winning vision of distopian science fiction...where all the goodies get killed, awesome. Now, in this tale Max has been captured by the War boys who are all led by Immortan Joe. Your standard gang of barbaric lunatics, only this time not kitted out in S&M gear, no this time they are all painted up in a tribal sort of way. Long story short, Max has gotta reluctantly help out Charlize Theron's character of Furiosa (with the help of Nicholas Hoult's ill War Boy character, Nux) in saving some damsels in distress from Joe whilst trying to reach some fabled lush green lands. This of course equals a whole load of vehicle chases across the outback which basically never stop.The first sequence we see is Max's classic and gorgeous black pursuit special (the now famous 1973 Ford XB Falcon GT) getting trashed, wait what??!! I heard about this before hand and I have to say I don't like it one bit, I wanted to see that fucking car in action once again, damn it Miller! Not quite sure how Max's super fast special manages to get wiped out by the collection of clown cars chasing him but never mind, it bloody happened didn't it, ugh!So one of the first things we see as the real story kicks in is Immortan Joe's citadel which appears to built into a fecking massive cliff. How the hell did they manage to do that? there's like some sprawling catacombs in this rock by the looks of it, I wouldn't of thought anyone had any time in between killing each other and building ridiculous killer automobiles. This is actually one aspect that didn't sit well with me, this whole idea felt way too grand and over the top for a Mad Max movie, it looked like something from the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy...only with cars instead of orcs. Then if I really wanted to be picky I would ask how everyone is so muscular in this dead post-apocalyptic world, meh don't question it. Its here we start to see the strange freakish array of characters that inhabit this new Earth, gotta say I loved what I saw here for the most part. Miller has always been good at creating these bizarre characters for this franchise and he nails it again here.Most of the bad guys are just big rippling baldies covered in white paint for some reason (the War Boys), not much background given but they look intimidating for sure. Other citadel dwellers and bad guys come in various shapes and sizes such as the creepy looking Corpus Colossus, a physically disabled child of Joe with exceptional intelligence (a real person with a real disability). Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones), a huge muscular mammoth of a man, dim-witted and another son of Joe. The Bullet Farmer who is some ugly aging bloke in a suit of bullets and...is a farmer?, hence is name. The People Eater is a big fat bald guy (everyone is bald in the distopian future) who I guess eats people? Again hence is name and the reason he's so fat, he also looks to have lost his nose because he wears some kind of metal plate there. The Doof Warrior who is some crazy blind bloke that rides a war rig (the Doof Wagon) into battle strapped to some huge speakers and playing a fire spouting guitar. This guy seems to have become the new Boba Fett of the movie world but he doesn't actually do anything, in fact I fail to see the point of him or the drummers other than simply to look cool. Admittedly he does look cool, certainly unique with his mothers face for a mask (oh yes), but basically pointless.Lastly we have Immortan Joe who is easily the most effective looking character I've seen in years. His mask appears to be some kind of breathing apparatus that is attached to some kind of bellows around his neck. The mask is slightly reminiscent of an old WWII pilots oxygen mask but with a terrifying line of big teeth like a skeleton. Not too sure about his ending though, was his mask like...attached to has face and skull? He also seems to wear some kind of transparent body armour with medals and whatnot attached, obviously he suffers from some kind of affliction or disease. Visually this guy looks fucking amazing, the makeup really tops it off with his pale ghostly complexion and silver balding, widows peak hair line. All in all the selection of characters gave off a very 'Dune-esque' (1984) vibe in my opinion.The action is virtually constant here, its the trademark of the movie (and franchise), non-stop. The main bulk of the action centres around Max and co trying to escape on the tanker under a barrage of gunfire and explosions. Now yeah, we've seen this before in 'Mad Max 2' but this has been ramped up to maximum overdrive, its insane! There are vehicles being torn up and flipped all over, metal mechanical shrapnel shattering all over the desert, bodies are flying everywhere, War Boys are leaping around on pole vault type things hurling explosives, gunfire, stabbings, fisticuffs...all happening on and off various extreme vehicle creations. It all looks completely real (because all the stunts were real), its highly impressive and shows great achievement in both eruptive action and practical effects. On top of that the location work, scenery shots, panoramas and the crisp, bold colour palette really look nothing short of gorgeous, it almost looks too good for this type of movie. Gives you faith in movies again it really does.That's not to say the action saves it completely, in my view. Amongst all this grade A action you do have to wonder how Max, Joe and others manage to survive some of the horrific fender benders they get into. The good guys battle their way away from the citadel, all that way, only to come back again and do it all again? wut?! The canyon sequence stuck out as a very daft cheesy notion. This biker gang that hides out there, living in and around the canyon walls, which they ride about on...with motorbikes? bit risky isn't it. Also, where did they all get their matching costumes? When the good guys come back through the canyon, do they go a different way? didn't it get blocked off. And it does all seem nuts that all this happens purely because Joe wants his girls back. He unleashes his entire armada and risks everything just for some ass? can't you find more girls in your citadel? Oh and in the end the citadel bad guys just let Max and co into their city and take over? huh? he just killed your leader.The greatest action flick ever? hmmm not too sure about that, its certainly up there but I still find myself preferring the gritty cult classic 'Mad Max 2' with Gibson. I think Hardy does a reasonable job but he is no Mad Max if you ask me. One thing I hated actually was the deliberate lack of dialog from Max, it worked well in the older films (MM2) simply because there was less to explain, 'MM2' was like a bloody 80's videogame it was so straight forward. Here there are things that could use background information plus the amount of times Max gets into a situation (mainly at the start) where I really wanted him to just speak! say something!! Explain your situation to Furiosa then she might not try to kill you...ugh! I found that actually frustrating and it didn't need to be like that.Still, the fact that the goodies went back on themselves towards the end really made me groan frankly. Its like Miller didn't know how to end it so he just made them go back and run the same gauntlet all over again, easy option for more of the same. I won't lie and say I didn't like it, but I won't lie and say I thought it was a stunning movie, the action is monumental at first but after the initial hardcore, automobile, carnage sequence, things felt a little tamer. The initial visual shock and awe that hit my eyeballs, making them swell, started to ease off. So awe-inspiring visuals all round and some great characters...visually at least. Is this a good flick? yes, yes is it, its a very engaging solid action movie, buts lets not get too carried away. Its really a one trick pony if you're honest about it, big gas tanker with goodies fights off hordes of baddies, rinse, wash and repeat until credits. The only real difference is its Furiosa's story, and to a degree, Nux too, unfortunately Max is just along for the ride in his 30 year old reboot.",

    "review": "  Apocalyptic films are usually a hit or miss subject. Many are forgettable or cliched to the point of being one big joke, kind of like the film within the film by the Mackenzie brothers in Strange Brew. Some films get it really right, while others get it really, really wrong with disastrous and silly results.When one thinks of the modern apocalyptic film the template for that genre of cinema was crafted by George Miller. His major debut Mad Max (1979) was less apocalyptic and more a '70's exploitation car chase flick sent to hell and back, making the film an achievement in film making. It pushed the envelope at the end of the decade.It would be the sequel to that film, Mad Max 2 or The Road Warrior here in the states, that would define Miller's vision of the world beyond the end, the people that lived after the \"event\". The Road Warrior is one of those rare films that exceeds its predecessor with a story that, while simple, is presented in a way that is unforgettable and burns itself into your psyche.We'll skip Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. It has its place and its moments, but is really a film that Miller cared very little about as he left the world of Max for thirty years.Mad Max: Fury Road is a return to the supercharged film that The Road Warrior happened to be. Max (Tom Hardy) once again runs afoul of a mutant clan using slave labor and water to control their little piece of a broken world. Led by Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keayes-Byrne, who played the Toe Cutter in the original film) a chase ensues after Furiosa (Charlize Theron in an awesome performance) steals a commodity that is sacred to the enraged leader.A simple story if there ever was one, but this goes beyond that. Fury Road is open to close action with very little time to catch your breath. Some films are called a roller coaster ride, that age old cliche that they slap on posters. Fury Road is like going into hell without any looking back. It's funny that a film set in a fictional version of our world can draw so many parallels to life itself.What really stands out in Fury Road is the role of women. For a film titled Mad Max, the strongest character in the film is Furiosa, a warrior that does not give up, leading her ironic cargo to a promised land that may or may not exist. Distant memories or wishful thinking? There are moments when Max feels like a side character and this is Furiosa's movie. It's an amazing thing to see in film where a woman is neither a pawn nor a gimmick, but an integral piece to the film. She is the center that everything about Fury Road revolves around.I was more than sketchy when I heard that another Mad Max film was on the way. So many returns in the last decade have floundered over the indulgences of these sequels and reboots. It's about a 50/50 split in that arena. Fury Road is probably the best of the bunch and is probably one of the best films of 2015 so far. It is a credit to credit masterpiece that really cuts at the other blockbusters of this year and the almost stagnant world of super hero movies. Fury Road is, ironically, a breath of fresh air in a cinematic universe that tends to regurgitate last years product. Dare I say that this film is Miller's masterpiece, possibly even surpassing The Road Warrior? I don't know, but I really, REALLY want to watch it again.",

    "review": "  Allow me to begin with a confession. I had to see Mad Max: Fury Road again. I knew minutes into the film that my appetite would not be quenched and I needed to see it again, which I did less than 12 hours later. A week later I saw it a third time in the theater. The reason I did this is obvious in one regard - it's a highly enjoyable, pulse-pounding, amazing spectacle of first-class stuntwork and mad genius so rarely accomplished on such a large, splendid scale of destruction. The other reason, from a writing standpoint, is that I needed to see the movie again or else my review of Fury Road was going to consist of nothing but an unending stream of positive adjectives vomited upon the page in excitement. And for you, dear reader, I wanted to do better. Also, I wanted to see Mad Max: Fury Road again and I honestly wouldn't mind in the slightest seeing it again.In the post-apocalyptic future, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) is an aging warlord with his own fiefdom. He controls the water supply and has an army of gearhead warriors to enforce his rule. His trusted driver, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), is leading a caravan for supplies when she goes rogue, driving off into the desert. Furiosa has taken Immortan Joe's \"property,\" namely his five wives. Enraged, Immortan Joe gathers a posse of death vehicles and riders and heads off to reclaim his \"property.\" Max (Tom Hardy) is a drifter thrust into the middle of this conflict when he's strapped to a car and driven out into the desert, part of the Immortan Joe rapid response forces. There are few things more exhilarating in the realm of motion pictures than a well-executed, well-developed action sequence, and Mad Max: Fury Road is a blistering, awe-inspiring masterpiece of brilliant carnage. What director George Miller has achieved onscreen is visionary. The level of execution is so rarely seen at such a large scale, and with so many moving parts, that I was delighted and curious how something this extraordinary could escape the risk-averse studio system. I'm trying my best to restrain myself from sheer hyperbole, but this is an instant classic in the world of action cinema and a definite top five all-time action film (for those keeping track, I would say last year's Raid sequel would also qualify for that status). The movie provided me a font of joy that did not let up until the end credits ushered me out of the theater. The action sequences are epic in their scale, with dozens of different vehicles in hot pursuit, and yet Miller brilliantly orients his audience to every moment of his symphony of demolition. There are so many different parts to the action but the audience knows everything that happens. The sheer sense of momentum and pacing is overwhelming and giddy. The action sequences develop organically, with new consequences throwing our characters into different and dire directions. There's also a startling amount of variety with the action sequences. Fury Road has been described as a two-hour chase film, and that's accurate to a degree, but there are breaks in between the sequences, small moments to catch your breath and learn more about our characters and their hostile world. Each sequence is different enough that the action doesn't ever feel redundant, even when the third act literally requires the characters to backtrack. The adrenaline just doesn't turn off from the get-go, and Miller keeps throwing out new tricks, new stunts, and new cars to astound and amaze. Simply put, Fury Road shames other American film releases. The stuntwork is another facet that just raises the bar when it comes to action movies. Miller emphasized practical effects whenever possible, and the emphasis pay off with a heightened sense of realism onscreen. It's real cars being smashed to real bits, real stuntmen being tossed around. In an age of CGI over saturation, it's all too easy to become numb to big screen spectacle because of how hollow it all comes across visually. Just this past month with the Avengers sequel, I knew that all the fight scenes were mostly CGI or actors against green screens, and it eases off the enjoyment of the moment. Don't even get me started on the deluge of CGI carnage in the last Hobbit film. Real physical objects and physical interaction offer so much more believability in an age of increasing disbelief with special effects. With Miller's focus on practical effects first and foremost, it brings that sense of crazy excitement back and it ensures that Fury Road will hold up better over time. I also appreciated just how much thought Miller and his team put into crafting their world. Every detail feels like it adds to the overall richness of Miller's vision. The designs of the cars, the use of scrap, the fact that a pulley system is operated with children running up giant wheels, it all contributes to making the world better realized and more alive. The level of thought put into weird and deadly concepts in this movie is fantastic. Once the main characters pass through a bog of land, we see people dressed in cloaks traversing the land on stilts, and it's little passing details such as this that make the movie feel more complete. I enjoyed that one of Max's heroic attributes is that he's specified for his blood type, being O the universal donor. The fact that Miller finds a satisfying way to bring this attribute back as a payoff is also appreciated. I also enjoyed how Miller expands upon the family of Immortan Joe, with his bevy of freakish sons and brothers and peculiarities. I enjoyed the fact that Miller isn't afraid to embrace the weird of his dystopia, symbolized best by a blind guitar player attached to a roaming wall of speakers who can shoot flames out of his instrument. Every time the movie cut back to this guitar playing pace setter, I smiled, and I smiled a lot during this movie.Some have grumbled that Max is a supporting player in a movie that bears his name, but I would argue he is a co-lead and the real star is rightfully Imperator Furiosa. Max is not replaced with Furiosa, rather they have an inter-dependant relationship where they're both vulnerable and they both come to trust the other but without a romantic mingling. These are both wounded, shaken, mistrusting, and volatile people, and to watch their shared sense of teamwork and the gradual opening and reliance upon one another, it is itself an affecting and emotionally satisfying relationship. But back to Furiosa, it's really her story because she is the one with the personal connection o the mission. Max has always kind of been a wandering warrior who finds himself in other people's battles. Consider him a post-apocalyptic Man with No Name. Furiosa is the leader who has planned and implemented the escape from Immortan Joe, and it's she that deserves our attention. I enjoyed the fact that Miller doesn't even have to explain her past. We know she's suffered trauma, physical and likely sexual, and he assumes the audience does not need Furiosa's past abuse spelled out specifically for them, or seen in grisly flashback. She's a strong woman who is far from helpless with one arm. This is a story about women liberating themselves from sexual slavery under a corrupt patriarchy (more on the thematic relevance below). Theron is our leader and the ferocity in her eyes is all you need to know you believe that this woman will do whatever it takes for freedom.The other aspect that's very clear is that Fury Road is a decidedly feminist film but it never stoops to preaching or even directly calling attention to its efforts. It's a ruined world where men with unchecked power have exploited the vulnerable, where women are treated as \"property\" and valued for breeding purposes. Our heroes are by and large women who have rejected their roles in this society or are fleeing their impositions. And with Furiosa as lead, it paints a more than convincing picture of women being just as capable and badass in the post-apocalypse (I want to go as Furiosa for Halloween). It's a movie that portrays women struggling against an unjust system that devalues them but Fury Road doesn't wallow in their suffering. It doesn't have to in order to get its points across. It also treats the wives in a manner that lacks sexualization. Immortan Joe has treated them as property but Miller treats them as human beings, even going as far as to give them distinguished personalities. I'm not saying they approach three-dimensional characters but they're certainly not just eye candy. There's a sequence where they wash each other with a hose, and you could see the myriad ways this moment would go tawdry for some cheap titillation. What the Men's Rights Activists (sadly this is actually a thing) seem to have lost in their caterwauling is that feminism is not a zero-sum game; one person gaining stature and opportunity does not mean it's taken away from another. Just because Furiosa is strong it doesn't make Max weak. Furiosa being a compelling lead character does not diminish Max. It makes him an even better character because he recognizes her value and his own limitations, like a scene where he voluntarily hands over a rifle because he knows she's the better marksman. No one has to explicitly point and say, \"Girls can do it too.\"There's also a fascinating commentary on the danger of religious fundamentalism with the war boys. These powder-white young men are Immortan Joe's armed forces and they are promised a swift appearance at the gates of their paradise if they die in battle (\"Witness me!\" is their exclamation before sacrifice). They spray paint their faces chrome (\"Eternal, shiny and chrome\") and then go in for the kamikaze kill. Again, the theme is ripe and obvious but without requiring characters to comment. Nux (Nicholas Hoult, wonderfully deranged and then sincere) actually has the closest thing to a character arc, going from hopeful martyr to independent thinker. He begins as a clumsy yet determined antagonist and becomes a resourceful and unexpected ally. This is practically a flawless film on a technical level. The cinematography by John Seale (Cold Mountain) is bright with lush colors that pop on the big screen. We've been treated to far too many color degraded films, so it's nice to view a movie that wants to use all the colors at its disposal. The musical score by Junkie XL (300: Rise of an Empire) is stirring and pulse-pounding with its heavy percussion, but there's a languid melody that returns again and again that is emotionally resonant. It's surprising how the score will punctuate the bombast and wailing guitars with a lovely string arrangement, like when we rush into the sandstorm and a car is blown into the sky. The editing is outstanding by Margaret Sixel (Happy Feet) and she keeps the audience informed with every new twist and turn, and with so many moving parts and changing dynamics, that is a miracle itself. The production design by Colin Gibson beautifully expands and informs this strange world. There isn't a department in Fury Road that wasn't at the top of their game.If I had to quibble, I could accept the argument that Mad Max: Fury Road lacks the substance to be much more than an exhilarating action ride. The dialogue can be a bit on-the-nose, Hardy mumbles through a majority of his miniscule lines, and the characters aren't as fleshed out as they could be and the plot is rather bare bones. However, I view its narrative economy as a virtue, as there isn't a moment or scene wasted in telling this breakneck tour de force of post-apocalyptic demolition. Rarely does an artist get to work at this level in the studio system let alone succeed with a final product that still manages to be strange, mordant, uncompromising, and completely riveting. This is a near-perfect action movie and a thrilling high-wire act of practical filmmaking bravado. Mad Max: Fury Road is the standard I am going to judge all summer movies by for the rest of the year, and I imagine many will be found wanting. I could continue to heap praise on the movie but the most persuasive stance I can make is that if you fail to see Fury Road on the big screen, you will always regret this decision. I am a disciple of Fury Road and witness my brethren and me. This movie was made for the biggest screen, the loudest sound system, and an endless bucket of popcorn. Nate's Grade: A",

This one doesn't get started until about thirty minutes in, and the character development is sloppy, uneven, and unnaturally rushed. For example, we're supposed to believe that the frenetic war boy abandons his blind faith because of one embarrassing maneuver and the fact that he got to stare into a girl's eyes for two minutes. Those must be some eyes.The reason that story is so important, especially in action films, is that the audience must be kept in suspense about how the action sequence will end. Here, there's no doubt about who will survive; the only question is how, which isn't that entertaining.This film's champions shouldn't think that I don't get the gender politics here. I understand that the film puts women in positions of power, that it stands against sex slavery, and that its depiction of women is more progressive than many other films in the genre. That's all great and the reason why the film got one star instead of a half.Overall, this story is weak, and all the chase sequences in the world can't rescue a weak story.",

    "review": "  Considering the wave of terrible 90's Scifi sequels/remakes we've had fired our way in the past few years (Terminator, Robocop, Total Recall etc.) Fury Road's success has been more than a pleasant surprise.It takes a lot of very 80's dystopian post-apocalyptic sensibilities and puts it in modern context. The relevant storytelling, characterization and heavy play on social themes make it a compelling tale but it's the barebones, relentlessly unforgiving visuals that make it a thrilling ride through and through.There's more to the world of Mad Max than sand dunes and angry people with automobiles though, with very little screen time Miller manages to convey a very elaborate society full of warrior tribes, caste systems and cultural/religious customs that are intriguing if not visually iconic.Let's also not forget the cast of characters representing a variety of minorities without feeling like forced tokens. A phenomenal performance by Charlize Theron breathes badassery into Furiosa and the manic Nux played by Hoult! It seems the best way to bring back the \"strong silent type\" hero is to in fact keep him silent. (who would've guessed?) Hardy skims by as Max with stern looks, grunts and single syllable words and for that we love him.At the end of the day Fury Road is both a nonsensical, visceral action packed adventure about a bunch of rebels fighting the system but also an intelligent character study with a dab of social commentary. Some of these folks are larger than life (Max) others victims/villains turned heroes (Furiosa, Breeders, Nux) which ever you appreciate more you're both cheering and enamored by the spectacle.",

    "review": "  Over thirty years since the last instalment in the \"Mad Max\" franchise, Tom Hardy takes over the leading role once helmed by Mel Gibson, and takes the character to unseen heights. George Miller definitely waited for the perfect time to release this picture, coming out in an age where every action film relies on CGI. Displaying a perfect balance of practical and CG effects, the action pieces in this film are breathtaking to behold. Everyone in this film gives it their all, injecting fuel into this franchise that was believed to be dead long ago. The two main questions people will ask about this picture is does it live up to the original trilogy and will it welcome newcomers. I will say that you do not have to view the original films in order to know what is going on here, but it definitely will not attract people who have no clue what they are in for. \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is a breathtaking spectacle (better than any I have seen in a long time), but it was a little too short on characters to really care about EVERYTHING that was going down. By the end of this film, I realized that it definitely was spectacle over substance, but the spectacle was so incredible that it will almost overshadow the bad upon every single viewing. In the end, I will say something that I have never said about any movie. It is a flawless film with many issues. My brain was going nuts during my viewing of this film, and I loved that. If you are planning on seeing this, please do so in the theatre, it is worth it. \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is awesome!",

    "review": "  George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road holds no bounds in its trek across the desert landscape. \"What a lovely day.\"Littered with little character buildup and a paper thin plot-line, the 2 hour adventure goes off-road with tons of vehicle carnage. There are enough story details, as needed, but ultimately, it's all there to setup the next incident on \"fury road.\"The violence is erratic, over the top, and highly entertaining. A good combination of CG, as well as real vehicle demolishings come as advertised. There is so much going on, the film manages to leave the want for even more.Tom Hardy is a man of few words, it is no wonder the film belongs to Charlize Theron with Nicholas Hoult following in her footsteps. Seriously, the film could have been called Furiosa road.There's no secret here. Mad Max: Fury Road delivers what is expected of it.",

And I'll be honest, in the first 15 minutes, I had no clue what I had gotten myself into. It was a little overwhelming. The types of movies that just throw you into a world with no explanation always throw me for a minute. But, what I will say is that once I'm in, I am sucked in 100%. And this I was sucked in 1000%. What is this society? Why is almost everyone from it sick? How did Furiosa become the only woman in power? Why is there a flame throwing guitar? Now, these are all questions that are still swirling around my brain, but in the moment, I could have cared less. I was simply along for the ride. The visuals are absolutely stunning (that sandstorm at the beginning. Holy hell.) The acting from the main characters is on point. (Charlize Theron is my queen.) The chase scene in the last half hour had me incredibly stressed out in the best way possible. The storyline was deeper than a typical action movie. I could honestly keep going. I would love to watch this again, now that I understand everything, and just dive in and go along for the ride.",

Mad Max gets kidnapped and strapped to the front of a vehicle, and we watch cars blow each other up. There's not that much more going on - until maybe 60% into the movie when the Charlize Theron character explains she's trying to get back home - and eventually needs to return to where the movie started.There are bizarre kings and crazed punks and a few siren slaves whose presence appears, again with little context. People spray themselves with paint, one truck has a wonderful rock guitarist strapped to the front, whose axe shoots flames out of its neck. And this goes on for two and a quarter hours.However, the way the visuals are conceived is stunning. The home city has mammoth levels strung on hyper-industrial styled gears, with muscular percussionists pounding out something - for some reason. It looks cool. But to no intelligent end.",

If you have never seen a Mad Max before that will be your reaction. Everything about the Mad Max universe is so different and special Bringing back Miller was the by far the best decision.Without him this movie would not have been anything close to what is was. Miller makes the movie feel like an original Mad Max film. From the weird skull guys, bad ass cars, and post apocalyptic wasteland, A great thing about Mad Max are the characters. Charlize Theron plays Furiosa, a girl who has stolen precious cargo from main villain, Immortan Joe, that all of his followers are after. Charlize Theron as Furiosa was the highlight of the movie. She is the most interesting and most impactful than any other character on screen. Fury Road is the ultimate thrill ride and definition of a good action movie. The action sequences and visual effects are so beautiful and amazing. Every shot is as real as it gets and looks spectacular. Definitely one of the best looking films of the year. The movie is so alive and bright that it makes it hard to keep your eyes off the screen because you don't want to miss anything. My biggest flaw in Mad Max is sadly Tom Hardy's portrayal of Max. I didn't feel his performance was strong enough or energetic like the character should be. But I overall I loved Fury Road. It's action scenes were amazing, awesome characters, and extremely well directed. Should be a fun watch for any Mad Max or action movie fan.",

    "review": "  Mad Max is the newest masterpiece in the infamous Mad Max movie franchise by George Miller, who returns after 30 years to direct this movie.Evey now and then, we have certain movies that become milestones for how great an action film can be. 1981: Raiders of the Lost Ark. 1988: Die Hard1991: Terminator 2: Judgemtn Day. 1999: The Matrix. 2008: The Dark Knight.and 2015, MAD, MAX, FURY ROAD!This movie is absolutely incredible! It is unbelievable, it is riveting, it is beautifully chaotic and desructive, and it is without question the best action movie of the decade. No other movie the past 6 years comes close to this masterpiece in terms of practical effects, stunt work, visual effects, sound editing, cinematography, directing and minimalistic, yet effective storytelling and qorld-building. Everything you need to know about its characters is told through actions, and decisions over heavy handed exposition. The pacing is something out of this world, being so extremely super crazy, yet so super awesome at the same time. While the story is nothing complez, it is still there, and serves its purpose rightfully without any forced scenery or visual pleasure.",

    "review": "  I really had no desire to see this movie at first because I actually never saw a Mad Max film. But when I saw the trailers, I was blown away and I immediately became intrigued. Looking at the visuals and the action, this looks like everything I want to see in an action movie. After watching this film, I felt ashamed that I never saw a Mad Max film because Fury Road is AWESOME! It is such an adrenaline-filled rush that I feel like taking a nap after watching it. The entire movie is like one big chase. At first, I didn't think that much about it. I saw it as just a fun, heart-pumping thrill ride. I didn't think it had much story and not enough exposition for me to understand the characters. I thought because maybe it was part of a franchise and I didn't see the other films. But after multiple viewings, I saw that it was telling their story the whole time. It was all told through a visual medium. It's a film that doesn't contain much dialogue, so you need to follow the story through its visuals. Because of this, you can immediately understand the characters and the world they live in. The film also has a surprising amount of feeling and emotion. This helps us feel for the characters and adds a sense of humanity to the film. I say that the only people who wouldn't like the film are those who can't handle this kind of action or for those who have never seen a Mad Max film. But even some people who have never seen a Mad Max movie, like me, can still find a lot of enjoyment in it. I know I did. Mad Max: Fury Road was some of the most fun I've had all year and I'm sure it will please all fans of the franchise.",

    "review": "  Brilliant addition to the classic franchise that both manages to reboot with a new lead actor while continue the excellent story. Tom Hardy fills in for Max perfectly, rightly playing him as a man of few words but with a dark past. While some complained that is really more of Furiosa's story (wonderfully played by Charlize Theron), they forget Max is essentially the mysterious stranger who shows up to reluctantly save the day in each film since \"The Road Warrior\" (still the best of the franchise). The rest of the cast is also excellent, particularly Hugh Keays-Byrne as the villainous Imortan Joe. Behind the camera, George Miller crafts a brutal yet beautiful vision of the apocalypse like the never seen. The action sequences are breathtaking, made more so than they were done by real stunt people, and crafts a original world complete with its own religion (\"Witness Me!\" has fast become a popular sci-fi phrase) vehicles & costumes (Joe is a monstrous sight). Not just one of the best action movies in years but the best film of 2015.",

    "review": "  Although its won audiences and critics alike the world over, this is not the definitive Mad Max film. A likeable cast heads a dystopian piece packed full of beautiful cinematics and jaw clenching action sequences. Yet despite this I left the film feeling a lack of awe and inspiration. This is in part due to the tiresome plot which acts as a prophetic odyssey but instead frames as a consistent action pursuit romp. Although played by the talented Hardy I found the titular lead underwhelming and underdeveloped. I feel this had less to do with Hardy's performative efforts and more to do with the characterisation in the script and plot. This may be in part a nostalgic attempt by Miller to homage its previous incarnation or an unfortunate side-effect from the emphasis on Theron's Furiosa. Whatever the reason, I find the underwhelming nature of such an original and iconoclast character to be a great departure from Gibson's lunatic apocalypse cop and as such the major downfall of the piece. Whilst certainly a good movie, one can't help thinking its not deserving of the multitudes of praise which it is being given",

    "review": "  George Miller's Fury Road is full of car chases...in fact the whole film is a hyper presentation of the Mad Max world. Miller started out actually dealing with editing and the vehicle chases in the earlier Mad Max movies. This film is sped up literally in order to keep the pace and you definitely lose a sense of rational. It is a chase to be remembered with wild special effects. Tom Hardy is passable as Mad Max although he could be any man fighting his way through a dystopian society. Charlize Theron added her touch to her heroine of the piece with a relish that would make Sigourney Weaver in Aliens proud. Yet I kept on saying that this film is nominated against films like Spotlight and The Revenant. It certainly is well made though I do not think it warrants the nominations. I loved George Miller's eye for detail; he hired a mega team to handle it all. And its focus for detail showed up in earlier films. My favorite would be Babe; a story about a pig's life. Yet this picture is beyond Cecil B. DeMille and borders on a Pink Floyd' The Wall approach. You know there's a good guy, people to be saved, and the bad guys. And you work your way to the end. Afterwards you feel assaulted (the theatre had the volume turned on super high) and left breathless. It is a roller coaster ride of a movie. Yet I left the theatre not knowing or caring much for the characters. i wanted to explore Max's psyche further; he was no more than a persona much like Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name. In the age of video games, you would hope that detail would not be lost. In this case you will lose yourself in the design of the movie. Fantastic special effects and makeup are present. You can't help but admire the technical artistry. You just hope there would be more heart lurking somewhere in such a technical achievement.",

The story is pretty basic: women escape from hell looking for liberty and life, only to return after killing the evil ruler and his main henchmen to start anew. Oh, and the top babe almost, I said almost (remember now this is the apocalyptic future; no time for hope here) has feelings for her accidental saviour. Ah, what a romance. With many of the horrific, destructive fight scenes fought at such an exaggerated, frantic pace, it's a surprise all involved don't merely die from heart attacks. But you get a general idea what the film is going for when the bossman's babe is dead, and he has one of his henchmen cut the dead mom open only to see if his baby is alive, and upon finding that he is dead (I almost had a baby brother! I almost had a baby brother!) he is tossed aside like so much dead meat. At times the antics of the death squad is so silly its almost comical, such as when they spray their teeth with chrome, an allusion to the love for the shiny vehicles they worship as they hope for a battle death to take them via glory to Valhalla. An often silly, even unnecessarily abusive film to convey a story of little import that means little to most, that is unless you're an aspiring death squad recruit looking to take out the boss man to glory and victory.

But this is where the fun stops.What a dud it was, despite all the action. Story? \"A woman rebels against a tyrannical ruler in post apocalyptic Australia in search for her homeland with the help of a group of female prisoners, a psychotic worshiper(sic), and a drifter named Max.\"I guess if you have great memories of the original movie or if you have a thing for George Miller, this was the greatest thing ever --especially in super duper 3d. To me, it was a never-ending car chase from point A to B and then back to A, filled with fighting scenes, flat characters, supermodels turned wannabe-actresses and an almost mute protagonist. What else did I expect from a schizophrenic writer/director who not only created the Mad Max franchise nearly forty years ago, but whose last three writing and directing credits are Babe: Pig In The City and Happy Feet 1 & 2?I guess I expected too much. Even with so much garbage polluting the big screen these days, this one didn't rise above most of the big budget muck that we get to 'enjoy' as entertainment. I'm not even going to waste more words on this one. Sorry, I didn't get it. Shame it made almost half a billion dollars at the box office. There will surely be more of the same this year or the next.Pros: lots of hypeCons: everything elseVerdict: avoid",

The film does not shy away from this fact, it actually embraces it.The characters felt real and their motivations felt real enough for me to eventually be drawn in, despite the absurdity of the setting.And this, I can respect.Yes, it had some gruesome scenes of violence, but it didn't focus on them.This was my first Mad Max film, I assume the flashbacks/hallucinations somehow connect to the previous films. Happily, they weren't overused and the plot didn't hinge entirely upon them, so even a newb like me can enjoy this film.",

    "review": "  Fury Road illustrates how far the Mad Max story has evolved or devolved as this viewer would attest. Upstream, the first Mad Max was a unique & exhilarating dystopian nightmare of a semi-horrific road rage film encapsulating the raw brutishness of the Australian collective consciousness of the 1970s. Remember it wasn't made that long after Aboriginal First nations peoples gained the right to vote. And then truck engine sized cars roamed the Aussie roads where roadside eucalyptus trees had big American copies of GM and Ford cars wrapped around the trees making them look like tinsel on Aussie Christmas trees set in the blinding heat and dust of the outback. One could be forgiven for feeling like being in A George Miller film even outside the cinema in the Australian reality of the time. Fury Road has a Jerry Bruckheimer-ish feel to it with Australian models who act like a gang of bangers from Zoolander walking down the catwalk with David Bowie wincing at their garish Derelict Ozzie-style clothing. But the film has somehow captured an audience who seeks solace in a cinema from the ever-present real thrills and spills of the dominant paradigm of daily worldwide terrorism events.",

Max Max is insanity on the silver screen; chaotic when there is action going on and surprisingly quiet and peaceful in lulls. The pacing is excellent.Tom Hardy plays Max, a man of little words but many actions. He was captured by Imperator Joe and his War boys, and enslaved to them, forced to give his blood to keep the sick war boys alive and make them stronger.While Hardy is the leading name, I feel that the two best performances were actually by Charlize Theron as the fierce Imperator Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult as Nux, the endearingly reverent War boy. Despite the performances, Miller's vision is by far what makes the film a rousing success.Mad Max is white-knuckle excitement at its highest octane, and I would be hard pressed to deny that I had so much fun watching it.",

Few viewers besides the most ardent of fans will remember or perhaps even alive when the last film came out three decades ago, but Fury Road will surely push them to dig up that one and retrace the history of the series.Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron both are fantastic, and the action scenes are fun and exciting to watch. However, any attempt to fully describe the experience of watching Mad Max is in for an impossible task. Just watch it.In my first viewing, while I had some appreciation for the emotional heart of the film, it didn't hit as hard for me as it apparently did for others. However, after giving it another go, I came to grasp the heart and the message. One of the most entertaining watches in a while...*guitar riff*.",

The acting is good for the most part- it's the writing, the dialogue, and ultimately the directing. The story arc is simple- not necessarily a bad thing in an action movie- but the actions of virtually every character is so far off the believability track it quickly becomes a jumbled mess. The director was more obviously more interested in creating a visually stunning string of intense scenes than a good story. Should have been cut down to a seven minute music video.",

I tried with the older movies since they were highly reviewed and was bored with them and tried the updated version after having it in my queue \\ for two months and was bored with it too. Yes the visuals are fantastic, Charlize Theron is fantastic of course, but I just couldn't get past how shallow and silly the whole premise of it all is. Sure, there are some ironies there and as a popcorn flick for the masses it is not exactly difficult to follow. I just can't do it and despite the manic action sequences I was bored and as soon as they said they were going all the way BACK to where they started I was out. I simply do not have the patience to go through all of that nonsense in reverse and could care less how it ended. I rate the story at like maybe a half star but gave it 3 because Charlize's screen presence mixed with the high budget style and CGI is worthwhile just to look at despite the story line. I can't forget to mention Nicholas Hoult, who has officially sealed his title as World's Most Endearing Zombie.",

    "review": "  An action masterpiece through and through, it's plain and simple! Since the days of 'Die Hard' and 'Terminator', the action genre has turned into a repetitive, over-the-top array of films trying too hard to create entertaining sequences that instead look too cheesy due to bad composition or an overuse of CGI, of course along the way we have had some fine exceptions in the style of 'Casino Royale' and 'The Dark Knight', but certain directors *cough* Michael Bay... don't seem to be able to use their knowledge of an action sequence to its full potential and instead have constant fiery explosions and over-the-top shaky camerawork among other things... oh but then there's 'Mad Max: Fury Road', talk about epic action pieces. It has been 30 years since the release of 'Beyond Thunderdome' back in 1985, and George Miller decided to return to the directorial chair for a Mad Max reboot, and my God, he truly is a mastermind of action. After creating the epic scale of an action film in the form of 'Mad Max: The Road Warrior' it was going to be hard to live up to the previous films in the franchise, but Miller didn't just do that, he excelled at it and instead beat his previous films. With Tom Hardy as the new face of Max and Namibia as the new backdrop for post-apocalyptic Australia, 'Fury Road' is an exhilarating action fest that goes beyond its boundaries in creating what might just be one of the greatest action films ever made. Hearing that nearly 90% of the stunts and effects were practical literally blew me away, the sequences are extravagant and complex with frequent fireballs and car crashes filling the screen. George Miller's 2015 vigorous tale blends emotion and brutality with drama and action to reignite Australia's greatest film franchise and create the epitome of the action genre.",

    "review": "  Madness. If this were a hokey movie blog that chose to describe movies in a single word, that is the word I would use to describe this one. When you walk into a movie in 2015 and it grabs you by the exhaust pipe and makes you squeal, you say it is madness. I'm not a world traveller, I'm not a centenarian and I don't drive a cab in New York City. I don't feel or claim to have 'seen it all.' I don't even want to 'see it all.' But in 2015, moviegoers as a breed do have that mentality about them. There is a chip on the shoulder of the undulating masses who put on their jazzy showtime boots and rip a ticket to a flick, shovelling chemical kissed corn fluffs into their mouths on a Friday night. 'Horror? Seen it. Tragedy? Seen it. Comedy? Thriller? Western? Romance? Action? Hell, I've seen plenty of action! I've seen action films you've never even heard about', they might say. And woe to the ever optimistic purveyor of fine action cinema. For he knows not the battle that he is embroiled in is a battle that has already been fought, and lost, before the first frame is even considered. Because the very audience he is so eager to please, with their noses high and their postures erect, have already made their minds up. And who can blame them? For truly they have 'seen it all.' But they haven't seen this. Mad Max: Fury Road is a cinematic revelation. And with its fist clenched tight, it will take great pride in walloping your senses with a kaleidoscopic triptych of master crafts: sight, sound and touch. Not touch in the literal sense perhaps. There won't be any oily chrome under your ass or Outback gravel under your feet (unless you have found the coolest theatre in the world). But the film is so full and so thick with ideas and invention, and pulls it off in such grand fashion, that damned if you won't feel grit between your teeth or wind in your hair as a dozen roaring, manslaughtering vehicles cascade in a symphony of chaotic road rage from stage left to stage right and back again. You will certainly feel the effects of the Australian desert in the dryness of your mouth halfway through the film, when you realize that your mouth has been agape for a solid hour. Because this film, this madness, doesn't ease in. It starts fast and heavy. It starts in bleak conditions and future foreign saturation. It starts this way before you've had time to finish reading that text from your mammy and continues on in this way, with little respite, for two solid hours, until the final battle of petrol and honour commences. Do we lament the lack of dialogue? We don't. Shakespeare, this is not. Flowery, overly descriptive wordplay curling round itself, fighting for attention, for itself and for its creator (not unlike the words you have before you now) would serve only to get in the way of the reason for the (killing) season. This is evidenced in the few blocks of dialogue we are, frankly, hampered with and their awkward placement within the story and equally awkward delivery by the otherwise capable acting talent on roster. But how much exposition do you need? It's all right there in front you. Vehicles, war machines, kitty grinders, good guys, bad guys, damsels in distress, blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts (except, possibly, for the last two). Is there a message beneath the motor oil? There is. And depending on who it is you are and what it is you're looking for, it is perhaps an environmental one. Or a sociopolitical one. Or a feminist one. Or a pre-apocalyptic one. Or even a familial one. Enjoy the one you have. It's the only one you've got. So this, it seems, is something worth seeing. This is for you, moviegoer, you who have seen it all. This is special. And it has a special effect. One beyond the 1,500 some odd special effects shots in the film. Shots which, according to legend, were achieved 90% practically and therefore only 10% digitally (which is astounding when you see them in action). Shots which sported a sea of extras. Extras which sported among their ranks talents as impressive as Olympic athletes and Cirque Du Soleil performers. No, the special effect of which I speak is that rare beast that, if you're lucky, you can experience once in the bluest of moons on the biggest of screens and in three dimensions if you feel so tickled (though that third dimension isn't necessarily a necessity). We call this effect 'pure cinema.' I call it madness.",

Bacially, the movie was just one continuous chase scene w/a explosion fest thrown in for good measure. What's missing? Well, a damn story for starters. Very weak at best, with so little character development it left gaping holes in the whole escape from the tyrannical bad man scenario.Another glaring omission, was no Australian actors! This apocalyptic world of Mad Max is suppose to be in Australia. I guess the Casting Director went out for drink when these actors were chosen. Bad idea. All American accents, and NO Aussies. Maybe for this flick, it didn't make much difference as there is so little dialog between actors and their weak-ass story. Non-stop chase scenes w/gratuitous killing gets a bit stale w/o a decent story to fill-in. Under The Thunderdome quality it ain't there by a long shot. BTW, I am a BIG Mad Max fan, but this re-boot misses the mark for me.",

    "review": "  WHAT A LOVELY DAY, INDEED. this movie is everything the trailers made it look like it would be - a totally insane thrill ride roller coaster of a film from start to end.The film opens with revving car engines, the perfect prelude to the smashing, racing, crashing action you're about to see. The casting is pretty awesomely perfect, and Tom Hardy's demeanor fulls up the pages of script he doesn't talk through.A few big takeaways: obviously, the action and stunts were breathtaking. If there's a film out there that makes a better case for practical stunts and effects, I haven't seen it. Everything in this movie is based around real explosions, real crashes, and the interaction with the physical environment, therefore you end up with an incredible scale of thought and detail put into the reasons for everything and some pretty amazing visuals to accompany the story. Another thing is the extreme visualism with which George Miller has brought back to Mad Max is absolutely stunning; it creates amazing editing and action that is so in your face but at the same time easy to follow and understand. Finally, the soundtrack almost never leaves and, while loud and crazy, sets its paces and sticks with the action incredibly well. The movie is even self-aware about it's music, pairing it with a specific vehicle in the film that forces the viewer to be reminded about the music playing and brings it to light constantly, but not so much as to distract.As with most, there's also an incredible feminism empowerment plotline to the story that shines, but doesn't feel forced. There's just strong and powerful female characters that kick all the ass, straight and simple. There's no reason why or why not, and that's what all movies and filmmakers should take as a huge lesson from Fury Road.Definitely make a point to get to the theater for this one - a small screen will GUARANTEED not do the action justice. I'll be seeing it in IMAX next week, which I would also recommend.",

    "review": "  I watched this on an airplane, just as everyone else was leaving. It's probably not an ideal setting to watch this A-list action movie, but that's okay. I jotted down notes. Here they are:- My first Mad Max movie- Great action movie, decent drama- Action was fun and extremely fast-paced, sometimes to the level of not following what was happening- I did enjoy the action, but for a two-hour movie, it could have used more variety- Sprawling world of a desert, which, as empty as it was, was easy to understand in its geography- Disconnection between characters led to an aura of mystery- The cause was established in a short and sweet package; don't expect anything revolutionary or elaborate- Characters connect simply on grounds of not liking status quo and seeking redemption, without one of our heroes (Tom Hardy) even revealing his name until near the climax- Extra points for avoiding romantic mumbo jumbo in favour of developing strong female roles, led by Charlize Theron- Ultimately, redemption is achieved...? It's unclear, perhaps so that sequels are justifiedTo round up my points in a paragraph, I hesitate to hail this as one of the best action movies of all time. None of the characters were memorable, even in their mysterious ways. Neither was there a singular great action moment that still resonates in me. The whole package was definitely greater than the sum of its parts, and, as a whole, I had a good time. As a drama, the relationships between all of the characters, with a silent agreement to fight for the same cause, intrigued me most. As an action movie, I can see myself having an even greater time, when watching this on a screen larger than my head. I cannot speak for Mad Max fans, so as a newcomer to the franchise, I dig the world. You are definitely still relevant, George Miller.",

    "review": "  This is what happens when you have a visionary filmmaker with an idea in his head for 30 years. A film so energetic, so well-oiled and with a story that moves along faster than Max's own Interceptor that you just want to keep going back in over and over again once its finished. The first thing I love about it is Miller's direction. He almost completely does away with the shaky-cam fight scenes of recent action films and now, finally, we have someone who knows when to employ what technique. When to use slow motion (or when to go fast motion), when to cut to maintain suspension of disbelief but also to keep the viewers understanding of the scene and all its players intact. Miller also accomplishes something extraordinary with the characters of the film - here we have fully fleshed out, three dimensional characters but with barely a word of dialogue. Characters are developed as we see the world they live in. We feel for Nux because at the start he is just cannon fodder, unremarkable when standing next to the other warboys (A surprisingly easy thing to relate to in the real world). We feel for Furiosa because she has made it through so many implied hardships and has come out fighting on the other side. The character of Max is already developed fully through the canon of the original films, but Miller recreates this character by showing us his past through his fevered hallucinations, so the film works as a standalone piece as well as a part of the canon. Something else this film has received noteworthy praise for is its female leads, and personally I have yet to see a film do this as well as this one does. Yes, the female characters in this film are in the foreground and are all holding their own with the men, but it never addresses this, it just lets them do their thing, almost as if - could it be possible - woman can be proactive too??!",

If it was not for several friends telling me about the anti-patriarchy themes I may have passed over this one as well. I am glad that I did not. I watched it originally in the theater a week, or two, into it's release and I knew that it would easily be one of my favorite films of the year (especially considering how few new films I watch in their year of release). The bottom line is that the story is more important than the vehicle. It is an incredible action film and marrying the story with the action is important and it's main strength but I am suggesting that the action/chase movie is could be bigger. There is little time spent on building relationships between the characters and the viewer. Now is a good time to remember that I prefer drama films so this could be the perfect feminist action film and I may not recognize how perfect it is.I waited to watch it a second time because I wanted to have a better sound system which I now have. The first time one of the diesel engine turns over it sounded perfect and then I turned the base down; I could feel the nails shaking loose.Mad Max: Fury Road is an important movie and should be enjoyed.",

    "review": "  The purpose of a metaphor is to compare a subject to another thing so that your listener better understands the point you're trying to convey. I will do that now. One of my favorite metaphors for describing movies, other than sandwiches and burgers, is to compare them to complex machinery. A movie is like a machine in that it is full of moving parts, all of which work with each other to perform the machine's job. With many machines, not all of the parts may be functioning, but they still more or less work. It's only when all the parts work as they're supposed to that the machine works at its optimum capacity. This is how I'd describe Mad Max: Fury Road, George Miller's return to the franchise after a 30 year hiatus. (Has it really been that long?) I regret not seeing this one in theater, first viewing it on my laptop, which diminished the experience for me. However, that did not stop me from loving this movie, and my affection towards it has only grown with each subsequent viewing.Fury Road combines two of my favorite things about movies for a really great package: big spectacle and meaningful storytelling. These sometimes get mislabeled as being mutually exclusive, but this film seems to be a big middle finger to that notion. Miller uses big action set pieces to tell a story about survivors, monsters, cults, and the overthrowing of tyranny to set up a benevolent matriarchy. That last one may seem a bit odd for Mad Max, but thankfully the more laid back script keeps it from being too on-the-nose. That's another thing I like about Mad Max, there isn't too much exposition. The opening shot tells you all you need to know to get caught up on the scenario, whether you're a newcomer to the franchise or a returning fan. Everything else important to the story is shown through visuals and character interactions. For example, Max is very different from how we last saw him, and I don't mean that he's played by a different actor. A lot of time has passed since he last interacted with another human being, but this is never told directly to you. Instead, the audience is trusted to figure out by the way Max behaves. He's not so good at talking anymore, speaking in low grunts and pantomiming with a shotgun in order to order people around. Likewise, we know that Immorten Joe's group of followers, the War Boys, are cultists because of their mad devotion and willingness to throw away their lives, even though the word \"cult\" is never mentioned once in the film. I think the Mad Max movies are a great example of how you can show instead of tell in order to make a more compelling story.There wasn't a single moment that the film lost me. Miller understands the audience's need for practical effects, mostly keeping the CG invisible to viewers. The only really obvious use of CG is the crazy scary sandstorm with the tornadoes and lightning bolts, and, man, wasn't that really cool? Yeah, this whole movie is cool, which is important for an action movie. Thankfully everything's always moving forward, nothing stopped.I could go on and on, but this is just an RT review I'm doing for fun. If this was for a publication, I'd be more thorough and professional-sounding, but nobody's going to read this but me. If you do happen to stumble upon this and wish I wrote more, well, sue me.",

It seemed unlikely that the director, now known for such family-friendly fare as Babe and Happy Feet would decide to revisit the world he created with the first Mel Gibson as Mad Max back in 1979. So I was surprised when Miller decided to direct another installment with Tom Hardy taking on the role Gibson played in the first three films. Hardy is an excellent choice, he is good actor and has a great physical presence and can suffer photogenically like Mel did (especially in The Road Warrior). But Max is almost a secondary character in this film, Charlize Theron plays Imperator Furiosa whose rebellious act stealing the brides of Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the Toecuter back in the first Mad Max film). Missing an arm (thanks to CGI) and with her hair cut surprisingly short, the de-glamorized Theron is just as riveting and physical in her performance as Hardy. The first half of the film is a chase and second half is a race. And yes, there is a surprising feminist subtext to the film as well as a not-so-surprising environmental subtext to this film.",

I can't even say this film had to be acted all that well because it's secondary to the action sequences and Maxes grunts which I guess is also part of the action cause it definitely isn't part of the dialogue. Having Charlize didn't hurt. No story. A mind numbing ride without too much effort required by any of the actors to portray anything other than shock, fear, dismay and hope. Well at least I am able to narrow down my list of potential critics to follow from 333 to 10. Abysmal.",

Nothing stands up to scrutiny, no character holds up to any real logic, and of course it has nothing to do with the first movies of the same franchise.Let it be noted that Charlize Theron is the real main character here, and plays her part with talent and charisma, which sorely lack in Tom Hardy.",

Tom Hardy did the role justice, but wasn't as good as Mel Gibson, and unlike most of the other reviewers I wasn't overly impressed with Theron. The hit is George Miller's vision of what an action movie should be, so I can recommend this one to all Mad Max fans",

    "review": "  The surprise smash hit of 2015, Mad Max: Fury Road is a sequel/reboot to George Miller's Mad Max (1979). What's strange about Miller is that apart from his Mad Max franchise his biggest accomplishments have been writing both Babe and Happy Feet. Very peculiar then that from the same director comes literally the most action packed film of the last decade. Unfortunately however this very strength becomes its greatest weakness.Whilst visually stunning there is barely a narrative driving the action foreword. The story goes that in a post apocalyptic wasteland, where chrome and oil are worshipped and water is in short supply, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) decides to run away from Immortal Joe, the man in charge of said chrome, oil and water, taking all of his 'wives' with her. That's essentially it, what follows next is a two hour long car chase. Somehow this Max character (Tom Hardy) tags along for the ride and apart from being able to drive in a straight line and being nifty with a wrench doesn't really add much.Theron's Furiosa is amazingly bad-ass and the only really likeable character. It's worth mentioning that it's great to see a strong female lead in an action film such as this. Hardy's Max on the other hand barely says ten words and doesn't really feel justified as the titular character. Nicholas Hoult gives an unrecognisable performance as Nux a young 'war boy' but any real hope of a character arc, for him and nearly all characters, is sacrificed in place of crane cam shots of exploding vehicles.The mostly practical visual effects are amazing to behold and Miller should be applauded for his return to physical effects and sparse use of green screen. It's visually stunning but only remains interesting for so long. Coming in at exactly two hours it felt at least half an hour too long. When Max and friends finally escape their pursuers I thought it was over and the perfect ending point, however this was not the case. They make the decision to return through the desert from where they came to confront their captor. At this point I felt cheated, not only were all the previous car chases pointless now there was to be another half hour of exactly the same.Fury Road is an amazing technical achievement and should be recognised as such but unfortunately in order to uphold this, narrative and character development are sacrificed.",

    "review": "  15 year old production hiatus, drastic changes in shooting locations, cast revamp. The fact that Mad Max Fury Road, the 4th installment of a long forgotten but highly revered franchise was made braving all these odds is nothing short of an incredible event in the recent movie history. And oh yes it's a sight to behold.Fury road takes us back to the arid dystopia which auteur George miller introduced about 35 years ago. Only now Miller has upped his game by several notches. Thanks to the massive $ 150 mn budget and creative freedom conferred on the creators by the studio. Landscapes are brighter, more dreadful, vehicles bigger and more revved up, the mad madder. Enter Immortan Joe, a ghoulish dictator/self-proclaimed messiah who has taken over an entire citadel by stealing its water supply. Under his wing is an army of ailing skinheads called the 'War Boys' who have been promised slots in Valhalla in exchange for suicidal fanaticism towards Joe and his ideas. This works very well given the downcast society where everyone is looking for redemption . Status quo turns into bedlam when Joe's army imperator, Furiosa (Played by the dazzling Charlize theron) goes rogue after stealing Joe's most prized possessions, his wives during a supply run. What ensues is a long exhilarating, chase sequence between furiosa and Joe accompanied by his army of white minions. Thrown in the midst of all this chaos is Max Rockitanksy who is picked as a human power cell by Nux, a starry eyed war boy for his pursuit on fury road. While max was rigged with ample gadgetry in the previous movies he is stripped down to one single instinct, that of survival (The Famous interceptor is shredded between two giant trucks in one of the scenes). Against will he is forced to help furiosa and the wives flee to a safe haven called the green place. Lean plot? Yes. Shallow? Definitely not. Amidst all the edge of the seat action sequences it is easy to miss the subtexts which the writers have carefully interlaced with the main story line. While the original script was slated as one long chase sequence, it became denser with time like a bottle of aging wine. Furiosa's missing arm (the elephant in the room), freakish figures scavenging swamps, Max's strange time hopping visions might all be part of a bigger universe whose surface was merely grazed in fury road. We will have to wait for the promised sequels to watch these elements unfold. (Yes there are more movies in line). At the helm of the movie is a mastermind who has crafted his art of direction over years. While he might be pretty inconsistent in making movies George Miller's devotion and bravura puts most his younger contemporaries to shame. Millers uses his outlandish creativity and visceral filmmaking style to make some of the most unforgettable action sequences ever made. Oscar winning cinematographer John Seale (The English patient) who came out of retirement for the project delivers with some stunning shots of Namibian Desert. The art direction and production design are equally stellar. Be it the adorable tumors on Nux's neck , the super cool skeleton engraving on the war rigs door or suave interiors of Immortal's Elysium , the amount of detail that has gone into each character, vehicle or set piece is simply staggering. (Check out the vehicle gallery on the official movie to know what I'm talking about). It would be a sin not to mention Margaret Sixel who puts her editing skills to to make the entire movie look like one long thrilling chase sequence. Junkie XL's operatic score works as a perfect complement to the mood of the movie. But the real stars of the movie in my opinion is its stunt crew. It is incredible and admirable how these guys pulled off a majority of death defying, jaw dropping, and plain batshit crazy stunts with real people and real vehicles instead of doing it the easy way. War boys, polecats, flamers would all have stayed as concepts had it not been for their raw calculated gutsiness. My adulation goes for the entire stunt team. This is analog movie making at its best. If you didn't see this on the biggest loudest screen, you definitely missed something. One of the biggest surprises of Fury Road was how the movie was not about Max but Furiosa, a warrior equally or more broken than the titular character (We see what you did there with the deceiving trailers, WB). Deeply conflicted and often poignant she tries to bring sense to a mad society. Played flawlessly by Charlize Theron, Furiosa is easily one of the strongest female characters to emerge out of an action flick. She is definitely among the ranks of Ellen Ripley, Sarah Conor and likes. Replacing Mel Gibson is a more reticent, feral, Tom Hardy who gets the job done but becomes subdued by Furiosa's intense screen charisma. Nicholas Hoult also puts a heartfelt performance as Nux, a rather demure war boy and Hugh Kayes Byrne as the nefarious yet graceful antagonist. Against all the praises I have heard some strong criticisms about the apparent feminist undertones of the story, but I wonder does it really matter? At heart Fury Road is a straight up action flick with beautifully choreographed stunts, minimal dialogues, strong characters and a seemingly linear storyline. There is no subtle way to put it. Fury Road is every adrenaline Junkies dream come true. If road warrior is the punk's Sistine chapel, Fury road is summer action flick's Holy Grail .",

    "review": "  To let you know I had not watched the original Mad Max movies when I had watched this film, so my judgment comes from the film on its own basis, and using that fact I must saw that George Miller does a good job as far as the cinematography of it. John Seale, the cinematographer, does a exceptional job here. There are many shots of the film that feel like the belong here. John Seale also did some of the Harry Potter movies were he also did a great job in. The action is directed to perfection and left me in awe struck at the amount of time and special effects put into this film with no cgi being added to boggle it down. As for characters Tom Hardy is good as Max. He hardly says a word and I really love that when watching the film. I loved that he was all about action and doing stuff and not so much about talking, because a lot of times in the movies just your facial expressions can say so much about a scene, and Tom Hardy was no exception. The fact of the matter is that he was undoubtedly Max. Now Charlize Theron I adored as Furiosa. She was what won the movie for me and made it awesome. I still remember after seeing this film the first thing I thought was \"Dam she could be a great Wonder Woman.\" I mean seriously forget Gal Godat and get Charlize to play Diana, and bet I would love it along with everyone else. I mean the woman really does lead these women from the terrible and crooked husband. Nicholas Hoult and Hugh Keays-Byrne sadly were not as good or interesting. I mean they were just raging fits of anger. They didn't think and they had no brain. I mean really they were not compelling villains at all. In fact I found myself quite bored with them to the point were it didn't make any sense. Now with that being said I am going into all the problems with this film. The lack of story- While there were interesting characters it lacked any type of good characters which hinders the film quite a bit for me cause I do like a good story. That being said there is some story here unlike what people are saying it just takes some time to get to itThe entire first 20 mins were boring- I mean at first I was into it, but it felt like the action sequence would just keep going and going and honestly if it wasn't for my desire to finish my food I probably would have gone to sleep. Not good movie. Not good at all. The villains suck!!!- No really they do. There bad and awful villains to the point were I wanted them all dead. __ OK now that the issues are out the way the film is still decent enough. I won't be recommending it to anyone probably unless there just really into action films tho. Still tho there is a lot that we can still love with Mad Max: Fury Road which is why I am still giving it a 7/10.",

Tom Hardy, who I like very much, had a hard time stepping out of the shadow of older Maxes who shall not be named, yet held my attention well. But:1. It seemed that F & M were a perfect match. Why didn't they actually hit it off?2. The ritual of the \"culture\" was WAY overdone. There's value in ritual, especially for \"primitive\" cultures like that into which civilization had devolved in the movie; but beyond a certain point, ritual becomes a survival risk.3. Why didn't Furiosa speak Aussie?4. No reason is given for Max leaving, except that Max always leaves. Honestly, couldn't something have been done with that? Why can't Max finally find something that can make up, even just a bit, for the loss of his family?",

With brilliant visual and practical effects, tons of creative imagery, engaging characters, great acting, pulse-pounding music, and exhilarating action, Fury Road is a thrilling cinematic experience.",

THIS Mad Max really doesn't have a drop of blood in it. A lot of \"crash. boom, bam\" but nothing really at stake. If you are expecting to see the old gritty, hardcore Mad Max where death, rape, and dismemberment are just around the corner... you are not going to find it here. If you want another homogenized 21st century type \"action\" film, it's worth a look.",

The antidote to the onslaught of comic book superheroes and vigilantes of the last few years was anti-hero Max... or so we thought. Director George Miller subverted all our expectations of this film, from tweaking the gender roles in action films to astronomical production aesthetics. Few directors have the tenacity to unleash the kind of physical carnage Miller splashes across the screen here. You'll barely have a second to breathe as he seamlessly shifts from one insane set piece to another, ratcheting up the stakes and assembling his meticulous symphony of carnage with the combined result being one of the most successfully ambitious action extravaganzas committed to film.",

But, suffice to say, it was good. Very good. The first 20 minutes or so are, to be frank, the weakest part of the movie. Its slow, somewhat uninteresting and as a newcomer its admittedly a little hard to get on board with the madness (pun not intended). But as the movie progresses, um, yeah, so......The action is sensational. This is one of the best action movies I've seen, and its weird how one and a half hours of action can greatly sustain your interest.Tom Hardy as Max was brilliant and so was Charlize Theron as Furiosa, and the setting was prettey sublime. There were a few things that bothered me though. One, was that Nicholas Hoult's character, whilst a great character, had a romance with some girl which blossomed in about 3 minutes, and I'm not even exaggerating.Also there was admittedly a lot of screaming and nothingness in terms of plot. But, honestly, by the time the film concluded, I had the biggest, happiest grin on my face in a long while.",

Each Mad Max movie pretty much stands on its own, including this one. Even more with this one since Mel Gibson didn't return, and this movie has a very different style to it than the others as well. This movie is very simple in the story department, but the main draw of the film is the extreme, practically non stop action, and just crazy world. George Miller did a great job focusing on practical effects over CG, and it shows in some ridiculously awesome action. The soundtrack is also amazing, perfectly putting the action into a musical form, even serving as the sound effect track for a good portion of the movie. The movie is just really exciting, adrenaline pumping craziness. It's definitely a weird universe though, which I could see turning some people away, and it can also take a while to figure out just exactly what's going on with the world as well, and what story is there is pretty thin, but the main focus of the movie is on the action, world building, visuals, and the soundtrack, and in those areas, I can think of very few films that do as well as Fury Road did.Personal Grade: S+Technical Score: 82%",

    "review": "  Believe the hype. Max is back and he's kicking ass. While Tom Hardy isn't quite as good at being Mad Max as Mel Gibson was (srsly, Gibson is a raging bigot. He's already mad), he has the look and his terse acting actually helps him sell his traumatized road warrior persona. Charlize Theron is the woman of the hour as Furiosa, a badass warrior woman out to redeem herself. The plot begins with Max being captured and Furiosa making off with some precious goods that Immortan Joe, the ruler of The Citadel, can't let slip away. Max is serving as a \"blood bag\" for Nux, a Warboy with terminal cancer. Nux figures chasing down Furiosa is his last chance at immortal glory, so he drags Max along for the ride. Thus, the chase begins.Every character cast for this film is pretty much perfection. If you remember the bizarre characters from Road Warrior, you'll recognize similar horrors and mutants here. The world is dead and irradiated, so there's plenty of twisted creations all around. The gangs themselves are all very well-defined, as are their leaders (I loved the Guntown dude's vehicle). The music is fantastic, and the environments are legit video game-quality otherworldly (the storm sequence and the swamp were particularly awesome). The action as a whole puts the end chase in Road Warrior to absolute shame, which is a tall order but one that Fury Road fulfills.My only issues with the movie were that the 3D stuff was overdone, the movie should have been an hour longer (I still prefer 3-hour movies for films that aspire to real art), and some leaps in logic (apparently everyone in the post-apocalypse has the same blood type). But those things aside, Fury Road is well worth the price of admission. Action movies will be compared to this for a long time to come.",

The cinematography for this film is an absolute marvel- showcasing the sprawling outback desert through hues of oranges and reds during the daytime, contrasting it with beautiful midnight blues at night. All this comes together to give the movie a very lively atmosphere. The score alleviates the sense of rush and is smartly used diegetically as well as non-diegetically. The action scenes are shot brilliantly with minimal special effect, furthering its case as a masterpiece. Finally the acting especially that of Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa is top-notch and no character is left needing further characterisation. Tom Hardy's Max is a man of little words, but the performances are so strong that the movie doesn't need dialogue in order to flourish. This movie is definitely not hyped up- go see it and then go see it again.Rating: 5/5",

    "review": "  George Miller burst onto the cinematic landscape in 1979 with the 70's exploitation car chase masterpiece Mad Max then exceeded the brilliance of that debut with a sequel (Mad Max 2) that truly cemented him as a visionary and visceral filmmaker. Now, almost thirty-five years later, Miller demonstrates with Mad Max: Fury Road that he's lost none of his vitality; however, where previously the thinness of plot and character felt appropriate in this franchise, here they read as omission and highlight the fact that at the end of the day this is little more than a well-executed two-hour car chase.Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is the true hero of this story. Despite living in the aggressively patriarchal society of the Citadel ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) she has attained a position of some authority. When she sets out on a trade mission she takes with her a group of Immortan's breeders with the intention of seeking refuge in a remote society of women. Max (Tom Hardy), spends the first half hour of the film held captive as a human blood bag for one of Immortan's goons until he escapes and teams up with Furiosa.Miller's strong point is the detail with which he paints his world. The colours, the costumes, the makeup, the souped up vehicles, the dare-devil stunts, the magnificent collisions, the heavy metal guitarist screeching out the pursuit's soundtrack. It's riveting stuff. Imaginative and witty. And as an exercise in action direction it's pretty flawless. But the film aspires to being more than a thrilling roller coaster ride. It asks us to care. And on this level it falls short.We learn in the opening scene that Max failed to protect his wife and daughter and so (groan) there are subsequent snippets of his daughter haunting him throughout the film. The breeders are all so damn beautiful (including super model Rosie Huntington Whiteley) and given little chance to develop individually that their shared plight is easy to dismiss. The developing bond between Furiosa and Max thankfully doesn't end with a kiss but nor is it of much consequence. Nicholas Hoult, as one of Immortan's gang, has a defined arc in the story which only makes you wonder why him and no one else?Theron, with her buzz cut, racoon eyes and prosthetic arm, makes a fine action heroine. Hardy, similarly, has just the right brooding presence (and pouty lips) to more than comfortably fill Mel's boots. They look great together and I wish they were given more to do than drive from A to B and back again. Another subplot, another significant complication would've been welcome meat on these narrative bones. Fury Road is indeed audacious and thrilling but you'll come away affected far more by Miller's virtuosity than the film itself.",

The complexity of its action scenes and their individual, often awe-inspiring shots alone aren't the film's only attributes, however. Making beautiful use color in its dessert landscapes, incredible locale and vehicle design, and a perfect use of pacing -- especially in the kinetic energy of action scenes -- director George Miller and his team create something that doesn't really come along often. As much praise as other \"artistic\" action films like The Dark Knight receive, that example doesn't even come close to the skill on display in the conception and editing of Max's set pieces. It's light on story, but sometimes a film can be almost perfect without one. Sometimes.",

    "review": "  \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is completely unique. Its visual appeal and creativity can't be denied, but it is also one of the strangest films that you will ever experience. In a market where every genre is saturated with films that recycle the same concepts and ideas, it is rare to find a film as unique as this one. It even feels unique when compared with the \"Mad Max\" films of the 80's. George Miller is no stranger to the film industry and \"Fury Road\" may be his masterpiece. I think that it is really cool that Miller wrote a new chapter into his series 30 years after the last film. Most of this story is told without dialogue. The action is constant and the imagery drives the story for better or for worse (we will never forget the brief milking scene or the idea of a \"blood bag\"). Immortan Joe's mask is terrifying and the production team convincingly transformed all of the actors into nuclear holocaust survivors. I appreciated the performances by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, though any sort of emotion seems to be overshadowed by the previous and next action sequence. This one won't be winning any Oscars in acting categories, but it will certainly make a run in categories like Production Design, Film Editing, and Sound Editing. To be honest, I was a little bit disappointed with the film. It had so much hype for its entire theatrical run, augmented by a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 97%, and I just did not receive the amount of character development as I expect from a critically acclaimed film. Still, I will be the first to admit that I need to see it again to process everything that happened and may adjust my rating afterward. My wife and I are still scratching our heads about the electric guitar guy (who we have discovered is named \"The Doof Warrior\"). We assumed that he was symbolic or sort of reference to the original films, but apparently he is exactly what he appears to be: a flame-spewing guitarist who pumps up the rest of the troops. I suppose that he left a big enough impression that he is the only character that I have discussed. The most well-written character in the film is Nux and we grow attached to him because he undergoes the greatest transformation. I look forward to watching this film again and believe that the sequels will be even better if they deliver the same amount of action while including a greater transformation of their characters. There are a lot of cheesy sci-fi films from the 70's and 80's that involve vehicles (\"Death Race 2000\" is the first one that comes to mind), but the vehicles are perfectly incorporated into this film's creative atmosphere and they are just cool. Everybody loves \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" for its creative post-apocalyptic story and constant stream of action. I believe that the Academy Awards will acknowledge its effort and remind the film industry that action films can blow our minds with more than just the action.",

    "review": "  Could one of the best films of 2015 be a sequel to a movie from the 1970s featuring amazing chases, swashbuckling action, all connected through a distinct mythology and set in a time that seems too fantastic to be real? The crazy answer is \"yes, yes it can\" and the funny thing is I'm not talking about that little film with Star Wars in the title. Since the 1979 original, writer/director (and doctor) George Miller has given the world two other iterations of Mad Max-1981s The Road Warrior and 1985s Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (whom George Ogilvie shared a co-directing credit)-but this newest take proves an old vehicle can learn many new tricks with 2015s Mad Max: Fury Road-a legitimate candidate to be one of the most influential films currently made. With a plot told almost exclusively through visual storytelling, Miller and his staff have truly outdone themselves with what the cinematic medium can do-driving from one scene to the other with frenetic pacing, inspired use of editing (which it should win an Oscar with) and subtle yet dramatic acting from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Hardy and Theron-playing main protagonists Max Rockatanksy and Imperator Furiosa, respectively (you have to love names like that)-epitomize the brawn and finesse of Miller's filmmaking aesthetic. Amid the brutal carnage of the chases there is a chaotic fluidity to it all that evokes a beautiful dance-blending music and movement to please the senses. This level of sophistication has been hinted at in the previous films, often with socially sensitive issues that evoked the times they were made in. With real-world oil shortages in the 70s being a major headline, the preservation and fight for gasoline was at the focal point in the original three. This has now been replaced with the preservation of life, an inspired and logical way to go, showing the value of conscious awareness and preserving this place called home; Earth (similar themes were touched upon in Miller's 2006 Oscar-winning film Happy Feat). The underlining theme of survival (that spans each entry) is representative of what Mad Max: Fury Road is-a film that breathes life, has a \"never say die attitude\" but expresses the limitless freedom and determination of what people can achieve.",

    "review": "  Loud, proud, and yet relentlessly incoherent, Mad Max: Fury Road is a disaster of a film masquerading as bold. A reboot, at least of sorts, of the franchise previously headlined by Mel Gibson, director George Miller brings the outlandish post-apocalyptic world back to the screen. We find Max (Tom Hardy) captured at the hands of a crazed war lord, only to find himself mixed up in the escape of the vaunted female Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and the Warlord's many prized wives. Those that are prone to like Mad Max will point to the action scenes as proof of the film's inventive and unabashedly brutal nature. To a large extent this is true, the film does look good, and the action sequences feature uniquely conceived devices, feel impactful, and are extremely well choreographed and otherwise executed. Mad Max, to be sure, can be fun to watch. This is all fine until the point in which one dares to ask, 'what am I watching'?Simply put, Mad Max is an absolute narrative mess. Very little is explained, only the thinnest most idiotic delivered exposition is ever given, and then the sole purpose is to set up a 10 or 15 minute fight or chase scene, meanwhile leaving any characterization, plot, or coherent narrative structure in the dust. Big vehicles blowing up are good, eyes being gouged out-that's great, but in order to constitute a movie there needs to be some semblance of a storyline, some reason for us to be invested in the characters. The script deficiencies don't stop at a lack of storytelling, the dialogue is extremely sparse and quite literally dumbed-down. It feels as if it's penned by a behavior disorder fifth grader trying to be naughty during language arts. Utter nonsense comes out of characters with inexplicable motivations, histories, or personas. One might think the film's cast, featuring Charlize Theoron and Tom Hardy would be a saving grace. Talented actors as they are, they are adrift in a film that wallows in absurdity and disorganization. Neither actor is developed, and one must ask, why Max had the honor of the film's title? The character of Max in this film is relegated to that of a side character, and a rather uninteresting one at that. The reasons for this are curious and perhaps politically motivated but, regardless, it was a dumb one. Hardy is an incredible talent and to have him so underutilized is perhaps one of the greatest cinematic crimes of 2015. Outrageously terrible. 1.5/5 Stars",

To say it is a thrill ride would be an understatement. There is one 5-10 minute scene of the movie where you can catch your breath when they are stopped and trying to figure out where to head, and that is it. The entire movie from the opening second to the finish is packed with non stop fast moving action. Even if you have no idea who the character is or what this movie is about, give it a shot if you are looking for a great action movie. There really isn't too much dialogue at all to talk about. Just know that Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are both really good. And I commend both of them for not being afraid to be part of a movie like this. Some big name actors might find it silly to accept a role in a movie like this with George Miller directing. A 2 hour car chase war with these elaborate man made put together vehicles, it is absolutely awesome to see. You keep waiting to see what the next gang of bandits has in store for the main characters as they are driving across this deserted landscape. It is a downright fun movie with amazing action throughout, surely one of the best movies of the year. God forbid it gets any Oscar attention though, the academy I'm sure is \"above\" picking films like this, even though they deserve it.",

Tons. Does Tom Hardy mumble and grunt most of the film? You bet.But all of that is inconsequential to the fact that Fury Road is one of the most visually stunning, engrossing, and glorious films of the year. In an age of overuse of CGI, Fury Road is also a miracle to even exist. But George Miller's proper use of CGI and practicality put other films to shame. This goes for both the stunning scenes of vehicular carnage, as well as the costume designs, including Immortan Joe's mask. This film's cinematography is Oscar-worthy.Charlize Theron gives an iconic performance as Imperator Furiosa. Nicolas Hoult, as Nux, delivers the best character arc of the film. And Tom Hardy - who proved with Locke that he doesn't need to move much to command a fascinating performance - proves that he doesn't need to speak much either to be a captivating. The backstories are implied enough that they don't need to be delved into and fleshed out. What's on the surface is gritty and excellent enough. And the bizarre scenes - including a guitar-wielding flamethrower called the Doof Warrior - add to the film's intensity and post-apocalyptic world-building. Needless to say, Mad Max: Fury Road may be one of the best action thrillers in a long time. It's certainly one of the best films of 2015, by far.",

Absolutely grotesque good and bad heroes fight for gas in a post-apocalyptic future society in a movie that can only be described as post-modern and cyberpunk. The exhilarating action is so intense that even the rotten tomatoes critic got curried away and gave it an almost perfect score (97%). Tom Hardy (known for Inception and The Dark Knight Rises) has become the next big thing in Hollywood due to this remake. Charlize Theron (an absolutely top actress overall) is simply great in the post-feminist role of Imperator Furlosa. Nevertheless, as one might expect, the fight for gas idea, which was original, innovative and to the point in 1979, has not aged very well and seems quite ridiculous today. Still, the movie is top notch as an action film with some very funny moments and you will remember it for some time, not for it's non-existent deeper meanings but for it's overambitious and grotesque cyberpunk environment.Grade: B-",

    "review": "  Fury Road, a�fourth installment in the long dormant Mad Max franchise, feels�simultaneously familiar and inexplicably alien. The desolate backdrop, thrilling chases, and camera work recall The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome but it's all so damn useless. Our long standing hero Max, presumably the character audiences are coming to see, all but�disappears behind�the narratives of new additions�Nux and Furiosa. Why make another Mad Max film if Tom Hardy has to sit�in the passenger seat?Writer/director George Miller never had much success fleshing out back story for his characters or the origin of their world and he seems to have completely lost interest in trying. Viewers who did not see the original trilogy of films are given no understanding of who Max is or why he's fighting for survival alone in the wastes.�Fury Road provides little more information about its�supposed lead than \"I used to be a cop\" and \"Max. My name is Max\". Wow. Profound.Friends and fellow reviewers alike have countered these critiques by reminding me of how \"beautiful and exciting\" the film is. I agree that Fury Road is visually impressive but I'm not sure what's exciting about not using your brain. Tom Hardy grunting�and shooting his way through a thin script certainly doesn't thrill me, no matter how well-lit the sand is. If you want car chases and explosions for hours on end then why not just play the video game?�",

The action has a special rhythm to it, so your eyes don't have to wonder. Lastly, the way the movie is shot is mainly in wide shot; which reveals more of the action.",

    "review": "  Alright, I may have been too harsh on Mad Max: Fury Road initially. I still don't think it is in any way a masterpiece, but the action sequences are glorious and at times truly thrilling. George Miller can't be praised enough for avoiding CGI as much as possible, and instead relying on death-defying stunt work, and a huge lot of practical effects. It's hard to imagine how much planning and rehearsal had to go into orchestrating these sequences of pure exhilaration. Still, there is not much beyond the fireworks to hold everything together. The actual story isn't all that compelling or surprising, and a tad more characterization would have been welcome. When it comes to dramatic weight Fury Road is fairly bare bones, to say the least. There are also a lot of stylistic flourishes that I just didn't really care for. With that said, the extended chases are certainly impressive and the cinematography and editing is truly outstanding.",

    "review": "  As a fan of the dystopic movies, I saw the Mad Max trilogy a couple years ago b/c I heard they were shining exemplars of the genre and have great action to boot. I came away disappointed by the lack of an interesting plot to complement the over-the-top action sequences and the post-apocalyptic setting (the two sequels in particular). So you can imagine my excitement when news came of a new sequel. But after seeing rave reviews from friends and critics alike (e.g. this site), I decided to give the franchise another try, expecting somehow this time would be different.Apparently the director decided the problem with his three previous attempts was that there wasn't enough adrenaline and proceeded to make the same mediocre movie, but with everything turned up to 11. So instead of a mere waste time, Fury Road was a spectacular waste of time. I mean this in the literal sense: the action sequences were quite the spectacle and allow us a glimpse of the atavistic savagery that lurks beneath our superficial civility; and the lead actors very much impressed in the physical acting department. But those positives were rendered hollow by a script (one which I can only assume was written by a rather talented 13 year-old) that offers little character development and a plot that can be adequately summed up as (spoiler) \"Guy and girl go from point A to point B and back to point A, kill bad guys along the way and save the day\". The chases, fights and explosions soon became trite and, after two exhausting hours, something to be tolerated rather than relished. The handful of attempts to humanize the good characters also looked clumsy and forced, as incongruous as the brief tender string interludes amidst the near-constant industrial drumming that filled up most of the run time. In the end, this movie offers neither hope (e.g. Children of Men) nor despair (Brazil), just the anodyne comfort that the good guys won and all is right with the world again -- at least until the next sequel comes along (which shouldn't be long as there is a 5th installment on the way).So in conclusion, if you're looking for 2 hours of mindless vroom and boom interrupted by an alleged plot, this is your flick. But if you appreciate even only an ounce of subtlety and intelligence, avoid this movie like the plague. In fact, if you just want to watch Tom Hardy drive around the whole movie, you would find Locke a far superior alternative.",

    "review": "  What a Lovely Day Indeed.Writer-Director George Miller has revisited and reinvented his Mad Max franchise quite flamboyantly. In full disclosure, I had no idea that Mad Max was a pre existing franchise until after I saw the first trailer for the film. Although, When I saw Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, I became slightly interested. I believed that these two oozed amazing chemistry. Like the previous installments, there was a nuclear war that led us to this post-apocalyptic world. Food and water are noticeably scarce. From beginning to end, it is non-stop over the top action. It fairly reminded me of the old video game 'Twisted Metal\" which we all know is all about absolute mayhem. So many explosions, so many collisions, so much anarchy!!!! This film roars with an absolute vengeance!!!!!! Every aspect of the film is beautiful. The score by Junkie XL was absolutely riveting. It had my heart racing when the action started up and it just felt so perfect. It really placed the film on a more grand scale. This really excites me because XL produced the score for the upcoming film Dawn of Justice, along with Hans Zimmer. So, I am definitely intrigued to see what those two were able to accomplish together. My favorite thing about the film was definitely the camera work. The way that George Miller and John Seale were able to make this world look so visually stunning yet still so destitute is by far some of the best camera work I have seen this year. The rotations and the tracking shots were just wonderful to see. This a film that is made for the big screen. It is absolutely visually stunning. The vehicles they created for this film look like something straight out of a comic book and when you see them you can't help but to stare in awe. It makes this world of desperation something to be slightly desired. The acting definitely is a high point for me as well, because the ball could have easily been dropped if not handled properly. For instance, when Charlize Theron is on screen, she steals every second. She is almost unrecognizable as a tortured soul who has had enough of this so called society. Everything that she does seems so instinctual and sometimes, although justified, barbaric. She really becomes her character and allows herself to be taken into this world.For those that may have grown a bit tired of the post- apocalyptic films that we have been bombarded with over the years, fear not, for Mad Max: Fury Road has successfully changed the game. In the beginning sequence of the film, we meet the eponymous character Max Rockatansky, played by the incomparable Tom Hardy. We quickly realize that he is already in a bit of a pickle. Just from the opening ten minutes, we learn that he's a troubled soul and that he is doing the same thing that everyone else in this world has been forced to do: survive. His survival skills are instantly put to the test once he is captured by the War Boys, the army of Immortan Joe, the film's main antagonist. The capture scene is so well choreographed and so amazing to watch. The world that Miller creates is so unique and beautiful: something that only his mind could conjure up. It's an absolute barren wasteland full of vehicular warfare of the greatest caliber. The film is full of a mass population that looks savage; however, these are just everyday people that are trying to survive. At this time, all that people know is carnage, chaos and catastrophe. Naturally, we should all be able to relate to the survival aspect. There is no order. Only a seemingly tyrannical rule, led by one Immortan Joe. There are some who follow, hence his army of War Boys, and there are some that believe that he is the reason that the world is still the way it is, insert Imperator Furiosa. Fury Road explains how Max, who seems to be a bit of a drifter, meets and works with Imperator Furiosa. Once these two meet up, it is non-stop action. While the action slows down a bit, you learn Furiosa's purpose and it is a rather plausible story arc. As a moviegoer who appreciates dialogue, I was a bit disappointed in some of the writing. Some of it seemed to be forced and other parts seem like they did not belong at all. For example, there is one instance in the film where Miller tries to create some emotional investment between two of the characters. However, in my opinion, it translate well. The film is well paced and at a run time of 2 hours flat, it's a really good film to go see with friends especially if you are an action junkie. Oddly enough, after watching this film, I do not have any interest in viewing the original Mad Max trilogy starring Mel Gibson. I loved this film and I just feel like this is something that can very well stand on its own. A very interesting take on a post apocalyptic world from the Mastermind George Miller. He successfully created one of the best action films I've ever seen.",

You get to See movie, the action is not to fast for the eye. Great movie.",

    "review": "  This movie is one of the most insane and chaotic movies of the summer. With George Miller returning to the helm for another installment of Mad Max, it is our viewing pleasure that we get to witness such a high explosive film. This film stars Tom Hardy, who plays the role of Max, alongside fellow stars Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult. Most of the actors in this movie do a phenomenal job, and even though Tom Hardy's character was the least interesting, he did an amazing job, as always. If we're on the topic of characters, George Miller really fumbled the ball here. Max is definitely the 3rd most interesting character along with being the 2nd strongest character. Charlize Theron's character was definitely put in the spotlight more and she was the bigger bad-ass. I'm not saying this out of opinion, but the movie clearly shows on several occasions that she is the stronger power and even the more interesting. Max had the least amount of depth given to him (which is ironic considering his name is in the title) and he had the most basic, undeveloped back-story you can imagine. They spent more time developing the character of Nicholas Hoult (which was actually a good surprise), rather than developing their main character. This movie though, was filled tons of action and was the equivalent to a 2 hour video game. The cinematography is amazing and everything looks so well done. The CGI is solid for the most part, but the movie does a great job of relying on practical effects and explosions. There were some moments where I felt that the CGI background looked really bad, but other than that, they did a good job of utilizing their budget. On the contrary, watching a video game for 2 hours doesn't leave a whole lot of room for plot development. The movie sports a basic plot that says get from point A to point B. That's all the movie really is. Nothing is really explained and nothing really has meaning. They just see how much action they can fill into 2 hours. Like I said, it makes for an extremely entertaining movie, but I wasn't able to connect to the situation nor the characters. When they tried to develop plot in the movie, it felt like it came to a dead stop. There was a point where nothing was going on and I was actually bored. They seem to throw in random, useless plot elements and it makes me groan. For example, at one point, Max and the crew meet up with these \"mothers\" that help them fight for their freedom. I'm sure this was connected to the other Mad Max movies, but if it wasn't. then this was the most useless and boring plot device in the movie. They seemed helpless and unnecessary and the whole pit stop derailed the movie. I know it seems like I have a lot of gripes about this movie, but I really don't. It was a great action thriller that was extremely crazy and intense. I love a lot of the unique aspects in this movie and the level of crazy that they go up to. They do things unimaginable to most human beings and it's a really fun summer movie. In the end, Mad Max is certainly worth watching and one that I myself own on Blu-Ray.",

    "review": "  Physical effects make a triumphant return to the GGI saturated season of summer blockbusters. Max Rockatansky has emerged from the waste land in Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) to show us the light of epic cinema. George Miller gets another bite at the Mad Max apple and produces a Lawrence of Arabia (1962, David Lean, UK) type epic while making a strong feminist statement in a post apocalyptic acid trip fever dream.  I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the uncanny valley but the epic scope of Lawrence of Arabia (1962, David Lean, UK) versus Revenge of the Sith (2005, George Lucas, USA) is apparent to anyone whose viewed both. CGI is helpful and can be a great asset to a filmmaker. Fury Road has over 2,000 visual effects shots[i]. That being said it's not how much CGI you use but how you use it. It's the motion in the ocean not the size of the boat. Often Miller's use of CGI is used to color correct shots, add clouds to the clear Namibian sky, and dessert rocks turned a much richer hue.  After screening Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) themes George Miller was hinting at in Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome (George Miller, AUS, 1985) became much clearer. The Triple Goddess helps redeem Max when he is at his most feral, his humanity holding on by a shred and our titular hero can only manage guttural sounds in lieu of language. Tom Hardy plays the titular character in this latest Mad Max incarnation. Max fights to protect the maiden or in this case maidens. He is aided and rescued by the mother and in this case the mother is the warrior Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron crushes this role), and lastly he is aided by the crone. In Miller's post apocalyptic wasteland the crone is a bunch of motorcycle driving, seed toting, rifle shooting bad ass grandmas. At one point Max washes blood off his hands using the contents of a tanker full of mother's milk.The themes in Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) are often not subtle but don't seem heavy handed in a movie that has little to no exposition. In an era when movies find it necessary to have a pseudoscience explanation for our super heroes and science fiction it's refreshing to have a movie not crow bar in needless exposition. Much like Sergio Leone Miller uses action and his actor's body language and facial expressions to convey story instead of relying on dialogue. In Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) there's no time to waste with monologues as the drums of war beat in the distance and a war party race towards you and among them is flame throwing guitar player strapped to a flat bed full of speakers racing down the dessert with dozens of other maniacs painted white. Oh did I forget to mention the maniacs in white body paint drive hot rods that have gentlemen with explosive spears ridding atop them.  I've heard the notion bandied around that George Lucas is treated unfairly by adult fans who didn't like the prequels. That the movies were not bad they were just now adults and not the target audience as they were in 1977. Mad Max: Fury Road (George Miller, AUS, 2015) takes that thesis and crumples it up and tosses it in the rubbish bin. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (George Miller, AUS, 1981) & the Star Wars trilogy live in the same sweet spot in my pre-adolescent heart. In fact they are probably neighbors and enjoying going over each other's homes for summer BBQs or drinks around the holidays. Coincidently they live down the street from Raiders of Lost Ark (Steven Spielberg, USA, 1981). If my review hasn't been clear up till now stop reading this and go see this movie NOW!By Jake Cohen5 out of 5 Martin Riggs(s). RECOMMEND",

Film is 100 years old and change, and in that time i have seen most every version of the car chase and fight, then mad max comes along and give you 2 hours of action you have never seen before. George Miller does a flawless job of creating and executing this set pieces as well as creating a unique and intriguing post apocalyptic world. This film has strong feminist undertones evening without a complicated plot. Several times the question is asked \"who killed the world?\" and its clear it wasn't the women.

    "review": "  Where in Valhalla did \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" (2015) come from...? For years it was nothing more than a ghost story, limping along in production hell, until finally its trailers released and piqued little to no interest. Now, with the feature finally in cinemas, an unwitting audience has had its eyes opened and re-emerged crazed and amazed. Without warning, \"Mad Max\" has become a must-see theatrical experience and required viewing for filmgoers and filmmakers alike....Don't skip what I just wrote. Must-see is what I put, and must-see is what I mean. This is an unexpected hit that has shaken audiences in the most awe-inspiring and thrilling way imaginable. After a decade of planning, George Miller has finally shown his hand and taken the world by storm - electrical sandstorm, to be precise. After making children's movies for the past couple decades, Miller somehow convinced the studio that he was fit to direct a sequel, not a reboot (the Hollywood weapon of choice), to a film series that hadn't been popular for 30 years. In addition, he seems to somehow have maintained complete creative control over a property of which many millennials (read: target audience) have little to no knowledge. How he pulled this off is a mystery and a miracle - and one of the best things to happen to movies in a long time.\"The Avengers: Age of Ultron\" (2015) has been hotly anticipated, but this summer belongs to the mad.It is simply the most gorgeous, exhilarating film I have seen all year. Breathtaking action is conducted with balletic precision; Miller masterfully leads the eye from beat to beat, giving his scenes room to breathe and his audience a broad scope to behold. He is not afraid to pull back and let every element of his rich, textured world be absorbed, studied, and most importantly, understood in the midst of incredible chaos. The direction and editing stands in stark contrast to the claustrophobic, frenetic camerawork that has dominated action films over the past decade.It's been reported that Miller spent the years leading up to production crafting every element of this post-apocalyptic future in the greatest detail. From mechanical body art and dashboard decor to endless storyboards and a choreography of violent, perpetual motion, Miller's own gleeful madness has crafted a movie so eye-popping in its reality that repeat viewings are a happy necessity. The camera brilliantly frames and deftly tracks through increasingly intricate, explosive, and dynamic chase scenes with deft purpose.Cinematographer John Seale presents us with generously saturated shots, resplendent with deep blues and fiery reds. Even the night scenes are a triumph of art: Seale overexposed these shots during daylight before giving them their midnight blue tint, thus allowing the shade and depth of the elements to be captured and clarified in the dark. Even if you hate everything else about the movie (impossible), it's intensely beautiful just to look at.Although titled \"Mad Max\", Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron absolutely share the lead, with the warrior Imperator Furiosa given just as much narrative depth - if not more - than Hardy's wild dog of a Max. Like Max, Furiosa is a professional badass - even with a missing hand. Their gradual alliance is destined to be one of the most classic pairings in cinema. The nihilistic Max is put to the test by the idealistic Furiosa, her sense of morality a bright light in a dark future. In turn, Furiosa's gambit against Hugh \"I Played Toecutter\" Keays-Byrne's tyrannical Immortan Joe proves disastrous without Max's honed, remorseless instincts. Both the hero and anti-hero plunge into the insanity with only a faint hope of rising above their personal tragedies.Significant portions of the thundering soundtrack are played by Immortan Joe's own band on the run, a raging, tireless team of drummers led by a mutant guitarist shredding an axe so rock 'n' roll that it literally spurts flames. The absurd concept is a wonderfully bizarre choice for the film and a terrible temptation for those of us forced to drive the speed limit on the way home.\"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is a spectacular victory in filmmaking and has rightfully earned its status as a new standard for action movies. Its balance of practical, in-camera effects with tangible CGI imagery, coupled with Miller's patient planning and meticulous layout of his story, is exactly why a movie that could've been another run-of-the-mill action flick has instead become an instant classic....What a film! WHAT A LOVELY FILM!!",

I liked it back then but for obvious reasons it kind of scared me, so it was a bittersweet feeling back then. Watching this one, I kind of went down the memory lane and really enjoyed it! It was both nostalgic but also intense for me, and it did not let me down in terms of effects or the general feeling I had imprinted in my mind! The acting was OK, and I am not sure if it really matters. The movie is so action packed and intense that even less talented actors could have pulled it off I think. I was amazed by the costumes, the make up, the vehicles, everything! The music of the movie was so good! I liked the \"bad guys\" as they seemed and were really really bad and I enjoyed every minute of the chase that goes on for almost the entire movie! The fiction part was there, but it's something you expect in such movies.I was really really close to rate it with a 9 out of 10, but I decided that an 8 is closer to the truth based on other movies of the genre. If I could, I would give an 8.5 to it!",

The action is amazing, some of the best action sequences ever put to film. Furiosa is really the main character of this film as she drives the plot quite literally, Max really only says a few things the entire movie, he is still badass though. The practical effects are what make this movie worth seeing, they could have easily done these amazing action scenes with a computer but that would take away the immersion and this movie would not be what it was, the only drawback is that there is a time when the film really slows down and it gets kinda boring. 4.75/5",

At first I thought he was going to attempt an Aussie accent but soon went straight back into Bain. Nevertheless I do believe he controlled the screen well! The storyline itself was good, simple yet easy to relate and gave a good sense of morality. The main stand out element to this film was the superb special effects and stunts which has been one of the best I've seen within the last 10 years. The film itself knows exactly what it is and plays well upon it, high octane, none stop, balls out action! Contender for film of the year...please stop grunting Tom...",

    "review": "  I would say that this movie is pretty much the kind of movie that I expected it to be. That being said I think it was a bit softer than I hoped it to be. I think that, again, the Hollywood plonkers have opted to make a movie that got a more palate rating (to them and their cash registers) than what it should have been. It is not as obvious as with Robocop and a few other movies but the feeling is there.It is still a fairly entertaining movie. It is of course yet another special effects movie and as such it does not disappoint. It differs from a lot of the usual special effects movies in that the effects are pretty down to Earth in a bizarre way. We are not talking about superheroes or near magical technologies here but instead we have a devastated landscape, scrounged together equipment and a totally ludicrous desire to blow up the last remains of human civilisation. The bizarre vehicle designs and the totally ridicules behaviour of a lot of people in this movie is alone worth watching it to be honest.As with the previous Mad Max movies this one stretches the bounds of reality (I hope) when it comes to human behaviour and how they waste the few precious resources, specifically gasoline and bullets, that remains after the apocalypse. It provides some spectacular scenery but it also puts a bit of \"what the f...\" feeling to it all. Not that this part is not expected from a Mad Max movie though.What I think was my latest let-down in the movie was the Mad Max character itself. To me he is supposed to be a real bad-ass. In this movie he was not really that impressive. He certainly was far from the original Mad Max character in my opinion and was really overshadowed by the Furiosa character. I could have lived with that if this character would have been really impressive but she was not. She was cool but she was still underwhelming when comparing to anything in the original bad-ass Mad Max universe. I would say that Tina Turner and Mel Gibson still rules!Still it is a decent futuristic, apocalyptic action movie, maybe not living up to this old movie geeks expectations, but not at all a wasted movie evening. The sound track of the Blu-ray certainly gave my subwoofer an exercise as well.",

    "review": "  This movie is way better than I thought it would be. It's mindless action fun, of course, but it's an incredible ride, an adrenaline rush from start to finish.� I honestly cannot believe that this is the same director that did the first Mad Max films more than 30 years ago.� The direction is so fresh and energetic, it seems like someone MUCH younger with a fresh perspective on action films would be responsible for such a film.� I'll admit that I was never a fan of the first films (never even saw the third) and found them exceptionally boring.� This film is a complete 180 of the originals, it's jam-packed with action, action and more action.� And it's all awesome.� The whole film is a series of car-chase/fight scenes (Car chases!� Fights!� Fights on top of cars!), yet it never gets boring.� It's visually eye-popping, everything is well-choreographed and composed, and the stunt-work is freakin' incredible.� Luckily, there are some moments of down time where we do get to learn a bit about the� characters. It's just enough to let the audience catch its breath, then off it goes again.� The film doesn't bother explaining the hows and whys of this dystopian future, but shows you the world and society as it is now, complete with a culture that is surprisingly well-developed.� The story isn't that deep or compelling, but it's got more substance than I expected it to.� The acting is solid too, especially by Charlize Theron, who is completely believable as a badass (don't let the title fool you, this movie is Theron's show).�� I do wish there had been a little more explanation of the backstory, sometimes the story and characters' motivations get a bit murky... but there is simply not enough room for that in the movie like this, it would have disrupted the flow.� This movie is pure action spectacle and raw entertainment.� It's a Wham Bam Thank you Ma'am, and everything a summer action flick should be.",

It was exciting, the acting was great, the story (yes, unlike what you've been told there's actually a story) was captivating and, while not really all that original, it felt fresh and unique in how it was told. Overall, this was very entertaining and I look forward to future installments. The negatives were that Charlize Theron has way too large of a role. Even in the trailer and promotional posters, she's clearly the star. Does this hurt the film? Not necessarily but it feels unnecessary. The story should've focused more on Max. We got almost no backstory for his character whatsoever and he maybe speaks a dozen lines. The other element that was a weak point was that some of the scenes were a bit too ridiculous. I expect some of it but not to the extent where you have a guy standing on top of a vehicle traveling at high speeds through the desert while playing an electric guitar with flames coming out of the tip. Yeah, that happens.",

Of course, it is a very simplistic action blow-em up. Characters are archetypes, dialogue comes with a fair amount of spittle, and there are no real revelations here. It is really succeeds best at drawing you in visually and not letting go. You are chained to this balls-out burst of blood and oil spectacle which hurtles along at such a pace that thinking too reflexively is not advised. There has been much made of the film's feminist elements, and they are intentional and well-intended. However, it falls short in the end; as the plot still relies on the trope of the strong silent man with the brave plan whom the queen needs to convince her to not despair and risk the messy death again to do the \"logical\" thing. Come for the satisfying crunch of righteous fury, stay for a captivating sequence of explosions.",

    "review": "  Rarely a film of such epic scale has come with so much anticipation and mystery all at once. The long delayed George Miller 's fourth Mad Max film in the franchise is finally hitting the screens and let me tell you, the 30 years gap between Thunderdome and Furry Road was well worth the wait. The film is actually more a reboot than a sequel and it's maybe for the best. Mastermind G. Miller is back with the most incredible slice of dystopian madness you'll ever experience at the movies these days. When everything look and feel the same with avalanche of CGI and total lack of depth, Miller manages to give his film not only heart and guts but a look absolutely unique and beyond anything I have seen so far. Combining the best of technology and old school film making this new episode of the adventure of the lone desert 'Samurai' has a taste of madness like you will rarely see. Inspired by paintings of Dali and Goya for the visuals and probably a few more, the film plays like a massive chase across the desert, restless and uncompromising, nightmarish as hell but gorgeous as can be. Many themes are tackled along the chase and Miller seems to have understood a long time ago that men are beasts with no real future unless women take control and bring back the necessary balance our world needs if we wish to survive and have a future. The character of Furiosa is shown as an equal to Max and some scenes show them looking very similar to each-others, both broken and desperate for redemption. This films manages to bring back the old school adventure flick, a no brainer on the outside but with a lot of depth if you look closer. Miller is a genius on his own, shots after shots he builds a tension of a rare intensity and manages to offer to his audience a film that will definitely surprise a lot of people through it's unusual pace, messages and visuals. The soundtrack is amazing with a lot of percussions during the chases across the desert, pushing the madness as to have a group of drummers playing on the rooftop of a truck and a heavy metal player blasting his flame thrower guitar while chained to one of the trucks. By now you have figured out that you are dealing with a film like no others, filled with images from another world. It will take me a few days to recover from the experience because i haven't been thrilled by a film this much since El Topo of legendary director A. Jodorowski. By now all hope is for another episode soon, a Mad Max: Furiosa would be quite thrilling, let's only hope mister Georgy won't wait 30 years this time... (BTW did i mention that i have seen the film 11 times in all the movie theaters of the Bay Area? You are a fan or a foe...)",

    "review": "  Mad Max: Fury Road. It's been 30 years since the last time we experienced the escapades of Max Rockatansky and his leader-clad dystopian future. Were the years of waiting worth it? Hell yeah! but not as much as everyone thinks. Of course, it's an action movie, and a phenomenal one at that. Fast-paced, outlandish, and incredibly creative driving sequences make up a decent portion of the film, and these scenes are incredible. But of course, this is what everyone is expecting. I'm noticing very few people are asking \"how's the story?\" or \"how about the characters?\" or \"how does a dystopian future lead to cult driven biker gangs?\" This is the biggest problem with the film, nothing is explained. Why is Max captured by the strange cult? Who is Immortal Joe? How does he have control of all the water? What is the basis of his religion? Who is Furiosa? Why is she leading this convoy? What's the story of all the other gangs? Are they friendly with each other? enemies? Why do Joe's minions spray chrome on their face? Why is Max really involved in all this? All these questions and more will NOT be answered in this film. This is what turned me away during my second viewing of this film. There's a lot of sacrifice of character development and filing in plot holes to make room for all the action. But in theory, that's what Mad Max is. The only film that really had slow moments and focused on the story was Beyond Thunderdome, a film that's overblown by the other two, as well as getting lost in the 80's. At the end of the day, that's all Fury Road is, a chase movie. Although I personally prefer Road Warrior if I'm watching a chase movie. But Mad Max is definitely a great addition to the emerging genre of the Secretly Smart Dick Flicks",

    "review": "  Even at the beginning, there's no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.The film shares Max Rockatansky's (Tom Hardy) adventures. Max is an ex highway patrolman. He's been haunted by the past, by family he never saved. He meets the Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is being pursued by the dictatorial Wasteland leader \"Joe\". Furiosa reaches for Max for help in keeping the 'Five Wives'-women she brought with her-into safety, as Joe's deranged breed of warriors called The War Boys, that are barely humans, are raging across the desert to capture them. This pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape, suddenly sending them into a game of survival.After a rip-roaring opening chase sequence, Max is held captive in the Citadel, the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader \"Joe\" is ruling over. The grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land. This brings the entire populace crippling under his control. As for Max, he becomes merely a blood bag for Nux (Nick Hoult) one of Joe's War Boys, who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader, who has promised them the glory of getting into Valhalla, the promised land.Everything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur, even the feverish chase, even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence. Miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clich�s and retreads, surging into the cinemas, today. It's a visual feast, but surprisingly, with sense. It's explosive in every unimaginable ways, but it's not devoid of a human story, which in this case, is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movie's payroll. Tom Hardy is utterly capable as the main hero, but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on Theron's character. At some point, there would be a sense that Max isn't the only one playing under the spotlight, as it gets evident Furiosa is equally as massive as his role is. Hardy here is singularly stunning, playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required. His mission transcends past his emotional torments and he's never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past. Same can be said with Furiosa, who is not only running from Joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip, but also to bring every woman into safety, back to freedom where they belong.Much of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of Joe's subjugated land, while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way. It's like it doesn't know how to stop, and if it does, that's surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece. There's an enigmatic style Miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world, and it keeps the momentum in tack, if not ever progressing. The tone of the movie, all those vividly dark colors, that magically shifts from something to another, imparts a drowning experience, only it's enjoying and looks festive to the eyes. This makes every eye-squashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza, turning all those burning combustions, metal blasts, and endless pursuits, from mere technical marvels into a hair-raising escapade.Amid these sanity-grabbing action sequences, though, is an emotional streak that keeps Max and Furiousa's humanity alive. This prompts them to survival, into carrying out their similar humane causes, clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society. This turns the movie into something visceral, cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand. It will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives. This needs to be experienced, felt, and forever cherished. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, ignites eternal fire, and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history",

    "review": "  \"Visceral\" is the word most often associated with Fury Road, and it's the right word to describe this film. Everything is satisfyingly crunchy, from the roar of deranged V8 rat rods and muscle cars, to the spectacular action sequences, to the colour-saturated landscape, to the pounding soundtrack, capped off by the unforgettable flame-throwing, guitar-wielding, red-onesie-clad Doof Warrior.From the moment it starts, you'll be dragged along for a pulse pounding chase across the desert. It's a simple enough story, but it's obvious from the start that plenty of thought has been put into constructing this dystopian reality. Small touches will jump out at you, like the intricately designed roof of the War Rig or the ritual scarification of the war boys, that will complete your sense of immersion in this world.The only reason it doesn't get the full five stars is because of the lack of Australian humour, although even that appears in places, and for a touch of sentimentality that jars somewhat with the nihilistic survival themes that characterise the Mad Max films.Other than that, so close to perfect that it doesn't matter! Greatest film of 2015, hands down!",

    "review": "  While moderately overhyped. Mad Max: Fury Road is still a really good movie. In fact I will go to as far and say that its pretty great. And for someone who is not too familiar with the other mad max movies I can safely say that anyone who hasn't seen them will find a lot to enjoy and it may introduce new fans of The series. While Tom Hardy may not share much resemblance to Mel Gibson He does a good job at making the role his own as well as preforming some great stunt work which is what I want to see from this guy. But by far the best Character/performance in the Whole movie is Charlize Theron as Furiosa who steels the entire show and makes it her movie. In fact she is more of a hero than max is in this movie. Visually this movie is absolutely fantastic. This movie is gorgeous to look at if this film wins the Oscar for best Cinematography I will not be disappointed. The number 1 thing fans go for in this kind of film is the action and boy do we get a lot of it. The action scenes pretty much take up take up almost the entire movie and to say that it keeps you on the edge of your seat would be an understatement. But once in a while the film slows down so that we can learn more about the characters especially Furiosa now granted it is very short lived just so that we can get back to the action but I at least give the filmmakers for at least trying for trying to help us latch on to the main character and making us feel for them during the action scenes. Also did why is no one talking about Nicolas Hoult in the movie. He did a great job and I really felt sorry for his character. My only problems with the film would be that the flash backs that max kept having did get a little overused. Yes we get it movie he has a dark past you had 3 Movies to establish this. Also the Villain was really underdeveloped but with a good look and a bad ass voice that does not matter. All around a great film and probably the best experience watching a movie in a while.",

    "review": "  For a movie that's essentially one super-long chase scene (with pit stops), it packs a huge amount of narrative power. Character arcs are well-defined, histories are intriguingly hinted at, and the world-building is mind-boggling. And all this done in the midst of spectacular action sequences. But what strikes one the most is how ANGRY it is (as if the \"Fury\" in the title and character named \"Furiosa\" weren't obvious enough) - angry at the state of women in a destructive patriarchal society such as the world we live in. And that is the reason why this could very well be a game-changer.",

It was just a lot of mind numbing action and explosions. All of that was really cool to watch, burt there wasn't much more to the film than that. I think the best thing about the film, that made it interesting to me, was the way in which it was filmed.

And it's matched only by the stunning cinematography. This movie is gorgeously shot and perfectly edited. Every action scene is natural. It isn't forced, even if there are some very choreographed scenes. It works. And considering the movement of the vehicles as these shots take place, it feels real. I'm sure there are some effects used, but the scale is epic and reminds me of the intensity of the chariot races in \"Ben-Hur.\" Simply said, this movie is brilliant.",

It turns out that the only thing holding The Road Warrior back was a huge pile of money and a light technological touch-up. Mad Max Fury Road uses The Road Warrior as a baseline and takes it to its natural conclusion, a riptide of cars, guns, and hellfire that starts thirty seconds in and keeps going for two hour straight. Its not without its missteps, and some of its flourishes fall flat, but overall, Miller has shown us exactly how good a post-apocalyptic joyride can be.",

What was George Miller thinking when he decided to redo his original movie? Maybe it was to cover up the Mel Gibson controversy, now he has another mess to dispose of. Like Gibson or not, and the original was a bit before my time, the new Mad Max is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I don't know what the lead actors' names are and don't want to know either, because their completely uninspired performances have me wanting to forget everything about them. Oh, Charlize Theron, not my favorite and further down on the list after Fury Road. The movie reminds me more of the Italian knockoff films made to resemble Mad Max than the original Mad max series of films. Action movies do not captivate my interest normally, and this movie reinforced the norm.",

    "review": "  No character development. Whatever little immersion there is, is stripped away whenever Harding speaks. The sped up action sequences keep immersion at bay. The introduction doesn't leave you very impressed with Harding's character, so when we meet Theron's, she isn't built up as a bad ass very well - as its rooted in her hand-to-hand combat with Max.As for world building: spilling water? Are we to believe that anyone survives on such a brief outpour with so much lost to the ground? And what gasoline shortage - everyone and their grandmother, seemingly literally, has an engine in good working order and plenty of juice. Wouldn't have cared less if Max bought it, didn't care when his car bought it. The actors just don't pull any of their scenes off. When the villain fixes to hate the heroes (death of pre-mature son) it looks like he may of just called it a day (silly mask didn't help the actor). When the young hottie takes to meaning business with watching the back or using a gun, it doesn't even live up to the clich�. Zero sexual tension through-out. The Nux and redhead relation wasn't even sweet - again the scenes were weaker than the clich�. I don't even know any names besides Nux and Max.I did like the cinematography of the cool desert night. However, this is where they hatched the idea of travelling 160 days on bikes. Well, maybe if they travelled a mile a day. And of course in a post-apocalyptic world that was short on gas beforehand, there are plentiful bikes - in good working order - enough that the stranger guy gets one laden with supplies and brimming with fuel.Harding is either a bad actor or wrongly cast. Mel Gibson, or any number of others, would have shown guile when turning them all back towards the citadel, a bit of sexual tension when the blonde was in tight beside him in the hatch, and so on.",

    "review": "  Mind numbing repetition. I don't understand how this film gets good reviews. The story is thin, characters are thinner, mostly this is two hours of car chases and crashes in the desert. It assumes too much. Mad Max was a character driven film where we see Max go from a family man that wants to live in peace, to his trial by fire towards the Road Warrior. By Thunderdome we knew Max, so so it was the development of others against Max's foil that made the story. In this weak tale a Warlord named Joe keeps many wives and has many more sons. Imperator Furiosa helps several of Joe's wives escape while on a \"gas run\". When Furiosa takes a detour Joe finds out immediately and engages in pursuit, catching up quickly, thus begins the bulk of the film, an endless chase scene across the desert. You'll notice I've said nothing of Max as Max appearance in this film is merely gratuitous. He really isn't needed except to convince Furiosa to turn back to the Citadel and that could have been done by any of the characters. This was not a worthy addition to the Mad Max universe. Perhaps it's time for the franchise to die. I'm glad I only paid $1 to see this.",

Jurassic World, Avengers Age of Ultron, Everest, Mission Impossible V, Terminator Genisys, Tomorrowland, Joe Wright's Pan, Jupiter Ascending, 50 Shades of Grey, Fantastic Four, Maze Runner II, Insurgent and Furious 7 are examples of great imagery and poor dramatic execution (of course, some of them better than others); but everything is not lost, due to one man and his bizarre but astounding imagination. George Miller and his crew of kamikaze filmmakers depict a desperate world of primeval instincts in this entertaining --and quite possibly essential-- film. Mad Max: Fury Road is a genuine masterpiece in every single aspect: screenwriting, cinematography, sound design, acting, editing, costume design, stunts, music, set decoration, make-up and directing. The film excels in its narrative because of the symbols regarding lost childhood and vanished humanity, strong gender metaphors and the environmental ideas it works with. PERFECTION is an insignificant substantive to describe the best movie of 2015.",

There's action, guns, drugged up skinheads who want to rush to \"valhalla\" (Or in otherwords, death.), Post apocalyptic setting.. It has a ton of things going for it, but the issue is.. There's no story OR characters.The story is just a simple chase-movie. Main character get caught after which he escapes from being a blood-bag (Skinheaded druggies need his blood to continue functioning.) while accidentally meeting up with a truck full of women who are escaping from the Cult leader of the skinheaded druggies. They're trying to escape to \"eden\" which by the words of Furiosa (The manly woman who kicks ass) is a green land from which she was stolen from.That's it for the story. 80% of the movie is about getting to that place while fighting lots of skinheads in crazy spiky cars.Characters also aren't built up. Max is the blandest of characters. His character is literally just looking at things angrily and shooting at them. Occasionally sees phantoms of his daughter show up (Which isn't explained at all in the movie.) and shoots more people.Furiosa's reasons for escaping are explained and that's also literally to \"save other girls\" not really a character trait that has much to it. And otherwise she's also similar to the main character, a hard-ass who gets shit done.And there comes the issue. You will feel interested in side-characters that come from the enemy side because there's simply no reason to LIKE the main characters. Until the end I was actually cheering for the enemies because hey, they were interesting. There was literally a guitar guy who sat on a huge truck which had HUUUGE speakers and was shooting out fire from his guitar!! That's BADASS! Immortan Joe also looks like a barely alive bulgy old man who's like \"GO TO VALHALLA NOW\".. Which is again.. Pretty neat.But this movie, although it isn't horrible.. There's nothing \"GREAT\" about it.. It's a solid 60% imho. It's being kept up by its licence and style, but half of the movie is simply less than mediocre.",

    "review": "  Fury Road is the rare movie that wastes nothing. Not a character, not a crazy vehicle, not a scene, not a single action is this film is done for no reason. Everything is put to absolute perfect use, as we watch amazing practical action play out in a visually cohesive way. But Miller doesn't let the audience get tired, he throws in scenes of tension, character, and emotional weight to round out the glorious apocalyptic spectacle. After watching it three times in three days, I loved it even more the last time.",

I haven't seen any of the other ones, so can't say if they would provide any additional context. The action sequences were amazing, which made up most of the film. This is a movie I wish I had seen in the theater!",

    "review": "  I was lucky enough to catch a pre-screening in Denver. Since this is an extra-early review, I will go out of my way to avoid spoiling anything.Fury Road doesn't resemble anything else I have ever seen, even including the other Mad Max films. The budget is everywhere on the screen, from the vehicles (I hesitate to call any of them 'cars') to the environment, to the quality of the actors. In every way, it has the feel and atmosphere of a world gone completely insane, with everyone having long since accepted that fact and moved on. Tom Hardy makes the most of a character who is written with all the personality of a block of granite. Even in his most human moments, Max is still closer to a force of nature than a man. Charlize Theron's Furiosa is the brains, heart, and soul of the film, and she does a great job with the role. For essentially eye candy- a role they play admirably- a real attempt is made to give the other women (prominent in the trailers) individual personalities; but this primarily comes off as independent quirks. There are simply too many of them for fully fleshed-out characterization. Still, it's a valiant effort in a film that really didn't need to make it to pull the target audience.There is a strong and undeniable feminist streak running through the film that gets stronger as it goes along, one that has aspects of both nurturing instinct and raw strength. It never feels patronizing- anything that the protagonists achieve has to be torn, tooth and nail, from the hellish wasteland. The 'Immortal' Joe and a rogue's gallery of other assorted baddies are never given the same humanizing respect: they are deformed beasts possessed of an animal cunning and not the smallest drop of decency. Liquids of all kinds play a dominant role in the film, to the point where anything liquid becomes fraught with subtext. It's a simple, unique storytelling technique that works like gangbusters playing against the stark, parched background of the Mad world.Overall, I find it difficult to be overly critical of anything in Fury Road. It delivers on every promise the trailers made and a whole lot more besides, with visceral violence, genuinely incredible action, solid writing, and dozens of moments that made me think 'yes, someone really thought that out properly.' I would hesitate to call it a 'smart' film- that wasn't part of the brief- but it certainly delivers on everything a sane person could ask for, and it is definitely firing on all cylinders.",

Well I suppose people find this movie is be \"One of the greatest Action Movies in the past decade\" due to it's overwhelming use of Explosions and Death to it's artsy weird atmosphere and more use of action than focusing on a story? Nope, people don't seem to realize all of this stuff and are tricked into believed \"HOW AWESOME\" this movie is, even asshole critics are giving 5 stars to this Eye Sore. So please don't be fooled by It's overwhelming use of action to make you believe it's a telling a complex and interesting action/drama story, because It's not. And yes It does have a plot but It's focusing more on action than it does It's story when It should be a balance, I don't even want to explain the plot because It's way too fucking obscure for me to explain without sounding incredibly stupid, I don't even remember half of the plot in fact. And you're probably thinking \"Where's all the positive aspects of this movie for you to give it 3 stars?\" I wanted to put everything positive at the beginning but I was just too impatient to wait, this movie is plain and simple Overrated.",

The overall plot is pretty simple, it's basically an escort mission that you would find in a video game where you have to go from point A to point B, now on paper that doesn't sound too interesting, but the way the film tells its story through the combined use of impressive visuals, interesting characters, and strong non-verbal acting actually give this movie a level of complexity that many movies today lack.",

I remember liking Beyond the Thunderdome when I saw it, but I wouldn't call myself a Max aficionado for these details to really matter.I just didn't like it because I was bored. 2 hour movie, and all but 30 minutes of it is car chases.

But I would suggest you try desperately to acquire it, because the flavors are transcendent!The post-Apocalypse has never looked so good. This film is simply gorgeous to look at. Sure there will be some film snobs tired of the increasingly more common orange/blue palette, but it plays to great effect here. And it makes the Chrome so shiny!Miller has created yet another wonderfully bizarre fictive reality, rich with original characters. If there is to be one criticism of the film it would be that it should drop the Mad Max moniker and simply call itself Fury Road, as Max himself plays much more as a supporting character (indeed he spends much of the film as a hood ornament). The real lead in this film is Charlize Theron's Furiosa, and Theron infuses her performance with such a cool badassery that she seems to be channeling Ellen Ripley, Sarah Conner, and Beatrix Kiddo all at once.The best advice I can give anyone just now diving into the world of George Miller is that it's going to be weird, it doesn't have to make sense, and it's ok to laugh and have fun.",

I don't know actually what to say on the topic, because the world in which the action take place is very accurately built, and also the character has the same great characterization, both the main and the secondary. The rythm never falls, and also in the moments of calm, you feel that something will roar back soon. There is a total lack of humanity in most of the characters as well, and this give you a strange feel for all the vision. From here to say that is the best action movie ever made, probably passes a lot, and I will not express my opinion on this.",

    "review": "  The original Mad Max film trilogy of the late 1970's to mid 1980's have long endured as classic, dystopian science fiction movies. They made a star of Mel Gibson and gave us the unforgettable image of Tina Turner in a chainmail cocktail frock. I was a little sceptical at yet another reboot of an old movie franchise, there've just been so many disappointing ones churned out over the years. Here however, we have a great movie, that not only honours the originals but could almost fit easily between any of them. In style, it is more like the first Mad Max movie. It is graphically violent and filled with some great car chase and stunt sequences. The character of Max (now played by Tom Hardy) is almost an anti-hero and says very little. Indeed much of the action and plot centres on Charlize Theron's character, Imperator Furiosa, a one-armed, oil tanker-driving rebel who is trying to rescue a group of concubines from the evil clutches of a local warlord. There's a definite feminist undercurrent to this movie and the female characters are refreshingly strong for a movie of this genre. It is telling that George miller, the original director of the series has returned to his baby and taken it forward. He has managed to recreate the visual feel as well as the spirit of his ground-breaking stories and clearly has a tight control over his vision. This is a real edge of your seat movie. Gripping, good fun and I really would like to see where the \"Road Warrior\" ends up next. Hopefully, the rumours of more adventures to come are actually true.",

    "review": "  First things first, I have to rant a little bit about something that's been bothering me since I finished watching this film last night. And that is the reaction to the film among men's rights activists, or MRAs. Now the very idea of men's rights activism is an absolutely preposterous one since, and think about this, what rights don't men have. Think about it, what rights are these men actually fighting for. What rights DON'T men have? Specifically white men. But, anyway, the reaction to this film was very negative, despite many of them not actually having seen the movie, because of the 'feminist agenda' by having a 'forced female character' in Imperator Furiosa. I guess the complaint comes in the fact that these men believe that women, in action movies, aren't allowed to be badasses because real women take a subservient role to men. Either that or they're damsels in distress or they're the romantic interest for the male lead. These men have got clearly defined roles for women and being strong leaders isn't one of them, at least in films. Even if the film had a forced female character, which it doesn't, as the lead and the one that really drives the narrative forward, it wouldn't be a legitimate complaint. It's not like they make a big deal of Imperator Furiosa being a woman at any point in the film. The film just tells its story and lets its characters speak for themselves. The film having a strong female lead isn't a valid complaint and it will never be, because you are focusing on the gender of the person playing the character and not on the content of the film. So, MRAs and their opinions about this film are not valid and they are human filth. Why would you listen to human filth?With that out of the way, and I do apologize for that but I really had to get it out of my chest, I was honestly really fucking looking forward to this film ever since I first saw the trailer late last year. I really like the original trilogy. The Road Warrior, or Mad Max 2, if I were to compile a list of my favorite action movies, would place very, very highly on that list. Like maybe top 3. I thought that Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was a huge disappointment, but that was probably because of George Miller's lessened involvement. It just wasn't as good as the previous two films in the trilogy. But ever since I saw The Road Warrior, I absolutely fucking loved it. So, when Fury Road was finally announced for release, almost 30 years after the last Mad Max movie came out, I was super excited yet also careful in my expectations, cause the reality might've been that this movie might not have ever matched up to The Road Warrior. Well, I'm here to say this film was pretty much everything it should've been and even then some. You know how I said that The Road Warrior was one of my favorite action films ever. Well, I can definitely say the same about this film. It's really that fucking great. It'd be one thing if it was just for the action/chase sequences, which are out of this fucking world, but the film also has a surprisingly good interesting narrative with some really strong character development for Furiosa, Nux and Max. Here's the thing about Max, while the series is named after his character, since The Road Warrior, all he has been is a pawn in someone else's game. He's a means to an end for some of these people, so that's why I wasn't bothered that Max, while still an integral part to the proceedings, took a backseat to Furiosa because her story to save the wives of Immortan Joe from sex slavery is the driving force of the film. Nothing happens without her involvement. Honestly, Furiosa herself is a fucking badass. I don't give a shit if the MRAs hate me for it, but she's one of the better characters, in any action movie, since, probably, The Bride from Kill Bill. Notice how both those characters are women *gasp*. She's strong and vulnerable all at the same time, like you know there's something about her past that simply fucked her up for life and her actions during the film is sort of her way to redeem herself for what might've happened. Max is also haunted by the past and the people that he failed to protect that ended up dying and how that's the reason that he, usually, goes off on his own rather than stick to a group. Contributing to Furiosa's quest to free the brides also offers him a chance at redemption. Though I do think Nux is the more surprising of all the newer characters, at least from how he transitions from one type of character to something completely different. Nux is, essentially, a War Boy, essentially a fancy name for cannon fodder for Immortan Joe. Nux wants desperately to reach Valhalla, a place where warriors who dies in combat reach in the afterlife, imagine like a heaven or something. Pretty much everything about Nux is about reaching Valhalla because this is all he knows and all that Immortan Joe has taught him. So seeing him evolve as a character is really interesting and Nicholas Hoult is great in the role. Charlize Theron is also pretty incredible as Imperator Furiosa as she, surprisingly, plays the character very subtly. By that I mean the fact that she never hams it up, like there's much more to the Furiosa character than what you actually see on-screen. And that's something that is, hopefully, explored upon if ever a Furiosa prequel ever gets greenlit. Tom Hard is always amazing, so no complains here, but Max is a character that never says, or emotes, much. Have I mentioned how amazing the chase sequences are in this movie? Like the first extended action sequence of the film is one of the best you will see this year, or ever for that matter. The beauty about a film like this is that with, very few exceptions, it's all actually taking place with real vehicles. There's some computer generated crashes here and there, but, by an large, it's actually taking place and that means that it has so much more impact than it would've otherwise. The visual of the apocalyptic dust storm is a sight to behold. I can't even explain how much detail there is in this one desert storm scene with fire tornadoes and shit. It's a visual feast for the eyes honestly. Something tells me that, technically, this scene was probably a bitch to put together. The spectacle of this dust/electrical storm has to be seen to be believed. It's stuff like that that puts this film over the top. The chase sequences in this film are some of the best ever seen on film. Find me a film with better chase sequences than The Road Warrior or Fury Road. I got all fucking day. The costume design is, obviously, excellent. No one does post-apocalyptic costume design better than Mad Max. The Road Warrior pretty much set the standard of what post-apocalyptic costume design looks like. The climactic action sequence is also out of this world. The action in this film is world-class. And, of course, the editing has to be top-notch as well in order for it all to make sense from a visual standpoint. There's so many things going on from a visual perspective in this film that the editing needs to be especially commended because of the difficulties in placing this all together to where it looks amazing to a viewing audience. So Margaret Sixel, the editor of the film, deserves a standing ovation for her work here. I tip my hat off to you madam. But perhaps what I like most about the film is sort of the little moments of character development that you get in between the action sequences. Like how there's a certain respect that's building up between Furiosa and Max throughout the film. They don't do it in a heavy-handed fashion, but you can notice the respect building between the two. The interactions between the wives and the gang of women is really cool as well. Those small little moments of character development is what makes this film and the world feel so fully developed. It's a dark and brutal world to live in and the film does a fabulous job at representing that. With that said, I fucking loved this film if you couldn't tell. My favorite of the year so far and one of the best action films I've ever seen. Though it's so much more than just an action film. That's one of the beautiful things about it. I, obviously, highly recommend this film. Long live Imperator Furiosa.And fuck the MRAs.",

Yes, the visual effects were amazing, but the rest of the movie falls flat. Lame dialogue, lame characters, etc. One of the villains is a fat guy with an oxygen, really? I was happy with the story until everyone decided opps let's turn around and go back the exact way we can for the past hour and a half of the movie, WTF. Weak story. Where did the ambino war children come from? Why is there no towns other than a gas town? Even shanties would make sense of the story world. Story world environment was lame also. Desert, more desert. I know it was a post nuclear war world, but there could have been more than what we were given. Anyone see Oblivion, way way way better story world environment. I would love to know how people this is an action masterpiece, must not have seen John Wick, Lucy, the new MI movie, which are all 20x better than this. OVERRATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

George Miller (The Witches of Eastwick, Babe, Lorenzo's Oil, Happy Feet) is my favorite director. Mad Max 2 was like this and that's his Aussie style action. Best performer was Charlize Theron, she was calm, cool and wonderful! Tom Hardy was cool too. Nicholas Hoult (About A Boy, Warm Bodies, X-Men: Days of Future Past) looked different and he did nice performance. First I thought story is boring, but climax car chase action sequences were really dynamic, heart pounding and fantastic! 3D effects were really vivid, colorful and amazing! Ending was great!

    "review": "  \"George Miller has said that the best version of his film is in black and white, with no dialogue. BLACK & CHROME is an attempt to realize Miller's alternate vision. The cinematography, the editing, the sound design, and the score, are now represented in a completely new experience.\" Warner Bros. may have removed the video by now though.Contains some SPOILERS. I just watched Mad Max: Fury Road how director George Miller originally envisioned it being: black and white with no dialogue. This is my first time seeing Fury Road. I missed it in theatres. When the film was coming out and black and white trailer was released for it, that made more sense to me for the setting of the flick, honestly. I was able to follow the narrative from only the visuals. With the exception of grasping all of Imperator Furiosa's backstory, that is. I can kind of guess, but I am still not 100% sure.From what I gathered, she's someone of high command for Immortan Joe. Unlike other women being used for their milk or intercourse (for the purposes of giving Joe a son, hence the words \"Our Sons Will Not Be Warlords\" along with \"We Are Not Things\"): she must be unable to bear a child and was forced to become useful by becoming more like a male crony for Joe (i.e. her appearance of having no hair which is what all of the members of Joe's men look like). I wouldn't be surprised if her arm was was lost thanks to Immortan Joe initially either, for her failures I mentioned earlier.Furiosa represents not adhering to societal standards visually, a woman with agency nor solely a love interest, and a character with a disability, all together! YES! Excuse me as I go send George Miller and Charlize Theron hundred of letters of thanks. All of the other women under Joe's tyranny wore dresses of some kind whilst Furiosa did not, reinforcing my belief of her becoming more male-like as she worked for Joe that gained her a high ranking in the process. Not since Ripley from Alien has there been such a cool character that outshines (more like steals the entire show) from the titular Max.On top of that, the Wives aren't exactly damsels in distress, some of them help out. Eventually, Furiosa and Max get assistance from other women of varying ages (including older, you hardly see that!) and color which kick as much as butt as they do. This was something I was sooooo happy to observe. :') The Fury Road character of Nux is another fascinating addition to the motion picture I'd be remiss not to type about. His arc is one of being worthy of going to Valhalla by dying as a man: besides Max he's the lone other prominent male non-antagonist character. He himself is dying, utilizing Max as a \"blood bag\". Before joining them, he's very child-like, but with Furiosa and Max and the Wives his personality and character matures.Fury Road is an action-packed ride that rarely has any stops. During it, director Miller gives some characterization sandwiched in between all of that as well. The vehicles have tons of personality, what more do you want?! These moments would probably be stronger with dialogue, but I believe I got the gist of the majority of them. It isn't perfect, yet it all works rather well. Currently my top cinematic experience of this year with Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation right behind it.Hrm, I should view the one with dialogue next I think? Or would that ruin the impact of Miller's original vision? Uncertain now.",

It's a modern day masterpiece. It breaks the mold of films, and gives us something new, something fresh. There isn't a ton of dialogue from the main characters, but the idea is that we don't need it in the first place. Just by looking at Max you almost get this feeling that you know exactly what he is thinking at the time. Sorrow is portrayed beautifully in the little moments and happiness is resurrected in the end. This movie allows for multiple viewings and you really should take advantage of it.

Fight to escape, and then strangely enough, fight to return. That's about it. Am I over-valuing the first two films? This will be one of those DVDs one can buy spending hours reviewing all the small details missed the first time. And, there are a lot of small details in the characters and vehicles. So many, in fact, that I found myself constantly scanning the screen in an attempt to take them all in. The guy behind me kept holding his breath during the battle scenes. I thought he was going to pass out. Each time the action calmed for a second he took in this big breath. The action is non-stop and there are some endearing, if not enduring, characters.

    "review": "  A Mad Max for the Happy Feet Generation 71-year-old director and writer George Miller has taken a 30-year hiatus from Mad Max; but in 2015, Max is back! This is a completely reimagined post-apocalyptic world. Forget Mel Gibson; Tom Hardy gives a fantastic performance as Max. Hardy offered few lines of dialog, but he spoke to the audience thorough his action, he also had help with his supporting cast of Charlize Theron and Nicolas Hoult giving equally as impressive contributions to their respective roles. For those of you who are familiar with the world of Mad Max, you will get a pleasant surprise. I'm not sure if it ever specified as to where in the world this film takes place, but it looks a bit different than the original trilogy. That being said, it was a great improvement, and for those of you who have never seen the old Mad Max or have even heard of the film you will also be presently surprised with a fantastic action film, that ranks among the best ever made. Furiosa (Theron) is charged with taking a war machine to fill it up with gas. When the self proclaimed God, Immortan Joe figures out that she is going off course to escape with all of his wives, he goes mad and follows after her with every car available in his kingdom. Max is a captured \"blood bank\" for Nux (Hoult), a driver trying to make his name know to Immortan Joe. Braving through a giant sand storm it is a race against time for Furiosa to escape with the other women. When the film is boiled down to its core, it is a two and a half hour car chase on the back drop of an absolutely gorgeous desert landscapes, including a giant sandstorm tornado, and the best action set ever to be put on film. The effects are outstanding and realistic, the acting is phenomenal, and the cinematography is beautiful. Any action film fan will love this, whether or not you are familiar with the mad max story. Taking the time and money out of your day to see this film will be worth every cent.",

Director George Miller has reinvigorated the Mad Max mythos with an unexpected surge of gorgeously photographed action set pieces that put every other big budget superhero/action film this summer to shame. Even more surprising than watching a 70 year old George Miller hand Hollywood's action filmmaking elite their own asses, is that Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa is the star of the film. Theron has created a badass for the ages and the decision to have her character drive the narrative is brilliant. This film is a triumph of high energy, action filmmaking and deserves to be seen repeatedly on the largest screen humanly possible.",

Despite the good art direction everyone looked like they just got back from burning man and Charlize Theron was a waste as an action star . I'm glad I saw it on DVD and didn't waste the money at a theater ! I'm really amazed that so many critics liked this ! I'm being generous with 2 stars ( for the art direction ) Sorry but the rest was a bore !",

    "review": "  Finally! A remake of the notorious and infamous post apocalyptic action film, Mad Max, Fury Road. With a collage of profound creativity and limitless imagination, George Miller, cast and crew deserve the industries most distinguished recognition for this incredible production. From costume design to monstrous mutant machines to high risk stunts and a compelling score from the orchestra behind the scenes, this film defies all the stigma of a typical monotonous sequel. The film speed variations, close ups and panning and zooming contributed significantly to the riveting and seamless action. Amazing aerial drone footage and natural settings. Excellent casting and authentic looking extras. This film is a direct result of professionally coordinated hard work. I thought there was just one element it could've used. Tomorrows technology depicted as outdated technology: solar panels. Hybrid and hydrogen energy. Cellular and UHF communications. But there is a certain admiration for the dedicated old school discipline that is just not for sale. If you went to see this movie expecting something resembling \"Terms of Endearment\", no one is interested in reading your review. Anyone fit to grant this movie with less than 4.5 stars, can never appreciate what it takes to produce ten seconds of a specifically original feature action film like this one.",

The bad guys looked menacing, the visuals were stupendous.. even the old ladies in the final showdown kicked some serious ass. I loved that there was a dude rocking out to some metal during the whole thing hah the only thing that kinda irked me a bit was how things were wrapped up so neatly at the end when they arrived back at the Citadel, but that's the only issue I really had and a very minor one at that. I'm shocked I loved this when I found the original Mad Max trilogy tiresome(I slept through every one). I'm calling it now, BEST MOVIE OF 2015.",

Mad Max: Fury Road is currently my favorite action film ever made. It is a modern action classic and easily the best film so far in 2015. It is a Milestone in action film history. Tom Hardy does a descent job as Max Rockatansky not as good as Gibson but good enough for the film. Charlize Theron is also very good I think Furiosa will be an iconic female action character like Ripley and Sarah Connor. The action in this movie is some of the best I've ever seen with great stunt work and no terrible CGI like most action films these days. If you want mindless action unlike The Expendables or Fast And The Furious movies watch Mad Max: Fury Road because it will give you an experience like no other.",

Easily one of the best films of the year, it incorporated so much well-shot action and so much meta-commentary on resource usage and women's rights that it's amazing no one was clamoring for this sooner. Now, everyone wants to be witnessed. Tom Hardy was a solid choice to replace Mel Gibson, but everyone knows that Charlize Theron was the true star of George Miller's return to prominence. Theron's Imperator Furiosa is easily the best written female action character of the last few years and honestly, probably of all time. Her character's sole mission, after achieving military greatness, is to rescue Immortan Joe's concubines from a lifetime of breeding. Her performance is both subtle and in-your-face, which is what pissed off the last remaining \"men's rights groups\" that still laughably fight for relevance. Theron deserves massive credit for bringing humanity to a world that is massively devoid of such things, but George Miller deserves so much credit for crafting this desolate world. The action scenes are perfect- the creative decisions are beyond impressive, what with an entire vehicle dedicated to a guitarist and his wall of amps. This film is mad impressive: and goddamn, I hope it gets a sequel.",

Every time you discover a really bad visual blunder or terrible editing job, take a drink. I guarantee you'll see less than half the movie before you're passed out on the couch. Another possible drinking game.....Charlize Theron is beyond beautiful. For this role, she cut all her hair off and rubbed axial grease on her face. Guess what, it's still f**king Charlize Theron only with short hair and grease on her face. So the drinking game is, when you first realize you're looking at the \"transformed\" Charlize, start drinking and don't stop till you pass out. Unless you have the intellect of a grape, that'll be in the first five minutes of the movie and you'll be spared death by boredom which occurs within a half hour. Positive note and suggestion. It's better to rent the streaming version as opposed to the less expensive physical DVD. This will actually be less expensive in the long run. Having the actual physical DVD, in front of you will give you the strong urge to destroy it and relieve the world of one copy of this crap. Investors gave money to this project. They're out there and they're giving money away. CONSWriter has serious Mother issues. This movie took two hours of my life which I will never get back.",

    "review": "  I would best compare this film to another film that came out in 2013 by the name of Gravity. Gravity, much like the film I'm reviewing right now, was a spoon fed, overly praised film that places more value on aesthetics than it does on engaging characters or a worthwhile story to be invested in. Just like Gravity, one bewilderment towards the overwhelming positive reception versus the actual quality of the film shouldn't be a surprise since if you remove the technical achievement all you'll have left is superficial entertainment with a two hour car chase. It's a dumb action film with a high budget, and cool car stunts which is sadly all it has to offer.Around this portion of my reviews I would provide a synopsis of Mad Max: Fury Road, but any sort of synopsis should be considered a spoiler. There's very little plot in the film that required three writers to create. To put it in perspective the film without giving away thin specifics is basically like driving a couple miles away from your home to get water while being chased by lunatics, remembering there's no longer anyone guarding your home for some reason, and returning home the same way you came even though it was blocked after an explosion. That is all that occurred within two hours. Like mentioned before, this took the effort of three writers to create is pretty pathetic not just in writing, but filmmaking as a whole.It's titled character, Max, is a man of few words, fewer defining characteristic beside having a tortured past, and less of an engaging character. Max is relegated to a supporting role who just goes with the motion of events. Some attempts are made in providing a backstory to Max, but it is thinly stretched out. All that is told about Max through hallucination is that he failed to protect people. Their importance is never specify almost as if discluding any newcomer in the franchise. If it fails to stand alone as it own entity then it failed before filming began. Nope, instead of providing stronger context it's better if that time was better spent on very long car chases instead.More ridiculous than the thinness of the story is the presentation of serious moments. Car chases take up 90% of the film are bombastic, and loud which when applied to a character, Furiousa, talking about redemption can't be taken seriously. That's the clear points of these moments, though once again I want emphasize it took three people to write this story. Without much exploration into character backgrounds it further deteriorate into an eye candy spectacle that only manages to hold your attention because of it belief it would lose its audience if there wasn't a extensive car chase for every few minutes focus on plot.The film opens up with our main character Max being captured, and in an attempt to escape shows to the viewer(s) how insane the world is. This very early scene shows a crowd of people gathering around to get water with the images presenting a clear picture of how important this resource is in the world. Yet, the three writers felt the imagery of this scene wouldn't be enough to convey the desperation in its world either being water, healthy people, or fertile land which is why lines like \"As the world fell, each of us in our ways were broken\" is spoon feeding to the definition. Much like the example I use in the opening paragraph, if it was entirely muted (we're talking about virtually no dialogue) the film would actually be an achievement in storytelling regardless if it needed to use simple caricatures for an action movie. Unfortunately, with spoon fed dialogue like that it's a blessing and a curse the characters don't talk as much as they do taking away from the experience.Characters are simplified to very basic character arcs; most notable examples comes in the form of Nux and Furiousa. Nux wants to be taken to Vahala which loosely can be tied to religion as much as Furiousa search for redemption from an event that's makes a very loose connection with the antagonist. Nux doesn't suffer as much as Furiousa in his basic characterization due to his simplistic loyalty painting a clear picture of his arc when he enters the picture. Max goal is to possibly get over past demons and survive without talking much. Now, Max getting over his demons isn't an issue since it's what drives his character to be a better person than he was before. However, Max being muted when Furiosa is trying to kill him is idiotic. He's man of few words, but not very intelligent...or is he? The script can't decide on that as in one scene Max manages to get a truck out a swampland that got mired in the desert by the use of the only conveniently found tree in that area. So his reluctance to speak in a scene where women are trying to run away from the same lunatics chasing Max, and the leader is attempting to kill Max a simple explanation would have avoided a well choreographed, but rather pointless action scene.So earlier I made a rough outline of the film general story by making up an example. That outline has serious issues. First, there is an explosion in a canyon with only one entrance way being shown. That entrance gets blocked by rubble of rocks. Yet, when the characters decide to return to where Max was taken seemingly using the same road. Second, we're in the desert and making further suspend your belief is despite the large locations shown throughout the film Max takes the same route to return to the Citadel (where the film basically starts). Lastly, the antagonist took all of his men when chasing down Max? If not, how come the citizens of the Citadel didn't kill Immortan Joe (the antagonist) if his power was so limited? It would explain the ending, but if so, even if the antagonist did strike fear in the people's eyes the numbers of baddies still in the Citadel is larger of that of what the Immortan Joe took with him when chasing down Max and his Five Wives. In context characters finally stop looking for answers in other places that might not exist, but also in context it basically means the outline of the story is unbelievably goofy.If you're looking for action, but mostly in the car chases variety Mad Max: Fury Road has impressive stunt work. For starter, the way Mad Max: Fury Road is filmed is done like an expert. The camera in these car chases usually follows the cars without shaking the camera. No matter how many cars are on screen together or if there's an explosion the camera doesn't need to shake to emulate the chaotic nature of just occurred in a scene. It does it through visuals favoring long takes with wide shots angle to see every bit of carnage done in the film.Another aspect of the car chases is the smart uses of wide shots throughout lengthy sequences. A common problem for directors of higher budgeted action movies is that a director would make the mistakes of using many mid-shots instead to be closer to the action instead of pulling the camera further for a better flow. One of the best example is a scene where Max is attempting to break the window of a car from his capturer who's planning to kill himself in a blaze glory during a desert storm. In the background, Max is seen struggling to hang onto a car and attempting to break the window while in the foreground his capturer is preparing to kill himself. This paints a picture of struggle, and a time limit within the same shot. This also applies to car crashes as when a car gets destroyed the camera shows the entire car as it gets destroyed. However, instead of pausing to display this demolished car it will instead continue to follow the action. One prime example of a George Miller expert direction is in the film there's tanker that explodes, and how he displays it incorporates many techniques. From this lone scene in a couple of seconds Miller combines CG, shot composition, and editing to seamless effect. As Max is fighting against a Warboy on a pole/ladder that's very close to touching the ground in motion he successfully kills the Warboy; with the ladder now having less weight Max attempts to get himself onto safety in the foreground on a moving car while the background a tanker is exploding within the same frame of shots. This moment doesn't last any longer than seven seconds, but seamlessly through expert uses of CG, shot composition, and editing it's a seamless flow of coherence that Miller often succeed in duplicating throughout the film.The stunt work is nothing short of amazing. Cars are demolished on screen alongside obtaining a high body count from in the film characters death. In general, the stunt will require a dozen or so cars as well participants to do insane set pieces. Not only do the stunt crew having perform a dangerous stunt on constantly moving vehicles, but also do it with visibly little protection and sometimes with props like spears, pipes, baby bottle, spray can, and anything that can be found in this post apocalyptic film. What's pulled off successfully is a string of convincing looking stunts that at some point in the film you'll begin to believe every single stunt was done by actual person. In some scenes a dummies is used, but with an expert stunt crew it blurred the lines between a real person and dummy that it's not even noticeable even among action aficionados.CGI is used in virtually every single shot of the film, though it's mostly use on either filtering colors or enhance the effect of a scene. For instance, going back to the tanker explosion if you removed the CG from that explosion you'll still have the same explosion and stunt in place. The only thing the CG is adding was enhancing the effect of an explosion to give it more visual finesse by darkening smokes and brightening up the flames. Sometimes CG will add an explosion or make a scene colors pop out. Fury Road usage of CG is smart as it only uses it to add to a larger piece of the film instead of it taking over for an entire scene.Set design is also detailed with a rough-hewn general look for the clothings. Getting across a clear picture of this dystopia fascination with worshiping cars like a religion. There is no normal looking car in the film as you have muscle cars on top of tanks, vintage cars on top of oil rigs and things that look like killer porcupines with wheels underneath them. There's a lot to admired from the vehicles including the manic arsonist guitarist surrounded by a wall of amplifiers. The guitarist is also a key feature of the soundtrack, with Junkie XL using the chaotic music to stamp a mark of citizenship upon the particular tribes across the journey, mixing in suspenseful, looming soundbites to show the ever-nearing distance between threats.The acting I can't complain about, but that's mostly because the cast provide a lot more conviction in their portrayals than the script does in providing details. Tom Hardy hardly speaks in the film with most of his performance relegated to simply grunting and facial expressions. Despite the limitation in his performance Tom Hardy sells the image of a broken, desperate man. Everything his character is feeling is received by the viewer properly. Charlize Theron plays Furiousa a cool looking character with a no-nonsense attitude. Playing a complex character whose composure hides a lot of her inner turmoil. Having to display a rough surface while at the same time a character whose holding onto what little hope for a better life there is left. Her chemistry with Hardy is excellent displaying the changes in their relationship through the film going from strangers, to enemies, to partners convincingly.Nicholas Hoult plays Nux a character heavy on a visual arc. He has the most easily definable character traits utilizing them in his portrayal of Nux. A character that enthusiastically goes into blindly following a belief of the antagonist to a more down to earth person contemplating a new view for life. His changes are among the most evident in the film benefiting from a character whose entire journey unlike the other two characters is seen to the finish line. Hugh Keays-Byrne is a appropriate looking \"Obviously Evil Bad Guy\" type of antagonist. His costume leaves little imagination for what kind of person he is. Consumed in the role Byrne exudes desire, hatred, and vengeance through his portrayal of the film antagonist. I also must give credit to the casting of largely unknown actor Nathan Jones and playing on his strength by giving him little words to speak and allot to express. This movie was expertly put together needless to say.Mad Max: Fury Road will make you mad and furious for the wrong reasons. It's more of an issue of the shallow writing that excuses itself to be a two hour chase scene. Gazing upon it you'll be in awe at the large scale practical stunt work, and gorgeous cinematography before realizing its product of its time that is only appreciated as such. The biggest drawback to the film is it uncertainty to trust the audience; it's powerful images tell its story majestically, but due to the spoon fed dialogue the reward that comes with figuring out what occurred in the story yourself diminishes the impact when it does it for two hours. It's technical achievement on all fronts, but if the spoon fed dialogue was virtually removed than it would have also obtained a storytelling achievement to go along with its wild world.",

    "review": "  Easily the largest scale Mad Max movie of them all. Let's get one thing straight before I start nitpicking: This is a must-see action movie. This is probably the best action movie that has come out since the 80s when it movies had this kind of ultra violence and carnage. From the minute the movie starts it is going at full speed and it never lets up.So with that out of the way, let's get to nitpicking!First, there is just so much action that it all kind of blends together. That sounds kind of strange, but it is just constant mayhem and destruction that thinking back on the movie I have a hard time picking out one key moment where I can say to someone \"Remember when...\". This doesn't mean the script is out of control or that there is too much going on to comprehend, it just means that there was so much good that nothing really stood out as great.Tom Hardy is fine in the main role, but at times it felt more like he was doing his Mel Gibson impersonation as opposed to making Max his own. He does a fine job, but nothing tremendous.Many probably wonder how this compares to The Road Warrior (the often considered best of the franchise). Personally, I think The Road Warrior was a better movie. I just found it more memorable with moments and characters that are unforgettable. Plus, the action (while nowhere near the level of Fury Road) was built up to as opposed to just a constant. I can see why someone would like Fury Road more, but I think The Road Warrior accomplished more as one of the all-time great b-movies than Fury Road accomplishes as a big budget Hollywood film.The movie just has so much going on and it's a lot of fun, and there could be no dialogue at all and you would still have a great time watching this movie. It is highly recommended and you need to watch it if you haven't already.",

    "review": "  Good action, boring story, bad pacing, good acting.A movie this well liked by almost everyone was sure to disappoint me, and it did. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. The acting was fine, and the action was great. It was the pacing that bothered me and the CG. The story was shoehorned in and it took the backseat like it was supposed to so, no real complaints there. I never really cared for any of the characters or their plights, the use of flashback to humanize Max didn't do that at all and rarely made any sense. It became cartoonish at points, and the other characters were underdeveloped to care about their motivation or plight. The acting was there and there wasn't a bad performance out of anyone.The graphics when not practical, but CG looked terrible and extremely CG. There is an establishing shot of the base in the beginning and it looks like a paper cutout diorama you made in middleschool, it looked like a comic book since there was a thick outline around the people in the foreground, it was weird. Most of the CG was bad, there wasn't enough textures at times, so it had that weird plastic look to it. The pacing was the worst offender in the film. I get that it's an epic car chase, but there were scenes that took too long and didn't really feel like it fit or did anything to further the story. There's this \"night\" scene (which is clearly a blue filter over the lens of the camera, it's that bad) that nothing seems to happen, I get that they're trying to strength the bond between the two leads, but it felt out of place and annoyed me. Then the whole movie is about running away from the problem (which is totally fine) to go to this \"Eden\", that takes a great chunk of the movie to get there, but SPOILERS, there's something wrong, \"Eden\" is dead, so they have to go back to where they came. So the first part of the movie takes 1.5hrs to get to eden and 30mins to go through now an army of cars and ruthless killers (that weren't there going out, but on their tail) to get back to the starting point. \"Eden\" should have been the middle point, the \"blue\" scene should have been cut a lot shorter (develop that relationship with action, not exposition, since nothing gets resolved there, since they tell each other their history, kind of, which we the audience already know) and more time should have been given to the fight to go back to the start. There were more problems going to \"Eden\" (don't remember what it was called in the film), then there was going through a fleet of murderous men and their vehicles. That doesn't make sense. It's a good film, that would have been made better if Miller kept it as a mindless action film and didn't try to make it just above that. The story/pacing and CG were the biggest retarding factors in this film with a very basic and somewhat cliche premise. Ironically, Max is the most useless and unnecessary character in the film, to the point where I think he was a hinderance. His character trope is so cliched it's annoying. Guy with a troubled past that closes himself off to the world, yet it affects him enough to retard progress in the real world. He was overly melodramatic and it got annoying.",

Whereas Daniel Craig breathed new life into James Bond bringing out a dark and sinister side - almost an anti-hero - to a film classic Tom Hardy neuters Max and takes character development no where. He says about three words (does he have an inability to remember scripts or was the scriptwriter just lazy??). If they had put Mel Gibson back in the role he wouldn't even have had to act - just pay him in Jack Daniels, throw him the keys and follow him around with a steady cam.

Theron is formidable and Furiosa is one of the best film action heroes this decade, and it's great to see Hardy taking Max back to the first-Max-film roots. Hoult is also brilliant and almost unrecognisable in a very good way. Great accent work by everyone as well.",

    "review": "  What a grand, insane work of vision is Mad Max: Fury Road. What a bold and visionary exercise has George Miller created. In a world of action movies that are mostly thin soup, this is what you wish for from all of your action movies: something created out of sheer ingenuity and imagination, a movie that gets rolling and doesn't have time to stop; a movie in which the bright and colorful visual palette is so audacious and so fully packed that your eyes can't catch everything that the director is trying to show you the first time around. Half the time you don't understand everything that you're looking at, but you don't really mind. It's so big, so grand, so full that it demands to be seen in a theater. I pity those who hold out for television.What surprises me is that all greatness happens in the midst of a modern practice that I normally despise: The Reboot. Yes, George Miller is rebooting the classic genre that he helped to create, but he's not just slapping a coat of paint on an old fence, he's embracing the new while taking us happily down an old familiar road.Thirty-six years ago, when Miller first conceived of Mad Max, he effectively wrote the book on how to make a movie about the apocalyptic future. His was a world gone mad, a savage and unholy world in which The Bomb had tossed humanity back to its tribal state but only far enough back that it still had trucks and motorcycles to mow each other down with. The participants dressed like professional wrestlers and shot each other at will when they weren't driving spiked vehicles into one another, ready to wage war for a tank of juice. It was unique, it was visionary, and it was such a riotous journey that filmmakers have been chasing his vision ever since.In Mad Max: Fury Road, the McGuffin is a little more potent than just a race for gasoline. The plot here is thin enough that it doesn't bungle the action, but what it boils down to is the soul of humanity. We meet Max (Thomas Hardy) a haunted man suffering with painful bouts of PTSD - he has flashes of memories of people he failed to save. Before we can get a good look at Max, he is captured by The War Boys, a bald and skin-bleached band of cultist working under the thumb of the tyrannical King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a fearsome being where wears plastic armor and a skull mask that is really unsettling - imagine if Sweet Tooth from \"Twisted Metal\" were a rock star and you've got the idea. His cult is so vast and so audacious that his caravan travels the wastelands of Australia with it's own war drums and guitar solo. No kidding, there's a guy in this army whose function is to play guitar while strapped to truck specially designed for that purpose!What follows along a pattern of Miller's four Mad Max movies is that in each movie, the world appears to be getting worse. In the first Mad Max, the world was devastated but still resembled one that we recognized. In Fury Road, the remnants of humanity have returned to their feral state, still able to drive cars and have religious rites, but closer in common sense to apes then to man.In the midst of this chaos, one of Joe's warriors, the one-armed Furiosa (Charleze Theron), goes rogue and steals one of Joe's War Rigs. What the rig is carrying is more than just gasoline and weapons. I won't spoil it, except to say that Mad Max: Fury Road isn't all boys with toys. As the movie moves into its second half, it really becomes a story of tough women fighting for their own survival.They exist amid a world in which every this is always moving. George Miller doesn't want you to catch your breath. He allows you two or three slow beats, but for most of it's running time, this is a movie that is always on the move. Essentially, it's a chase pictures, but there are so many crazy images filling the screen at all times that you have to see it twice to catch them all. Even better is that fact that his action scenes make sense. The chase scenes have an orientation so that we don't just feel that we're watching a lot of nonsensical editing.His palette is refreshing in that it's bright and colorful, forcing you to realize how many movies these days are grim and dark and hard to see (look at the trailers for Dawn of Justice and The Fantastic Four and you'll see what I mean). But Mad Max takes place mostly in broad daylight under blazing sun. We see everything, and there are bright colors, definitive colors. Every vehicle, every costume, every location and every character has their own texture and their own look.What a crazy ride this is! What a unique visionary is George Miller. He is a man who can create something as violent and bloodsoaked as Mad Max and then pull the reigns back for something as sweet and beatific as Babe. What he proves with Mad Max is that there are original worlds to be created in the movies. It is still possible to make a great action picture that moves and pops and sings and excites us. He had a plan and he executed it beautifully. Just like his trucks, he kept his eye on the road, and he didn't stop for anything.",

You expect wild characters and outlandish vehicles in an explosive race across the desert and it delivers.What's even more impressive is the amount of back story and plot that is laid out at the start just by showing the way the people live. It's a barbaric survival-focused existence, but it tells everything you need to know.Dramatic visuals and intricately created vehicles lend a rich background to the movie and Charlize Theron's prosthetic is perfectly executed. Great work here. It's brutal and violent and dirty and covered in grease and sweat. There's fire and drums and fights on top of speeding trucks. If that's what you're looking for, you will not be disappointed.",

Of course shared with the world so everyone knows... Anyway, I appreciate the practical effects, but the little bit of CGI that was used was VERY jarring because they were pretty poorly done and stuck out like a sore thumb from the practical effects they did... That and the fact that it was basically just a car chase movie, are the only complaints about it. Otherwise good movie. Charlize Theron definitely outshined the character the movie was named after.",

The production design is excellent, the cinematography excellent, and the cast does very well. The action is a clear staple with some impressive special effects and stunt choreography. Is it perfect? Probably not, but I also don't believe in perfection. I can pick at things here and there like a lot of movies, and while I'll let time tell what the legacy of this film will be, I'll safely say this is a bright spot that proves that great films can still come out of the big movie machine in this day and age, and need not any original ideas either. Fury Road is a very simple post-apocalypse adventure that is light on story, but excels because of great aesthetic filmmaking and retaining a character to it that sets the film apart from the overload of bland, similar big budget products that dominate a lot of theatres. Fury Road will certainly grab everyone's attention and wake us up to what movies can strive to be... it already has.",

The \"dialogue\" is the worst I've ever witnessed in a major production. The story; sorry, there is no story. And when will the studios realize Tom Hardy has no charisma?? Would have preferred to have Charlize Theron's character be Max instead; maybe changer her name to Maxine. Then towards the end, when he thinks Theron's character might not make it, Hardy finally says, \"Max, my name is Max.\" Who cares at that point??

When I heard that another Mad Max film was being made (prior to seeing any trailers, or previews) I was disgusted at the concept that there was no way that current day hollywood level production companies could possibly produce anything but garbage regarding this film. I was wrong, dead wrong. This film is a fantastic experience, that deserves to live as long and well remembered as any of the films before it do, in my opinion. Nicholas Hoult played a real character, I was glad to see him come out of his \"pretty boy\" shell, in my opinion. I hope to see more from him...now that I have seen this film, lol.

Tom Hardy is spectacular, as ever, and Charlize Theron brings to life a character I never would have thought she'd portray so well. Hugh Keays-Byrne portrays a great antagonist, and the supporting cast of Nicholas Hoult as Nux and the other girls definitely bring a spark into the film. Overall, 10/10. :)",

    "review": "  After all the riotous marketing featuring the word \"MASTERMIND\", George Miller irrefutably proves himself worthy of the title. From start to finish, \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is one long chase scene, and the pacing is brilliantly handled. There is no drag, and the story has been woven in a way that both the character development and plot play out fluidly alongside the action, which is a wholly remarkable feat. I hope Michael Bay's seen this picture because Miller pulls off a job that action directors of today NEED to take note of. What of the cast? Well, he's no Mel Gibson but Tom Hardy does pretty well as the titular hero - once again, thrown into a chaotic situation that requires mutual trust for the survival of himself and the innocents around him. Although, his accent still puzzles me... it was some sorta South African, English hybrid that had a tinge of Russian in there every now and then... truly weird stuff but, again, he does well in the role. The real highlight of the film though is Charlize Theron as Imperotar Furiousa. She plays what you could call a \"true\" powerful female-character. And that's NOT because she kicks ass in the movie or is intimidating to watch or because she stands up to oppressive men... no, it's all those things AND the fact that - underneath all the toughness - she possesses a very human amount of heartbreak and fear. These character \"weaknesses\" are of course channeled into her strengths, which makes indeed makes her a strong female-character. This is what needs to go into the composition of any \"strong\" female part. Strong female parts are NOT women who are just another Black Widowish, superheroic ass-kicker that doesn't need a man's help to \"get the job done\", but they are everything that is embodied in Theron's character. So thank you, George Miller, for getting that right. The guy's 70 and he's STILL taking young Hollywood writers and directors to school.",

    "review": "  Don't get mad with me to the max, but I was not enthralled at all with \"Mad Max:Fury Road\". George Miller's redux of his classic 80's Mad Max franchise was mostly about visual storytelling but there was no true connection with any of the characters, mostly the madman himself Max. If you are not familiar with this franchise, the film takes place in a dystopian future where eccentric characters set the pave to a divided society. Tom Hardy stars as Max, who is about to be killed in some type of mundane \"chain to a speeding truck\" kind of deal; when circumstances change, he now joins a group of female rebels led by Imperator Furiosa, profoundly played by Charlize Theron; but not to the caliber of Oscar nominated, don't get furioso with me, just my take. Tom Hardy, who is one of my favorite actors, turns out his worst performance of his career; he looked lost and stale throughout the picture. However, I am still in the Tom Tom Club as a Hardy fan; Hardy har har. Nicholas Hoult was sound as the desperate Nux. Director George Miller's direction was way over the top, and not much could be said of his limited screenplay. Hey, but I did not hate it all together. John Seale's brilliant cinematography got my seal of approval. \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" was a road for me that will be less traveled. *** Average",

    "review": "  Basic: Mad Max: Fury Road, a part sequel, and a part reboot to the Mad Max trilogy. The story in this film starts off where Max (played by Tom Hardy) is being pursued by a group of War-boys, and very quickly enough, he gets captured. We see Max getting so many hallucinations; we see that the War-boys are taken over his clothes, his stuff, and now his blood.Then, we get another hero in the film, and she's a female action hero named Imperator Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron), who has taken Immortan Joe's (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne) five wives: Toast (played by Zoe Kravitz), The Splendid Angharad (played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Capable (played by Riley Keough), The Dag (played Abbey Lee), and Cheedo the Fragile (played by Courtney Eaton). Joe and his army are now going after her, and retrieve back the five wives. Then, later in the film, Max is team up with Furiosa, and the five wives to get far away from Immortan Joe, and searching for a new home, that has food, and water.What's the deal: Mad Max: Fury Road, what is there that I want to say about the film? I would say, pretty much, everything about it. I remember when I saw the comic-con trailer of Mad Max: Fury Road, I actually thought that looks cool, and I had this feeling like it might be a fun action-packed movie. But when the other trailers to Mad Max: Fury Road came out, this is where I started to feel a little bit down, and getting some mixed feelings about it. Not only because they're not as exhilarating as the comic-con trailer to Mad Max: Fury Road, but it's also because I started to feel like the film might be mixed on how the storytelling may somehow be empty. Suddenly, when the film was about to come out in theaters, or already came out in theaters, this is where I'm hearing so many great reviews about the film, and it literally made me going to the point of where I wanted to see this movie. It actually took me a while for me to see this movie, because there we're some other movies that I was checking out. Then, I remember watching Mad Max: Fury Road on the day, that was right before Jurassic World was about to come out in theaters. From the opening moment, of where we see some of the credits rolling, then we see Max being chase by the War-boys, and being capture by them, this is where I literally going to the edge of my seat. Not only to the opening scene of the film, but the entire movie from start to finish, yes. What happened was we been seeing that almost the entire film is set out in the desert, and then we been getting tons of action and, chase sequences. We see people are getting shot at with bullets and arrows. Cars are getting destroyed by big trucks. War-boys are throwing sticks to people's cars that can actually explode. Then, we also see this one character, whose call himself The Doof Warrior, and he's on top of a big truck, playing his flame throwing guitar, while the truck is driving. That's actually one of the most craziest and memorable moments I've ever seen from a film. Somehow, I just really like the way how this movie cranks itself up. Every single one of these action scenes is absolutely exhilarating, and there is just so much in it. It's like, the director; George Miller was thinking this through, by not only the plot, but also the action sequences. He was trying not to make it too long, but he was trying not to make it too short either. All he was trying to do was keeping everything in balance. It's like he thinks to himself on how that works, and how that doesn't. The action sequences goes on to one thing after another, and while the action is rolling along, and keeping everything fast-paced, we also see that the characters don't at all come across being stiffed, and the film switches to one character to another to see what's going on to them, or what's happening to them. That's what so great about it because you can totally feel the exhilaration coming right at you, when those things are presented in the film. The scenery looks beautiful, and the visuals are over-the-top in such an exciting way. I also notice that the film does run about 2 hours long, and there are some moments in the film that does come off slow, but believe me, I was never at all bored with anything in this movie.The one performance in this movie, that really acts like a real star in there and it's not Tom Hardy-I would admit that Tom Hardy is actually quite good. I've always like him, since the first time I saw in a movie, which that was Inception. In here, he does seem to be good, when he's in his game, but the one performance, which does so many things in there is Charlize Theron. I do see that she's been getting a few Razzie nominations, all because of that movie she was in last year, A Million Ways to Die in the West, but in here, I really enjoyed watching her, when she's playing this female action hero, Furiosa. I really like her performance as much as I really like Sigourney Weaver in Aliens. Her outfit or the style of her character looks amazing. She's brave, she's fearless, and she does a lot of driving, a lot of shooting, and other things that makes her a reason of why she's like a real star to this. Nicholas Hoult, on the other hand, steals the shows, when he's playing the character, Nux, and I also have this big connection to his character. In fact, I really do have a connection with all these characters in the film, even if I don't know much about them. As for the rest of the supporting cast, they all did a fine job. My full opinion: For all of its exhilarating action, and everything that the film delivers, Mad Max: Fury Road is an amazing, and yet, an insane ride. 9.6/10",

    "review": "  At this point, there's probably nothing original I could write about MAD MAX FURY ROAD. Following a long gestation period and an insane level of hype that it most certainly lived up to, this long-awaited sequel/reboot was just the kind of fuel injection that the action blockbuster has been in need of for quite some time. It's a balls-to-the-wall action film that is brimming with subtext in a way that most dramas don't even come close to matching. What George Miller has done is bring cinema back to the basics of the story told through moving images, with dialogue/exposition brought to a minimum. In the absence of a lot of talking, which some will interpret as a lack of story/plot while others will simply be turned off, the characters are developed through their actions, what they wear, what they drive, etc. It's basically a production designer's heaven, as there are no superfluous details. Everything and everyone in this world has a purpose, but you have to be perceptive enough to catch it; it will also take multiple viewings to be able to truly absorb all of the little things because a lot of them pass by so quickly. In response to the ignoranamuses/ignorami(?) who belittle the film for its apparent feminist stance, a careful viewing of the film will put that to rest. Yes, the female characters are strong and have agency, but they are given equal status to the male characters. All you have to do is look at the patriarchal society led by Immortan Joe and the Many Mothers. In both power structures, the absence of the other has led them down a precarious path that is only rectified when they (Max and Furiosa) realize that they have to work together in order to survive. The basic message of the film is redemption is only possible through mutual respect and teamwork. Of course, there's all of the action. Seeing as the film is basically a two-hour chase, there are quite a few set-pieces which only get better as the film progresses. And what makes this even more glorious is that these were accomplished in a largely practical manner (with a couple notable exceptions). And because endless action would wear you out, there are a few brief moments of respite where the philosophical underpinnings of the film are made a little bit clearer. Taken as a whole, MAD MAX FURY ROAD is perhaps one of the most complete action films, and a perfectly good example of what Hitchcock termed \"pure cinema\" (and was also a term used by Miller in promotion for the film). My only complaint is that some of the dialogue is a little bit silly, and isn't helped by some occasionally stilted delivery. However, that's a minor quibble when considering how fully realized the film is. George Miller has come back with a vengeance and shown the imitators how its done, even besting (in my opinion) the high mark set by his original trilogy. Do yourself a favor and see this for yourself if you haven't already (or again, if you have).",

Leaving you with the sense that you have just sat through the greatest two hours in action movie history. And that is what Mad max is, it doesn't pretend to be anything else. It doesn't slap you across the face with politics or social issues and doesn't try to shove the directors ideals down your throat. It is pure action, unadorned and as naked as the wives.

    "review": "  I always wondered about lone critics who disagreed with the general consensus. Did they not see the same movie the rest of us did? And yet for Mad Max: Fury Road, I find myself going against the grain. This was a good movie, but certainly not a great one. The Road Warrior was a great movie. At the risk of sounding heretic, the first half of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome might have been even better.What those movies had that Fury Road does not were two welcome qualities in an action movie, which are attitude and restraint. In regard to restraint, this movie was almost non-stop action. That sounds good on paper, but it tends to diminish the impact of action scenes as they pile up throughout the film, one after another. It's a bit like Indiana Jones riding off on a horse and stealing a truck from the Nazis. It's one of the best action scenes ever filmed, but part of why it's so great is because it's not 2 hours long. During parts of this film, I felt like I was watching a Cirque De Soleil performance. It was too much, too often. And though the movie had character development, it lacked attitude. As an example from Beyond Thunderdome, there's a scene where Gibson's Max has to relinquish his weapons. As he pulls more and more of them out from every nook and cranny, the collector of weapons has a look on his face that says, \"I've seen it all, and even I know this is one bad man\". It's an incredible scene that sets the tone for what Max has evolved into since The Road Warrior - and it didn't take 5000 extras to film or require a massive explosion. That's what I mean by \"attitude\". In Fury Road, Tom Hardy's Max never has a single moment of even that magnitude, much less a Thunderdome-esque scene where all eyes are on him. Instead, we get that for Charlize Theron's character. And while that might please some who are looking for more female heroines, I didn't pay to see \"Tomb Raider\". I paid to see Mad Max. In The Road Warrior, the villains knew who Max was by the end (though not by name). And the people he saved? They knew him as well, hence the haunting monologue at the end. But in Fury Road, it seems the only one who knew him by the end and was truly impacted by his presence along the way was Furiosa. Which brings up a natural question, \"If the grand majority of the characters in the movie don't know or care who Max is by the end, then why should the audience?\"",

    "review": "  This film is lost in its own little world, I love this fucking movie.We waited 30 damn years for this sequel, God it was worth it. These films aren't big on story or character development, but I think it's more the idea of the series. You have to get lost in these films like the other characters are. You'll understand why they have do the things they do in this terrible, post-apocalyptic world, and have a good time while you're at it.That being said, Mad Max: Fury Road is just as absurd, bizarre, unique, and... well... mad. Tom Hardy gives a funny and great performance as Max, he's a great addition to the series and a good replacement for Mel Gibson(who had a quick cameo). Charlize Theron is also cool, but I think Nicholas Hoult was far more interesting. He absolutely disappeared under the white makeup and surprised me of how much effort he was putting into this performance. I love seeing George Miller expand on his universe and really show us just how screwy the future could be if society truly would fall apart. The bigger budget makes this movie look and sound amazing, and somehow, it still contains the same feel as the first two Mad Max films(\"Beyond Thunderdome\" kinda got bland).I look forward to future installments. Continue expanding this world, George Miller. Take all my money.",

My disappointment was just delayed, remake turned Mad Max into pussy Max, and the whole thing came across as a victim mentality. I don't think the filmmaker was in touch with the nerve the original Fury Road touched and its a shame, if he would have got it, it could be the new cult movie instead its just a Starship Troopers 2 with no redeeming qualities other than the cute harem of gals.",

Where was the dog and Gyro Man when you really needed them?The acting, if you can call it acting was limited to 10 word utterances. Hardy was god-awful with his Aussie type accent if you can call it that. In fact the accent changed towards the end of the flick. The only redeeming features where Charlize Theron and some of the action sequences. But while it was loaded with action so much of the film was speeded up to supposedly heighten the action which it did not. The plot was so thin as well. All in all a total waste of time of true Mad Max fans.",

George Miller does an excellent job at bringing back the elements on what made The Road Warrior so great and pushes them up to the highest level. This film tells it's story through a visual style instead of hitting us with lines and lines of dialogue, and developing our characters not through exposition but instead through the actions our characters go through. Something that alway stands out to me is how beautiful this film is, there is one certain scene involving a sandstorm where I have to say it is one of the most beautiful moments I've seen in film. I loved Mad Max: Fury Road, the action is spectacular , it works with it's visual storytelling , and is a beautiful symphony of death, destruction and creativity.",

    "review": "  Why I didn't care for the Fury RoadI'm sure most of us have seen Mad Max Fury Road. The movie critics gave it great reviews, rotten tomatoes, and IMDB all show it having approximately a 98% approval rating and now the international film festivals all giving it awards and high accolades.These are all opinions and everyone is entitled to their opinions. There was just something missing when I watched this reintroduction of one of my childhood heroes. That despondent loner who was first on the search for vengeance for his life that was torn apart and then as a he wanders the dessert in a post apocalyptic Australia he finds himself an unlikely hero to people more desperate than himself. He always manages to win the fight against overwhelming odds.When watching the former Mad Max Trilogy I always felt a sense of isolation, and desperation. I felt I emotionally connected and could empathize with how lonely his world could be; His family and friends gone, food, gasoline, and water are so scarce they are priceless and coveted by all.Much of what had built that emotional connection for me in those movies were the cinematography, the sound track/audio work, and the pacing. It wasn't a rip roaring adventure chase scene throughout, it slowed at times and built a sense of suspense and offered time to know and understand key characters.In my opinion I felt at the opening of Fury Road we should have received a more thorough reintroduction to Max. Those of us who know him already, have not seen him in 30 years (certainly some have re-watched the films), others may have no clue who he is, also he has lived for a period of time wandering the post apocalyptic wasteland on his own since the last film. Show me how this has affected him. In the opening of Fury Road we get a brief voice over monologue as introduction and we see Max forced to eat a lizard as a means of sustenance. Then he is almost immediately captured by bandits from the Citadel.Even a brief montage of Max searching for something, fuel, food, civilization, show him on the outskirts of the Citadel contemplating if it is a safe place or hostile, give me a camera shot of a small section of road sand blowing over it as a hint of the world that use to be but is now forever lost, Max shaking an empty canteen thirsting for water, shaking empty gas cans. These small things could easily build an emotional connection to Max and make me feel a need to root for him as I then have a better sense of what it would be like in this desperate situation. Then we find ourselves at the Citadel... Lots of dirty skinny people here, it must be a crappy place to live but better than wandering the dessert alone. I really don't know how bad these people's lives may be but they get really excited when that rare and coveted resource called water is released...Wait is water not such a rare resource or are these people just idiots, because when the water is released they catch about 1 cups worth in their random pots and pans then splash around in what is left on the ground. Is this a utopia of plenty filled with a population of morons?Then their leader Imperator Joe the one who controls the water tells them to not become addicted to the water. Everyone needs water, it's not an addiction it's a necessity Joe. Just bad dialogue...Joe is a God like figure to this community we later find out because he controls the water and it is pumped up from the ground and only he can command it to be released. So obviously this clan is beholden to him. Also there is plenty of water he is just holding back to maintain his hold on the communityHe does have a very ominous mask and costume so I honestly like him as a bad guy figure regardless of some of the less than stirring dialogue he is given.Then we meet Furious. She gets to drive the truck. Why? I don't know. Apparently she has proved herself in this male dominated militaristic society. I appreciate woman in a strong leadership roles but this society clearly doesn't seem to be heavily dominated by women. I would have appreciated Furiosa's character had I some idea of how she managed to become so entrusted that she gets to drive the truck that hauls their most precious resources fuel, water, and breast milk. That's right the Citadel is a lady milk dairy farm. It doesn't specifically say that but it is conveyed through brief shots of women in a milking room. Just a brief glimpse into her past, flashbacks something throughout the movie to show me what she overcame could really help elevate her character and make you cheer for her. Again it's all about creating an emotional empathy for a character for me.So Away she goes with her small contingent of security vehicles on her way to the Bullet Farm and Gas Town, I guess to trade milk for supplies... ROAD TRIP!!We are driving, we are driving, whoa wait what? she went the wrong way...WHY!?! Don't know. Joe's crew is watching, Uh oh she's gone rogue. Why? Uh oh Joe is mad apparently Furiosa stole his lady friends or prized breeders as Joe calls them. You know pet names and all. So cute.Joe sends out the call to chase down Furiosa and get his ladies back. Rally the WAR BOYS!!Now we meet NUX, who I really didn't like in the beginning but now I will say he is the only character in the movie that was dynamic enough to make me care about him. NUX as a war boy has one purpose in life and that is to do as Joe commands and if he does an honorable job and pleases Joe he will enter the gates of Valhalla; which I can only assume is some form of heaven. As the movie progresses NUX goes from only wanting to please Joe to realizing he can do good for others and in doing so he would be more significant in this life than he ever was when he was just a war boy out to please Joe.Additional characters that I believe could have used better development are the Breeders and the Mothers or old ladies, I'm not sure what they were real called because by the time we meet them I was just wishing the movie would end.The breeders are taken to safety by Furiosa, or they were kidnapped by her because she thought they were abused and didn't want to be with Joe. I'm not sure if the Breeders wanted to leave or Furiosa convinced them they should leave because once they are being pursued by Joe they seem to want to return to him. A simple scene showing how these women suffered under Joe's captivity would have made me care much more about these women. Not that I want to see abuse or cruelty to women but an indication that they had suffered would build an emotional connection that you then want to help save them as well.The Breeders are the central component of the movie; we should be made to care if they escape.The old women seriously they just loosely tied a few things together like hey there is no green place turn around and go home. Honestly they could have driven there met no one and formulated a plan to go back.Now the guitar guy...I enjoyed the concept of the guitar guy jamming out as the war party moved along but I wanted him to actually play the music that you hear. Instead he plays a bar and then there is a score that takes over and includes none of his guitar work. I wanted him to be James Hatfield from Metallica melting my face with Fuel for fire...makes sense they need fuel, guitar guy is shooting fire. Also guitar guy is shooting fire but not using it to fight anyone, super wasteful!Here in a post apocalyptic world where fuel is scares and this idiot is just burning it up!!I don't feel a sense of scarce resource or desperation. The Breeders are wasting water when they get one of their miraculous escapes from a horde of fast moving vehicles. All the vehicles are supercharged gas guzzlers, NUX empties about 10 gallons of gas into his car in an attempt to kill himself and blow up the war wagon. Really if I was in charge and someone wasted that much gas there would be no Valhalla for them.I just didn't get the same desperate, these are hard times sense from this movie. I wanted to feel suspense, the whole time you just knew these guys were going to make it and Furiosa and Max would live but you knew NUX was going to be dead before the movie was over. Of course they had their close calls but never did you think \"oh man this is the end for them\".It was a great bit of Cirque Du Sole style chase scenes pieced together again and again but I really could have done with 45 min less chase scene and 45 min more character development.On top of all of this I'm a car guy and there were a number of ridiculous vehicle related items that were wrong or nearly impossible.Climbing around touching hot exhaust pipes, an 18 wheeler can escape motorcycles and supercharged cars, Nux drives with a flat tire at high speed (Max would have to stay in place for this to be somewhat possible but still incredibly unlikely, spitting a fuel mixture into the supercharger and getting boost, climbing around in an engine compartment fixing the engine while driving down the road and its not just a single engine it's a dual engine setup. This rig would lose so much power after losing 50% of its power it would be crawling along not out running all those other vehicles.Yes, Yes it's just a movie don't nitpick the silly details but really character development could have tied it all together in a Lovely package for me.Okay enough of the why I didn't like it. Honestly I just wanted more of an emotional connection to the characters.Positives There were lots of explosions It was well shot The action scenes were well choreographed Joe's costume was unique-ish (Post apocalyptic Darth Vader) Pro-Breast feeding",

Shot and directed to perfection, with breath-taking action and a killer score, Mad Max defies almost all tropes of modern Hollywood blockbusters. The film is incredibly smooth, and provides the rare opportunity to just sink in and forget about everything around you, which seems to be lacking from many other films.One thing I noticed and really appreciated is how colorful the movie is. Instead of a dark tone, Miller chose to color the movie with nothing but bright and vibrant shades. Even the night-time scenes are a very vibrant blue.It's quite mind-boggling to think that Miller, a 70-year old man, creating this master-class non-stop action thrill ride. The first twenty minutes are filled with more energy and passion than about any film that's come out this year. The only movie in recent memory that I'd say rivals this one in sheer intensity is Whiplash.",

    "review": "  A flat out action-fest. A two hour car chase, or maybe more accurately tank/car/motocycle/semi/vehiclewithwheels chase. But a great one. Tom Hardy may get top billing, but Charlize Theron feels like the protagonist of the movie with Hardy's Max being a close second. Having never seen the original Mad Max films, I was not sure what to expect, but it played out pretty much how I expected from the trailers and clips I had seen. Take a movie that goes over the top on outrageous costumes, sets and action sequences, and then ramp that up to 11. That should be a pretty good idea of what to expect with this movie. For example, when we first meet the women that Max is trying to help free, they are removing chastity belts that literally have razor sharp teeth on them. There is a post-nuclear fallout mutant that plays a flame-shooting guitar nonstop in front of a giant wall of speakers attached to a war vehicle. Everytime they came up with a concept or idea, I feel like they said \"That is great! But can we make it bigger, or crazier.\"Hardy's Max is a quiet hero, with a touch of insanity that never gets fully explored. Maybe that character trait is being saved for a sequel. I think he says a total of 40 words throughout the film. But it works. Theron is a hardened road warrior (wink wink) that is trying to balance out the horrors that were done to her. She does a great job with this and comes across as a strong determined leader.",

    "review": "  Mad Max is a sequel (one could suppose) to the three films of the Mel Gibson era, although it is more of a reinvention of the Mad Max world (or perhaps reimagining is a better word). To this end Miller brings a creative hand that is sheer spectacle on a grand scale. A little digging reveals that this film was reportedly made over a period of 14 years, initially constructed as a single chase sequence. Although the final product provides some ingenious ways of narrowing our focus in on the characters (through colourful imagery and attention to the small details), the thrill of the chase is very much intact. As with the Mad Max motif, the setting is a post apocalyptic world where resources are slim. Max (the man of little words) finds himself enslaved in a majestic desert enclave where, along with the rest of the slaves, finds himself at the feet of a merciless leader who has been hoarding an underground water source for his own purposes. The film's plot, which is refreshingly simple against this backdrop, moves forward when (as a character suggests at one point) the people start to push back. This push back comes in the person of Furiousa (Theron), who creates a plan to free the wives who have been taken by the merciless leader for their ability to repopulate the new earth with perfect human offspring. Here the world of Furiousa and Max intersect. There is much to be said about the details themselves. It feels like every aspect has been meticulously handled with not just intentional oversight, but intimate and personal motivation. The cars themselves become each become a character, and you almost feel a hint of sadness when they meet their demise. They are a fusion of time periods and eras, an effort to sentimentalize a time that is long past perhaps. Some of the vehicles emerge with some familiarity (the spiked menaces and the long fuel truck), while others elicit some surprises in ingenuity (the acrobatic sequences with the long extending poles come to mind). The colour red is used for striking contrast in the desert setting, symbolizing the fine line between life and death (illuminating an epic sand storm as well). The colours merge with the characters themselves (the white attire of the retreating women also providing a striking contrast), with the underlying emotion and subtle sexual tensions that arise (which are wonderfully and tastefully explored with a degree of subtle modesty) colouring the movement of the film itself. At the heart of the film is the question of hope, which comes as both an idea and a character. The question that looms is one that Max assumes at one point in the film, suggesting that one needs to be careful about the idea of hope, for when hope fails your world fails with it. The idea of hope also becomes a question of the chase and the journey, a question of choices and direction. The film's concluding sequences, which I won't reveal here, becomes an intriguing commentary on these ideas, taking the layers off of the question of what happens when hope fails. The character of Nux (Hoult) is perhaps the most intriguing, especially in a discussion of the film's heart and soul. As we move from the spectacle to the chase, and from the chase to the person, Nux, a man who knows only one form of life (blood and war) gets swept into this journey of hope. His transformation reaches outwards to the nomadic purposes of Max (whose sole purpose is to survive) and to the community minded mission of Furiousa. Nux becomes a picture of the possibilities that hope can provide in such an immersive and merciless apocalyptic setting. Life is about more than living and dying. He becomes an embodiment of redemption, of new life, even for as crippled and hopeless as his body and circumstance appear to be. Set against such an epic back drop (which includes a massive vehicle to transport a blazing electric guitar and a riser of drums.), this idea becomes somewhat monumental. Mad Max is a reinvention that brings the series to a whole other level. It is spectacle and it is commentary. It is post apocalyptic and it is wonderfully retro. It moves with fury but it demands attention to detail. It is what a summer film should be.",

Yeah, Borderlands has more story/dialogue if you think of it over Mad Max (Mad is more action than dialogue...something I don't like very much on movies since I love more to think than to sleep). Honestly, this movie works coz it's visually stunning and if you have played those games, you will love it even more OR if you grew up watching the original...nostalgia must be the correct choice. So yes, I recommend this film only for those reasons. The music score is not that bad neither the make up but editing has it's flaws (to much speed on scenes that could work with the correct slow-neutral touch?).

Admittedly it doesn't have a complex plot, it won't change the way you live your life or make you question yourself in a spiritual way but this is very much in keeping the previous Mad Max films. Just like in Mad Max 2 and 3 the world is in a post-apocalyptic state of anarchy. Human beings struggle for basic things like food, water and clothes it seems but do possess some damn funky automobiles and other associated gizmos that would make the average petrolhead very excited indeed. Very early on Max and his iconic car with the spinney turbo thing coming out of the bonnet gets captured by a group of Chelsea football hooligans. Nothing very mad about Max here as puts up about as much of a fight as you would expect if Michael Jackson wrestled Mr T, lame. To summarise some people decide to pop out for some groceries in a huge truck and since the desert lacks road signs they subsequently get lost. A scouting party is sent to find then and direct them to the nearest Kwikimart but they find that a group of young, under nourished girls have stowed away on the truck. Their Dad\\Uncle\\Boyfriend (he is all of these at once) is very upset about this, puts on his Darth Vader costume and goes to find them himself. Then a big chase happens followed by a very brief lull, then another big chase with some explosions and just in case you felt that there wasn't enough chases there are some more and that's about it.Tom Hardy basically just grunts a lot but fortunately not in an incoherent Bane type way. But ill allow this as Max is supposed to be mean and moody and this he does successfully. But let's face it, this is really Charlize Therons film. She does her best pseudo Robocop\\Annie Lennox impression and drives a truck. Everyone else's role is just to look good and this is achieved in the main. You would think that a 2 hour chase would wear thin very quickly (Terminator 3 anyone?) but Fury Road manages to avoid this. Maybe it's because it's so well choreographed and just looks so damn great in a Neil Armstrong magnificent desolation kind of way. I would also pay big money for some the more popular music acts around these days to employ the use of the flame throwing guitar live on set. This would obviously mean the donning of a flameproof suit anywhere near the vicinity but the upside is that we wouldn't be able to hear the Beibers and One Directions of this world. Win.",

Fury Road, for some people, does seem to just be a two-hour action sequence. However I did find a lot more to this movie than that. One of the things about the Mad Max movies is that they were not very dialogue-driven but rather told mainly through visual storytelling, and that continues here. Plus there is a story told through this two hour sequence and the action and chases actually play an important part. It's a road action-escort mission film, so the action plays a major part in the story, which is why having it focus a lot on the action and thrills doesn't really bother me so much.",

    "review": "  After a surprise premier at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Mad Max: Fury Road is poised to melt audience's faces off this weekend. Supposedly picking up things where the 1985 film Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome left off, George Miller's new installment in the franchise sees the titular character (this time played by Tom Hardy) facing off against more carnage, blood, guns, cars, and chaos. Max has just pissed off a local warlord/cult leader named Immortan Joe, and he is out for revenge. His escape through the Australian outback sees him cross paths with Furiosa, a dangerous and unpredictable rogue leader with her own agenda. The two form a makeshift team of sorts, and the pair must to to rely on each other in order to outwit Immortan Joe's ever growing pursuit.Essentially, this all boils down to one hell of a chase movie, filled to the brim with hyper-masculinized batshit crazy antics. Miller directs the action sequences flawlessly with a kinetic, constantly-moving energy, which adds a mesmerizing layer of visceral appeal to the whole thing. Fury Road is pure spectacle and looks great - even in 3D, where objects fly in and out of the frame without feeling too gimmicky or distracting. The level and precision of detail that went into this film is almost as crazy as the stunts; various tattoos, weapons, clothing, vehicles, makeup, etc. are all incredibly well-crafted and give the film a unique feel of time and place. Oscar nom for Best Production Design anyone?Despite the film's desire to be constantly churning on a violent machismo overdrive, Fury Road feels perplexingly feminist at times. Charlize Theron's portrayal of Furiosa easily makes her the coolest character in the film, and her determination to be both wickedly badass but still sensitive when needed overshadows Hardy's quiet and one-dimensional performance as Max. And then there is a scene where an all-women militia take out a human trafficking gang. Girl power for the win.Fury Road, like many other films of its genre, suffers a bit from lack of characterization, dialogue, and undervalued performances. The most we ever hear from Max is during the opening voice-over, where he sprawls on giving the necessary exposition to explain that this is a post-apocalyptic film where survival is valued and ethics and law are not. I wish we could have seen more of an explanation for his backstory, or more interactions with him and Furiosa - just something more to show that Max is indeed a person and not some lifeless prop.Despite it's few setbacks, Fury Road keeps the narrative tight and compelling, which compliments the unstoppable fluidity of the action. It's a rich and immersive film, sure to impress those who can stomach it's brutality, and a rare treat to see something so adrenaline-packed without compromising on story.Leaving me feeling like a child at the amusement park, Fury Road no doubt sets the bar high for what a summer action flick can and should aspire to.",

    "review": "  This movie is perfect. It has so much more than tons of fantastic action. There are actual character arcs! No shaky cam! Practical stunts and effects! The only people who say this movie is short on plot are the same people who have problems paying attention in movies. Or, perhaps, they are used to amateurish backstory-dialog-dumps that have unfortunately become the norm. Characters only say things to each other that actually make sense, not like in Christopher Nolan movies where they bizarrely tell each other things they already know for the benefit of the viewer which they must know is there because otherwise there is no reason for them to be saying what they are saying. You need to get absorbed in the movie and PAY FUCKING ATTENTION YOU STUPID TWATS! All the plot is there, all the exquisite detail of the world is there, just get absorbed in the movie and look at it from the point of view of a person dropped in the world. There are enough dialog cues to tell you everything you need to know, but apparently everyone wants their dialog the same way Mac from Sunny wants it. I can't even comprehend anyone not liking this movie, it is perfect.",

There is a reason for all the hype, indeed: Fury Road is a non-stop roller coaster ride, which consists of 3 major action scenes scattered in 2 relentless hours of film. However, I don�t believe this movie deserves ALL the hype it�s been getting: its ending feels rushed, and so does Immortan Joe�s demise: it seems as random as any of the thousands of thugs' - or warboys, if you may - deaths we witness during the film. I believe this movie should be remembered for what it clearly serves: brilliantly orchestrated action sequences, together with the strong, memorable character that is Imperator Furiosa.",

The film works on almost every level: as a comic book movie, as an action flick, as a character study, and much more. Also, it has beautiful cinematography and performances to burn; some of the CGI was almost as good as in the 2009 movie \"Avatar\", I dare to say.

If I want to connect to Max's story I am better of dusting off the first three. It is, however, visual entertainment and for that it is great fun for a movie night, but not a worthy successor. I do not understand that the titular character is playing second fiddle to Ms. Theron's character. I almost feels that Mad Max was added to justify the Mad Max elements (post apocalyptic landscape, tribal societies and outrageous vehicle) and to boost box office sales. The script seems to be written not to tell Max's story, he's just along for the ride. The one moment MAx had an opportunity to take central stage and which might have made it a Mad Max film, was cut on the editing floor I assume. It was the nightly action, where Max returns with blood on his face and the viewer does not even get a glimpse of what our boy did. Just Charlize's words \"it is not his blood\".",

    "review": "  30 years after the release of 'Thunderdome' Mad Max is finally back. The lone wolf, the single warrior, the loner, the lone soldier, the outcast, the outsider, the man with no name...errr...named Max. The hype has been stratospheric for this one, I have gone into this expecting truly mind blowing things, the greatest action movie ever made? lets see, I will be brutally honest in every aspect.So the bottom line, this is virtually based around one sequence from 'Mad Max 2' and made into an entire movie. We all know which sequence, the one with that bloody great gas tanker covered in gun turrets and spikes. That sequence was epic on so many levels, a truly award winning vision of distopian science fiction...where all the goodies get killed, awesome. Now, in this tale Max has been captured by the War boys who are all led by Immortan Joe. Your standard gang of barbaric lunatics, only this time not kitted out in S&M gear, no this time they are all painted up in a tribal sort of way. Long story short, Max has gotta reluctantly help out Charlize Theron's character of Furiosa (with the help of Nicholas Hoult's ill War Boy character, Nux) in saving some damsels in distress from Joe whilst trying to reach some fabled lush green lands. This of course equals a whole load of vehicle chases across the outback which basically never stop.The first sequence we see is Max's classic and gorgeous black pursuit special (the now famous 1973 Ford XB Falcon GT) getting trashed, wait what??!! I heard about this before hand and I have to say I don't like it one bit, I wanted to see that fucking car in action once again, damn it Miller! Not quite sure how Max's super fast special manages to get wiped out by the collection of clown cars chasing him but never mind, it bloody happened didn't it, ugh!So one of the first things we see as the real story kicks in is Immortan Joe's citadel which appears to built into a fecking massive cliff. How the hell did they manage to do that? there's like some sprawling catacombs in this rock by the looks of it, I wouldn't of thought anyone had any time in between killing each other and building ridiculous killer automobiles. This is actually one aspect that didn't sit well with me, this whole idea felt way too grand and over the top for a Mad Max movie, it looked like something from the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy...only with cars instead of orcs. Then if I really wanted to be picky I would ask how everyone is so muscular in this dead post-apocalyptic world, meh don't question it. Its here we start to see the strange freakish array of characters that inhabit this new Earth, gotta say I loved what I saw here for the most part. Miller has always been good at creating these bizarre characters for this franchise and he nails it again here.Most of the bad guys are just big rippling baldies covered in white paint for some reason (the War Boys), not much background given but they look intimidating for sure. Other citadel dwellers and bad guys come in various shapes and sizes such as the creepy looking Corpus Colossus, a physically disabled child of Joe with exceptional intelligence (a real person with a real disability). Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones), a huge muscular mammoth of a man, dim-witted and another son of Joe. The Bullet Farmer who is some ugly aging bloke in a suit of bullets and...is a farmer?, hence is name. The People Eater is a big fat bald guy (everyone is bald in the distopian future) who I guess eats people? Again hence is name and the reason he's so fat, he also looks to have lost his nose because he wears some kind of metal plate there. The Doof Warrior who is some crazy blind bloke that rides a war rig (the Doof Wagon) into battle strapped to some huge speakers and playing a fire spouting guitar. This guy seems to have become the new Boba Fett of the movie world but he doesn't actually do anything, in fact I fail to see the point of him or the drummers other than simply to look cool. Admittedly he does look cool, certainly unique with his mothers face for a mask (oh yes), but basically pointless.Lastly we have Immortan Joe who is easily the most effective looking character I've seen in years. His mask appears to be some kind of breathing apparatus that is attached to some kind of bellows around his neck. The mask is slightly reminiscent of an old WWII pilots oxygen mask but with a terrifying line of big teeth like a skeleton. Not too sure about his ending though, was his mask like...attached to has face and skull? He also seems to wear some kind of transparent body armour with medals and whatnot attached, obviously he suffers from some kind of affliction or disease. Visually this guy looks fucking amazing, the makeup really tops it off with his pale ghostly complexion and silver balding, widows peak hair line. All in all the selection of characters gave off a very 'Dune-esque' (1984) vibe in my opinion.The action is virtually constant here, its the trademark of the movie (and franchise), non-stop. The main bulk of the action centres around Max and co trying to escape on the tanker under a barrage of gunfire and explosions. Now yeah, we've seen this before in 'Mad Max 2' but this has been ramped up to maximum overdrive, its insane! There are vehicles being torn up and flipped all over, metal mechanical shrapnel shattering all over the desert, bodies are flying everywhere, War Boys are leaping around on pole vault type things hurling explosives, gunfire, stabbings, fisticuffs...all happening on and off various extreme vehicle creations. It all looks completely real (because all the stunts were real), its highly impressive and shows great achievement in both eruptive action and practical effects. On top of that the location work, scenery shots, panoramas and the crisp, bold colour palette really look nothing short of gorgeous, it almost looks too good for this type of movie. Gives you faith in movies again it really does.That's not to say the action saves it completely, in my view. Amongst all this grade A action you do have to wonder how Max, Joe and others manage to survive some of the horrific fender benders they get into. The good guys battle their way away from the citadel, all that way, only to come back again and do it all again? wut?! The canyon sequence stuck out as a very daft cheesy notion. This biker gang that hides out there, living in and around the canyon walls, which they ride about on...with motorbikes? bit risky isn't it. Also, where did they all get their matching costumes? When the good guys come back through the canyon, do they go a different way? didn't it get blocked off. And it does all seem nuts that all this happens purely because Joe wants his girls back. He unleashes his entire armada and risks everything just for some ass? can't you find more girls in your citadel? Oh and in the end the citadel bad guys just let Max and co into their city and take over? huh? he just killed your leader.The greatest action flick ever? hmmm not too sure about that, its certainly up there but I still find myself preferring the gritty cult classic 'Mad Max 2' with Gibson. I think Hardy does a reasonable job but he is no Mad Max if you ask me. One thing I hated actually was the deliberate lack of dialog from Max, it worked well in the older films (MM2) simply because there was less to explain, 'MM2' was like a bloody 80's videogame it was so straight forward. Here there are things that could use background information plus the amount of times Max gets into a situation (mainly at the start) where I really wanted him to just speak! say something!! Explain your situation to Furiosa then she might not try to kill you...ugh! I found that actually frustrating and it didn't need to be like that.Still, the fact that the goodies went back on themselves towards the end really made me groan frankly. Its like Miller didn't know how to end it so he just made them go back and run the same gauntlet all over again, easy option for more of the same. I won't lie and say I didn't like it, but I won't lie and say I thought it was a stunning movie, the action is monumental at first but after the initial hardcore, automobile, carnage sequence, things felt a little tamer. The initial visual shock and awe that hit my eyeballs, making them swell, started to ease off. So awe-inspiring visuals all round and some great characters...visually at least. Is this a good flick? yes, yes is it, its a very engaging solid action movie, buts lets not get too carried away. Its really a one trick pony if you're honest about it, big gas tanker with goodies fights off hordes of baddies, rinse, wash and repeat until credits. The only real difference is its Furiosa's story, and to a degree, Nux too, unfortunately Max is just along for the ride in his 30 year old reboot.",

I could say how I've seen it four times and how I have friends who are going to see it their 2nd/3rd times tonight. The first time I saw it, me and my buddy were so mesmerized by the film that we sat through every second of the credits (which are like 15 minutes long) blown away and speechless.. This was the most visceral, immersive movie experience I've ever had. Gravity and Avatar were also visceral and immersive but to even think about putting them in the same boat as Mad Max: Fury road is a joke. Before I ramble on and on, I'll keep it short and simple: Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action movie ever made. I enjoy bringing people who haven't seen it to see it so they too can experience what I think with time will be considered the best action movie ever by not just me, but by the majority of long-time film critics. See it twice, three times, see it ten times (I've heard of someone who has seen it 11 times), just make sure and see it once and get ready for roller-coaster adrenaline soaked 2 hour movie experience like no other. All I can say is it's so shiny, so chrome.",

    "review": "  It is one of the most intense, dark / gritty and badass action adventure I've seen in a very long time. Watching this one feels like I'm living in the 90's or something. It kinda reminds me on how cinematography is well executed without any nonsense or by putting huge explosions and overused CGI effects (Michael Bay should take notes on this one). The chasing scenes are the most brutal and jaw dropping as far as I can remember. The movie is beautifully shot with well great pacing. I've seen the last 3 Mad Max films but this one, it's just way beyond Mad Max. It is superbly amazing in every way. As far as the characters goes, I like Tom Hardy as Max, he might be different compared to Gibson's version of Max but, this guy nailed it. But Charlize Theron as Furiosa, I think this character will be remembered. She is super badass in this film. She really brings the impact of this film, the real hero till the end. Everything in this film is fantastic. It will or should have a sequel that's for sure. And people are furiously excited for the next one. Great job by George Miller bring the franchise in a very high note.",
