    "review": "  An arresting, disturbing documentary on the Church of Scientology told by former members who decided to leave at different points in time for various reasons. This is an interesting perspective for a documentary concerning the subject of religion, especially one that is so prevalent in Hollywood. The filmmakers do an excellent job collecting many different stories and viewpoints from those they speak to, and the result is a horrifying exercise of religious exploitation of power. The manipulation and abuse that infects this religion is very concerning, and it will be especially fascinating to watch the public's response to this movie once more people get the opportunity to watch it.",

    "review": "  If you thought scientology was creepy, just wait till you see this.I'm not ranking this higher because, despite being 2 hours long, there was potential to be even longer. There were plenty of other aspects of the church I'd like to know about, specifically the whole process of brainwashing. The documentary ended and I was still baffled at how many people go along with this shit. I couldn't believe it and needed to know more. By focusing a bit too much on the ex member, Going Clear suffers a bit by not going in depth on the research aspect of a documentary. Hopefully, this isn't the last we hear from this crew and we might have something that complements it in the future.Thanks to a beautiful presentation, a great structure, relentless pacing and shocking revelations, Going Clear is essential viewing for us to learn how something so preposterous became so unbelievably powerful.",

    "review": "  Completely one-sided? Yes! No one affiliated with Scientology would speak to the filmmakers. Which given the way they handle their business is no surprise. But, it did feel like a lost opportunity. Despite the one-sidedness of it all! This is probably one of the most shocking and eye-opening documentaries to be released this decade, if not ever. To have gotten to the level that Scientology has risen to and for them to be allowed to conduct their business in this manner. With very little intervention from our government! It was unsettling to realize just how much influence and power they have. While the film is not perfect! It stands as a very damning piece of evidence against Scientology and from a journalistic standpoint. It is an incredible expose on this controversial group and hopefully will shed light on their business practices. Help those who work within the church in some way and force those who hold higher-power within the organization to answer for any crimes they may have committed.",

    "review": "  Going Clear doesn't do anything new or special for the art of documentary film, but it does provide a fascinating peak behind the closed doors of the cult of Scientology. Though much of the doc's information on the subject is easily researchable (the film itself is based on a book), there's plenty of shocking, and downright chilling revelations within the accounts of the cult's former members participating here. Since most of these people are former high-ranking officials, members of internal security, and/or notable Hollywood figures, one can hardly be surprised by the wealth of inside information and controversy that they dredge up throughout the film. The documentary doesn't, however, resort to over-sensationalism or gossip-mongering to get its point across. It's simply being up front with the audience and recounting real, personal stories that detail abuse and corruption at the hands of the so-called church. This documentary is all about getting the truth out there. Indeed, notable celebrities such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta aren't demonized. Their public and private struggles serve only as cautionary examples of the power and influence of the organization and its leaders. If anything, audiences will sympathize with Scientology members and their families, and will hope that the information in this documentary becomes common knowledge -- putting more pressure on the church and hopefully one day brining its leaders to justice for their crimes.",

At its roots are lies, fabrications, and fantasy. What they offer is happiness and joy, but the cost is great misery and cutting off the loved ones from your life. This tells a good story and paints an extraordinary picture of Scientology.",

    "review": "  Anti-theists will look to this movie and point out how the theology of the Church of Scientology is no wackier than the stories of other religions, or that the barbarism allegedly practiced by Scientologists pales in comparison to the atrocities committed by other religions in the past. But that equivocation doesn't work well when you take into consideration that it is the 21st century, and humanity has supposedly evolved past the point of acts of barbarism in the name of the supernatural. Violent extremism of any type from any religion has no possible justification in the modern scientific era, and Scientology is not exception.As a documentary, it is an amazing piece of work that is told in chronological order, from L. Ron Hubbard's beginnings to the present day. As the interviewees talk about their cases, the mixture of hope and despair becomes palpable, as former members come to their realizations, leave the Church, but emphasize the depths to which current members have been trapped in or sunk to. Reason and rationale have no place in faith, but coupled with the monetary power behind the organization, the institution and its members become that much more intimidating.I'm just a small-time reviewer with a small-time podcast. My work hasn't caused more than a blip on the radar of a very few people. But I am legitimately nervous as I type this, because there is the very real possibility that when I post this, the defenders of Scientology will come at me as they have other people. Here's to hoping I'm not ruined.",

    "review": "  GOING CLEAR: SCIENTOLOGY AND THE PRISON OF BELIEF is directed by Alex Gibney and is based on the book by Lawrence Wright. While it doesn't really replace the book in any meaningful sense, it was a great companion piece that filled in a lot of gaps that a book was never going to fill anyway. Among these significant additions were archival footage of Scientology gatherings and L. Ron Hubbard, as well as interviews with many of the key people who provided anecdotes for the book. I suppose the edge that the film has is in being able to actually go behind the scenes with a look at how Scientology operates. Even still, the book goes into far more detail than the film had time to do. As for its documentary qualities, I thought it was well put-together, as is to be expected from veteran documentarian Alex Gibney. The interviews were sufficiently interesting, alternating between talking heads and archival footage. A couple of the crazier moments were courtesy of Tom Cruise, shown in one clip fervently saluting a portrait of Scientology founder, L. Ron Hubbard. The film even manages to tug at your heartstrings as the discussion moved to the Scientology policy of disconnection, and one former member recounts her daughter saying that she would have to disconnect from her. And of course there were all the tales of abuse at \"The Hole\" perpetrated against the Sea Org, the Scientology clergy. All together, it paints a very dark picture of a religion that uses fear and intimidation to keep its members in line while, at the same time, catering to its celebrity members' whims. I would have liked a little more general discussion about religion and how belief is used to control people, something that is touched upon a little bit towards the end, but for what it's worth this film does a great job exposing Scientology for the fraudulent scheme it is.",

Not much of what it contains is entirely new or shocking, for those who have heard some reports on Scientology in recent years, but it's thorough enough and scathing in its tale of the atrocities committed by this bogus church. The polished and provocative film lets former members--many of them in the higher echelon of the church's leadership at one time--speak candidly of their experiences with a cult that is insidious, vengeful, hideously controlling, spiritually and morally bankrupt, and rotten to the core. Even if only half of this expose is roughly accurate, the facts are infuriating. This so-called church is no church at all and certainly doesn't deserve its tax exempt status, gained by ruthless intimidation of IRS officials, who can certainly be cowed. Their \"leader,\" the Machiavellian David Mascavige, engages in the most despicable tactics to maintain control and ruin the lives of anyone who dares to criticize the organization. Yet many of the believers have chosen this and relinquished their free thought, even with the brainwashing that the \"church\" engages in. The interview subjects acknowledge this toward the end of the film, admitting their shame as well as their rage. One thing you can do is boycott the films of Tom Cruise, a shameless huckster for this bogus \"church\". His arrogance and complicity are made crystal clear.",

To be cruel to these people is furthering the abuse they allowed themselves to suffer until it could be, no more.

    "review": "  Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief is at once an intriguing social analysis and a disturbingly reflective in depth exploration about world religion. Specifically, scientology and how their beliefs have influenced their fellow members.Its at its most disquieting when exploring the life and history of its founder L. Ron Hubbard. But the truly unsettling part is how his earlier works of science fiction influenced the very basis of scientology. This is demonstrated by Hubbard's slow decline into mental illness, peaking during his times as a scientologist.The most frightening aspects came from archive recordings of church members and the stories of manipulation, harassment and degradation. Its in the interviews that the documentary wholly fleshes out the emotional turmoil experienced by those who have opposed or left he organisation.Footage of Tom Cruise, John Travolta, L. Ron Hubbard, David Michavige,Tommy Davis and meetings gave the confronting sense of how widespread it has become and its tax exemption and IRS protection heightened their power. A particular scene, with John Travolta, grabbed my attention. In the scene he asks if there is any other religion on the planet that preaches love and compassion. Really? I mean.....is he serious? Maybe John should get out more.It was most difficult to watch previous members talk about what had happened to them and the shame felt about what they'd done within the church. Especially when they were deemed a 'Suppressive person', a complete load of sh*t, or if asked to disconnect with family members. It was emotionally riveting but also depressing; saddening. The church itself has lashed out, as you'd expect, at both the director and ex-members in the documentary and denying many of the claims. In fact, they even created websites calling some of them psychopaths and wife beaters. And yes, they still defend themselves. The irony is that they defend themselves for doing things they openly do.Alex Gibney directed this film, written by Lawrence Wright and you can see the influence both had on the final product. Gibney himself was the subject of much complaint from the church, and has done an extraordinary job condensing everything about scientology. The thing is though, there are aspects the film doesn't thoroughly explore, like that of the abortion controversy only fleetingly mentioned. You can understand this, it can't all fit into a two hour documentary, but it leaves many questions.What Gibney does understand however, is how to seamlessly blend the archive footage with the later interviews. Its something that gives the film some gravitas which elevates it from a contemporary documentary. Gibney does this particularly when he is trying to discern the group as either a religion or cult. And yes, of course, he leans towards the latter. The most disappointing aspect here is we aren't given any interviews with current members, however you have to wonder if they would be allowed to conduct such without the church's intervention?Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief is a film that pushes the boundaries in terms of the definition of religion. Its compelling and well crafted and exceptionally heart-breaking. But, above all else, Going Clear is a film about susceptibility and control. Scientologists are going to get angry over this. I really, really hope they do *smiley face*. In the end, this is going to be the best publicity the film will get.",

Then pouring on humiliation & servitude & deprivation, gradually introducing physical punishments abuse & torture while adherents constantly beg forgiveness for imagined transgressions. When it gets physical is the main thing that draws the line between it & mainstream religion but not basic military training. This is why its so hard to resist or society to prosecute for all the damage that it does in its single minded pursuit of its agrandizing power & ever greater control over their victims' whole lives that is never satisfied.",

It's a powerful look at one of the world's most dangerous yet interesting group of people, all devoted to a religion that's not really a religion. It's a fascinating expose on the behind-the-scenes goings on that, while some will argue none of the information is new, puts it all into a whole new light.",

    "review": "  It still blows my mind and saddens my soul with how many people Scientology has deceived and all the carnage it was left in its wake. Broken up into three sections, Going Clear puts a personal face on the subject and clearly delineates Scientology's corruption of power and many abuses. The first part delves into former Scientologists and how they first got hooked in, the second a look at founder L. Ron Hubbard and its history, and the last focuses on the increasing number of allegations against the church and its current leader, David Miscavige. The biggest complaint levied against Going Clear is that it doesn't offer up much in the way of new information, and it's a valid one to some extent, but that makes the film no less powerful or scathing a critique. It's most helpful as a succinct summary, and very much a must-watch in that regard, especially for those unfamiliar. Hopefully, the film and stir it has caused will be a future catalyst that will lead to the FBI or someone finally being able to step in and shut them down for good.",

There were plenty of other aspects of the church I'd like to know about, specifically the whole process of brainwashing. The documentary ended and I was still baffled at how many people go along with this shit. I couldn't believe it and needed to know more. By focusing a bit too much on the ex member, Going Clear suffers a bit by not going in depth on the research aspect of a documentary. Hopefully, this isn't the last we hear from this crew and we might have something that complements it in the future.Thanks to a beautiful presentation, a great structure, relentless pacing and shocking revelations, Going Clear is essential viewing for us to learn how something so preposterous became so unbelievably powerful.",

    "review": "  La cienciologia ha estado rodeada en controversia desde su concepci�n.L.Ron Hubbard su fundador, era un hombre exc�ntrico, y siempre levanto sospechas. Este culto se volvi� popular gracias a hombres como Tom Cruise y John Travolta quienes la alababan apenas ten�an la oportunidad. Going Clear finalmente pone todas las cartas sobre la mesa, y expone de manera concisa las controversias que ha habido y a trav�s de los a�os y de manera espeluznante, nos presenta practicas que son inimaginables. Alex Gibney, uno de los mejores documentalistas trabajando hoy en d�a, entrevista a personas que estuvieron dentro de la iglesia ocupando altos rangos, y cuentan exactamente que pasa adentro. Es fascinante escuchar todos los detalles acerca de este culto, porque esta perfeccionado para prevenir que las personas puedan pensar por si mismas, por lo tanto crean una dependencia a esta instituci�n, y cada vez invierten mas dinero en ella y as� se mantiene. Detalles como las terapias a las cuales son sometidos los miembros llamados \"auditing\", sirven el prop�sito de interrogar para poder descubrir los secretos mas oscuros de los miembros, y estas sesiones a veces duran horas y horas, y luego son grabadas para mantener evidencia, por si alguna vez alg�n miembro decide irse, y asi son extorsionados a quedarse. Se menciona que personas de alto perfil como John Travolta son extorsionadas de esta manera, y esa es la raz�n por la cual sigue apoyando esta causa. Luego existen reportes de abusos y violencia psicol�gica y f�sica perpetradas por el mismo David Miscavige quien esta a cargo de la iglesia. Alarmantes declaraciones tambi�n de un lugar llamado \"The Hole\" donde personas que no obedecen, son llevados y a veces encerrados por a�os sin ning�n contacto hacia el mundo exterior y en condiciones terribles, y son sometidos a juegos psicol�gicos, por ejemplo, el cl�sico de las sillas donde estas personas est�n adoctrinadas a tal punto, que pelean por un puesto para poder quedarse dentro de este culto. Todo el sistema esta creado para esto. Para poder llegar al mayor nivel espiritual llamado \"clear\", los miembros tienen que aprobar estas pruebas, que por supuesto cada nivel tiene un precio en aumento. Luego, solo algunos que avanzan hacia los mas arriba pueden llegar a tener acceso a las creencias de este culto. Antes de esto, la causa se mantiene bastante escondida, y es de esta manera que tantas personas no renuncian, porque mientras mas arriba llegues en los niveles, toda la historia que de hecho es sacada de un libro de ciencia ficci�n escrito por el mismo Hubbard, es revelada, entonces solo las personas que ya est�n inmersas totalmente son capaces de aceptar este relato completamente ficticio y rid�culo.Este documental es explosivo, pero por suerte esta respaldado por pruebas contundentes, y testimonios de antiguos miembros, quienes fueron sometidos a los peores de los tratos. En la cultura moderna, la cienciologia es vista casi como una broma, y no se toma en serio. Luego de Going Clear, esta comprobado de que es un problema serio y hay que combatirlo. En el a�o 1993, fue aprobado por al IRS que la cienciologia se librara de pagar impuestos, por lo tanto toda la fortuna que logra recolectar de sus miembros es pasada directamente a Miscavige y a su circulo mas cercano. Going Clear es finalmente el expose que est�bamos esperando. Hubiese querido ver expuestas controversias acerca de Katie Holmes y tambi�n acerca de la esposa de Miscavige que lleva sin ser vista desde el 2007, pero probablemente no fue incluido por problemas legales. Igualmente este documental logra su cometido, nos deja con la boca abierta y sin ninguna duda que este culto es maligno y tiene que desaparecer.",

From what I have heard and gathered regarding Scientology, a lot of the hits and stories have already been covered in previous media ranging from the religion using Tom Cruise as their leading spokesman in the Aughts and having set him up on sanctioned dates following their forced divorce of him and Nicole Kidman, to their control over John Travolta, sketchy investments and looking for various forms of tax breaks, and various other no so favourable stories. The most interesting thing of the doc for me was looking into the story of Hubbard in the first portion of the film since I was only aware of his writting in a very passive way so it was interesting to see his sketchy war record, and how much of a huckster he became when it came to cross polinating his science fiction writtings and his dianetics and how he was able to sell a croc to so many folks. Also the fact, in 20/20 hindsight, how much of that they were able to incorporate into PT Andersons the Master which came out a few years ago. Will be a interesting follow up if ever some of the more powerful voices (and not just Haggis) come forward to add to this story. Erie.",

No. Not one person from the Order of Scientology spoke for this documentary; however, that's not the fault of the director. That fault lies with the Church (if that's what you want to call them...)This organization has wielded an immense amount of power and I never knew just how influential they were. I use all of these terms in the past tense for reason. The Church of Scientology claims that they have over 3.5 million members. Many public records place the actual membership at less than 25,000. Empires rise and fall......and so do certain \"religions\"...",

But that equivocation doesn't work well when you take into consideration that it is the 21st century, and humanity has supposedly evolved past the point of acts of barbarism in the name of the supernatural. Violent extremism of any type from any religion has no possible justification in the modern scientific era, and Scientology is not exception.As a documentary, it is an amazing piece of work that is told in chronological order, from L. Ron Hubbard's beginnings to the present day. As the interviewees talk about their cases, the mixture of hope and despair becomes palpable, as former members come to their realizations, leave the Church, but emphasize the depths to which current members have been trapped in or sunk to. Reason and rationale have no place in faith, but coupled with the monetary power behind the organization, the institution and its members become that much more intimidating.I'm just a small-time reviewer with a small-time podcast. My work hasn't caused more than a blip on the radar of a very few people. But I am legitimately nervous as I type this, because there is the very real possibility that when I post this, the defenders of Scientology will come at me as they have other people.

But, it did feel like a lost opportunity. Despite the one-sidedness of it all! This is probably one of the most shocking and eye-opening documentaries to be released this decade, if not ever. To have gotten to the level that Scientology has risen to and for them to be allowed to conduct their business in this manner. With very little intervention from our government! It was unsettling to realize just how much influence and power they have. While the film is not perfect! It stands as a very damning piece of evidence against Scientology and from a journalistic standpoint. It is an incredible expose on this controversial group and hopefully will shed light on their business practices.

    "review": "  Going Clear | A+ | Everyone associated with this compelling two-hour HBO documentary should be extremely proud. Director Alex Gibney deserves another Academy Award for this historic contribution to society. Not only has he exposed, in breathtaking detail, the brutal, vindictive nature of the greed-driven Scientology cult, he has also exposed the devastating control religions (and faux religions) have over powerbrokers like cowardly former IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg, Jr. Scientology's monstrous dictator David Miscavige is pure evil. But it is Goldberg who will go down in history as the criminally weak man who let the Scientology cult slip through his fingertips. Despite his deal with the devil Goldberg somehow still has the audacity to practice law at mega law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Everyone at Skadden should be ashamed. But I digress... Going Clear showcases former top leaders who reveal intimate details about their roles in developing and executing relentless warfare against anyone who dares to challenge, or leave, the cartoonish Scientology cult. One of its victims is acclaimed screenwriter Paul Haggis who heroically left the cult when he discovered the truth. It also shines the spotlight on the unforgivable support of global superstars like John Travolta and Tom Cruise. It's easy to understand why Travolta remained loyal and silent for so long. The dark secrets Scientology is holding over his head could've destroyed his once hot career. But it's impossible to understand why Cruise continues to support the cult following revelations by former leaders at the very top: mental and physical abuse, unbridled greed, brainwashing, borderline slave labor, stalking and harassment. If Cruise does not take immediate steps to repair the damage caused by his leadership and misguided support of Scientology, his legacy will be destroyed.There are also moments of profound humor in Going Clear. The infantile mythology of Scientology, convoluted levels of enlightenment, silly costumes, comic book hit squads, tacky architecture, hideous stage design elements and asinine presentation materials lead to several laugh-out-loud moments.But overall, Going Clear is deadly serious. The Scientology cult continues to control and destroy lives. And it continues to use its clearly illegal tax-exempt status to fortify its multi-billion-dollar global empire. Everyone should see this film. If you can't find it in theaters, it premieres on HBO on March 29th at 8:00pm",

For Gibney, supposedly a sophisticated, intelligent filmmaker, to foist such a one-sided piece of propaganda off on us is unforgivable.

But what annoyed me most was Gibney's completely assaulting my intelligence by only presenting one side of the story. Doesn't he think I can compute and decide for myself? Do you mean to tell me there wasn't a single Scientologist of Scientology official who disagreed with what he was saying (obviously there was as he keeps sort of bragging about not listening to them. I don't get why he's so proud of that.) Then what's new about what he's saying? These sources have been making the same claims over and over again for, what is it, five years? Again, does Gibney think I don't have the intelligence to read the New Yorker, the New York Times or the St. Petersburg Times/Tampa Tribune? So where's the expose? No, Gibney talks down to his audience while promoting one of the most outrageous pieces of propaganda I've ever seen, while the fawning media thrust laurels at him. Bogus.",

I knew that there would be things that would make me uncomfortable and some that might make me laugh so I was ready for it all.My mother and I arrived at LACMA just before 4pm. The showing started at 7:30. We wanted to beat the traffic, get parking and get some food and a good spot in line. So when we did line up, just after 5pm we were the 5th and 6th people in line. We were sitting next to a lovely young couple, Liz and Ryan and another gentleman named Rob. Ryan asked us if we had read the Lawrence Wright's book \"Going Clear\" I said, \"My mother has but I lived it. I didn't need to read about it.\" Which then sparked a 2 1/2 hour Q and A session with me and my mother about our years in Scientology. They were very keen to hear all our stories and ask tons of questions. It was really nice. There were a couple of people in front of them that kept turning around scowling at us and getting on their phones (Seriously OLD ass flip phones) and possibly taking some pictures of us. I didn't really care because nothing I said was untrue. So record and report away.When the lights dimmed at LACMA's Bing Theater and the film was about to start I started clapping furiously. I was the only one for about 5 seconds, in that eternity I realized, I FUCKING HATE CLAPPING. It is one thing that you are forced to do CONSTANTLY in Scientology. Somebody shares a realization in the classroom, clap. Somebody achieves a new status, clap. Go to an event, EVERY TIME A STATISTIC IS REVEALED CLAP. If COB says something AMAZING, STAND and CLAP. Someone thanks L Ron Hubbard, STAND and clap and give three cheers. So much fucking clapping. It was in that moment that I was genuinely happy about something clapping that I realized that it was one of the many things that had been stolen from me. An ability to genuinely show happiness and exuberance without dread and regret.Then the film came. It was a PACKED house. Filled with a few celebrities, Joel Egerton, Camryn Manheim and a few others. Also Tom Devoct, and Spanky Taylor who are in the film were there. Before the film started I saw Larry Anderson. He was the star of a few of Scientology's Technical Training films and he left a few years ago, tape recording his ordeal for posterity. I spoke with him before the film started and thanked him for doing what he did and told him that he had helped so many people. Mostly the people who were there were older LA types who were members of Film Independent who were never in Scientology but were fascinated or who just wanted to see the hottest ticket to come out of Sundance. Before the lights had dimmed there was electricity in the air. People were talking and looking around and getting very excited about the whole thing.If you have read the book it is a very good visual representation of it. It is an excellent movie over all. Very well put together. An excellent combination of the live interviews that Alex does with the people featured in the film combined with Church event and promotional footage and news reel info. It paints a very accurate and scary picture of a secretive cult that lures you in and takes from you your self determinism with promises of powers and improvement.It also goes deeper than any other film that I have seen, about L Ron Hubbard, you get to see the what happened to him leading up to him creating Scientology. The hardest part of viewing this film for me was when they spoke of the Sea Organization and signing a Billion Year Contract. They showed the contract on the screen. I immediately became filled with anxiety and dread. I was embarrassed as a majority of the film goers laughed, loudly, at the idea of signing away a BILLION years of your life. It made me angry. When I made that pledge I really was willing to sacrifice a billion years of my existence for the betterment of all mankind, even those assholes that were laughing. I felt like they would never make a commitment like that. To selflessly help everyone, even people they hadn't met or ones who thought they were crazy. Then I reminded myself I was no longer bound to that. I wasn't in that trap. And I got calmer. It is irrational and I know that but seeing that contract just took over an old area of my mind, one that I thought was long gone after just over a decade out of the church.But the truth is I am constantly reminded of the church. In my frequent nightmares. In all of them I am there. Trapped in my old job trying to do everything differently but still ending up with the same terrible results. Often I wake suddenly in a panic, covered in sweat. It takes a moment but I realize I am at home, in bed with my husband and I am alright.This film doesn't cover every aspect of what it is like to be in. It couldn't possibly in 2 hours. This film is about belief and how that can become a prison even for the most intelligent of people. It is an excellent film showing how, over time, you gradually fall into the chasm of cult like mindless behavior. It isn't instant.Most of the attendees were never in. They were electrified. In disbelief. \"How could Paul Haggis stay so long?\" \"Didn't he know?\" I think everyone likes to think they are above any swindling. They would know better. They would NEVER fall for anything like that. They would have seen through it from the get go. They are smarter than that. It was like they were all slowing down for a gruesome crash on the highway, almost parking so they could really take in the carnage and sneer at it, \"Look at those idiots! I NEVER drive like that. Only total morons would ever die so horrifically in a ridiculous crash! Hrumph!\"So I say to you, dear people, who didn't live through the absolute insanity that is Scientology, to those of you who haven't had to claw your way out of a seemingly endless abyss, kicking and screaming, fighting for your sanity and sometimes losing all your friends and family in the process, kindly, don't judge. You weren't there. You don't know what it is like. You didn't live it. You haven't lost decades of your life to a cult. You didn't maim yourself doing 16 hours a day of slave labor. Be kind. Be helpful. Be there for people who were. They need your help and your patience. They are like newborns, coming into the real world for the first time and they need your love.I won't spoil the hardest hitting portion of the documentary, but this film flat out calls out John Travolta and Tom Cruise. I hope they step up to the mic and take responsibility for their hand in these crimes.Who should see this movie? Everyone. Everyone who can. The real story about Scientology has been lingering in the shadows for too long and this film shines the light of truth on it like a thousand spotlights. It can't be unseen. It can't be denied or shooed away as just former disgruntled members being sour grapes. It is hard to see and hard to believe but I can tell you it is all true. And it's not even the whole story.I spoke with both Lawrence Wright and Alex Gibney after the film to thank them both for doing this. I asked Alex if he would consider making another film about people like me, born into Scientology, one of the few who did sign that billion year contract and worked for the church and spent time on the RPF and escaped. He said that he was hearing so many stories that there was definitely another movie there. So wait for it folks, the whole story may come out. Hopefully I can get a few minutes of screen time to tell mine.",

    "review": "  I saw this film at the Sundance Film Festival. As a former Scientologists and Sea Org member, I have seen and participated in many projects that have tried to explain and translate what goes on inside scientology. This film does this clearly and in such a way that anyone can walk away knowing where scientology came from and where it it is likely headed. I worked at the Intentional Headquarters of Scientology for 15 years. I can tell you that this film not only captures the essence and horror of that place, but does so in a way that leaves the viewer asking how such a thing could be occurring in a modern day United States. Unless you have a lifetime subscription to Kool-Aid, chances are you will find this film fascinating and informative.",
