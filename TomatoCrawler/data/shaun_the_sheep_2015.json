Particularly fun in all of this is that most everything is done in pantomime, which is both very hard and very clever. Me likey.",

    "review": "  Not having seen the television series that these loveable characters are based on, I went into \"Shaun the Sheep Movie\" cold. I can say without a doubt that it is one of the best films you will see all year. From no dialogue throughout the entire film, to it's story of sheep just wanting a break from their boring daily routine, this film has it all. Helming and embracing it's visual gags, cliched gags, and clever gags all the way through, the laughs are constant and never let up. It was almost overwhelming how charming this little film became by the end, and it is not just the mindless sheep-filled adventure that the trailers make it out to be. There is an emotional undertone to the story that really makes it stand out above most animated films nowadays. What always impresses me the most from Aardman (the company behind these claymation films) is their ability to bring a realism to their animation. It is so maticulously handled that it seems flawless, and that is always the most commendable thing. There are times where you just completely forget you are watching a claymation picture. \"Shaun the Sheep\" get's every point across with it's silent style of filmmaking and I absolutely loved that. This is the definition of \"show-don't-tell.\" If I had one quip it would be the fact that they have a few too many fart jokes that become a little too juvenile, but the film is for kids as well, so I forgave that. \"Shaun the Sheep Movie\" really is a work of art for it's genre.",

    "review": "  Coming from Aardman studios (who gave us Wallace and Gromit and the truly excellent Chicken Run) we have Shaun the Sheep based on the series of the same name. The plot is simple: a clever sheep and his friends have to find their amnesiac owner who is lost in the big city and return him to their country farm, while avoiding animal control. But the execution is beyond clever - it's fucking genius. The movie is completely rendered using clay animation and not one word of dialogue is used. If it wasn't a children's movie, I would be tempted to call it a wordless work of existential art. But beyond the concept, Shaun the Sheep is an adorable experience for children and their parents and for the odd filmgeek like me who can enjoy the sincere, touching moments in addition to all the slapstick.",

    "review": "  When Aardman Animations puts out a new movie, there's no resisting. Their Wallace and Gromit franchise is stop-motion animation at its finest, a studio that can rival Ghibli and Pixar for visual dazzle and wizardry.Adults will delight at every ironic and twisted gag that will go right over the heads of the kids. No way they'll get the shout-outs to The Night of The Hunter, the Silence of The Lambs and Scorsese's version of Cape Fear. Shaun The Sheep Movie began life as a short-form British series where both animals and humans speak in indecipherable gibberish, so the emphasis is squarely on the visuals, much like Sylvain Chomet's Triplets of Belleville. Writer-directors Mark Burton and Richard Starzak deliver in high style. Just look at the pig that throws a party worthy of the Kardashians.The action starts out on Mossy Bottom Farm, where Shaun (voiced terrifically by Justin Flatcher) and his flock make loads of mischief for the Farmer (John Sparkes) and his sheepdog Bitzer (Sparks again). Soon the flock takes off to the Big City and end up dressing as humans to eat in a fancy eatery. As for the Farmer? He gets amnesia after suffering a concussion and then uses shears to cut human hair and ends up as a celebrity stylist. And Shaun, first introduced in the 1995 Oscar-winning short A Close Shave, he is always a delight. Sure, the movie drags a bit and the soundtrack, featuring Eliza Doolittle and Rizzle Hicks, might be a bit too hip for such an old-style feature, but Shaun remains a real party animal.",

    "review": "  Short, simple, and ridiculously cute. Shaun the Sheep tells its story with zero dialogue. The humans talk, kind of, but it all sounds like gibberish, putting you into the animal's world. I really liked this silent method of storytelling, and it was surprisingly able to be held over the runtime of the film. It relies solely on sight gags and cuteness, but they all work. It's a profoundly silly movie but I had a lot of fun with it. Some of the gags seem a little been-there, but they're done with enough of a clever twist that I didn't mind. If I really had a criticism of the movie it would be that I still don't like the way Aardman studios animates people where they always look so creepy, and the villain of the movie is horrendously clich�d and boring. Sill I recognize that this is a kids movie, and for a lot of kids this will be the first time they see a villain like this, and he gets enough laughs that I'm willing to give it a pass. It's a simple, fun movie that left me with a smile on my face. It will easily entertain anyone from age 8months to 80 years, and I can't think of any other movie that can claim that feat.",

Not to mention if you've ever taken a liking to Chicken Run (2000) or Wallace and Gromit there's something here that you'll like. The movie follows Shaun the sheep who after day after day of the same thing he believes its time for him and the other sheep to have a day off. On accident they get rid of the Farmer that takes care of him and his trailer is whisked away to the big city. It's up to Shaun and the Sheep to travel to the city and find out where Farmer is and bring him home. The stop animation is fantastic as it always is in Aardman films. I enjoyed the warmth of the film and the overall meaning it brings by the end of the film. I'd say the pacing is well done, but at times it slogs just slightly too much for me (especially early on). Overall, though I highly recommend giving this one a look!",

This is an exceptionally brilliant exploration of visual storytelling. There are only grunts, no dialogue whatsoever. It's totally insane how hilarious and evocative physical action is when done right, and the characters tell so much story in a normal amount of time. It's so crazy and entertaining.The humor is definitely aimed at a younger audience, which is what I knocked a little bit but there's certainly chuckles throughout, with some big laughs mixed in.The story is definitely nothing special, but it's really entertaining all the same.

    "review": "  Shaun the Sheep is the big-screen adaptation of the popular character from the BBC and is a true triumph in stop-motion film-making as they not only had to overcome the grueling animation work; the film also contains no spoken dialogue and it succeeds in spades! Brought to us by the always-reliable, Aardman, who've made such gems as Chicken Run, Arthur Christmas, and of course, Wallace & Gromit where Shaun the Sheep made his debut: the attention to detail is extraordinary and it is literally impossible to catch every joke in one viewing. The film is straight-up, HILARIOUS and I found myself giggling with delight the entire way through and it's all due to the brilliant, slapstick timing, sight-gags, and adorable characters, in particular, Timmy the baby sheep. The story is brutally simple, the sheep want a day off from their routine and accidentally end up on an adventure into town to bring back their owner they accidentally incapacitated; just enough plot to get the ball rolling. The highlight comes from a side-splitting scene involving the sheep disguised as humans in a restaurant that had me crying with laughter! It is so rare to see a film this brave with no big-name voice actors, no lame pop-culture references, and most importantly; no discernible dialogue which makes this a glorified, silent film! It's brisk, laugh-out-loud funny, and expertly crafted by the wonderful hands of Aardman studios; proving they're the kings of stop-motion animation.",

That's right, I said silent. No words are spoken by any character during the whole movie, just a bunch of grunts. The slapstick is nothing original, and the plot is relatively simple, but this film is still very funny and keeps you rooting for the hero.",

    "review": "  I grew up having a few of the Wallace and Gromit films on VHS and so I was excited to see what Aardman Animations next had in store. Shaun the Sheep comes from the same company and producers and is one of the most innocently fun rides you'll have watching a film in 2015. The animation is spectacular and it's humor for kids and adults is hilariously impressive.There's no dialogue besides giggles and some mumbled yelling between characters, but you never need it. You know exactly what the characters are feeling purely based on the music and facial expressions. Coming from British writers and producers, the humor is definitely a little bit different than something we would see in an American kids movie, but it works nonetheless. The good thing about this movie over something like Minions, also a summer release, is that there's tons of silly humor but there's also some heart within this story as well. You're always rooting for Shaun and his crew of sheep to find their owner and get back to the farm. The burp/fart jokes are there, but not has overbearing as some other kids films.Knowing that this comes from a stop motion animation company, makes the physical humor all the more impressive. All of the action is seamless. The movie made me laugh more out loud by myself than Minions did watching it with an entire audience. Shaun the Sheep is a film all audiences will enjoy from kids to adults alike. I sure hope they make more of these.+Brilliant humor+Beautiful animation+Funny story with heart8.4/10",

I enjoyed Shaun the Sheep when it was 5 minute vignettes on the Disney Channel when I was a dedicated viewer of that channel but I think that's the time frame that this works. I adore claymation stop motion movies and the work put into them and I think it is well done here but I just didn't think all the jokes work. A lot of the jokes are ok with a few great ones but I don't know, I just didn't find myself enjoying this as much as many obviously did. It is practically silent relying on physical humor which is ambitious for an animated movie but like I said, it wasn't enough to really get me laughing. The art direction is great and the sound effects are good and the voice talents do a good job with the little noises they have to do. With an 80 minute running time, it felt more like 2 hours. Kids might enjoy it more but I don't know if it'll captivate them",

Still, while the story is familiar, there's a layer of creativity at work here that is so refreshingly genuine. This felt like a film where everyone involved had a great time creating this world of \"The Big City\" and Mossy Bottom where the farm they live exists. If you're a fan of the show, this is familiar territory. What's amazing to me is how after well over 100 episodes, they were able to insert a premise that breathes new life into the series. As to it being too kiddish, my wife and I were howling through the entire thing. I don't think it's possible to keep up with all the jokes being thrown at you. My kids were amused, but there's so much \"adult\" humor that we all walked away happy. Highly recommended!",

    "review": "  Losing that you love makes you realise its value.The only reason to I go to Nick is to watch 'Shaun the Sheep'. This show was watched by many adults as well, a popular one among all the ages. As the fan of this series, we have been waiting very long to get a movie version. I was excited to see it and of course enjoyed it completely. Its impossible one to get disappointed with the movie/show when the narration is led by one of the awesome characters, Shaun. The promotional posters were also created some extra curiosity that imitated the famous Hollywood films like 'Boyhood', 'Wild', 'Birdman' and many others.Stop-motion is a very-very hard and outdated concept of the animation format, but still loved by many. Every year only one or two get released, sometimes none. The technical sides were upgraded, including bluescreens for backgrounds and other special effects. Still the hard work remains, but qualities are improved. It made significant contributions to the live-shot movies in the old days when there was no CGI. So when we see a movie like this, the product reveals in each and every frames the real vision from the artist and writer's perspective. Every detail, every corner of the screen tells the story.It was so good as a television show, because of short and sweetness. The filmmaker intended to create the same magic, except the credits its just a below 80 minute movie. Had a good storyline and a couple of new characters were introduced. Because the new adventure extended its area volume and so the antagonist was needed. Shaun and his buddies set foot outside their barn to find their lost farmer. The journey begins towards the big city and the movie discloses their risky and dangerous undertaking. They go pass lots of stages to accomplish their quest and only the last quarter reveals result with a thrilling chase scene.Unlike the series, it was not completely a fun movie. There are some emotions involved, and I was amazed by those exhibitions. Because of some kind of childhood connection between Shaun and Co and their owner. That was unexpected, but was really very nice to see the other side of them. We know Shaun is a curious character, he always wants to learn and try new things. So when he has to make an unexpected decision, it does not go as planned and the fun begins with their mischievous adventure in an unfamiliar territory.As usual without the dialogues, that can be understandable by everyone without a language barrier. A true family movie, from grandparents to grandchildren together watchable flick. Almost a masterpiece, offers a lot of great moments to give ourselves to it. And for the fans its a celebration time for sure. Definitely this movie would get into the final shortlist for the upcoming (2016) Oscars, if not, that would be a shame for the entire ceremony. But for winning, we have to wait till how good 'The Good Dinosaur' going to be. In the meantime, don't miss this little cute flick.8 1/2/10",

    "review": "  I really dig this style of film making. It looks both fun and delicate, impressive and charming.The TV-show is super and fittingly put into short episodes. It was a possibility that the full lenght aspect wouldn't be a fit, but it really did.The story is all right, where Shaun and the rest of his friends head out to the big city to save the day. Very funny film. Visually very clever and imaginative. It gave me many laughs and not just of the stupid kind, I felt it took a chance with some smart puns but they work out for both kids and adults.It's quite a disaster that Norway puts up the film in cinemas ONE year after it's premiere and over 4 months after the next to last country permiere. Gosh.I highly reccomend this film no matter which age group you are put in.8 out of 10 wool factories.",

This one is certainly a little different as there isn't one spoken word in the whole movie. Now I don't have little kids so I don't know if it's a problem for them or if they would be bored with this, but this movie is still funny/clever/touching all without dialogue. I would say this isn't as strong as the movies I mentioned earlier, but I still enjoyed it. While the story is simple, there's enough going on that makes it clever and doesn't drag at all. It's not quite as funny as the previous Aardman movies, but still a very solid offering and I walked out with a smile on my face.",

    "review": "  Shaun the Sheep is a movie apparently trying to grab the audience's attention with their many attempts at slapstick comedy and disgusting humor. Something that Inside Out wasn't able to portray, except for its more clever attempts at slapstick humor.The movie was about how a bunch of sheep are getting chased by people which lures them to the city. They must disguise themselves and sneak away from the animal control to find their way back home safely. Now, I ain't going to spoil the ending, there is more action to brace along but I think this movie is more emotional than Inside Out in the case of making me cry. It was cute, sometimes too cute.The movie is very funny but the attempts at humor left a bitter taste in my mouth, as though it was intended for 9-year-olds. Older kids especially older teens would not get as much of a kick out of it.",

It reminds me of Chicken Run and The Curse of Were-Rabbit.The story is very simple but effective. Kids will love this movie. The execution is great. Editing is great. They set the premise really well. It is so amazing that the entire movie has no dialogue. There are a few words but you might not even notice them. The soundtrack in this movie is amazing. This movie has one of the catchiest soundtrack of 2015. It stuck in my head. Some people might end up boring because there is no dialogue. But this movie entertained me the whole time. Even though I have never seen a TV series, I enjoyed this movie a lot.In the end, I would say Shaun the Sheep is a super-fun family movie. It is funny, warm and clever. I love this movie.",

Though I've never seen the Shaun the Sheep TV show,, I decided to watch the movie anyways, since I believed it to be good. Having watched the movie, I can't say I was as into it as I was with some of Aardman's other work. But don't get me wrong: Shaun the Sheep isn't a bad movie at all, and was pretty fun to watch, but I just didn't see it as much compared to other works I've seen by the same people, which might be because it didn't feel like much happened in this movie when compared to the others. I like how they were able to go the entire movie with virtually no dialogue(not counting background songs), and the movie could be very funny at times. Overall, Shaun the Sheep is a nice movie, but I don't consider it one of the best, though that's just me.",

Still, this didn't feel quite as charming or funny as some of their other work. Sure, they had the obligatory \"Silence of the Lambs\" reference, but a lot of the film really didn't rely as much on the sight gags and visual humor that Aardman is known for. Yeah, maybe this was to appeal to a younger audience, but in the end it made the movie feel like it was missing something.",

    "review": "  When Aardman Animations puts out a new movie, there's no resisting. Their Wallace and Gromit franchise is stop-motion animation at its finest, a studio that can rival Ghibli and Pixar for visual dazzle and wizardry.Adults will delight at every ironic and twisted gag that will go right over the heads of the kids. No way they'll get the shout-outs to The Night of The Hunter, the Silence of The Lambs and Scorsese's version of Cape Fear. Shaun The Sheep Movie began life as a short-form British series where both animals and humans speak in indecipherable gibberish, so the emphasis is squarely on the visuals, much like Sylvain Chomet's Triplets of Belleville. Writer-directors Mark Burton and Richard Starzak deliver in high style. Just look at the pig that throws a party worthy of the Kardashians.The action starts out on Mossy Bottom Farm, where Shaun (voiced terrifically by Justin Flatcher) and his flock make loads of mischief for the Farmer (John Sparkes) and his sheepdog Bitzer (Sparks again). Soon the flock takes off to the Big City and end up dressing as humans to eat in a fancy eatery. As for the Farmer? He gets amnesia after suffering a concussion and then uses shears to cut human hair and ends up as a celebrity stylist. And Shaun, first introduced in the 1995 Oscar-winning short A Close Shave, he is always a delight. Sure, the movie drags a bit and the soundtrack, featuring Eliza Doolittle and Rizzle Hicks, might be a bit too hip for such an old-style feature, but Shaun remains a real party animal.",

    "review": "  Shaun the Sheep is a hilarious, touching, beautifully animated film that captures the spirit that made silent films so special. While this movie is more directed at children, adults will get plenty of enjoyment from this as well. The slapstick humor offers plenty of hilarious moments, and on numerous occasions everybody in the theater will find themselves laughing hysterically. Besides that the film is beautifully animated, which is even more impressive when one considers the time it takes to make a stop animation film. I will say the biggest surprise was the emotional depth of the film, filled with characters that couldn't talk, it conveyed a story that everybody could follow that was never weak, and had moments that made me feel like a child again, from the opening to the heartbreaking scene in the barbershop. In essence Shaun the Sheep is everything you want it to be for kids and adults, it's hilarious, nice to look at, but it also has a great emotional depth, much like the best works of Pixar.",

Beautiful sets, great stop motion animation and witty writing make this a joy from beginning to end. There is no dialogue in the film, so the story is told completely with expressions and action. While critically acclaimed, the film has been a hard sell to Americans without the normal dialogue between characters.

    "review": "  Coming from Aardman studios (who gave us Wallace and Gromit and the truly excellent Chicken Run) we have Shaun the Sheep based on the series of the same name. The plot is simple: a clever sheep and his friends have to find their amnesiac owner who is lost in the big city and return him to their country farm, while avoiding animal control. But the execution is beyond clever - it's fucking genius. The movie is completely rendered using clay animation and not one word of dialogue is used. If it wasn't a children's movie, I would be tempted to call it a wordless work of existential art. But beyond the concept, Shaun the Sheep is an adorable experience for children and their parents and for the odd filmgeek like me who can enjoy the sincere, touching moments in addition to all the slapstick.",

Bored of his daily routine, Shaun and his sheep buddies decide to take the day off, leading to disaster. They must go into the big city, and are constantly hounded by an Animal Control Officer who would be the ideal husband for Chantel DuBois. The result is a sometimes emotional little adventure film with plenty of sight gags and easy going plot lines. Its not up there with the Wallace and Gromit stuff, but its still very enjoyable",

    "review": "  When Shaun's plan to get all the animals a day off goes spectacularly wrong, the farmer ends up in the big city alone and with no idea who he is, and it's up to Shaun and the gang to find him and make him remember, while dodging an especially overzealous animal control officer. This is as much of a plot as you get, and as much as you need in this whimsically charming children's comedy from Aardman. Closely based on the television series of the same name, Shaun the Sheep is built around simple storytelling and simple pleasures, as befitting its target audience. However simple in this case should not be confused with dumb. The story may not be any more complex than that of a Saturday morning cartoon, but every minute has been packed with humorous details and charming visuals, like a Mr. Hulot's Holiday for the kiddie set. Slapstick and sight gags are constant and frequently hilarious. They range from simple trip and fall gags and funny animal faces to elaborate sequences that build and build with one thing after another going wrong until everything is delightful chaos. Oddly for a children's movie, the best of these gags involves a man with his head stuck up a horse's rear, though thankfully not a real horse's. There is the occasional burping or flatulence based joke, but far less than in most other contemporary kids' movies.  What's striking in its absence is spoken dialog, or at least any that's intelligible. The people talk, but it all comes out mumbled like the adults in those old Peanuts cartoons. Not that this is a problem. In the absence of spoken words, the characters frequently mime out their thoughts and intentions in a manner that would make Marcel Marceau proud. And it's just as well that they don't talk, because no words could be as good as the befuddled facial expressions of the city dwellers watching the sheep go by disguised as people, nor could they have improved the spectacle of the villain being seduced by two sheep dressed as a young lady. If Shaun the Sheep is in some ways old fashioned with its simple narrative and stop motion animation it can also be remarkably modern, as when the amnesiac farmer becomes a social media sensation, being reimagined by the internet into the image of Wolverine, Nyan Cat, and an Obama campaign ad. And while kids will delight in watching a cow being launched over the Moon Inn, their parents can take pleasure in references to Live and Let Die, Donald Trump's toupe, and I swear I'm not making this up; Breaking Bad. Like a Roadrunner cartoon crossed with Babe, Shaun the Sheep is hilarious, charming, and refreshing straightforward in its approach to storytelling. It will delight small children and adults alike. In short it's everything one would expect from Aardman.",

Plot's fairly predictable and all, however, it's the execution of the film that deserves all the praise in the world. From the way the animation is done to the comedic moments (which are truly well done and extremely clever), \"Shaun the Sheep\" impresses despite having no actual dialogue. The creators are able to express so much from body language, facial expressions, and movement-placing a greater emphasis on visuals and sound/music--that for a moment you forget that you're watching a stop-motion film. There's no question about it, a lot of passion, patience, and wit went into this project. The animation is really slick, the sheep are very cute and likeable, and those aren't even the reasons that I'd recommend this movie. Again, the film has the advantage of having great comedic moments and timing, but the way \"Shaun the Sheep\" gets by the lack of actual words is probably its most impressive feat. Mainly because the writers had to find ways to get around that barrier, and a lot of them were brilliantly done. And in the end, 'brilliant' is how I'd describe this movie; proof that you don't have to dumb down your film to appeal to younger audiences [although I must stress that anybody can enjoy these types of films.]",

It has something for everyone who goes to see the film, so really I do not see how anyone could not find enjoyment here. As for me it was not an amazing experience, but I had some fun.From the beginning you know that you are in for a different style of movie. The animation is creatively distinct and the absence of any dialogue took some time for me to embrace. This makes for an undeniably unique approach and the film does a wonderful job of embracing its own style. The humor comes naturally and often, and while it is mostly for the children there are enough jokes for the adults to enjoy as well. I respect the film because of how well it does what it sets out to do.However I just do not enjoy that style as much to be fully enveloped in the experience. I get that I am not the target audience here so this really is not a slight of the movie, but I cannot say that I enjoyed the film as many others. The humor does not hit as often and overall it was simplistic and boring for me. This is a splendid movie to take a family to, everyone will enjoy some parts of it. This is markedly a better family movie than Minions, but still there is movie this summer that hits on all cylinders for everyone in the family. Hint it's Inside Out.",

At a mere 90 mins the move still felt very long. My wife and two kids (6 and 3) were all bored. My kids love movies and rarely lose interest in an animated flick. They also LOVE the 7 minute short of Shaun The Sheep. But with the movie they were both ready to go after about 40 minutes...as was I. This movie is very niche. I can see why a few people might give it rave reviews, but this is not one for the masses. Did I love the animation style? Sure, it was unique and different. But there are virtually no spoken dialog for the entire move. Again, some might like that style...but for 90 minutes, my family was out.If you want to see something different than the same ol' Disney princes template, something with an artistic animation style, and something on the fringe give this a try.

Main Characters Shaun: He's a sheep voiced by Justin Fletcher The Farmer: He's a farmer voiced by John SparkesPlot Summary Life is going a bit too tiresome for Shaun and his flock. Every day they do almost the same things - only to dread doing the very same things the next day. So they take action in order to break the monotony. They trick the farmer to fall asleep inside a trailer so they can go do whatever their hearts desire is. But the plan goes wrong when the trailer accidentally rolls off into the big city and crashes. The crash causes the farmer to lose his memory. Shaun and the sheep, as well as a sheepdog, head into the big city to find the farmer and get him back safely before he realizes something's wrong. However, an animal control officer complicates matters - a lot.SCORINGMain Characters Shaun is great as a sheep who just wants to have fun - then realizes just how much trouble the fun's going to cause. And I like the Farmer as the clueless guy who doesn't know what his sheep are capable of doing. SCORE: 9Supporting Cast The rest of the flock is good - as a group. And the main bad guy, the animal control officer, is okay for the movie. SCORE: 7Plot The film starts off great with Shaun and his flock doing whatever it takes in order to get a day of rest. But for me, the middle of the film felt like a drag as Shaun and the others try to find the farmer. But the ending is mildly entertaining. SCORE: 7Originality Sure, there may be a lot of films about animals acting like humans when human are not around (Barnyard comes to mind). But there's something about the style of animation that gives it a lot of charm. SCORE: 7Violence Factor A wall gets torn down, and several creatures get shocked as well as creatures get tossed down a deep pit. But there's nothing too terrible about any of this (Maybe the youngest viewers will get scared.) SCORE: 8Other Moral Issues This film is about how a family is formed when nobody is remotely related to each other. But it has to be said that sheep and dogs don't act like this in real life. Just saying. SCORE: 8Final Score (out of 60): 46 % Score: 76.67% It has it's charms, but the story dragged on a bit too long for me to really enjoy the film.",

    "review": "  \"Shaun the Sheep,\" created by the producers of \"Chicken Run\", is an animated film about a sheep named Shaun who lives with his flock and a guard dog on the outskirts of a big city. Shaun is tired of his everyday routine and locks the farmer inside a trailer so he and the flock can have the run of the place. However, things don't go according to plan, and Shaun and his friends have to go to the big city to recover the farmer. Many misadventures occur along the way, such as a rivalry with the animal containment officer and other misadventures. Not everyone will love this kind of animation. There is very little spoken dialogue and the characters are left to convey their emotions through gestures and facial expressions. I personally found this film refreshing. Though admittedly goofy, the film is also very heartfelt and genuine and tells a true story of a farmer's special relationship with animals he raised from infancy. Even though this relationship goes afoul during the movie, the farmer and his animals never forget the connection they have. This is a wholesome animated film ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ B+",

While I certainly feel the movie is well animated (I am a huge fan of stop-motion and claymation and SHAUN delivers!), the movie does not really do anything innovative with its animation. Or with the story. Or really any part of the project. SHAUN THE SHEEP is exceptional at being unexceptional (AKA: the \"Argo\" problem). The picture is incredibly well done and also incredibly boring. Poor pacing, appeals to humor (sometimes even specific jokes) that have been used and re-used without providing much application, and a painful hyper-appeal to the very, very young target audience. The team for SHAUN THE SHEEP no doubt accomplished making a movie that will feel welcome and fresh to new, young audiences, but feels like a bore from the otherwise reasonable creative production team that produced the film.",

    "review": "  Let's go see a foreign film with no spoken dialog and which employs an old-fashioned style of cinematography and is aimed at four-to-seven year-olds. All that applies to the British claymation feature \"Shaun the Sheep Movie\" (PG, 1:25). Doesn't sound appealing? It didn't to me either, but what if I told you that these elements can be combined to create one of the most delightful experiences that moviegoers of any age are likely to have in a movie theater? And that's no bleat.\"Shaun the Sheep Movie\" is the first feature film based on the popular award-winning British television series produced by Aardman Studios, which is also responsible for the \"Wallace and Gromit\" shorts. The character of Shaun first appeared in the Oscar-winning 1995 Wallace and Gromit short film \"A Close Shave\". Shaun is one of the smaller sheep living on Mossy Bottom Farm, but his smarts and guts make him the de facto leader of his flock. The otherwise nameless Farmer is a sweetly slow-witted balding man who wears thick glasses. He takes his duties very seriously, but he's a benevolent leader, regarding his farm animals as family. The Farmer also has some cattle and pigs on his farm, but we see him mainly dealing with his sheep, feeding them, shearing them, etc. He is helped by his trusty canine assistant Blitzer, who runs a tight pen, but is often caught up in the mischief of Shaun and his fuzzy compatriots. In this film, Shaun decides to give himself and his fellow sheep a break from their monotonous daily routine, but his plan quickly goes awry. The sheep use their well-known ability to put people to sleep by repeatedly circling around and jumping over the Farmer's fence while he's trying to... count them. He quickly passes out in a wheel barrow. The sheep put him to bed in a small nearby camper and then - it's party time - ruminant-style! When the small trailer becomes dislodged from its parking space and rolls down the hill in the direction of \"The Big City\" (as the road sign calls it), Shaun stows away on a bus to retrieve his sleeping master.Next (and this is pretty flocked up), the rest of the sheep follow on another bus. Now all these sheep have to disguise themselves as humans to avoid detection and find the Farmer. Little do they know, but when the Farmer's camper finally comes to rest in The Big City by crashing into a light pole and he is conked on the head, he loses his memory. The Farmer gets a very appropriate job through a very amusing set of circumstances, but is still suffering from memory loss. Shaun and company have to find him, help him get past his amnesia and get him back to Mossy Bottom before the city's heartless \"Animal Containment\" officer gets wise to the sheep and puts them in his version of the Big House.\"Shaun the Sheep Movie\" is a very simple pleasure. There's nothing complicated about the plot and it's completely without cynicism or guile. The sheep are mischievous, the other farm animals are naughty, the dog tires to be tough and the Farmer is definitely large and in charge, but the only villain in sight is the Animal Containment Officer. This movie is so easy to follow that nary a discernable word is (or needs to be) spoken. There's a handful of English-language songs to supplement the movie's score, but every character's thoughts, motivations and intentions are effectively communicated with a combination of grunts, muttering, bleating and flawlessly clay-mated body language. Simple? Yes. But simple doesn't mean simplistic. It's as sweetly entertaining as 2011's nearly-wordless \"The Artist\" was for adults.Some moviegoers over the height of four-feet may be a little sheepish about going to see this movie, but they shouldn't be. This film may be a guilty pleasure for older folks, but it's a pleasure nonetheless. My advice? Grab the nearest four-to-seven year-old so you have an \"excuse\" to see \"Shaun the Sheep Movie\". Just make sure that you're legally entitled to take that particular child with you. Doing it any other way would be ba-aa-aa-ad. But so would missing this movie. \"A\"",

    "review": "  Shaun the Sheep is the big-screen adaptation of the long-running Aardman stop motion animated show. The studio once again manages to create innocent laughter and smiles on all our faces and it is an absolute fun time at the movies. The title character of this hilarious animated feature, whose name is a pun on the word shorn, first appeared in the Wallace and Gromit short film A Close Shave (1995). The mischievous sheep was given his own television show in 2007 and like this film it doesn't have a word of dialogue. Just like Jim Henson's Muppets, these stop-motion figures are effortlessly entertaining and are better performers than most actors working today!In keeping with its bright and positive visual style, the plot is simple and to the point. The movie begins with Shaun (Justin Fletcher) living in the barnyard with his sheep mates. One day, he decides to take the day off and have some fun, but he gets a little more action than he bargained for. A mix up with the Farmer (John Sparkes), a caravan and a very steep hill lead them all to the Big City and it's up to Shaun and the flock to return everyone safely to the green grass of home.The action never stops and the pacing never slows down. This is a rare silent film that owes a lot to Roald Dahl and the best of Chaplin, packed with gags and visual ideas. It stands on it's own as a movie and knowing anything about the characters and the story beforehand is not needed. In the opening sequence, the characters and settings are clearly set with Shaun being the centre of the story. Minimal dialogue and animation gives this a unique look that represents the charming style of Aardman. The limited expressions of the sheep take place through the eyes, while mouths hilariously appear like a sidesaddle at the left or right side of their faces. The lack of dialogue could be one of the reasons why the shows, and hopefully the movie, have such a universal appeal.It is difficult to assume how much time and energy have been placed into creating this feature. Stop-motion relies strictly on filming movable models and sets. The advantage over the smoother, more polished CGI is that there is no room for wastage. That means there has to be no errors and no excess, which is refreshing when modern cinema is often long, bloated and over-produced. Given how lovely the film is, the slow method of animation has certainly paid off. Some might stay away from this because of the comfort of watching the show in their homes but make no mistakes! This is a pure cinematic film that shouldn't be missed and will certainly delight children and adults alike.",

I've always appreciated and admired the attention to detail and the painstaking process that makes it all work. I had high expectations for Shaun the Sheep, and was not at all surprised to see such rave reviews, so I bought a ticket. I was very disappointed with the film and wonder if the folks giving it such high marks have been long time fans with some reference points from which to make comparisons. The past films have always had rich story lines, characters you could really engage with, great dialogue, etc. I found Shaun of the Sheep to be pretty boring and predictable. And way too chaotic and obscure for young children. I have to give it one half a star for effort, but that's it.",

    "review": "  The English animation studio�Aardman Animations�- best known for its \"Wallace and Gromit\"�short films, television series and one feature�-�has long been a favorite of mine, producing delightful absurdist confections that I can watch multiple times without losing interest. Still, while I almost always marvel at their stop-motion ingenuity (and love the very British teeth with which they design all of their animals), I have not loved all of their work equally: their first feature-length movie,�\"Chicken Run,\" was a winner;�\"The Pirates! Band of Misfits\" (in spite of its Oscar nomination) was a dud. In some ways I prefer their earlier, more raw work, in which the animation may not be�up to today's standards, but the ideas shine with sparkling mischief, such as Peter Lord's wonderful setting of Nina Simone's \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\"�or Nick Parks' playful mockumentary�\"Creature Comforts.\"Now we have a new feature, directed by neither Lord nor Park - stalwarts of Aardman's past - which follows the adventures of Shaun the Sheep, who has had his own BBC television series since 2007, and is apparently a character who first appeared in the 1995 Wallace and Gromit short�\"A Close Shave.\" I knew nothing about Shaun going into the film, but I went hoping for something at least as fun as�\"Chicken Run.\" What I got was not quite up to that standard, but still (mostly) entertaining, and a movie that is sure to appeal to young kids, making it the perfect cinematic destination for families now that everyone has seen�\"Minions\" and�\"Inside Out.\"Shaun and his ovine brethren live in relative harmony with their farmer master - the movie opens with a home-movie montage of their earlier happy days on the farm - but long for just one day off from the quotidian routine. Inspired by a bus-side billboard urging them to just get away, they come up with what should be a harmless plan to lure the farmer back to bed�(what puts people to sleep? counting sheep!) so they can run off and frolic ... somewhere else. Things go dreadfully wrong, however, and soon Shaun and company - accompanied by a most unhappy guard dog - are adrift�in the big city, looking for the lost farmer. Will they find him before a villainous animal control representative finds them and locks them up? Watch and find out.There are plenty of very funny moments in the movie - including the sleepy sheep counting - but also passages where the story drags. Unfortunately, when that happens, the filmmakers often choose to create pop-music montages that feel more about marketing that particular song than about furthering the plot. Indeed, the music, overall, is the weakest part of the film (except for one delightful \"baaa-baaa-shop\" scene which is actually quite cute). I loved every aspect of the animal containment center, though: it's designed to look like a prison, complete with an \"Orange Is the New Black\"�\"Crazy Eyes\" character. Overall, the plusses outweigh the minuses, even if the sum total never quite comes close to the masterpieces of yore.�",

    "review": "  To the city. So this is about a farmer and his rascal group of animals. When the sheep decide to have a little fun, it ends up in a huge ordeal, with the farmer in a runaway caravan crashing into the big city, resulting in memory loss. How are these mischievous sheep going to fix this? Claymation is an art form that doesn't see a lot of use nowadays; there's The Boxtrolls and Paranorman, but these movies come few and far between, which has to be due to how much effort it is to actually craft it. Shaun the Sheep is from the team behind Wallace & Gromit, and while this does have its merit as a standalone film, this really made me want to go back and rewatch those classic shorts from yesteryear. If you go to any movie website, you will find the quote section for this film to be completely empty. This is directly because of the most remarkable feature about this: it is 100% intelligible dialogue free, taking a page from the communicative abilities of the Minions in Despicable Me. With the exception of some featured songs, there is not a single line of understandable English words, and everybody communicates through mumbling and noises. Even the humans grunt at each other. This helps the film in a couple of ways: 1. It makes it more believable that these animals of different species can effectively communicate with each other, and 2. It forces the animators to be more creative in relaying important bits of plot development to the audience. I do really like this team a lot, and they came to the table armed with some creative ideas. The gags are cute, and you can clearly tell they were inspired and never planned to just regurgitate their works from the past. It's also very short, and it never at any point risks overstaying its welcome. The only thing I will really say as a point against this is the other side of the double edged sword of the fact that there is no dialogue: other than the visual jokes and the art of the animation itself, it really doesn't give you all that much to chew on. I don't think I'm going to get a ton of mileage out of this, as the Wallace & Gromit shorts/movie have so much more value in the rewatchability department, but for what they did here, it's something that you can watch and have a good time with.",

Shaun The Sheep is old-fashioned animation entertainment at some of its finest. A herd of sheep search for their owner, the farmer, after an accidental stunt leads him into the city. The sheep have some hilarious encounters with blending in with the human environment, and it's fun seeing them work themselves in an out of trouble in one situation after another. Films like these come every few years, which makes them feel that much more special when they do make a release. I had a blast and a mix of warmth and laughs watching this gem of entertainment.

    "review": "  Not having seen the television series that these loveable characters are based on, I went into \"Shaun the Sheep Movie\" cold. I can say without a doubt that it is one of the best films you will see all year. From no dialogue throughout the entire film, to it's story of sheep just wanting a break from their boring daily routine, this film has it all. Helming and embracing it's visual gags, cliched gags, and clever gags all the way through, the laughs are constant and never let up. It was almost overwhelming how charming this little film became by the end, and it is not just the mindless sheep-filled adventure that the trailers make it out to be. There is an emotional undertone to the story that really makes it stand out above most animated films nowadays. What always impresses me the most from Aardman (the company behind these claymation films) is their ability to bring a realism to their animation. It is so maticulously handled that it seems flawless, and that is always the most commendable thing. There are times where you just completely forget you are watching a claymation picture. \"Shaun the Sheep\" get's every point across with it's silent style of filmmaking and I absolutely loved that. This is the definition of \"show-don't-tell.\" If I had one quip it would be the fact that they have a few too many fart jokes that become a little too juvenile, but the film is for kids as well, so I forgave that. \"Shaun the Sheep Movie\" really is a work of art for it's genre.",

    "review": "  Man's second best friend is Sheep?.The story is about Shaun the main character decides to take the day off and have some fun, he gets a little more action than he bargained for. A mix up with the Farmer, a caravan, and a very steep hill lead them all to the Big City and it's up to Shaun and the flock to return everyone safely to the green grass of home.I know these a lot of people that may not seen the TV series of Shaun the Sheep and here's my quick opinion on the TV series. I liked the show, I thought the animation was pretty good I mean stop motion never get's old well to me it doesn't. The show had a good sense of humor to it and the character's without talking makes them even more enjoyable to watch. Now we got the movie and to my surprise this is actually a enjoyable movie and a great one as well.The animation once again looks well detailed and great I mean just like I said before about stop motion animation never getting old and still looks great even today. Nice work to the people who did the animation for the movie, you made a good looking movie.The character's in the movie are the same in the TV series and I'm saying that in a positive way because them not saying anything only sheep noises and you also got a dog that don't talk (Thank the lord for that) but anywhere they dialogue are them talking in their own animal langue and it's still interesting to see them interacting with each other like that, and that takes talent for me to be more interested with character's that are not human or don't talk human.The whole movie is trying to get the farmer home just because he got knocked out by a solid object and falls into caravan it falls into town and all of the sheep and the pet dog from the farm have to go out and search for him, that's whole the movie right there and it's short and to my surprise it flowed very well not like other movies that are short and the story line is too basic.If I have to name problems from the movie these only some like: The villain of the movie just felt like your basic, cliche, not that interesting villain with a poor character ark that every time his on I felt it would be a lot better if he wasn't there at all. And that's really it for problems.Overall Shaun the Sheep: The Movie is a good family movie with clever and well thought out jokes that flow extremely well even for a kids movie. Great character's, outstanding animation, funny humor and a good stand alone movie that's worth seeing if you have seen the show, if you have not please watch the show first to get to know everyone and then watch the movie.",

    "review": "  Shaun the Sheep is the movie adaptation of the popular children's TV series of the same name. An what i will say is that if you at least like the TV show you will like this movie because it is very much like a long episode, same to be said if you don't like the show you probably will not enjoy this movie. And in saying that, i was a little surprised by how much i enjoyed this film, i wasn't a massive fan of the show but i do remember watching it when i was younger and getting a laugh or two here and there. I wasn't sure if the humour would work as well now that i am older, but for most of the time it really worked. It is a very child friendly film so you get very childish jokes but the way they create these funny moments is genius considering that the sheep don't talk, so you are relying on the animation and sounds to make you laugh. Some of the humour was a little too childish for me but as i said, for the most part it worked. The animation in this film is fantastic, considering how difficult claymation is to do, the amount of work and detail they put into the film is clearly evident. Plot wise you know what you are going to get, it is obviously going to be a very predictable plot so i wasn't disappointed by it but knowing most of what was going to happen does take you out of it a bit. But this was simply a very entertaining film that had some good laughs and some good messages that they show through some slightly emotional scenes. This is a great film that the whole family could enjoy, the only thing that may put you to sleep in this film is if you begin counting the cute little sheep. - 7.2",

    "review": "  For such a simple film, the Shaun the Sheep Movie is a surprisingly hilarious and charming film. Aardman has created yet another creative, funny and potentially timeless comedy that appeals not only to the general taste in humor, but also to audiences who are looking to find something small, fun and enjoyable for a change.The film, like the cartoon series it spun off, employs no dialogue and relies solely on visuals to carry across everything: it's characters, setting and story, and it's done incredibly well. Most of the characters and their personalities we see in the film are, in the literal sense, seen, not spoken. Each character is consistent in their actions and ideas. The film and it's comedy wouldn't have worked otherwise, and, while it is guilty of making one or two pop culture references, the comedy is directly sourced from the characters and their environment, and it's hilarious, with one shining example being the scene where Shaun and his buddies were trying to learn how to behave in a restaurant. The Shaun the Sheep Movie, another 90-minute gem, is short, but packs in enough slapstick visual joy and hilarity to justify its length; it is neither dragged out or packed in too tightly; the pacing is consistent and makes for great fun for audience throughout the entirety of the film, rather than being sliced in different segments.It's nice and refreshing to see a film like the Shaun the Sheep Movie. It's a entertaining and highly amusing ride that's sure to please anybody with an open mind towards animation and kid-friendly films in general. It goes without saying that both Aardman fans and the general audience will walk out of this movie pleased, with feelings equal to that of finishing a nice meal.",

    "review": "  Cute and sweet with jokes that are ok. But I was expecting something more intensely satirical and biting. The amazing thing about the movie is the amount of work that must have gone into the animation - which is stop motion. Apparently 20 animators worked on the film producing 2 seconds of footage per day! That's nearly seven years of work to produce 85 minutes of movie! (If my calculations are correct.) So one almost feels obligated to see the movie given just the human resources that went into it. Apart from that, the whole thing is a bit wooly. And some of the music choices are jarring. But, if you find Shaun the Sheep cute you might like this one.",

Some pacing issues and an obvious Babe: Pig in the City ripoff plot are compensated with perhaps the best claymation from Aardman yet, and some beats that really resonate - a few times with sadness, but mostly with chuckles and the occasional huge belly laugh. Love all the sly (and some obvious) film references. This was the first film my two year old nephew saw at the cinema, it was a mostly successful trip, but a few seconds into the cinema he started crying and screaming about ghosts! How does a two-year old know about ghosts??? Thankfully, Hue and I had our toy Shaun the Sheep there to calm him down.",

    "review": "  Shaun the Sheep Movie is easily an inviting film, it has very soft and familiar nuance like an old friend or that vacation spot you used to visit as a child. It may not possess imposing visual effect like recent animations, but this simplicity is a strength of its own. Practically everyone can watch it and be entertained with smart visual jokes as well as a heartwarming story. After trudging to constant schedule in daily basis, Shaun is bored of his monotonous live in the farm. He begins to devise a plan to give him and other farm animals a day off. Unfortunately, he unknowingly starts a series of events beyond his control and they all must try to remedy this situation. The story is told almost entirely without dialogue as the characters mutter some gibberish that's familiar enough to understand with the help of visual cue and body language.It's not often to see stop motion animation in past years, it looks really classic and modestly effective. There are lots of subtle jokes throughout the movie, which are naturally done and flow seamlessly. Pacing might need a while to set, it gets better after the first act. Its blend of comedy and family aspects meshes very well, even if a few of the sequences are a bit predictable, they still deliver genuine uplifting vibe that children and adults can appreciate.Shaun the Sheep Movie may not be as bombastic as other animations, but it is funny and fascinating for all ages. Pleasantly entertaining, it has achieved what any film could hope for.",

For that reason they put the farmer to sleep but things go wrong when by accident the farmer is knocked down and looses his memory in the big city. Shaun and the flock with the help of the sheepdog must discover where the farmer is and make him recover his memory if they want things to get back to normal.A funny animated film that will delight the little ones with a very simple humour, no words at all and amazing little details that despite being orientated to younger audiences will entertain the not so young ones. A good family movie to watch on a lazy afternoon",

    "review": "  In my opinion, Shaun the Sheep, the TV show, is the best thing Aardman have ever done. Fiendishly funny, inventive and almost surreal in its enjoyment levels, adults will be able to enjoy it too. Shaun isn't Gromit, but he's a good character and here he stars in his own movie. He, the flock and the sheepdog go into the city to rescue their Farmer. This is an old premise for a film of this type, although new things are done with it and the city rendered in glorious Claymation never stops being fun to look at. Visually it's a very clever film and as it's stop motion it never feels artificial. Shaun the Sheep Movie isn't a profound film and it's all about the humour, which it delivers on. With unpredictable and bitingly effective jokes, clever slapstick and an atmosphere of unrestrained glee, this offers charm in spades and the laughs don't really stop flowing. A scene which occurs in a restaurant is one of those moments where you wish they could pause the film for a moment so that you can stop laughing and regain your composure.It's not flawless though. While this won't bother many, some poor continuity to the TV show, such as there being fewer sheep than normal and the Farmer being fond of the sheep in an overly sentimental manner can be irritating. The music is a bit jarring, and some of the jokes are a little broad and some of the set pieces are too threatening. The truth is, short TV shows being stretched to fit a feature length running time often stretches a simple premise beyond breaking point. This doesn't quite happen here, but the film runs out of gas before the end and it's not quite as inventive as say, The Wrong Trousers or A Close Shave. There are plenty of laughs, but they rarely reach the levels of hilarity the TV series would often produce. STSM is a good animated film and certainly worth seeing over many of the other films currently in cinemas and it's a good laugh for the whole family. However, it's not quite what it could have been, but it strikes an 8 on the laugh o meter.7/10",

I love the Britishness of the films and the love and attention that goes into making these films is there for all to see. And most importantly it's funny!",

There was none of that adult humour that gets hidden in the kids films nowadays... this was a straight up kids films. Still amazingly made and had its funny moments, but compared to the other films they made, this was not their best effort.",

    "review": "  Good ol' 'Aardman' back with another clay-mation delight. this time giving us the world of 'Shaun The Sheep' based on the 'kids' (I put quotes because it's one of those kids things adults can get a kick out of too) TV show about...well a sheep named 'Shaun' and his mischievous escapades with his fellow sheep, the farmer and his dog, 'Biitzer'.I love me some clay-mation, their previous 'Pirates' and further back still 'Wallace & Gromit' series of movies and shorts are some of the best animated movies (and movies in general) ever made. Masterpieces could be used to describe them and while 'Shaun the Sheep' isn't that, there's certainly plenty to love about it. The premise of the show more or less matches the movie just with a little more to it - to ramp the stakes up. After 'Shaun' gets into some shenanigans and the farmer ends up in the big city - the group go off to find him. Like the show this is largely silent with some bleets and muddled speech for humans. But it doesn't need it, the comedy all comes from the actions and with the great animation from 'Aardman' there's plenty.It's slapstick at times but it's also full of clever series of events and ridiculous and absurd set-pieces. Managing to elicit a lot of laughs out of silent characters show how strong teh animation and how subtle movements and the writing has to be. In it's short run time it utilises it perfectly the adventure is swift and when it takes a breather it packs it with jokes. The story like with most things is just a vehicle for jokes and towards the end it gets surprisingly dark compared with the breezy nature of the rest of the film - and to a point normal villain. While the story isn't much more than it needs to or could be the characters here play as much a part as the humour. You'll quickly get attached to them Shaun and the flocks endearing qualities, Bitzer's stern but lovable personality and teh farmers obliviousness and facial expression are all here to put a smile on your face - and you won't stop, I didn't.'Shaun the Sheep' brings the small time kids show to the big screen with resounding success. It's still very much in the spirit of the TV show but on a slightly grander scale. The attractive and sleek clay-mation from 'Aardman' is as present here as ever. It's not just good it's great and genuinely sits among Aardman's pantheon of animated master-classes.",

    "review": "  After the more meandering and disappointing Flushed Away and The Pirates!, Shaun the Sheep is a triumphant return to form for Aardman and the studio's best production since Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. The film is uproariously funny, even though there is not a single line of dialogue; just grunting, growling and of course bleating. This is thanks to the top-notch visual storytelling, where every expression, movement and set piece has its place and purpose. The animation is vibrant, detailed and sometimes captivatingly cute (thanks to Timmy, the baby sheep), and makes most of the recent 3D animations look cheap and uninspired. There are several pop culture references for older viewers to spot (even including one to Breaking Bad), which bring some added value, but mostly the film's focus is on the brilliant comedy. There are a couple sequences that go on slightly too long, and the film still isn't as hilarious as Wallace & Gromit, but out of recent family films, Shaun the Sheep beats Paddington in every way.",

    "review": "  Aah Aardman you've done it again! But then thinking about it when have they not 'done it'? They've been making animated gold for the past twenty-five years. But for some reason I was slightly more sceptical about their latest offering, Shaun the Sheep Movie. While I was never expecting it to be bad because come on, this is Aardman we're taking about, I was not expecting it to be half the film it turned out to be. Shaun the Sheep Movie is an hilarious, heartfelt and thrilling animated comedy that will delight everyone in the audience no matter what the age.When Shaun decides to take the day off and have some fun, he gets a little more action than he bargained for. A mix up with the Farmer, a caravan and a very steep hill lead them all to the Big City and it's up to Shaun and the flock to return everyone safely to the green grass of home.When going into a film like Shaun the Sheep Movie one has to weary of its source material. This is a big-screen adaption of what is basically a young kids programme on CBBC, so it was always in the back of my mind that it was going to play to a younger audience but really I found myself laughing more than any of the children in the audience. It's a natural talent that Aardman seem to have, they effortlessly give their films a universal audience and there is absolutely no one that this film isn't for.The very daring move on Aardman's part with this adaption is that Shaun is in all intensive purposes, mute, so they've played the film out like a silent comedy and as a huge lover of the genre I can say with great reassurance that directors Mark Burton and Richard Starzack have absolutely nailed it. In order for any silent comedy to work it has to have great visual comedic timing and mercifully Shaun the Sheep Movie has that.The absence of dialogue doesn't go a miss in fact you'll barely notice it. In fact I think it elevates the film into something else, something even more impressive. And as always with Aardman the animation is unmatched with its trademark use of stop-motion and plasticine, Shaun the Sheep Movie is extremely ambitious with some of its sets as a huge bulk of the film takes place in a city. The sets are just as impressive as they are meticulous and the attention to detail is just staggering.The producers have clearly been given a bigger budget to play with making the film feel surprisingly cinematic. The facial expressions are so life-like and provide first-rate comedic timing and just as I was about to leave the theatre yet another set of gags awaited me with its superb end credits sequence.I would be stunned to hear if someone didn't enjoy this, people will look down on Shaun the Sheep Movie but believe me, this is some of Aardman's best work to date. To quote Mark Kermode \"As I was watching it I could feel my soul being scrubbed clean\".",

The story was easy to follow and every second was dripping with heart and sincerity. Truly a masterpiece for both the very young and the very old. An instant classic in speechless humour like Mr Bean. Such a wonderful thing to come out for little children it rivals Winnie the Pooh for sure unadulterated fun and charm and in some ways even rises above it. One for all to see and enjoy- and which can be kept in it's purest state through translations in the simple fact that there is nothing to translate. 5/5",
