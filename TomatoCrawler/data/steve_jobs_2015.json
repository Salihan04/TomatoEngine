    "review": "  This is far from my favorite Sorkin screenplay, but a very good one nonetheless. Boyle's direction and choice of using 16mm, 35mm and digital film for the 3 different time periods is great. Fassbender, Winslet, Rogen and Daniels all put on great performances as well. This film only came up short for me because I was expecting something as great as \"The Social Network,\" and this obviously came up short of that, but it is still a great film.",

    "review": "  Dizzying with its dialogue, Steve Jobs tells the story of its titular man through three Apple product launches, 1985's Macintosh computer, 1988's Apple rival and failure, Next, and 1998's iMac, the beginning of the re-emergence of Apple into ubiquity. It's really an Aaron Sorkin movie above all else, which means we get absurdly intelligent characters walking and talking at rapid-fire with brilliant one-liners and snappy dialogue that bristles with musicality to it, the kind that your ears perk up for. It's a feast for the ears; however, Steve Jobs is really an emotionally cold stage play on film. Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) is the director but the staginess of the conceit is too much for the visually nimble filmmaker to overcome. There are a few small visual flourishes as inserts but the star is Sorkin's verbose screenplay. We get a glimpse into the prickly, egotistical, bullying, visionary, and curious man that was Steve Jobs. His continual denial of being the father to his daughter is a source of great contrarian insight. The structure of the script lends itself to repetition and artificiality. All these characters keep turning up and having these important conversations at these moments? After a while it feels like the characters are talking in circles and waiting for catharsis, and the concluding ten minutes is a detour into unearned sentiment. The movie and its major themes just do not come together with the clarity or force that the filmmakers believe. Michael Fassbender is superb as Jobs and there isn't a bad performance in the bunch. It's an engaging movie in the moment but I don't feel like I know Jobs any better than before. In attempting to tell the life of one influential man, Sorkin has made the movie about himself, but The Social Network this is not. Nate's Grade: B",

    "review": "  With a screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin, you really shouldn't be worried. Once again, he writes a tight, tense script, that highlights the most interesting moments in the life of the late \"Steve Jobs.\" Choosing very carefully, this is a very well-crafted biopic in the strangest way. Michael Fassbender is terrific in the title role and Jeff Daniels, Kate Winslet, and Seth Rogen (surprisingly) play off him extremely well. This is a character study and nothing more. Unlike the film \"The Social Network,\" which focussed on both the characters and the entire process of the creation of Facebook, \"Steve Jobs\" is even more dialogue driven, but it begins after Apple has been created. Danny Boyle definitely has his direction stamp on this one and it shines beautifully through the images on screen. Overall, \"Steve Jobs\" is a great ride for what it is, but nothing is all that exciting about it. I would give some nods to the writing and acting that this year's Oscars, but I think that is where the amazement ends. In the end, I had a great time with this film.",

    "review": "  Steve Jobs was a film that I believe is a phenomenal piece of cinema. I completely loved the way the Aaron Sorkins script captured the legend of this imperfect man who changed the world forever. But its director Danny Boyle who brings the script to life, giving us a stunning film that brings the story and actors to life. Michael Fassbender has risen as one of the best and most capable actors working in Hollywood. He may not resemble Jobs, but he plays the man so well that I believe most will ignore this pointlessly issues. He has the timing, grace, enthusiasm and brutality to pull off playing the man. He is able to cast him in a likable and unlikable picture yet never losing that charisma. Kate Winslet is fantastic as always, bringing us one of her best performances in years. She is humorous, fascinating and brings a lot of life to character. Seth Rogen blew me away in his more serious performance as Steve Wozniak. While there is a fun side to the character, this actor shines in his emotional scenes with Fassbender. You can feel a strained but strong friendship between the two, and I am glad Rogen was able to finally show some range as an actor. Jeff Daniels continues to prove that is a force to be reckoned with. He brings so much power to the screen that its almost staggering.",

    "review": "  WORDMAN: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Being An Asshole) - My Review of STEVE JOBS (3 1/2 Stars)Aaron Sorkin must have shit a brick when BIRDMAN came out, because STEVE JOBS, as audaciously entertaining as it can be at times, is THE SAME DAMN MOVIE! Told in three parts, all located backstage at significant product launch events in the Apple co-founder's career, the important people in his life congregate for their turn to yell at this difficult, arrogant, strategic, cunning, neglectful, impossible man. No, it's not told in a single shot and no, Michael Fassbender, who excels at letting us into the energetic mind of Jobs, doesn't levitate or sprout wings, but the dissection of a man as told by his coterie remains the same. Pairing Sorkin's wall-to-wall dialogue with the kinetic, visionary director, Danny Boyle, sounds great on paper. While written like a stage play, Boyle's hiring brought with it the possibility of infusing it with his boundless energy. Unfortunately, this is Sorkin's film all the way, and Boyle's stamp can barely be seen. In the trailer, there's a shot of the back of Jobs' head as he waits in front of a door, a pause, and then he bursts through. It's what I was hoping for from Boyle, this tension between stillness and action, but those moments are so few and far between. There's a beautiful wide shot in a hallway with a projected image that feels tacked on as a heavy-handed afterthought. A not-so-subtle rainstorm takes over the background of a key boardroom scene. It feels like Boyle is doing everything he can to get an \"ahem\" in there, but it's a losing battle against Sorkin's vision. It's not that the film is lousy. Far from it. It's just a one-sided marriage. This is tricky, adult, smart, vibrant storytelling, albeit the very type that won an Oscar a year ago, and wholly the work of its writer. In addition to the electric Fassbender, Kate Winslet, as Jobs' Polish Marketing Exec Joanna Hoffman, who can go toe-to-toe with him more than anyone else, gives a furious, committed performance. The heart and soul of the film, however, belongs to Seth Rogen as Jobs' former partner, Steve Wozniak. Rogen finds the humanity in the man who would eventually become overshadowed by the CEO in the glasses, turtleneck and Mom Jeans. Michael Stulhbarg, so great in A SERIOUS MAN, plays Andy Herzfeld , Apple's Chief Developer, with great underdog bravado, firing snappy one-liners back at Jobs with great skill. Same goes for Jeff Daniels as John Sculley, a one-time Apple CEO, who has to bring the hammer down on Jobs on more than one occasion. Katherine Waterston, so good in INHERENT VICE, proves that performance was no fluke, with her turn as Jobs' ex-girlfriend and impoverished welfare mother. They have a daughter together, Lisa, and Jobs' inability to recognize her as such is, along with Wozniak's storyline, the emotional arc of the film. STEVE JOBS shines a light on a man's fight to excel in business and innovation while his fundamental decency erodes. The baby steps Jobs takes towards his own humanity are presented in true fashion to its subject, without a shred of overt sentimentality. Instead, we're left with a warts-and-all portrait of a megalomaniac struggling with such things as gratitude and selflessness. Had it not been done before and so recently, I would be jumping up and down more for this film. Sure, it's less a biopic and more of a compact look at a man trying to get his way during the key moments in his professional career. I appreciate that it doesn't look at his entire life, intending to get at his essence instead. Sorkin refuses to dumb down his non-stop dialogue and characters, forcing the audience to stay alert. Cinematographer Alwin H. K�chler, who also shot Boyle's SUNSHINE, works overtime to make these backstage rooms sing, but there's no disguising the Broadway play just itching to get out from under the movie treatment. A film about a marketing master who, along with the real geniuses, has changed how the world interacts, is worthy. I was hoping, however, for a little more innovation, instead of the very \"Sorkin-y\" walk and talk on display. Still, I highly recommend STEVE JOBS, because movies about smart people almost never happen anymore. Jobs seemed to know that the only way to realize his vision was to be a complete jerk. Perhaps Boyle, who is known for being a truly nice guy, could have put his foot down and inserted his voice a little more, then STEVE JOBS could have been a brittle masterpiece. We'll have to settle for really, really good instead, and that's something Jobs would have never done.",

The performances are spot on, the dialogue is as snappy as any Aaron Sorkin movie I've seen, the structure keeps the pace going, and Danny Boyle gives the film an energy that compliments Sorkin's writing perfectly. All in all, even if just judging on individual scenes alone, Steve Jobs has some of the best moments in any film I've seen this year. And as a whole, it's almost as good as its excellent individual parts.",

    "review": "  A high performance machine sporting an operating system that's at times brilliant but at times slow, Steve Jobs proves a remarkable upgrade from its glitch-filled predecessor and boasts some award worthy hardware besides. Not that the software comes completely riddled with bugs, mind you. The three-act design - set backstage at iconic product launches and ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac - proves to be the greatest and most irksome portion of the film. Rather than present the man in a cradle-to-grave slide show, the film integrates a lot of facts, figures, and (emotional) core processing into three key moments that capture the human factor behind this genius like lightning in a bottle and doesn't completely feel like data processing. Like any multiple storied production, however, some chapters emerge stronger than others and Steve Jobs suffers the slight indignity of the weakest link playing out last. Aaron Sorkin punctuates the goings-on with some super-intelligent zingers (indeed, he has given filmgoers one of the most quotable films of the last decade) and heartfelt back-and-forths (despicable at times, his interactions with his assistant, daughter, and former partner make this a phenomenal performance piece for all involved), but his third act becomes a bit dull before hitting audiences with an engrossing and deeply vetting curtain closer.An R-rated drama based on Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography, this bio-pic takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint a portrait of the man (Fassbender) at its epicenter. Michael Fassbender flirted with Supporting Actor Oscar before for 12 Years a Slave, but Steve Jobs posits a good reason why he didn't get it: He's a lead performer and deserves Best Actor accolades all the more for this, his best turn yet. Director Danny Boyle deserves a good deal of the credit, however. Despite limited locations, the action always feels fluid and the arena grand. Of course, it helps that the settings compliment Sorkin's walk-and-talk style, pioneered on NBC's The West Wing and put to excellent use here too. Bottom line: Big Mac",

    "review": "  People have asked frequently what I thought of the film Steve Jobs, most of them expecting a long-winded, nuanced answer full of qualifiers, as is my custom. Everyone has been floored by my simple and firm response. It's fucking PERFECT. I have hesitated to pen this review for fear of sounding pedantic, fawning, or trite. But there is is no avoiding the inevitable. Steve Jobs is finest example of acting and screenwriting we are to receive this year. Period. This film takes a theatrical approach and delivers a variation of a traditional three-act play. Rather than try to take on the broad narrative of our protagonist's life story while worshipping Apple (as the overly hagiographic Jobs did a few years earlier), each act takes place directly before a public launch event. This particular choice is no accident, as Steve Jobs is widely recognized for being a master of theatrics and stagecraft. Steve Jobs is channeled in fine form by Michael Fassbender, who has quietly become the world's best underrated actor. His Jobs is deeply intelligent, narcissistic, manipulative, ambitious, and a committed and uncompromising strategist. It's no mistake that Steve silently looks upon a painting of Napoleon Bonaparte and ponders his future. We also see much of his philosophy and business strategy, such as accessibility over versatility, design over function, and aesthetics over hardware, to the chagrin of many of the supporting characters. Independent film queen Kate Winslet manages to issue great back-and-forth, rapid-fire dialog as Jobs' long suffering assistant. The direction by Danny Boyle is fantastic and micro-focused, not a scene wasted or needed. The script, curtesy of Aaron Sorkin, represents his best work since The Social Network and it's hard not to see the parallels in terms of the themes presented and the real life giants they tackle. One particular scene stood out to me in which Jobs and his former CEO, played by Jeff Daniels engage in a brutal argument. While most would see only two white guys in suits arguing in an empty room with a few chairs, I saw a vicious lightsaber duel to the death. The dialog give a no-holds barred gritty feel and the scene had me more tensed and riveted than any action movie thus year, save Mad Max: Fury Road. One might be tempted to call this ACTING: THE MOVIE.Other subplots proved to be rewarding as well, such as the odd relationship between Jobs and his daughter (three different actresses) which gives him a true arc by humbling him, forcibly, and bringing him full circle with his life decisions. He also shares a critical trait with the main characters of Citizen Kane, Raging Bull, and the Social Network in that the skills and abilities that make him succeed professionally, doom him in his personal life. Jobs even admits that he is \"poorly made.\" There are numerous other performances by character actors such as Seth Rogen that complete it so perfectly, but it would take another 3 paragraphs to do them justice. I can simply reiterate that Steve Jobs is lean, well-crafted masterpiece that deserves more attention and every award that it will be nominated for. See it. Absorb it. Think different.",

It is, however, the execution of said story that is such a let down. It's rushed yet uneventful at the same time. A lot of Petty drama that while I'm sure is important to the man Steve Jobs, but is entirely unnecessary in the film of that title. I mean, is the movie about Steve Jobs road to success or his daughter? I really don't know. It's better than Jobs with Ashton Kutcher, but I'm starting to wonder wether or not Steve Jobs will ever have a successful movie about him. We'll have to wait and see.",

Aaron Sorkin can be one of the most engaging and brilliant writers when he's on his game, but it can get to his head sometimes. Every major character in this movie is smart, quick-witted, and fast-talking, which makes them nearly indistinguishable from one another as people. There is no room for subtlety, nuance, or reflective silence. It all seems like it's just a bunch of Aaron Sorkins walking around talking to each other very quickly, and considering that this is supposed to paint a portrait of a real man, it only succeeds in leaving the viewer with the impression that he -- Steve Jobs -- acted like an Aaron Sorkin character.",

    "review": "  Aaron Sorkin gives the Apple co-founder some close scrutiny in this unflattering portrait, cleverly framed around three key product launches. Caught at his most over-stressed, Jobs often comes off as both the smartest man in the room and the most heartless, a difficult mix that's expertly managed by Michael Fassbender in the leading role. Fassbender doesn't even remotely look the part, but his ruthless conviction and forceful, melting gaze make the act easy to swallow despite that. It's also true of Seth Rogen, actually, who seems a bizarre choice to play celebrated engineer Steve Wozniak, but pulls it off against all odds in several tastefully limited appearances. This isn't the typical biopic, spanning a figure's entire life and weaving it all into one grand, epic journey with a happy ending. Instead, it's a concise, efficient peek through the window at three turning points in the man's history: his biggest gamble (Macintosh), his greatest spin (NeXT) and his ultimate redemption (iMac). The products get their moments to shine, as does Jobs's infamous penchant for micro-management, but the real story focuses on his relationship with an unwanted, unaccepted daughter and the betrayal of an adoptive pseudo-father. There's warmth in the script, and in its focal figure, but also a terrible, heartbreaking coldness on both fronts that seems painfully real. It may not be the whole story (several heavy moments are fabricated in the name of plot) but it's enough to convey a better understanding of its subject as a human being, warts and all. A terrific effort, moving and entertaining the whole way through, that merits watching whether you love the ubiquitous brand or loathe it.",

    "review": "  Slick, captivating and driven by outstanding performances, Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs is an incredibly focused, tensioned and well-paced biopic. Far from being a \"dream story\" of a cult \"tech-hero\", the movie is a provocative depiction of an arrogant, rude genius who found his own way to make things happen the way he has dreamed. The success of Danny Boyle's delivery is hidden in two main factors which wonderfully compliment Boyle's directing: the actors and the screenplay of Aaron Sorkin. Just like The Social Network, Sorkin's screenplay is direct, aggressive and dialogue based. Rather than a whole life story, the movie covers three specific events from Jobs' life in order to create a complete depiction of his character. Each scene is minutes before the presentation of a new product inspired by Jobs and just minutes before it all corporate, private and personal sides of the main character are being revealed to the audience. The second reason why Steve Jobs is a must see movie is the performance of Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet. The former delivers a mesmerizingly manic performance which truly deserves the Oscar nod which it received (although its chances of winning are quite small) while the latter is most deservedly considered to be among the favorites to actually grab the award for Best-Supporting Actress. Winslet gracefully remains in the shadows of Fassbender while she shows the same determination and dedication to success and Jobs' dreams as Jobs himself. If asked, why I would not consider Danny Boyle's latest aspiration to grab some Oscar Awards, the answer would be simple. While the screenplay and the direction make it possible to have a wonderfully tensed movie, the lack of emotional load and actual involvement by the audience with the characters is present at every moment. In addition to this, the final \"redemption part\" simply does not match the rest of the content and seems a bit awkward in the end. In conclusion, Steve Jobs is a brilliant movie which despite its minor flaws will be potentially a serious Awards-contender (at least Alan Sorkin has a real shot at winning for Best Screenplay, as well as Kate Winslet for Best Supporting Actress). A captivating, thrilling and completely enjoyable, the movie is one of the highlights of 2015.",

    "review": "  So I've finally got a chance to watch \"Steve Jobs\" over the weekend and I thought it was pretty good. Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet both gave a terrific performance, as the chemistry between the two was convincing and enjoyable to watch. The writing and the directing is this movies biggest strength, because the movie is non-stop talking and that's what this movie really is, and I know this isn't going to be for everyone, but for me, I was engaged all the way through and I honestly can't recall being bored while watching the movie. My biggest praise that I have for this movie has to go to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin, because filming and writing a movie like this isn't easy (trust me). The problems I have for the movie are very small and many people wouldn't be bothered by this, but this is just me. The little kid actor in the movie (Who plays Steve Jobs young daughter) she wasn't bad, as I thought she did alright for the most part, but there were a few times when I noticed some slip ups. But that's just a mini problem and the rest of the performances from everyone was great.Overall Steve Jobs is a well made film with clever writing, outstanding acting and directing. It's a shame that this movie was pulled from many theaters because nobody wanted to see it. Jem and the Holograms and Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension, both sh*t movies that managed to stay in cinemas, but this movie didn't.",

    "review": "  Steve Jobs is really a movie that would have been better served as a TV miniseries, at least in this way of telling the story. It's really 3 chunks of movie, each taking place before the launch of a notable Apple product. It's an interesting idea, and allows us to see Jobs at his most stressed and vulnerable levels, but it makes the movie feel a little choppy. It also means there's a lot of technobabble that I didn't understand and simply didn't care about. We do however get to see a lot of how Jobs handled things in these stressful periods. How accurate these representations are I have no idea, but they are interesting nonetheless. Aaron Sorkin's dialogue is fast and witty, which should't be any surprise, and while Fassbender really doesn't look much like Steve Jobs he gets a lot of the mannerisms and attitude down very well. All the actors do well, including a virtually unrecognizable Kate Winslet and a sadly underused Seth Rogen. The best scenes in the movie are these actors playing off each other, whenever Rogen and Fassbender have to argue with each other it's damn intriguing. There isn't enough of that though, with too much focus on the technical stuff and not enough on the people. I liked how they show Steve's eventual growth into a decent human being, but by not focusing on that aspect enough it feels a little forced. There's stuff I liked, and stuff I didn't, but nothing I really hated about this movie. Ultimately I was never bored, and I learned a few things about the man.",

    "review": "  \"Musicians play their instruments. I play the orchestra.\"Danny Boyle might have been the director of this biopic, but the true orchestrator of the film was Aaron Sorkin who once again delivers a powerful and engaging screenplay that makes the entire cast look fantastic. There is no denying the genius of Jobs, but it is so hard to encapsulate an entire life into a two hour film (several attempts have been made but failed to do so until now), but Sorkin masterfully pulls it off by focusing the film in three stages; each one involving a product launch. The first act takes place in 1984 during the launch of the Macintosh computer. Here we are introduced to Jobs's vision and his stormy relationship with his co-workers as well as with the mother of his daughter who he refuses to recognize. Jobs is an intriguing man with a unique vision who can't seem to balance his personal relationships with his creative genius. Through witty dialogues and fantastic character interactions we get a glimpse of who this man is. The second stage takes place after Jobs has been fired from the company he co-founded, for the launch of his new creation: NeXT in 1988. And the final third act is where he is finally consecrated as a genius during the launch of the IMac computer after having been called back to save the almost bankrupt company.The performances are fantastic, but you couldn't expect less from such a rich script. Michael Fassbender is superb as Jobs. He delivers an outstanding performance of such an iconic public figure. But the rest of the cast never falls behind. Kate Winslet plays his head of marketing, Joanna Hoffman, who is brilliant and shines in every scene she shares with Fassbender. Apple's CEO, John Scully is interpreted by Jeff Daniels, and there is a fantastic parallel scene where he and Jobs go off at each other during two specific moments that changed their relationship. Then there is another powerful scene where Jobs and Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) have a disputed argument where they finally let all their feelings out in the open. Every character in this film has his or her moment and each one is key to unravelling who Jobs was and how he thought. The film is perfectly written and I don't think anyone will take the Oscar away from Sorkin.",

    "review": "  It's a premise that on paper really shouldn't work, lock in a talented cast, a director in need of a hit and a writer who is capable of creating some of the most captivating dialogue on the planet and Steve Jobs quickly goes from an average affair to an extremely captivating one. Steve Jobs is a fast paced biopic of the late icon, who notoriously changed the world of computing for better or worse. Like him or loathe him, Jobs was famous for being a pioneer and infamous for his alienating demeanor and his ability at being intolerable for a large portion of his life. Sorkin does a brilliant job, pardon the pun, at balancing the bipolar nature of the man, showcasing him as an extremely troubled genius, who has the ability to infuriate as well as resonate. Luckily Boyle's cast is more than capable of pulling it off. Fassbender is on fire as Steve Jobs, firing through the quick paced and venomous dialogue at a frightening speed, all the while crafting a wonderful character. Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels and indeed Seth Rogen are all on point also, giving Fassbender the support he needs to be able to pull off such a feat. In fact Sorkin's material is so character and dialogue driven, it sets up barriers for Boyle to perform within, utilizing the directors frenetic style in a more mature and focused manner, Boyle himself hasnt been as on point for many years. It's a wonderfully shot, brilliantly acted and masterfully written piece of drama, that will offer insight and emotion into an icon that has just as much fans as he does enemies. The problems lie however in a formulaic approach, Steve Jobs has such a clear beginning, middle and end that each defining moment we are subjected to feels so prominently titled, that any sense of getting completely lost within it is tarnished as act 2 begins. The film also follows a typical biopic set up, having Jobs hailed as a demi god and forgiven for his sins all too easily, its enough of a niggle to hurt the final product, as all the drama leading up to the finale is so cut throat and indeed impossible of complete ignorance. Problems aside, Steve Jobs is a brilliant character piece, that you will happily find yourself getting lost in, time and time again.",

I like Fassbender as an actor but one thing I've always hated about him is when he does roles that require him to put on an accent because I don't think he's ever been that good at it with the exception of his role in 12 Years a Slave. Now I never had a real desire to watch this film but I'm glad I did. Fassbender plays Steve Jobs so convincingly. He's pretty much pitch perfect in this role and he mastered the American hippy-nerd tone and speech to the point where I believe he's actually like the character he's playing. It may not be an extraordinary performance but it's an extremely convincing one that works while still being quite over the top but at the same time very subtle. It reminds me of Johnny Depp's performance in Ed Wood. I think it makes him deserving of the 2015 Oscar for best actor. At least from the 3 out of the 5 Oscar nominated performances I've seen so far.",

    "review": "  Here's a film that proves that cinema is not only dead, but that great filmmaker can be pushing the boundaries of film and deliver a film that puts together a different structure and feel than earlier biopics.The film is set before the launches of three key products: the Macintosh, NeXT Computer and iMac G3, mostly showing the behind the scenes troubles that have occurred.The cast is superb, most notably Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs. Fassbender once again proves why he is such an amazing actor and why every director wants to work with him, bringing Jobs to life with dread, determination and a feel of perfection, depicting Jobs as a creator who wants everything to be perfect and if its not, than it shouldn't be created or advertised in the first place. Christian Bale was the originally choice to depict Jobs and while I feel that he could have done a fantastic job, Fassbender's performance is routed in your memory so firmly, it's just so difficult to see any other actor in this role. Kate Winslet wonderfully supports Fassbender as Joanna Hoffman, his marketing executive, who has to put up with most of his problems throughout the film. Winslet and Fassbender work together perfectly, sharing the screen in many key scenes of the film. Winslet successfully transforms herself into the character, while she is also completely unrecognizable. Seth Rogen is superb as Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple. Rogen proves that he can successfully do drama and doesn't have to waste his career on stupid comedies. Rogen and Fassbender share only a few scenes together, but in those scenes you see not only the camaraderie, but also the differing views of both characters. Jeff Daniels, as John Sculley, wonderfully supports the film and Fassbender. Katherine Waterston is terrific as Jobs' former girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan. Michael Stuhlbarg is outstanding as Andy Hertzfeld, a member of the original Mac team. Makenzie Moss, Ripley Sobo and Perla Haney-Jardine do a fine job as the daughter of Steve and Chrisann at different ages. John Ortiz puts forth a good performance as a journalist interviewing Steve Jobs throughout the film.Danny Boyle once again proves that he is terrific director and true visionary, ever since his films Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours. The film was originally meant to be directed by David Fincher, who wanted Bale as Jobs, but left due to certain reasons. While the film does at times have the feel of a Fincher film, it is still true Boyle, who wonderfully stages the film. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay, based on the novel by Walter Isaacson, plays out almost like a play and is perfectly structured. Instead of following the general trope of most biopics, this film makes the smart move of instead focusing on three major launches surrounding key products, an approach like I really like. Each launch, or act, is almost like a play and at times feeling like a short film in a way, with those specific launches. Sorkin's screenplay carries many of trademarks, including his genius dialogue. Daniel Pemberton's score is chaotic, wonderfully supporting the film and the characters. Alwin H. Kuchler's cinematography is beautiful and stylish, supporting the key launches. For the launches, a specific cinematographic stye was taken to distinguish the different timeframes: for 1984, 16mm film was used; for 1988, 35mm film was used; for 1998, digital was used.The end result is a well made film, which even though it may not be for everyone, is clear proof that great film can still be made with great storylines that have a great meaning, message and original plot. Well done.",

Su actuaci�n es de lo mejor del a�o y no puede dejarse pasar.

Kate Winslet tuvo el Globo de Oro por su papel como la asistente de Steve, y no s� si todos esperaban que se lo gane (no yo al menos, y al parecer ni siquiera ella porque se ve�a realmente sorprendida cuando se lo dieron) pero fue una victoria justa de todas formas. El cast en s� est� demasiado bien, y su gui�n es excepcional. Gan� tambi�n el Globo de Oro, pero no fue nominado a los oscar, algo que sigo sin comprender. El gui�n fue incre�ble y una de las cosas m�s destacables.La banda sonora tambi�n es muy buena y merece una menci�n.En general de las mejores pel�culas del a�o con una historia buena y unas actuaciones que deber�a ser ilegal no ver al menos una vez.",

    "review": "  Steve Jobs is a well made film, I don't think there is any doubt there. What is more in question though is the setup of the film. Based on a novel covering the same series of events, Aaron Sorkin has woven an entire career of one man into three separate days, and for better or worse, he manages to cover the faults and strengths of Mr. Jobs quite well. However, only covering those three events and squeezing of all of that drama into what feels like mere minutes leaves the film rather devoid of emotion. From the very beginning, I was enthralled by the film. The dialogue is sharp, the acting is top notch and the events themselves are of historical importance, but it doesn't all come together quite the way it was intended. It doesn't feel genuine, instead more like a mashup of ideas, throwing all of the characters and drama into the scenario as possible to build the story. Except that I didn't quite buy it. I believed these characters thanks to Sorkin's dialogue, I even believed that these events were just as important as Jobs would have you think. What I didn't buy was why I should care. Steve Jobs as a figure is interesting, but I wasn't sold on him as the centre of a movie. The story wasn't there to back him up. Unlike with Sorkin's efforts with The Social Network where he crafted a story around the figure, creating a grey image of all involved, this is very black and white. Now, I've been very hard on it, but I really did enjoy it, I just think there was something missing. The cinematography was pleasant if a bit stark, the direction was serviceable if a little devoid of style, and as mentioned before, the performances left me wanting more. I wanted to love this, but I just walked away liking it. This should have been a sure thing with the team up of Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin. Instead, I'm anticipating their next films and not relishing this one. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",

    "review": "  **** GoodI am about to launch my review of the biopic film \"Steve Jobs\" on the revolutionary computer mogul. But the pun pressure is on, I don't know if I will be able to have a Pun Mac attack with my review of Director Danny Boyle's inventive but at times unauthentic movie. Don't get me wrong, the film is not filled with rotten apples of filmmaking. Boyle takes an unusual approach in setting the film in three different time eras of Jobs about to launch his latest product designs: the Mac, NEXT, and the IMac; obviously, the latter did not do too shabby. I credit Boyle for this distinct approach, but I doubt how much authenticity was involved in what transpired in those launches. In the three launches, Jobs interacts with longtime marketing director/right-hand woman Joanna Hoffman, longtime upstart partner Steve Wozniak, Apple CEO/Surrogate Father Figure John Sculley and others; all while dealing with a paternal responsibility with at first he denied. Michael Fassbender fascinates once again; this time with his fervent & magnificent performance as Jobs. Seth Rogen has never been better with his dramatic programmed work as Wozniak, Jeff Daniels was his most-of-the-time usual steady self as Sculley, and Kate Winslet was impressive as Hoffman. Acclaimed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin did provide some words of entrepreneur & arrogance wisdom (sort of computer speak) with his \"Steve Jobs\" script; but as he did with Zuckerberg, he did not articulate a pretty picture of Jobs by focusing a bit more on his arrogance. Sure it was unorthodox, but \"Steve Jobs\" did the job for the most part and computes as a worthy film in my book.",

Michael Fassbender is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, he was spectacular as Steve Jobs as he always is. His Oscar nomination is well deserved.

    "review": "  I make it my business as a consumer of entertainment not to dig into the personal lives of artists. I don't read gossip blogs, I don't watch entertainment news shows, which tend to focus more on celebrity shenanigans than anything else and I don't Wikipedia people so I can see a record of their arrests and lawsuits. I don't do these things because: a) a person's personal life, even a person in the public eye, is none of my business; and b) I just don't care. I don't care if someone's a jerk in real life. I don't care if they refuse to sign autographs, or they drink too much, or they cheat on their spouses. I don't know these people, in all likelihood I never will and if I only watch movies or listen to music made by people without flaws, well, I'll have a lot more free time on my hands than I do now. And so it is with Steve Jobs. I appreciate the man, I appreciate what he's done for the world, his vision, his products. But I don't want to know about his life. I don't care if he was a slave driver to his staff, or if he was a bad father, or if he thought himself Jesus Christ, as many of his admirers did/do.So I went into Steve Jobs, the new biopic by director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, not knowing what to expect. Will it be reverential, or will it be a smear? As it turns out, it was both. The movie takes place backstage at the unveilings of three of Jobs' personal computing breakthroughs (or what were meant to be breakthroughs), the original Macintosh computer, which bombed, Job' 'perfect cube' the NeXT, which bombed, and the 1998 release of the original iMac, which put Apple on its current course for world domination.As the clock to showtime counts down and the auditorium fills with hopeful computer nerds at each event, we follow Jobs around backstage as he tries to circumvent technical glitches, issues with his family and issues with his coworkers. There is also the odd flashback to important times in Jobs' ascension, like his being fired from Apple and he and Steve Wozniak arguing over whether their original Apple computer should have two ports or six. It's a strange narrative structure. In one way it feels brave, eschewing the typical three acts, confrontations and resolutions most movie's pace themselves around. In another way, it feels unfinished. This movie is two hours long, but I felt by the end like it had just started. That's due I suppose as much to the fact that it represents such a small chunk of such a long and impressive career, as to the filmmaking team and its talent in crafting compelling entertainment. I think Aaron Sorkin is the best screenwriter in Hollywood. Whether in TV or film, his scripts are the smartest, sharpest, most well crafted of anyone putting pen to paper (whether that paper be organic or electronic). And director Danny Boyle is one of the most exciting in his field as well. I've loved his movies since Trainspotting, much of the rest of the world has loved his movies since Slumdog Millionaire. His films are always interesting, well made and unique. He doesn't repeat himself and he doesn't seem to worry about box office potential. But as well as Boyle does, Steve Jobs is really the Sorkin show at the end of the day, in much the same way that The Social Network was. In fact, this movie feels a hell of a lot like The Social Network in a number of ways, not least of all in the music by Daniel Pemberton, which at times sounds as if it's copying note for note the iconic Reznor/Ross Network score. But Boyle still knocks it out of the park, and with Sorkin and Boyle as this movie's mommy and daddy, Steve Jobs was sure to be a beautiful baby. And it is. As far as the craft of making movies is concerned, this is one of the best films of the year. Credit due also to Michael Fassbender, who plays Jobs with a great deal of care and intensity, as well as Seth Rogan, who tackles a rare dramatic performance very comfortably, and Kate Winslet, Katherine Waterston, Michael Stuhlbarg and Jeff Daniels. A hell of a cast who do a hell of a job. If there was an Oscar for best ensemble, this would be a contender. As I said, I don't know much about Steve Jobs. So I don't know how many liberties Sorkin took with the fact vs. fiction of this particular tale. From what I've heard, he took many liberties in favour of more dramatic pacing and snappy dialogue. If that is the case, then so be it. I didn't go to this movie to see a proper page to screen adaptation of Jobs' biography, I went to see a good movie. I saw a good movie, a really good movie. A movie that feels unfinished, like someone taking a hundred polaroids on a vacation and pulling out just three random photos from the pile and showing them to you. It would've been nice to see a few more photos to gain a better understanding of the vacation as a whole, but those three photos, my God, they are beautiful, aren't they?",

    "review": "  Steve Jobs is probably the best play you'll see on a movie theater screen this year. (Take that Fathom Events!) Now while some may take that as a negative criticism, it is actually meant as a compliment. The reason I call it a play is because that is just how the film feels. We are essentially given three very long scenes that all seem to take place on a similar stage. The actors show up in and out of the scene, almost like they are entering and exiting an actual stage. The film is almost entirely dialogue-driven. There is no real action to speak of here that an actor couldn't do on a literal stage. As such, the film becomes dependent on script and performances, making it all the more an accomplishment that it is so compelling.Aaron Sorkin is one of the best screenwriters alive; I feel there are very few people out there who would disagree with that. His projects are usually of high-prestige and attract truly talented casts. Steve Jobs is no exception. Michael Fassbender continues to prove himself one of the most talented actors working. Add to that a cast that includes Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels, Seth Rogen, Michael Stuhlbarg, Katherine Waterston and John Ortiz and you've got a great combination of script and performers. As for Awards consideration, I think Fassbender and Winslet are shoeins for Oscar noms (Actor and Supporting Actress). There are two performances here deserving of Supporting Actor attention-Jeff Daniels and Seth Rogen. It's a tough call who will get the nom. Daniels has the higher pedigree (Dumb & Dumber Too aside) and gets the best feud (arguably the best scene) with Jobs in the movie. However, Oscar loves to nominate comedic actors turned drama, which works in Rogen's favor. Plus he gets the best line in the movie that pretty much sums up the Steve Jobs personality contradiction in one sentence: \"It's not binary. You can be decent and gifted at the same time.\" So, we'll see what happens.While I think the cast and script pretty much make the movie, that doesn't mean director Danny Boyle and editor Elliot Graham don't deserve high marks for their work here. The film moves along at a quick pace and there really isn't anything that needs to be cut. We get a few flashback scenes to help make sense of the conversations currently on screen. Boyle and Sorkin have made an interesting decision here to not present a standard cradle to grave biopic. Instead, we are shown the behind-the-scenes goings-ons at three different product launches. Each scene reveals a little more about Steve's personality and his growth or lack there of as a person and an inventor. If anything, Steve Jobs was a complicated man. Maybe he wasn't the almost Dr. House-ian jerk he's presented as here. Many people that were close to him have spoken out against this portrayal. But Sorkin has made it clear that he is not a journalist nor is this a documentary. It's a movie. His job as a screenwriter is to take what material is available to him, and what sources will speak to him (including Steve Wozniak) and turn that into an entertaining and at least somewhat informative product. That job has been accomplished.Steve Jobs isn't going to please everyone. It is a much different style than what we're used to in a biopic. And those with limited attention spans may well find the film boring. What is both a blessing and a curse for the film is that the movie theater experience really doesn't add anything to it, making it a film that will be just as enjoyable at home. This is a good thing for the home theater crowd, but as has proven the case so far, it is a bad thing for the film's box office. I've said many times my favorite thing in cinema is watching good actors perform good scripts. So at least for me, Steve Jobs was a very enjoyable movie. 8/10.?",

    "review": "  Steve Jobs is a film worthy of the legendary former leader of Apple. With very solid performances, very entertaining narrative and great Sorkin script, is a life completely out of character.As for the performances, each character is magnificently interpreted thanks to the direction of Danny Boyle. Of course, it highlights Michael Fassbender who, although he had a stigma of not physically resemble, manages to build the character in every way. His work is so flawless that I would not be surprised to see him nominated for Academy Award -for which would have a good chance.Likewise, Seth Rogen and Kate Winslet achieve a magnificent performance while exploiting the arc of each of his characters. Particularly, I must say it is refreshing to see Rogen making a completely different role to the archetype of \"stoner\" to which we are accustomed, especially because it does so outstanding.Another thing to mention is that this film, unlike Kutcher, yes tells the story of Lisa, who was the unacknowledged daughter of Steve Jobs for years. In fact, we could say that in large measure the story revolves around two characters as they adapt to their circumstances. Including Lisa is the key ingredient of the formula that makes Steve Jobs is a movie that will interest all audiences and emotional functioning in many ways.Perhaps that did not fit was the way in which certain transitions, especially when two timelines are taken are made simultaneously with the accelerated dialogue style The Social Network. This could be confusing for some people, plus it feels strange. However, everything else is told so fluid and natural, so it looks like a situation we are living in reality. That is why they can easily forgive accelerated short time.",

This isn't Steve's coming of age story but it is a candid characterization of Steve. Fassbender surprised me with his chameleon-like representation of Steve Jobs and Winslet protrays Joanne who the public never get to see in the real world so it's quite great on casting (except Seth, no way can I imagine Seth as Wozniak). I was really confused as why this was marketed as Steve's biopic since it isn't but am glad I was able to see this film. It gives me another side of Steve that I never knew about. Sure it may not be historically accurate and maybe everything's fiction but it is one way of learning who this intricate and complicated genius is.

His screenplay is excellent, using a fresh set-up based around three product launches that both avoids the dull chronological narrative that is so often done incorrectly and allows the audience to get a sense of the type of person Jobs was with a minimal amount of expositionary backstory. The dialogue is consistently brilliant, zinger after zinger flying from the mouths of the characters in such a way that it comes off as merely impressive as opposed to sanctimonious or overwrought (see The Newsroom). In his hands, Steve Jobs becomes the kind of Oscar-bait that actually delivers, a thrilling biopic and a great piece of filmmaking that earns the awards talk it received before even being released.",

    "review": "  Sorkin has written an excellent play, but I'm not so sure it works nearly as well as a movie. I know it's been said, but Sorkin's latest works read like Shakespeare's historical plays. I just don't think the \"character\" of Steve Jobs deserves such spotlight (while I do think the character of \"Mark Zuckerberg\" works amazingly in The Social Network). I feel the show Halt and Catch Fire has done a better job with a fictional Jobs/Wozniak pairing. Sorkin's script is pretty good, though.",

Sorkin and Boyle try to distill his life and times into three product launches in the 80s and 90s, and it does flirt with greatness, but it never seems to break free of its own constraints. In that way, it's a fast paced character study with a lot dialogue, hot heads, and a man who had the hardest time reconciling his own greatness with two legacies: that of the technological/social progress he knew he could pioneer, and a family he had no idea what to do with.",

    "review": "  Como los pastores de las Iglesias, la figura de Steve Jobs esconde egolatr�a, ambici�n y falta de verdadera empat�a. Jobs era un lobo disfrazado de oveja o, m�s bien, un bully disfrazado de nerd. El director Danny Boyle (\"Trainspotting\", \"Slumdog Millionaire\") logra capturar a la perfecci�n a este pol�mico personaje en una pel�cula escrita por Aaron Sorkin, el mismo que nos dej� boquiabiertos con el cl�sico contempor�neo \"The Social Network\". Michael Fassbender contin�a demostrando su grandeza como actor, encarnando a Jobs como un hombre pasivo-agresivo con poca o ninguna conexi�n con el mundo exterior, tal como las m�quinas que produc�a. La actuaci�n de Fassbinder es de primer nivel. El ejercicio formal de esta pel�cula biogr�fica, centrada en la palabra (y en las actuaciones), nos recuerda a \"Birdman\", ya que la pel�cula se desarrolla en la antesala de tres grandes lanzamientos de Jobs y se enfoca en la compleja relaci�n con su hija. Pero a diferencia se intentar desarrollar todo en planos secuencia, aqu� se utilizan tres formatos (pel�cula de 16 mm, 35 mm y digital) para mostrar la evoluci�n de imperio Apple. Este dispositivo formal es una delicia para los ojos: Aplausos para el fot�grafo Alwin Kuchler. �Y c�mo olvidar a los actores de apoyo? Kate Winslet es magn�fica como Joanna Hoffman, la sufrida gerente de mercadeo; Seth Roegen es genial como Steve Wozniak, el talento ignorado detr�s de Apple; Michael Stuhlbarg muestra su gran talento encarnando al herido y maltratado \"nerd\" Andy Hertzfeld y Jeff Daniels como John Sculley (el CEO de Pepsi que toma las riendas de Apple y quien despide a Jobs), nos muestra como una gran actuaci�n se construye a partir de detalles y sutilezas. Algunos quedar�n decepcionados al saber que la pel�cula no llega hasta los lanzamientos de productos como el ipod, el ipad y el iphone y tampoco nos muestra la lucha de Jobs contra el c�ncer que acab� con su vida de forma prematura. Pero no era necesario. \"Steve Jobs\" captura de manera eficiente, contundente y sensible las dos caras de una de las figuras m�s representativas de la era digital y comparar a esta obra con \"Jobs\" (la otra pel�cula biogr�fica protagonizada por Ashton Kucher), es como comparar un ipod con un walkman.",

    "review": "  The long-awaited and second big-screen adaptation of the life and triumphs of Steve Jobs takes a different approach to the standard biographical film and instead focuses on three very important product launches in Jobs' career and the film takes place backstage during these unveilings and we are shown the chaos behind the scenes right up until Jobs hits the stage. First off, this film went through many hands and at one time had Christian Bale and/or Leonardo DiCaprio attached to star as Steve, David Fincher was at one time going to direct, and it seemed like Aaron Sorkin's brilliant script wasn't going to be made, how lucky we all are that it did. Sorkin is the fucking man when it comes to the walk-and-talk, rapid-fire conversations and his only rival in the dialogue department is Tarantino; though Sorkin excels at writing insults. The cast is fantastic across the board with the highlights being Jeff Daniels, Seth Rogen, Kate Winslet, and Michael Fassbender flawlessly portraying the icy but intelligent Steve Jobs, and he embodies the character so well, he puts to shame Ashton Kutcher's previous performance as Jobs. The dialogue exchanges between the characters feels very broadway-like and the cast would rehearse each act for two weeks, perform it, and then move on to the next portion, but it all feels so natural, only these exceptional actors could have pulled it off. The directing duties eventually went to Danny Boyle, which was an interesting choice because his penchant for colourful visuals and surreal images was toned way back to give us a straight-forward but competent film and he got to flex his artistic muscles by filming each segment from '84, '88, and '98 in 16mm, 35mm, and digital photography respectively to visually represent the changes in technology. This film doesn't show you every nook and cranny of Steve's life, nor is it 100% factually accurate; many of the arguments and plot points were combined to feature at these three product launches, but as an artistic representation and character study of the man, I can forgive it for fudging the facts.",

    "review": "  There are many characteristic mentions in this review, and that's really what this film is about; Steve Jobs and his personality.From the writers of 'The Social Network' and the book 'Steve Jobs' comes a realistic and truly dialog-driven biography-flick, that even made Steve Wozniak believe that Jobs was there in his younger self. The plot itself is centralized on three Apple-related events, and they all move very fast. The dialogs are so intense and packed with humor, emotions and realistic drama. Anger, embarrassment and basic human traits are all thrown over the place. 'Steve Jobs' is high paced & dialog-driven film, that might be too fast for some and a bit too boring (dialogs) for others. But it's without any doubt a spectacular film were characters are presented in an exemplary and realistic way. Yes, some of you might find it a bit too dialog-driven and even boring, and it really depends what kind of movies you like. The man of Apple is a very complex character, but they managed to present him in a splendid way. His personality; the way he see things and his behavior is so well visualized! The father-daughter relationship and the overall chemistry between different characters is exemplary, and most of the credit must go to the well chosen actors and the high-paced dialogs that never stops to irritate and even fascinate the main characters. There are many moments where things go badly, not just plot-related events; characters as well!Michael Fassbender might not have the splendid look as what Ashton Kutcher managed to transform himself into in the less impressive 'Jobs-film', but that's the only downside. Fassbender didn't do just fine in this flick, we're talking about a major transform into Steve Jobs himself. His performance might even be Oscar worthy, time will only tell. It might be his best performance to date, that's for sure. A five star-worthy performance of a really complex character, well done! But it's still not a flawless movie (none is); due to the very complexity of Steve Jobs, his development didn't come of as very abstract. There could have been more change and conflict in him, but being a complex individual does make one understand why the writers didn't go further with him.Yes; its another Apple-related film, but what is 'Steve Jobs' really? It's so much more than a tech-biography; it's a deep and understandable inside to what friendship, egoism, family, love, visions & obsessions can result into. Add a splendid direction by Danny Boyle with smooth camerawork, artistic moments, and of course the clever editing; that's 'Steve Jobs'.Personal Rating: 82/100Critical rating: 95/100",

I always feel iffy about going into films about real people from the last 50 years because half of the time I get more enjoyment and understanding of that person by just reading the news. This movie, however, doesn't try to tell you every detail of Steve Jobs life or pretend that he was deserving of worship for his accomplishments. Instead, it just shows you a pressure cooker of the man at four intense moments of his life. It's not a snap shot, it's not trying to portray ever detail or list the facts- instead, it's a painted portrait. Not every line, color or flaw needs to be there in order for you to see him as he was. It's a thoughtful and intense and beautiful portrait of a stubborn, flawed, and intelligent person who was damaged in all of the right ways that he knew how to keep trying until he was able to rise above. There's no attempt at answering every question, it's just a skillfully drawn portrayal of a human being.",

One of the best actors working today, a fantastic screenwriter and an accomplished director. I liked a lot about Steve Jobs. I credit Boyle for his choices in format, Sorkin for his unique approach in telling a story and the cast for giving fairly decent performances. It is, however, the execution of said story that is such a let down. It's rushed yet uneventful at the same time. A lot of Petty drama that while I'm sure is important to the man Steve Jobs, but is entirely unnecessary in the film of that title. I mean, is the movie about Steve Jobs road to success or his daughter? I really don't know. It's better than Jobs with Ashton Kutcher, but I'm starting to wonder wether or not Steve Jobs will ever have a successful movie about him. We'll have to wait and see.",

    "review": "  Like \"The Social Network\" before, \"Steve Jobs\" is not about the product(s) that have changed our lives, but of the harsh personalities of the men behind them. This movie reminds us that Apple was, in fact, a financial failure of a company in its first twenty years because the dream that Jobs had to make computers available for everyone was not fiscally feasible at the prices that those products were offered. To love Apple was to love a brand, not a system, and the most devout of Apple devotees were sycophants to Jobs' brilliant marketing strategy.\"Steve Jobs\" reveals that the man himself, or rather his persona, was a product, a product that he himself created. Like the Apple products, over time, Jobs grew to become more flexible; even though the products themselves are notoriously closed, they are no longer incompatible with the rest of the world. This movie is about the hard journey it took for the man behind those products to start to become more open and accepting.",

    "review": "  Steve Jobs (2015) is an interesting film with strong performances. It has an strong three-part structure that embeds the film with a repetitive rhythm (as well as Aaron Sorkin's trademark rhythmic dialogue). But this also significantly narrows the scope of the story into a character study of the title role played by Michael Fassbender at key business moments in his life. However, in adopting this approach, much of the story about Steve Jobs is transformed into fictional events/conversations that never happened in this way, or never happened at all. In order to overcome this problem, several inadequate flashbacks are offered to fill in the gaps. However, the film should really carry a \"Inspired by Real Events\" cautionary rider at the beginning since 80% of what is said/done in this film never happened, and the other 20% is remixed together in an attempt to drill down to the core of its title character. The end result is fascinating but nonetheless doesn't ring true because the portrayal is too tidy, possessing an objective type of introspective honesty on the part of Jobs that was utterly lacking in Walter Isaacson's biography. If anything, this film is an improvement on Isaacson's own misplaced attempts to psychoanalyze Jobs in that biography. To quote Mark Twain, \"truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't.\" Mark's Grade: B",

Only those there can confirm the truth and how much of what is shown is said truth, but even as a film, the pacing and growth of Fassbender's Jobs is brilliantly written and executed.",

The entire cast eagerly dives into the emotions bubbling under the surface.Boyle directs with flair, but he knows the strength of this non-biopic lies in the screenplay and its unusual approach to the three act structure.I can understand this won't appeal to large audiences the way a straightforward biopic would, but it's definitely worth an iWatch ...

    "review": "  Aaron Sorkin adapted his play \"A Few Good Men\" from the stage to screen in 1992 and has been working steadily in Hollywood ever since. Because of this I normally assume he's probably written somewhere between 10-15 screenplays and was shocked to learn that as of now he has only written seven. It just feels like every two years we hear about a new Sorkin screenplay, so much so that most people use him as the film's selling point over the director. It's incredible to see a writer with such a distinct style that his work is able to supersede the directing stylings of David Fincher, Danny Boyle and Bennett Miller.Danny Boyle directs \"Steve Jobs\" at an electrifying pace. He's able to turn Sorkin's dialogue to nearly explosive levels. Boyle always seems to be on the fringe of being an A-list director but just isn't quite there, despite a \"Best Director\" award from the Academy in 2008. His name just doesn't quite carry the same cachet that others do; very few people say \"well the trailer doesn't look great but I'm not worried because it's Danny Boyle,\" like they might do for say Spielberg or the Coen Brothers. Still, you have to give him credit for making an inherently boring subject matter very lively in \"Steve Jobs.\"The movie could have very easily devolved into flashy shouting matches between titanic actors practically looking at the camera and flat-out asking for Oscar nominations but it never happens. Michael Fassbender is definitely flashy but he never goes out of control with the role of Jobs the way an actor like DiCaprio would. He's very convincing despite bearing absolutely no resemblance to the real-life king of Apple. He walks a great tight wire between charming and unpleasant, riding on mostly his own self-assurance that he is a genius, even though everyone in his inner circle constantly tries to get him to \"manage expectations\" about both his stature and his products' success.The supporting cast is just as good as Fassbender and we always want to see more of them. Jeff Daniels and Fassbender share an incredibly riveting exchange during the climax of the second act that keeps you locked in on the screen. The movies flashes back and forth between the past and present, giving us the perfect context necessary right before we need it; it's a bold move and thankfully it pays off well. Kate Winslet plays a great right-hand man to Fassbender's Jobs and get to share the screen with him more than anyone else and seems to be the only character capable of navigating the wayward wiring of Jobs' thoughts, with a performance that always seem rightfully stressed-out without ever asking the audience for the slightest pity.Seth Rogen acts as the emotional and moral high ground of the film as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Rogen makes the smart choice not to try too hard at \"serious acting.\" He does what he has always been good at, playing an affable man who knows when to get serious. I'm not surprised that Rogen gave a great performance in a serious movie. Not at all. \"Knocked Up\" has serious moments that play out just the way they should, the only difference is the larger context of most of his movies are on the goofier side but he is still a great actor no matter the context of the movie, which is why I groan when people get head-over-heels that someone from the comedy world was able to hold their own in a drama. Rogen is such a treat to watch and is able to play funny and immediately flip to aggressive in one beat. He perfectly encapsulates that sick feeling you get when you can tell one of your friends thinks their better than you. He's the character we relate to the most; if you find yourself relating more to Steve Jobs then you're probably either an asshole or think you're better than you actually are.This movie fits into a strange place in the current film landscape. Yes it is entertaining from start to finish and I've actually found myself thinking about it now and again almost a week after seeing it, but I have my doubts about whether or not people will still be talking about this five years from now, let alone even one. The film ends long before the iPhone debuts which is a smart move, as to avoid becoming merely and \"movie of the moment.\" There is a slight nod to the iPod near the end of the film, but not in a way that really ages it in any capacity. So what we're left with is a peculiar picture that is half biopic, half historical fiction. It fits in better with \"American Hustle\" than it does with biopics like \"Walk the Line\" or even the original \"Jobs\" film.",

Boyle's direction and choice of using 16mm, 35mm and digital film for the 3 different time periods is great. Fassbender, Winslet, Rogen and Daniels all put on great performances as well. This film only came up short for me because I was expecting something as great as \"The Social Network,\" and this obviously came up short of that, but it is still a great film.",

It reminded me of \"Carnage\", another very solid film with Kate Winslet, but flopped miserably in the box office. \"Steve Jobs\" is a fascinating film with powerful characters, subtle dialogue that reveals just enough for the audience to grab its meaning but requires them way more time to understand its subtext. The first \"act\" is kind-of slow, but the rest is simply exploding, especially the last confrontation between Jobs and his daughter (played by no other than the daughter of \"Kill Bill\"'s The Bride, who has grown up beautifully!). A very well-done film that deserves way more attention.",

    "review": "  The dialogue, penned by Aaron Sorkin, is great but the nature of the piece (a biopic compressed into three acts centered around three pivotal product launches in Steve Jobs' career) stifles proper character development because the audience only gets a taste of the players and their relationships. Furthermore it is preposterous to think they would only speak to one another right before important presentations and never speak to each other outside said events. As stated by others on this site, this script would've made a great play but it makes a OK movie. Michael Fassbender is trying is best to recreate Steve Jobs but he comes up short. Seth Rogen is miscast as Steve Wozniak. Kate Winslet is good as the fictional composite character. The rest of the cast is alright.The interplay between characters is lively and captivating at first but the all too familiar walk-and-talk rhythm by Aaron Sorkin (not to mention the self-righteousness of the characters in his scripts) gets old by the halfway point. To me, the film seems to peak too early when Jobs and John Scully (played by Jeff Daniels) duke it out in the second act over the circumstances surrounding Jobs' ouster as Apple CEO, and from there on the intensity just seeps out of the movie. Predictably, the filmmakers couldn't resist themselves by adding a good amount of overwrought sentimentality surrounding the character of Lisa Brennan-Jobs.I suppose the subject of Steve Jobs is just too tricky a subject to bring to life on the big screen via a major motion picture with a cast of well-known Hollywood actors. He is however wonderful cannon fodder for biographies and documentaries.",

Sorkin's script is undoubtedly the best of the year (maybe the decade), Fassbender's performance is completely deserving of any and every award in existence, and the soundtrack from little-known composer Daniel Pemberton is astonishing. Steve Jobs is a film that will stick with you long after it cuts to black. You will sit in silence and contemplate what you just witnessed, because you're sure that it was a historical innovation in film and unlike anything you've ever seen before.

    "review": "  Dizzying with its dialogue, Steve Jobs tells the story of its titular man through three Apple product launches, 1985's Macintosh computer, 1988's Apple rival and failure, Next, and 1998's iMac, the beginning of the re-emergence of Apple into ubiquity. It's really an Aaron Sorkin movie above all else, which means we get absurdly intelligent characters walking and talking at rapid-fire with brilliant one-liners and snappy dialogue that bristles with musicality to it, the kind that your ears perk up for. It's a feast for the ears; however, Steve Jobs is really an emotionally cold stage play on film. Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) is the director but the staginess of the conceit is too much for the visually nimble filmmaker to overcome. There are a few small visual flourishes as inserts but the star is Sorkin's verbose screenplay. We get a glimpse into the prickly, egotistical, bullying, visionary, and curious man that was Steve Jobs. His continual denial of being the father to his daughter is a source of great contrarian insight. The structure of the script lends itself to repetition and artificiality. All these characters keep turning up and having these important conversations at these moments? After a while it feels like the characters are talking in circles and waiting for catharsis, and the concluding ten minutes is a detour into unearned sentiment. The movie and its major themes just do not come together with the clarity or force that the filmmakers believe. Michael Fassbender is superb as Jobs and there isn't a bad performance in the bunch. It's an engaging movie in the moment but I don't feel like I know Jobs any better than before. In attempting to tell the life of one influential man, Sorkin has made the movie about himself, but The Social Network this is not. Nate's Grade: B",

One aspect of Boyle's work that is lacking is trimming the fat of Sorkin's script. Sorkin is an extremely gifted writer but he needs a director to control him. Fincher did that perfectly in \"The Social Network\", but here Boyle seems to just let so many scenes go on and on. The movie is mentally exhausting at times. Still, the subplot with Job's daugther is perfect and adds emotional weight to the coldness of the film and all three actresses who portray his daughter, Lisa, do a fine damn good job, as does the rest of the cast.",

A very intelligent film with a great script/performances, the unusual editing style means the film often feels like a two hour trailer but it's a clever way of capturing Job's perspective: paradoxically erratic and elegant and completely non-linear. The cliche of his journey towards empathy is the only let-down, but it is minor enough to only be a small distraction. The deconstruction of real facts and events into fictional conversations makes this an interesting take on the biopic genre, it doesn't cling slavishly to verisimilitude but it doesn't feed reality into a Hollywood mold either, it takes the truth and remixes it through the film medium to create a virtual docu-drama that is both fictional and true. Very refreshing. 9/10",

Perhaps the miss conceptions of true genius lays in the fact that the creator not necessary is the one who have the skills to do it, is the vision to create it, what is recognize by the society.In the film \"Steve Jobs\", director Danny Boyle ( Slummdog Millionaire, Trainspotting) presents a very egocentric and arrogant leader of the Apple corporation in 3 major landmarks of his career. The film build as a 3 acts introduce the major characters, develop around the keynotes when a new product is been introduce, but also set the foundation of Steve Jobs persona.The first act begins with the challenges for Apple presenting the Macintosh computer in 1983. We see a young Steve Jobs (Michael Fasbender) full of arrogance, treating his engineers as puppets forcing them to work as hard as a can to make the computer smile. While all this is happening his marketing executive Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) is dealing the paternity dispute revealed in a Time Magazine, who brought Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterson) to the theater where the keynote is taking place so Steve can meet his allegedly daughter Lisa. Danny Boyle presents this 3 long scenes with a outstanding film style showing the stages of every character. Jobs personalities develops with the success of Apple Macintosh, the failure of NeXT and the comeback with iMac. Michael Fasbender is fascinating as Steve Jobs, you care for him for trying to be the father figure, but you also hate him, despise him for the person person that he was, with his colleagues, partners and his workers. But you also admire him for be the center of attention, the visionary who make Apple what it is, a true groundbreaking company that develops good looking products. Ket Winslet is powerful as Joanna Hoffman, she is the voice of conscience for Steve Jobs. But the person who steal the scenes every time it appears is Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak. Besides of been a pain in the but to Jobs, he is also who is just fighting for the people who build, the Macintosh, the iMac, and other products who make Jobs the star of Apple.Steve Jobs is a powerful film, that is considered more a failure than a success for Hollywood, but is a great example of how to make a biopic, without telling the whole story all over again.",

I would concede that the structure of the film, using imagined confrontations and meetings with the same set of characters before 3 different product launches; essentially a series of duologues, are too neat and too articulate to be real. But it is a clever conceit that's brilliantly written and executed, summing up the man's achievements while nailing both his ambitiousness as a businessman and his flaws as a human being. Michael Fassbender is mesmerizing but the others, even Seth Rogen, are all given ample screen time to spar with Fassbender and to shine. Between the rhythmic, tension-building editing and Danny Boyle's fluid yet controlled directing, the film manages to make even the dullest corporate dealings as exciting and riveting to watch as any action sequence in your blockbuster thrillers.",

    "review": "  A high performance machine sporting an operating system that's at times brilliant but at times slow, Steve Jobs proves a remarkable upgrade from its glitch-filled predecessor and boasts some award worthy hardware besides. Not that the software comes completely riddled with bugs, mind you. The three-act design - set backstage at iconic product launches and ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac - proves to be the greatest and most irksome portion of the film. Rather than present the man in a cradle-to-grave slide show, the film integrates a lot of facts, figures, and (emotional) core processing into three key moments that capture the human factor behind this genius like lightning in a bottle and doesn't completely feel like data processing. Like any multiple storied production, however, some chapters emerge stronger than others and Steve Jobs suffers the slight indignity of the weakest link playing out last. Aaron Sorkin punctuates the goings-on with some super-intelligent zingers (indeed, he has given filmgoers one of the most quotable films of the last decade) and heartfelt back-and-forths (despicable at times, his interactions with his assistant, daughter, and former partner make this a phenomenal performance piece for all involved), but his third act becomes a bit dull before hitting audiences with an engrossing and deeply vetting curtain closer.An R-rated drama based on Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography, this bio-pic takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint a portrait of the man (Fassbender) at its epicenter. Michael Fassbender flirted with Supporting Actor Oscar before for 12 Years a Slave, but Steve Jobs posits a good reason why he didn't get it: He's a lead performer and deserves Best Actor accolades all the more for this, his best turn yet. Director Danny Boyle deserves a good deal of the credit, however. Despite limited locations, the action always feels fluid and the arena grand. Of course, it helps that the settings compliment Sorkin's walk-and-talk style, pioneered on NBC's The West Wing and put to excellent use here too. Bottom line: Big Mac",

Some stuff had to be left out, of course... too many of the significant also-rans are alive and wealthy. So compromises are palpable. But that in itself is a significant achievement ,like getting shades of grey past a black&white censorial lens. Steve Jobs (the film) uses colour, and the lack of it, pace (fast, slow, timestop, flashback), sensitivity, anger, stupidity and brilliance. Imperfection in this movie just illustrates the flaws in its subject. And that is the point.... how to be brilliant, despite your flaws. Danny and Steve, both.",

The entire movie is centered on three launch days. On these three days, events that took place over years magically happen on the same day. I realize that it's a movie and not meant to be history, but this technique has the effect of turning each launch day into a laborious, overwrought string of dramatic yelling and overacting. It was honestly hard to stand - I just wanted the thing to end.I have no idea how accurate it is, if at all. Its one saving grace is the acting done by the three girls who played Lisa - they all looked like the same girl at different ages, and were all great. As for Steve Jobs himself, he comes off as so intolerable I can't imagine anyone dealing with him. If that's how he was in real life, then this movie is in a sense exactly what it should have been - painful to watch.",

Written by Aaron Sorkin, now officially an expert in scripting biopics of computer geeks with big egos, Steve Jobs, like its protagonist, doesn't leave anything to chance. The actors are of top quality, the script and dialogue precise as clockwork, and the music and cinematography incredibly atmospheric. This movie is relentless, and despite its only action scene being that of Jobs doing stretches, it leaves the audience on the edge of their seats for over two hours. The only complaints I might have is that a few scenes are overly stylized, contrasting with the naturalistic acting, as well as Kate Winslet's atrocious Polish accent, but this is nit-picking.

    "review": "  VIEWS ON FILM review by Jesse BurlesonIf not for Danny Boyle's grainy, pronounced direction, the routine for Steve Jobs (my latest review) would grow rather tiresome. For the most part, this is a real ball breaker of a movie, a character study that aches and moans. Every scene is a frigid confrontation, every dramatis personae is a painstaking resolve, and every bit of dialogue written by Aaron Sorkin, strands of hurried validity (remember the jibber jabber in 2010's The Social Network?).Anyway, if you decide to take in a viewing of \"Jobs\", you'll be doing what other patrons (and actual extras for the film) will be doing, looking from the outside in. This closed-off production masked as cinematic agoraphobia, has performances in it that I would categorized as master class. You don't see the wheels turning in any trouper's head. Heck, you don't see anyone really acting at all (this is a compliment).Now Steve Jobs the movie, is about the non-fictional Steve Jobs, an American businessman and co-founder of Apple Inc. He died before he reached the age of 60, fathering a daughter he claimed wasn't his, creating a computer that could talk, and achieving a net worth of millions upon millions of dollars. The vehicle doesn't delve into his later years when his health declined (due to pancreatic cancer). And it doesn't give us a highlight reel of him inventing the iPod, iPhone, or iTunes. No this is a two-hour running time of Steve's life, spliced into three days within three different years (early 80's launch of the Apple Macintosh, 1988's launch of NeXT Computer, and 1998's premier of the iMac). Here, San Francisco's adopted son is portrayed as sullen and forthright, a miserable human being. He's the smartest a-hole in the room and he freaking knows it. In terms of casting, Michael Fassbender shines in the lead role, Kate Winslet is almost unrecognizable playing Steve's marketing director, Seth Rogen comes into his own as Steve's rival/erstwhile collaborator, and Jeff Daniels adds on to his dramatic chops (just like in The Martian) channeling Apple Inc.'s former CEO (John Sculley). In the realm of structure, there are some swift flashbacks towards the end (Jobs and his daughter revisit their lost moments), some longer flashbacks sprinkled throughout (everything happening before 1984), a complex screenplay that sort of recycles itself, and sequences where actors talk as if it's merely for sport. My favorite line is when Jobs quips, \"musicians play their instruments, I play the orchestra\". Slammer!All in all, this is Boyle's twelfth flick to date. It pays homage to Arthur C. Clarke, gives a good-natured ribbing to Mr. Bill Gates, and has an unconcerned sense of time and place. In my opinion, it was probably released too early this year (October 9th to be exact). Here's hoping the Academy voters don't ignore \"Jobs\", actor Michael Fassbender, and actress Kate Winslet come January (their work deserves surefire award nominations). Bottom line: Steve Jobs is lean, mean Oscar bait yet it doesn't promote it, it earns it. Dialogue-driven, frustrating, exhausting, and psychologically formidable, you can already put it on my list of 2015's best films. Rating: 3 and a half stars.",

At least this viewer did. The father daughter relationship, which should have been a slam dunk for me, felt manipulative and forced even though the young actresses playing the daughters were good. And I can't imagine why Kate Winslet said she just had to play her role, all she did was run around after Jobs calling, \"Steve! Steve!\" much the way she used to constantly call out \"Jack! Jack!\" in another well-remembered film, which is looking better in retrospect.",

The plot itself is structured very much like a 3-act play and seems to tie things up a little bit too neatly and tidily. One gets the impression that this is not a true to life portrayal of all the nuances of Jobs' complicated life.",

    "review": "  Amazingly executed. Well shot. Thrilling performances by Fassbender, but more so Winslet. The frenetic pacing of the film was brilliant because it reflected Jobs' frenetic mind. The only issue was that the staged quality of the film gives it the feeling of a play, almost. It's very artificial. Also, I would go so far as to say that this is not a biopic, but rather an artistic interpretation of Steve Jobs's life. That's how practically and stylistically removed from reality it is. Still, great film.",

    "review": "  Minutes before the launch of the Macintosh back in 1984, Jobs is agitated by the designer's inability to make the device say Hello. That unwarranted obsession in reality, was his passionate vision that became the legacy of the iCEO. Walter Isaacson captured the essence of the genius entrepreneur's journey from his garage up until his last days after the introduction of the Ipad 2. However, the adaptation by Andy Sorkin restricts our insight into the character and his legacy as it focuses more on his struggles as a reluctant father and as a failed CEO. Danny Boyle ('Slumdog Millionaire', '127 hours') had to extract the best out of Michael Fassbender and the supporting actors to capture our attention in this one-dimensional biography and with some sharp dialogues, they do have a riveting effect.The first among the three product launches in the film's narrative centers around the Macintosh and more importantly, Jobs' interaction with Chrisann (Katherine Waterston) and their daughter Lisa, whom he refuses to acknowledge as his own. Jobs' nonchalant and unkind mannerism towards his daughter makes complete sense when he is portrayed as a prick with the Apple team. Sorkin unabashedly focuses our attention to this side of Steve Jobs and offers little insight into the reason behind such behaviors. Adopted at an early age after being abandoned by his birth parents, Jobs' acrimony pretty much takes over the entire film's narrative. The first act also portrays his persistence for achieving the details that wouldn't really matter to the end user but they are primal in his vision. Just when Jobs was to appear on stage to unveil the Macintosh to the crowd, the director jumps to highlight the product's dismal sales performance that eventually led to Apple firing its very co-founder.Four years later, Jobs' interaction with Lisa about the perfect cube and her mother's negligent parenting is interrupted by Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), prompting him to prepare for a couple of meetings before he gets on stage to launch the ridiculously overpriced, NeXT Cube. In a heated scene, Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) warns him of the Cube's imminent failure due to its price and market, to which, Jobs pays little heed. Product aesthetics and end-to-end control were at the core of his products while Woz tried to alter his ways to make products successful by making them more changeable. If this argument was heated, then the five minutes with the 'Newsroom' star Jeff Daniels who plays Apple CEO John Sculley, is simply screen-scorching. One man tries to justify why he did what he had to while the other looks for closure from his past failure. His moments with a very concerned Joanna, reveal his broad intentions and astute business mind. The screenplay then jumps to the epic failure of the product that was renowned in the computing industry for years to come.Having been re-hired as then struggling Apple's CEO in 1998, Jobs is about to get on stage to unveil the industry shaking iMac but he must first confront Woz yet again and a grown up Lisa who now shares a much stronger bond with her father. The film closes on the triumphant turning point that would mark new beginnings for Jobs' career as an innovative CEO and for his bond with the daughter he has finally come to acknowledge.The iMac went on to become hugely successful and it laid the foundation for Apple Computers which then became the hub for industry changing innovations. Sadly, this tip of the iceberg is all that the film showcases about the iconic thinker and his company's successes. Sorkin and Danny Boyle take their creative liberties to not only dramatize the failures of Steve Jobs but also digress from Isaacson's book to lean into the one-dimensional portrayal of the struggling father, failed CEO and ungrateful friend. Such deviations and liberties are acceptable in biopics that don't have two hours of exciting material but ending the story about Steve Jobs back in 1998, just when the world started recognizing his true genius, is risky and honestly unfulfilling.Steve Jobs may have been a prick with his social skills but his intention was only to pursue the unthinkable and achieve the extraordinary with his team. Only the thick skinned folk around him survived his lashing and they turned out to be the successors of his legacy of crowd pleasing innovation. Michael Fassbender is genuinely, the film's stronghold. His performance is fierce in its sincerity to the portrayal, his understanding of Steve Jobs' passion behind innovating is depicted with the persistence that comes from a mature actor. He is quite straightforward being acrimonious and he makes it look totally normal. This should, at the very least, earn Fassbender a nomination for the best actor.Jeff Daniels comes to his best in the heated confrontation with Fassbender and the scene just electrifies with intensity. Seth Rogen is mostly himself but his disbelief of Jobs' stubbornness is what he plays all along while being supportive to his friend. Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy Hartzfeld portrays the recipient of Steve Jobs' lashing that result from his obsessive innovation standards.Kate Winslet balances the tension, frustration and precarious nature of her CEO but being bold enough to challenge him especially when it concerns his daughter Lisa. As Hoffman, she stands out as a tough woman in business and more so by her well maintained composure. Danny Boyle's captivating direction includes a variety of filters, lighting and close ups. Andy Sorkin's screenplay shows us his perspective of Steve Jobs which isn't completely fulfilling for those who would've preferred a complete insight into the character. However, the film is a riveting watch because of the powerhouse of performances especially from Michael Fassbender. This may not be the last film about the world's most talked about tech innovator and CEO and it very well shouldn't be. - 7.681 on a scale of 1-10.",

    "review": "  People have asked frequently what I thought of the film Steve Jobs, most of them expecting a long-winded, nuanced answer full of qualifiers, as is my custom. Everyone has been floored by my simple and firm response. It's fucking PERFECT. I have hesitated to pen this review for fear of sounding pedantic, fawning, or trite. But there is is no avoiding the inevitable. Steve Jobs is finest example of acting and screenwriting we are to receive this year. Period. This film takes a theatrical approach and delivers a variation of a traditional three-act play. Rather than try to take on the broad narrative of our protagonist's life story while worshipping Apple (as the overly hagiographic Jobs did a few years earlier), each act takes place directly before a public launch event. This particular choice is no accident, as Steve Jobs is widely recognized for being a master of theatrics and stagecraft. Steve Jobs is channeled in fine form by Michael Fassbender, who has quietly become the world's best underrated actor. His Jobs is deeply intelligent, narcissistic, manipulative, ambitious, and a committed and uncompromising strategist. It's no mistake that Steve silently looks upon a painting of Napoleon Bonaparte and ponders his future. We also see much of his philosophy and business strategy, such as accessibility over versatility, design over function, and aesthetics over hardware, to the chagrin of many of the supporting characters. Independent film queen Kate Winslet manages to issue great back-and-forth, rapid-fire dialog as Jobs' long suffering assistant. The direction by Danny Boyle is fantastic and micro-focused, not a scene wasted or needed. The script, curtesy of Aaron Sorkin, represents his best work since The Social Network and it's hard not to see the parallels in terms of the themes presented and the real life giants they tackle. One particular scene stood out to me in which Jobs and his former CEO, played by Jeff Daniels engage in a brutal argument. While most would see only two white guys in suits arguing in an empty room with a few chairs, I saw a vicious lightsaber duel to the death. The dialog give a no-holds barred gritty feel and the scene had me more tensed and riveted than any action movie thus year, save Mad Max: Fury Road. One might be tempted to call this ACTING: THE MOVIE.Other subplots proved to be rewarding as well, such as the odd relationship between Jobs and his daughter (three different actresses) which gives him a true arc by humbling him, forcibly, and bringing him full circle with his life decisions. He also shares a critical trait with the main characters of Citizen Kane, Raging Bull, and the Social Network in that the skills and abilities that make him succeed professionally, doom him in his personal life. Jobs even admits that he is \"poorly made.\" There are numerous other performances by character actors such as Seth Rogen that complete it so perfectly, but it would take another 3 paragraphs to do them justice. I can simply reiterate that Steve Jobs is lean, well-crafted masterpiece that deserves more attention and every award that it will be nominated for. See it. Absorb it. Think different.",

The format of the movie is unique (seeing Jobs before the launch of 3 different products) however it also means you basically see the same scene 3 times. I thought the movie almost read like a play with a small cast. The set pretty much stays the same and the characters just come on and off the stage. The movie did engage me and presented the complex character of Steve Jobs, however not too many lines or scenes really stuck with me and I remember feeling slightly unsatisfied when leaving. Definitely worth a view even if it's just for the performances.",

Crafted with reverence to the subject matter, yet bold in its truthfulness in the messages it sets to share.

It focuses mostly on his relationship with the daughter used to deny and his relationship with Apple -- him hiring Scully, and then Scully kicking him out, and how he returned.

An almost completely unlikeable character* is made extraordinarily compelling, both on the page and in an award-worthy performance by Michael Fassbender. I could watch the characters in STEVE JOBS all day.However, as a biopic, it is openly contemptuous of its subject. Charisma aside, it makes no bones about the fact that it thinks Jobs was a terrible boss and a terrible father. (I invariably got in right when Jobs started NeXT, so it's possible he is shown to be good at something in the first half.) As a reflection of reality, it's disgusting in its hypocrisy. It spends at least half an hour in an ongoing argument between Jobs and Steve Wozniak about whether Jobs should acknowledge the legacy of the Apple II, coming down hard against Jobs' refusal to do so. Unfortunately, it fails to acknowledge that while Jobs was a terrible father to his first, out-of-wedlock daughter (which is true), he also had three other kids, with another woman, his wife, to whom he was by all accounts very good.This one-sided contempt while presenting its own point of view as a more complete picture of reality disgusts me. See it for the movie. Avoid it for the moralizing hypocrisy.*I didn't get to see the first 3/4 hour or so, so I don't know if it tried to make him likeable in there. Also now you know that I didn't see the whole movie, so do with this review what you want.",

Before the unveiling of whatever new technology exists within the scene, Jobs has various frustrating arguments with people in his life. It starts and ends on this note, essentially, with almost the whole plot based on those few moments before he is about to go on stage. It hardly gets into his interest in Buddhism and Hinduism, and only has a few scenes of the very beginning of what led to one of the most important people in the last century.The acting, enthusiastic response from the crowd as they awaited him to walk on stage, and basic plot was interesting enough, but it hardly got into depth in who this person was. Much like after watching Kerouac, I do not see him as a anything more than a megalomaniac after watching this. It's a very surface film, mainly focusing on his relationships. I am not even a techie, but living in the Northwest I have friends who are, and some who possibly even rubbed elbows with Jobs, so I expected a bit more insight into this world I feel so distant from. On this note, it failed. The dramas are enough to draw in most, as well as the decent camera work, but overall this is hardly an insight into this persons life. One of the main components of Jobs interest in computers was each individual having the ability to acceess what Jobs considered the greatest tool yet conceived. It only touched on this brilliant idea, and its portrayal of the man put him in a very unfavorable light.",

Fassbender is always good, but he did not draw in this audience member, as I didn't find any human qualities about his portrayal of Jobs that made me want to make a personal connection. Jobs' well-known arrogance and straight out abusive behavior for those most close in his life are once again in the fore front, but not in a way that make you empathize with his suffering. The film repeatedly references this through his discussions with Scully (Jeff Daniels- who is excellent in this role), but does not do enough to support a human connection to the little boy who never feels parental love. Instead, I found myself ever more anxious and agitated both by the film's myopic views via the lens of each launch, and the seeming lack of growth or ability for emotional growth in this main character, and man who changed much of our own worlds. Seth Rogen is terrific as Wozniak, and brings some humanity to the relationship between what was two friends and partners. Kate Winslet is good- but the party doesn't allow much room for her to showcase much of her talent.

    "review": "  STEVE JOBS, whatever else it may be, exists as a spectacular showcase for (primarily) two people - its writer, Aaron Sorkin, and its leading man, Michael Fassbender. Sorkin's script is perhaps the most Sorkiny thing he's yet written (which is really saying something), as it presents characters operating at an incredibly high level of verbal dexterity, and the result is simply a joy to behold, not merely a great screenplay, but an extraordinary screenplay. The dialogue is dense and rapid fire, giving the movie a feeling of breathless pace, no small accomplishment for a story mostly featuring people talking in rooms, the characterization of the title character is deeply complex and nuanced, and the narrative structure is fascinating and allows the audience to truly see this set of characters change over the course of 14 years (the structure also allows each of the three primary acts to reflect and echo each other in compelling and affecting ways). Director Danny Boyle does fine work in giving each of the acts its own visual and editorial flavor, but he also doesn't indulge in flamboyance for the sake of it; at its heart, this is a screenplay that could easily be adapted for the stage, and Boyle wisely respects that and doesn't mess too much with it trying to impart stylistic tics. As Jobs, Fassbender graces us with perhaps his finest performance to date, an instantly iconic portrait of a complicated, difficult, and visionary man who seemed to operate on a higher level than just about everyone else around him. There's a passion and keen intellect brought to the role by Fassbender that by all rights should see him highly praised come awards season; it is the performance of the year thus far. He's backed up by a host of (nearly) equally fine performances, particularly those from Kate Winslet (somehow being both totally harried and yet utterly in total control), Seth Rogen (shockingly affecting and affable), Michael Stuhlbarg (perhaps the movie's secret comedic weapon), and Jeff Daniels (an equally weary and optimistic father figure). I think there's a very real possibility some could view the film as \"boring,\" since its entire focus is in people simply having conversations, but I found it electrifying and exciting at all times, and to watch such sharp minds spar with each other is truly a pleasure. STEVE JOBS is the most cerebral movie of 2015 and - therefore - one of the best.",

This movie is not just about Jobs but also his dynamic, complicated relationships with talented people that all made the Apple phenomenon. Sorkin choreographs the script capturing that dynamic and theme (not history), making you want to go read the real story if you haven't already. I think more highly of Jobs than before and I'm NOT a hero worshipper. Read between all of Sorkin's lines. This is an amazingly well crafted film.",

Not sure if that matters here, but this is the only Steve Jobs movie I have seen even though it is the third. There's a lot to like about Steve Jobs the movie, but there is also plenty I didn't. First the good lies in a great job by this cast, I mean I think they nailed their performances. This is a talkie for sure and it is put together pretty well with a splash of back story that remains interesting somewhat. I say somewhat because after a while I felt like I was watching Grounghog Day. You know that movie where the same thing keeps happening over and over. This movie has three acts, around the launch of three Steve Jobs lead products, and we get the same scenarios with the same people all three times. I think it's unique in how to tell his story, but after a while I grew tired of it. I'm not sure you can watch this thing and not come away from it thinking Steve Jobs is a giant pain in the rear. It's a well put together movie, but just didn't resonate with me the way I had hoped.",

Aaron Sorkin can be one of the most engaging and brilliant writers when he's on his game, but it can get to his head sometimes. Every major character in this movie is smart, quick-witted, and fast-talking, which makes them nearly indistinguishable from one another as people. There is no room for subtlety, nuance, or reflective silence. It all seems like it's just a bunch of Aaron Sorkins walking around talking to each other very quickly, and considering that this is supposed to paint a portrait of a real man, it only succeeds in leaving the viewer with the impression that he -- Steve Jobs -- acted like an Aaron Sorkin character.",

The film doesn't lend itself to being all that much to look at. Fassbender is at the center of it all, and is really the propeller for all other movement. He all motion with little to no stillness. So where are the subtleties? Jeff Daniels does great in what feels like his character from Newsroom. Kate Winslet bangs out a great east european hint of accent. Seth Rogen is the true revelation, nailing a dramatic role that no one could have expected. Newcomer, Perla Haney-Jardine as daughter Lisa get the show stopping applause line.

    "review": "  A powerful and thought-provoking film, Steve Jobs accomplishes everything it's trying to accomplish. Taking place over the course of 14 crucial years in the life of one of history's greatest innovators, Steve Jobs takes the smart approach towards encompassing such a life through three well-connected and powerful acts to examine the flawed man behind all complex wiring. Danny Boyle's fabulous direction and Aaron Sorkin's timely and entertaining script, coupled with the film's three act structure of product unveilings, create a modern Shakespearean drama of epic proportions, driven by characters and dialogue which could all be the Bard's work. Michael Fassbender's performance as Jobs is astounding and Oscar-worthy, portraying the man as more of a robot or machine who isn't compatible with other human beings. His transformation over the course of the film is hard to see at times on account of Fassbender's excellent work to make him a character you only sometimes root for. With the impressive supporting cast of Kate Winslet as Job's sympathetic and flustered assistant, Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak, the Lennon to Jobs' McCarthy who Jobs treats like his Ringo and Jeff Daniels as John Scully, the man who helped Jobs become what he is but had to turn his back on him. As a character study and film, Steve Jobs is a journey of understanding which brings you closer to the man and away from the myth.",

    "review": "  Watching the STEVE JOBS biopic directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin was a nostalgic experience, bringing me back in time to 1992 when I purchased my first Apple Computer which regretfully turned out to be a \"rotten apple with so many problems that Apple's headquarters sent a technician to my home in NJ to change the \"motherboard.\" This was the \"dark phase\" of the company when it was on the downswing - the percentage of Apple users were declining and IBM's P.C.'s were on the rise. Because my \"mentor\" was a rabid supporter - never wavering in his belief in Steve Jobs and Apple products, I too followed his lead despite the fact that Jobs was not with the company having been \"fired\" in 1985. The film STEVE JOBS gives us a glimpse into the man who today is considered a visionary having changed the way we communicate and navigate the world.I once wrote a Letter to the NY Times extolling the power of film \"... to re-vise, re-invent and re-position history and historical figures within popular culture... Too often ideas, whether they be political or cultural, permeate into the general consciousness through the membrane of a director...\" And this holds true for director Danny Boyle's depiction of Steve Jobs. There is a frenetic pace to the film - and Boyle uses the moments before the presentation of new products to an audience of devotees as a vehicle \"exposing\" the complexity of Steve Jobs' personal and professional history. The dramatic focus of the movie STEVE JOBS hinges upon 3 major \"computer launch\" events - the original Macintosh in 1984 in competition with the Apple II - the commercial bedrock of the company; the unveiling of NeXT cube in 1988 - what it did is still a mystery; and the beautifully designed iMac in 1998 - the start of the innovational \"iEra\". The products were an extension of the man himself - a person who controlled every aspect of his brand - obsessively committed and singleminded - never one to compromise - as witnessed by his battles with childhood friend and co-founder Steve Wozniak - Seth Rogan doing a great job as this decent, burly \"nuts and bolts\" man who actualizes Jobs' idealistic concepts. Michael Fassbender is excellent as Jobs - cool, detached and charismatic encased in armor that is rarely penetrated except by the always-by-his side assistant Joanna Hoffman (a staid and respectful Kate Winslet with a weird undertone of an accent) and his daughter Lisa, (whose paternity he once renounced,) - a pivotal character functioning as a catalyst and humanizing foil to the self-absorbed and fervid Jobs.There is a claustrophobic feel to the film - an undercurrent of acute tension created by Job's contentious and truculent interactions with his colleagues and family; the need to micro-manage every one of life's moments leaving no room for respite - we the audience suffer from the lack of air. I also left the theater wondering WHAT exactly did Jobs do as co-founder of Apple Inc.outside of being a genius marketing promoter?  I recommend reading Walter Isaacson's authorized biography of Steve Jobs, particularly after seeing a movie which gives you a narrow, surface view of an impassioned man who deserves to be seen more fully to understand his historical importance as that rare individual whose accomplishments touched people all over the globe. Regrettably STEVE JOBS gives very little inkling of the man who anticipated much of the 21st century's technological innovations.",

Some have said that this was an unsympathetic film, taking a hard look at his relationships with his Apple compatriots and his daughter. I say the viewpoint taken is far too sympathetic. I'm still waiting for the movie that depicts Steve Jobs as the master of others' ideas, whose main skill was to commercialize something around his own cult of personality and call it his own inspiration, and whose life reflects the worst of humanity. Otherwise, Fassbender gives a barely believable performance as Jobs, while Seth Rogan hits it out of the park with his portrayal of Steve Wozniak and Jeff Daniels plays himself as John Scully so damn well.

This is not a straightforward biopic; it is a challenging film, and not for the lazy ass who prefers the conventional Hollywood storytelling.

But more to the point this is a movie about some of the decision making of Steve Jobs as told through vignettes from minutes before three different product launches ... the Mac, the Next and the iMac.The movie has the typical Aaron Sorkin patter which is what really drew me to see yet another Steve Jobs story and in this regard, doesn't disappoint, However the story telling is a bit artsy for Sorkin and I don't think he quite carried it off as well as his previous endeavors. Additionally, this movie is more of a potential insight into the character (or lack thereof) of Steve Jobs rather than a real bio-pic. While the casting is great and all do terrific performances, I don't feel that they were remotely true to the characters they were playing. Rather is seems they were asked to play aspects of facets of Steve Jobs life and given familiar name tags (having met Steve Wozniak some time ago, I can attest he was never as well spoken as Seth Rogan).This is an enjoyable movie from the standpoint of the dialogue which one expects from Aaron Sorkin, However in the end, the story itself reveals little and is somewhat muttled and confused leaving the viewer with little more than Steve Jobs was a hugely egotistical control-freak.

    "review": "  Steve Jobs is a triumphant, energetic, fast moving look at 3 days in the life of an arguable genius. Like Aaron Sorkin's previous script about an asshole genius (The Social Network), the titular character doesn't come across as all roses and sunshine. Indeed, he is difficult, rude, and oblivious to the effect he has on people. He is also insanely smart, passionate, and a huge perfectionist. Fassbender has impressed me with pretty much every role he has played in his career so far. With Steve Jobs, he tops that all. He makes Jobs a complex person who knows what he has to do, even at the peril of others. It helps that Fassbender is surrounded by a cast who are just as game as he is. Rogen is great, slightly against type, and some of the best scenes of the movie involve Jeff Daniels' Apple CEO John Scully and Jobs going head to head. Special attention, though, should be given to Kate Winslet who plays Jobs' right hand and is often tasked with the awful Job of cleaning up in Steve's wake. Props, too, should be given to director Danny Boyle who's electric direction drive this movie at 100mph at all times. Seriously, I need to see the movie again, as there was so much going on that is was hard to always have a 100 percent grasp on everything. Finally, major, major props should be given to Sorkin's screenplay which is concise but complex and always blindingly intelligent. As it stands, Steve Jobs is a brilliant movie about a brilliant, difficult genius who may have ushered in the age we live in.",

Painting their subject in a less than savory light, viewers may be surprised to find how little sympathy this film attempts towards Steve Jobs (aside from a fairly goopy conclusion), but there in lies the film's strongest card. It's a vivid character study, with the unmistakable Sorkin dialogue and Boyle visuals visible really allowing it to resonate, and the film's play-like approach to the acts (all three represent a different iconic launch in his life) certainly gives it prestige points.

    "review": "  Cast, director, and writer turn three product launches into hefty battles of words. Sorkin's dialogue is on point, except when he has Steve Jobs turn into a busy body and makes people follow him through hallways as they talk. This makes it seem less like a biopic, but it still has really strong acting and direction from Danny Boyle. The result is a stimulating look at a brilliant marketer who would literally change the faces of personal computers, also with some added subplots about his estranged daughter. Even though you'd think the subject matter would bore you, the way its presented makes it engaging and engrossing.",

    "review": "  \"Steve Jobs\" is a character study about the co-founder of Apple Computers and his nuanced personalities. The film finds him on the verge of releasing his latest prototype, and the film is a dramatization of the different aspects of his life and what makes him tick. The acting in this movie is top-notch. Kate Winslet shines as the foil in the movie to Michael Fassbender's Jobs, and even Seth Rogen shows his versatility as an actor. The acting is fine. Where this movie gets dicey is the execution. There are too many thematic elements in the movie, and the movie is largely melodramatic. There are too many monologues, which make the movie extremely maudlin and tedious. The movie moves at too fast a clip and consists largely of arguments Jobs had with people around him. The movie doesn't do nearly enough to focus on Jobs' accomplishments but rather paints him as a whiney, self-righteous little dipshit. I had high expectations for this movie. I wouldn't mind some acting nominations, but this movie is nowhere near best picture material for me --------------------------------------------------------------------- C+",

Michael Fassbender is on his usual stellar game as Steve Jobs and Kate Winslet is also her usual fantastic self as Joanna Hoffman, his lifetime confidant. It's a 3-act film, set up by 3 major products launches by Jobs (Macintosh, NeXT and iMAC.

    "review": "  According to the most recent of several Apple-founder biopics, Steve Jobs the man (Fassbender) was a delusional, self-absorbed pioneer with a God-complex to end all god-complexes. He was a less-than-fun dude, to say the least. I'm also hyper-aware that the thoughts I had on his faulty and fruitful life were being noted on a device that he created, one that 40 years ago would've taken up a large conference room and now fits in my pocket. These huge revelations have become his legacy...but should they have? Fassbender, Boyle and writer Sorkin, each among the best at their jobs, propose that Steve's professional successes may have been the cause of his personal flaws.The plot is a screenwriting construction; set during three different product launches and the minutes that lead up to them, Jobs (barely) tries to balance his two children, the more important his current product. The entire film is Sorkin's patented \"walking-and-talking\" trademark, yet never drags even at its 2+ hours length. Director Boyle, while relatively restrained, finds plenty of appropriate moments to display his skill for visual pop. However, the main cinematic thrills all come from the dialogue, as if the words are explosions in an action movie. Some people criticize Sorkin (Social Network, \"West Wing\") because his dialogue doesn't feel natural, the rapacious repartee undercut by over-explanation, and moments standing out as feeling \"written\". However, I usually just find myself wishing my friends and I spoke the way he writes. Add in line-deliverers like Fassbender, Winslet, Rogen, Daniels, and Stuhlbarg, Jobs end result is a hypnotic and highly entertaining capsule of a man at the center of the computer generation.",

Of course this is better than the one with Ashton Kutcher but overall you can't put much from what people knew about Steve Jobs to a movie. The complexity life of Steve Jobs as we know he had a tough time. He has family problems and also knowing later he has an illness. He is a legendary as the movie describe him where I see that he never gives up his passion of simplicity of a computer. He wants to make a computer easy for people to use and then develop the state of the art portable music player and then the game changing phone that change the world. I will give this movie a 3.5 out of 5 stars because I think it needed more points of his story from start till the end rather the dragging. If you are an Apple fan and wanted to learn more about Steve Jobs then this is an interesting movie. I don't recommend this movie for everyone because it might put you to sleep.",

    "review": "  The above line, which is the character Steve Jobs' (Michael Fassbender) explanation for why the Macintosh computer at the unveiling in 1984, is his reasoning, and it's the first time we see him in the movie and his super-demanding-behind-the-scenes self. He has to have the computer say \"Hello\" to the audience that will assemble and see his prized innovation (which he didn't all innovate by the way, but neither here nor there, at least to Jobs), and it has to break down how people have been shown computer systems in Hollywood movies. His marketing manager cum surrogate mother, Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) remarks, \"The computer in 2001 said hello, too. It scared the s*** out of me.\" There's another moment, a key one in a big, meaty exchange (what else does Sorkin love doing more) between Jobs and Wozniak in the auditorium in front of everybody, where Wozniak mentions that his products are better than the man who made them. Jobs agrees. Who is this a-hole? Our hero? Sort of, I guess.Aaron Sorkin once again gives us a guy who is a super-driven, I'll-do-it-MY-way-if-I-have-to self-professed genius, and perhaps it's hard to not think of Sorkin's Oscar-winning script for The Social Network with his version of Mark Zuckerberg (whether he really is or not I leave up to you dear reader). I could make a very long blog post showing the differences, but I think it comes down to something more elemental: Social Network is about friendship, or what would-be friendship is and as it breaks down (or wasn't there to start), and Steve Jobs is about marriages. Jobs's marriage to Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marriage to Steve Wozniak, Jobs' marriage to Sculley, and even his sort of marriage to Any Herzfeld. But what about the woman who birthed his daughter (\"She's not my daughter\" he exclaims in 1984, and is one of the major conflicts of the film), or being a father to his daughter? And like marriages - till death do us part sort of thing - the same arguments and same old BS gets pulled up over and over again, even as technology changes and people age and move on to other companies.So we get three time frames here, which is clever until it becomes a little contrived. That sounds contradictory, but what I mean to say is that on the one hand, Sorkin and director Danny Boyle get to show something that a lot of biopics don't bother with when they go for the 'rise and fall' scenario - Jobs starts out at a point that is remarkable in 1984, about to launch the Macintosh computer, but with people all around him trying to get him to be... decent, to do the right things, to not keep doing s***y things (the Time magazine article, the Dylan lyrics signifying something, the mention for the Apple 2 people, the threat to Andy on the voice), and we see Steve interacting with everybody in the format that is what it is, a Backstage Melodrama. And yet we see the same arguments basically take place in 1988 and 1998. It IS the 'hard' parts of business/creative/personal \"marriages\". In short, this may or may not sound appealing.I feel like I may need to see the movie again for certain little things; I'm still not fully sold that the ending (or at least the final five/ten minutes, his resolution with Sculley and Lisa) don't dip more than a bit into making this character sympathetic - and I don't mean that as a bad thing, but that it feels shallow in a certain way, as in 'we've spent all this time telling you this guy's a d***, many times over, but... maybe he's deep down a really good guy.' On the other hand, it may not be that clear, and as I think on the movie there's ambiguity to certain moments and scenes, and that's what sticks with me and makes me interested to see it again.There's one little scene, where Jobs is talking to himself, softly, and repeating technical details on the iMac. Is he talking to himself to rehearse the lines - the actor as well as the \"player of the Orchestra\" as he puts it to Wozniak as what he *does*, which is still slightly vague by film's end aside from the aesthetic side - or is he genuinely concerned to get the tech stuff right, a nerd underneath the sleek exterior? Sorkin, I should mention again, loves gigantic, monumental confrontation scenes the way Ninja Turtles loves pizza; there are more than a few in this film, and a couple of them (Jobs and Sculley in 1988, Jobs and Wozniak in 1998) are the kind that become borderline too much to watch - the cutting back and forth in time is what makes it jarring in a good way, making the psychology and points of view distinct and interesting - but it's almost like Sorkin can't help himself, no restraint in the slightest. Nevertheless, Boyle and the producers got such a top shelf cast that even if this stuff was theatrical-grandstanding I'd be riveted. Fassbender, Winslet, Daniels, Waterston, and for sure Rogen (he's proved himself dramatically before, in Take This Waltz, and here he does it again) all pull off performances that make these words come alive and, really, human all around.What I mean by that last thing is that, it's one thing to read Sorkin's words - he writes what he does, and you'll know it by know from Social Network or his TV shows - but what Fassbender does here is incredible. If there's sympathy that Jobs gets, it's not so much in the writing as it is through just him, finding that pulse beneath the cold 'genius'. And Winslet's Joanna as the 'conscience' is spectacular, and often because she's just the one trying to keep things moving/together. Jobs needs that - how else will he give any kind of 'face' ala the computer screen?",

    "review": "  The acting in this film from everyone was honestly great, but that was it. Steve Jobs was such a remarkable mind, yet none captured that magic in the film. Apple is iconic and always will be for multiple reasons and I wanted to see the how he made it happen. Was he mind mapping, sketching or bouncing ideas constantly to come up with what he did. I wanted to see something inspiring that in years to come I would watch again because it moved me. The film felt negative and just sad once again. It would have been nice to have seen the positive side. The last film didn't really capture the visionary he was either although they did include the how on a couple things but still missing that effortless creation. Everyone knows that side of Steve Jobs already, and it would have been great to see and learn something different and embody hope for all the dreamers whom aspire to create.",

No, this is not a documentary, that was secretly filmed back stage while other events were taking place. It is a movie. It happens to be very well made, and poignant. It evokes a sense of time, and place. It is worth seeing, even if you are not a Steve Jobs or Apple fan. The Steve Jobs portrayed is not a saint, he is not even likable at times, but he is human, and that is what makes this movie great!",

    "review": "  Steve Jobs is the next attempt at a Steve Jobs autobiography directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin. When this movie was first announced, I was really not interested. I had just seen 2013's Jobs and was not impressed. So, the idea of yet another one did not seem very appealing to me. But, then when Michael Fassbender was cast and I realized that Aaron Sorkin was the writer, I began to form high hopes. My expectations were exceeded in this unique and brilliant biography. Danny Boyle further proves himself as a wonderful director. Aaron Sorkin also has crafted an amazing screenplay with fantastic dialogue. Michael Fassbender gives one of the best performances in his career. He floored as Steve Jobs. Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels, Seth Rogen, and Michael Stuhlbarg were all also fantastic. There is s much to love in this film, but, like most film, there is that one teeny tiny flaw that keeps it from being a masterpiece. The fact that all of the people in his life seem to decide to let out their feelings towards Steve Jobs before every major product launch. Although, this didn't bother me and shouldn't keep you from loving this movie. Overall, Steve Jobs is a near perfect film ith fantastic writing, acting, and directing.Rating: A",

But Fassbender captures the angst, the genius, and in something I truly didn't expect was able to humanize Steve more than anyone could've expected. Seth Rogen, in my humble opinion is the man to beat for best supporting actor, as he turns in an incredible performance as Steve Wozniak; and not to be outdone Kate Winslet shows that she's still capable of delivering incredible performances of her own; playing in many ways Steve's conscience in the film as Joanna Hoffman. Every bit as captivating as The Social Network, Steve Jobs is an absolute triumph.",

    "review": "  First off, if you are going to make a movie that is NOT a biopic, and that relies on accounts of events that are NOT true, but rather are indicative of what might have happened or been said, then don't make the title of the project \"Steve Jobs\". Call it something else. That being said, the movie is extremely disappointing. The title character did amazing things in his, too short, lifetime. He was amazing because he saw the huge potential in transforming clunky giant computers like you'd see at Mission Control just before lift-off, into person-scaled electronic appliances that could facilitate human creativity in almost unimaginable ways. He imagined it and he made it happen, AND he started out IN A GARAGE! Add to that fact that he was adopted, that he dropped out of a small college where he studied calligraphy, that he was a hippie, that he eventually ended up being one of the most famous people of his era, and you have endless material for a book or a movie.Yet . . . what I watched in the theater this past weekend was a tiny snapshot of someone who was bitter and angry. Creative? Clever? Visionary? Nope . . . those traits, though apparent in non-fictional accounts of Jobs, didn't fit the narrative Aaron Sorkin decided to write. Fassbender was fine, Winslet was fine, Daniels was . . . fine. Everyone did fine work. Danny Boyle, even though he was forced to direct in a sort of a creative strait-jacket, also was fine. I have no problem with Sorkin creating characters in his work that convey personal inner-narratives or revealing aspects of the human condition. Many great films have gone into the father figure area: Santini, Corleone, even Vader! And Sorkin's track record certainly seems to indicate that he has a knack for dissecting the psychological landscapes of father figures and their influence on their sons. That's great, he should certainly explore that motif with gusto. But I can't help but feel that, in this case, he took advantage of an extremely well-known figure.",

The performances are uniformly fantastic, with Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet as the Oscar-worthy standouts and Seth Rogen proving once and for all that he's more than \"that stoner guy\" with a turn that's equal parts funny, frustrated, bitter and soulful. Tying it all together is director Danny Boyle, lending a story that's otherwise an entirely dialogue-centric 3-act play a cavalcade of visual style and pulsing kinetic energy. Acolyte of the cult of Jobs or not, this is a hands-down absolute must-see that I'm already itching to see again and again.",

I was longing to see his genius as a product designer and visionary. The movie did not express the most fascinating part of this man.What a shame.

Aaron Sorkin and Danny Boyle's overcast sketch of Apple's late co-founder overcompensates in the opposite direction. In the quest to show the tumultuous thunderstorms forever brewing inside a calculating, alienating tech wunderkind, the central character's unrelenting chill becomes both implausible and a detriment to a story that should have been a slam-dunk connection. Like the man who says he plays the orchestra, Steve Jobs is certain of its virtuosity, determined to stay on its dreary path at all costs. Michael Fassbender will net a best actor nomination, but the incomplete story and narrow, bleak lens limit his opportunities to shine the way he could have.It was impossible, as the final scene at the 1998 iMac launch faded to black, to ignore the protestations from Jobs' colleagues and associates who have decried the film's portrayal of him as inaccurate. Sorkin called the movie a painting, not a photograph. The problem: He and Boyle needed a Da Vinci, and they didn't create one.",

We were so saddened by his untimely death and often have pondered what amazing things he might have done had he lived for another three decades as so many of us are lucky to do these days. Of course, I had known about his early years. When you are as famous as Steve Jobs is, when your products are so well-loved and ubiquitous, there aren't a whole lot of secrets about you after awhile. But I was looking forward to seeing his life, or at least a part of it dramatized.My wife and I walked out before the end. This movie is so unpleasant, so strangely myopic, especially when considering the complexity of the subject, so tedious, so over the top VERBAL (yes, we expect that from Sorkin, but he was, after all writing a film not about himself, but at Jobs, and as everyone knows because we've all seen the clips and the documentaries, Jobs was not like that). The movie was so narrowly imagined, and, may I emphasize imagined here because so many aspects of the film did not gel with facts that even older members of the public like myself, know to be true. I wanted to know where his other family was. His wife and his three kids. Why was there no mention of them at all if this was a movie about the man and his relationships. And if it was simply a movie about him and his daughter Lisa, then one has to consider that Lisa lived with the family throughout high school and part of eight grade if I recall. I read about the ending. IT MAKES NO SENSE! How could Steve and Lisa have a reconciliation back stage at a product launch when they were living together! ABSURD!. Shame on Sorkin. Shame on Rudin. Shame on Universal for promoting complete falsehoods under the name of a human being we all know so much about. Do you think we are idiots? I hope this movie flops.",

The two hours goes by too quickly but the story ends in a place where you feel satisfied that you have had a glimpse into Jobs's life. After watching the movie, I read that much of the movie was more artistic interpretation that was based on facts. I would recommend this film. I am giving it 3.5 stars. I am not sure why I do not think it is a 4 star movie. Perhaps because I read all of the really positive reviews and my expectations were very high going into the movie. The movie does a nice job of showing Jobs as a person, a cult leader, a business leader and a technology pioneer. I found the relationship with his daughter and John Scully to be equally as fascinating for very different reasons. On the one hand, it was interesting to watch Job develop and to mature as a father and on the other hand it was interesting to see how Jobs and Scully interacted on many different levels. At times it was hard to figure out who was the mentor and who was the student between Jobs and Scully. The ending was fairly \"Hollywood\" without going over the top. You are left with the impression that Jobs has figured it out. \"it\" being his work and his relationship with his daughter Lisa.",

While the plot basically just bounces between different presentations he was involved in, they managed to put the backstory throughout each of these. Seth Rogen as Wozniak was decent too but Fasbender was just a very good Jobs. Much better than Kutcher.",

    "review": "  In this extremely intense film ( the audience MUST pay attention in order to keep up !!) Jobs is depicted as a genius visionary who was the ultimate at \"playing the orchestra\". He's also depicted (simultaneously) as a dictator who could push even fellow geniuses ( such as Steve Wozniak) up and above the breaking point. He's also having a complicated relationship (or lack or relationship) with his daughter and her mother who's depicted as someone unstable. There's a lot goin' on and I would have preferred a 3 hour film that shows most of his life, as it is, it starts in 1984 and ends in 1998. If you want more about Jobs read an accurate bio. I'm not sure, but it seems to me the negative parts of his personality were exaggerated here for dramatic effect, but the screenplay by Sorkin is still brilliant, and it's clear to me Michael Fassbender is one of the 5 greatest actors in the world today. His performance will blow your mind.",

    "review": "  The movie should have been named, \"Steve Jobs - Dramatic Backstage Moments\".If you're expecting a biopic, based on Walter Isaacson's book with the same title you'll be very disappointed - despite the opening credits stating that it's based on that book.This film was a narrowly focused, tedious, verbose, showcase of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin's tremendous need to hear himself speak. And he got Boyle, Fassbender, and everyone else to buy into it. Yuck.The theme of the movie was how incredibly flawed and downright dark Jobs was towards his daughter. It's really, actually hard to watch.No scenes of Jobs' childhood, college years, home, wife, son, iPhone, illness - none of it. All we get is endless amounts of Sorkin's bloviating between Jobs and Hoffman. Not fun, not interesting, not informative - just a lot of the same.And we see no happy moments. Really, none. It gives new meaning to the word \"film negative\".There was much more to the man than this movie shows. It's a disservice.The Ashton Kutcher movie, \"Jobs\" is now considered with a new appreciation. Looking back, I actually really enjoyed it!p.s. Spoiler alert - and I put it at the bottom in the hope that I DO spoil it for you. It's worth spoiling. Save your time and go see \"The Martian\" again. smile emoticon",

Michael Fassbender awes as Jobs in one of his most powerful performances yet, perfectly blending the man's egregious persona with his more intimate doubts and eccentric character. Other standout portrayals include Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak, showing he has the talent outside of his stoner schtick, Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, in one of her more engaging performances in years, and Jeff Daniels as John Scully, demonstrating once again why he is one of the more underrated actors working today. Overall, a towering film thats only flaw is its unfulfilling ending, but that's probably how Jobs would have wanted it; leave the audience clamoring for more. 4/5",

    "review": "  In his biography on Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs, Walter Isaacson frequently gave accounts depicting Jobs as impervious to empathy. Isaacson correctly suggested that this characteristic could make Jobs intolerable to his subordinates, but aided his success in turning Apple from near insolvency to the most valued company in the world. In this dramatization, by writer Aaron Sorkin and director Danny Boyle, the filmmakers are committed to portraying Jobs as sympathetic by concocting a phony redemptive story thereby diminishing his achievements. It takes place during a series of important product launches during the ten years that included Jobs being terminated by Apple followed by his return to become CEO. Most of the action is set backstage at the San Francisco Symphony Hall, amidst squabbles between Jobs and his family plus associates. Boyle directs in the standard Sorkin walk and talk style with numerous Steadicam tracking shots, but the pacing lags at times and there are moments when the editing is distractingly disjointed. Sorkin is great at sophisticated repartee, but his depiction of the estranged relationship between Jobs and his daughter is overwrought psychobabble. When Jobs confides to his daughter that his haughtiness is the result of being 'poorly made,' the scene isn't affecting as intended it's just embarrassing. It's also disappointing there isn't a stronger sense given on what made Jobs and his products so popular and innovative. As Jobs, Michael Fassbender is grandiose, imperious, disparaging. He never goes soft even when the material does. Kate Winslet is compelling in an enhanced role as a marketing executive and forthright confidant to Jobs. Seth Rogen is quietly impressive as Steve Wozniak. With Jeff Daniels, Katherine Waterston, Michael Stuhlbarg.",

    "review": "  There's something to be said for a film without special effects, big set pieces, or action scenes, and still is captivating from beginning to end. Steve Jobs is one of the most important figures in our generation, if not the most. While I'm typing this review there's a commercial for the new IPhone 6S, the man's imprint is everywhere at all times. But to me he's always been a bit of a mystery. Everything from his relationship with his supposed daughter to the broken friendship and partnership between him and Wozniak has fascinated me. Although this film may not tell the whole story, it tells one hell of one. With the best screenplay of 2015 and tremendous performances all around, Steve Jobs is one of the best films of the year. With an incredible end product, it's hard to remember all the troubles this film had behind the scenes. With the shuffling of directors, lead actors, and even studios, for awhile it seemed unlikely this film was ever going to get made. Foe what it's worth, I would have loved to see what Christian Bale would have done with Jobs, but Fassbender proved to be a strong choice. He doesn't look much like Jobs at all, but he seemed to capture his mannerisms and his presence for this rendition of jobs. Credit should also be given to the terrific ensemble cast. Kate Winslet held the film together as much as her character did her Jobs himself. Seth Rogen, who wouldn't normally associate himself with dramatic roles, gives a Jonah Hill in Moneyball like performance. I don't know if it will get him an Oscar nomination, but I think he may deserve one. Someone who may actually get one is Jeff Daniels, who plays John Sculley. Both him and Rogen have demanding roles and scenes several times throughout the film, and they always rise to the occasion.But I think the hero of this film is the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. The film is set up as 3 acts each right before an unveiling of one of Jobs' products. It's a structure that hasn't really been done before, but also proves to be very effective. It's jarring and even understandably annoying the first time they go to black as Jobs walks out on stage, but the material behind the stage is so interesting that you get used to it. The run-time is a brisk 120 minutes, but I could have watched 150 if they would have shown the presentations. Though we don't get a look into his products on the stage, we have youtube for that, we do get a new understanding of the man behind the products and it couldn't have been more fascinating. It's worth mentioning Danny Boyle's great work behind the camera as well, although I'm having a hard time dividing the credit between him and the brilliant screenplay of Sorkin. For nothing else, this film should be seen because of its sharp and intelligent dialogue and Oscar worthy performances.+Fassbender brings it+And so does everyone else in the cast+Give Sorkin the Oscar now+Boyle handles the structure well-Cut off some intriguing moments9.3/10",

Once again, he writes a tight, tense script, that highlights the most interesting moments in the life of the late \"Steve Jobs.\" Choosing very carefully, this is a very well-crafted biopic in the strangest way. Michael Fassbender is terrific in the title role and Jeff Daniels, Kate Winslet, and Seth Rogen (surprisingly) play off him extremely well. This is a character study and nothing more. Unlike the film \"The Social Network,\" which focussed on both the characters and the entire process of the creation of Facebook, \"Steve Jobs\" is even more dialogue driven, but it begins after Apple has been created. Danny Boyle definitely has his direction stamp on this one and it shines beautifully through the images on screen. Overall, \"Steve Jobs\" is a great ride for what it is, but nothing is all that exciting about it. I would give some nods to the writing and acting that this year's Oscars, but I think that is where the amazement ends. In the end, I had a great time with this film.",

    "review": "  There was so much hype about this movie, and I had such high hopes for this movie. So what happens? I walk out disappointed. First of all, I have no idea what was wrong with the Steve Jobs movie with Ashton Kutcher. Does the academy just pre-decide which actors and what movies will be nominated? Just as far as this movie goes, I thought it was going to focus more on the life of Steve Jobs. Instead, it more focused on Apple plunging at one point and then coming back as a successful company. Now, the last movie about Steve Jobs did not so much focus on the life story of Steve Jobs, but it showed how Apple got started. With this movie, I could not quite understand the storyline the makers of the movie had in mind. I cannot say that Michael Fassbender did a bad job in this movie, but I do not think that he was fit to play this role. I thought Ashton Kutcher did a better job. Kate Winslet did a pretty bad job in my opinion. Seth Rogen was fine, but I still saw him as a comedy in this movie. My point is that if you want me to give these actors a thumb up, they have to give me the willing suspension of disbelief. In other words, I do not want Michael Fassbender to try to play the role of Steve Jobs; I want to see him become the part like Bradley Cooper in American Sniper. All in all, I am not going to try to stop you from going to this movie because it might be up for a lot of awards. I just did not quite understand the big deal about this movie after I saw it.",

    "review": "  Almost everyone is aware of the influence that Apple and Steve Jobs has had on each of our lives -- as computers replaced typewriters and data-sharing blossomed into personal communications. Jobs' vision of meshed computers and ordinary phones gave us encyclopedic iPhones on-the-go and removed distance from the human interaction equation.Steve Jobs' revolutionary smart phones, tablets and laptops have changed our lives, and the way the world revolves, for the better. \"Steve Jobs\" the movie, however, only skims the surface of his significant life-changing contributions to your life and mine. It focuses less on one of the most forward-thinking and innovative souls in history, and more on the troubled perfectionist who had difficulty acknowledging--and even working with--others. It's fascinating to contemplate that the man credited with bringing people and businesses closer together on the planet, had a reputation for repelling others and not sharing credit.In one of 2015's strongest leading performances on film, Michael Fassbender effortlessly plays the narcissistic Silicon Valley high-tech pace-setter. As Jobs, Fassbender's fast-paced movements and quick tongue unveil a cold-hearted, ruthless friend and boss at a trio of historic product launches spotlighted in the film.It's at these dark, mostly anger-filled global announcements where viewers find themselves behind-the-scenes, standing between Steve Jobs and those at the receiving end of his bitterness and frustrations. The first twenty minutes of \"Steve Jobs\" is mind-blowing and quickly offers us an uneasy glimpse into the man behind the gadgets we use today.A rapid-fire script by proven screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, along with extended scenes using numerous characters, both underscore this story's troublesome look inside a creative mind that harbors serious personal flaws. After this stark revelation in \"Steve Jobs\" is apparent, the remaining part of the film becomes redundant and overwhelmingly anti-climactic.A sensational supporting cast, including notable performances by Seth Rogan and Kate Winslet, upgrade the operating system of Fassbender and Sorkin. Individually, they should provide enough terabyte memory to give \"Steve Jobs\" serious end-of-the-year award consideration. However, its stale plot and abrupt ending shouts continuous \"Downloading...\" to movie-goers, who find themselves waiting for the story to move further along.There's no argument that Steve Jobs was the conductor of the microcomputer orchestra. By \"inventing the future\" the self-admiring Apple leader changed the world. \"Steve Jobs\" takes the work he started in his parent's garage with computer-programming geek Steven Woznicak (Rogan), and launches those products under a barrage of tirades and ego stroking. The longer Jobs' personal faults are displayed in this film, the more viewers are left just wanting to see the next product rollout. A sad consequence for one of the most visionary minds of our lifetime.Grade: C+",

    "review": "  While there is greatness in this movie - performances, directing and movie structure in particular -�and successfully avoids the pitfalls of being just Apple fanboy fodder, as a whole it ends up being just a good movie that teases with overall greatness and comes nowhere near being \"insanely great.\" Michael Fassbender turns in an engrossing and deft performance as Steve, capturing Steve's drive for excellence in the computing world and his stumbling faults as a father and friend in the human world. Unfortunately the character lacks some of the soul of Steve -�his quirkiness and hippiness that also defined him and made his drive for excellence more than just excellence for the sake of excellence. It's this facet of Steve that, during product launches, I feel gave him the near giddiness of a 10-year-old on Christmas morning. It's this facet of Steve that is missing from this movie that would have humanized him just enough, challenged Fassbender just enough, to elevate the movie to greatness.",

    "review": "  'Steve Jobs' feels more like Aaron Sorkin's movie than Danny Boyle's. Sorkin's now trademark style is the screenwriting equivalent of a sustained machine-gun shootout, and this time the rounds are pumped out without pause for two hours. The relentless script packs a tremendous amount of wit, intelligence and intensity and sets up a dream role for an actor. There aren't too many A-listers who could have pulled it off, but thank the stars Michael Fassbender was available. As may be expected, there have been complaints of inaccuracy, but never mind the reality distortion filter - this is an entrancing film.",

    "review": "  This is a truly electric and energized movie with a strong ensemble performance reading Aaron Sorkin's poetry to us audience members. Sorkin is our Shakespeare with really intelligent dialogue to a challenging degree with how he likes his screenplays' pacing to be. The screenplay is well formatted into a 3 act structure that would make a brilliant stage play especially with the intensity of some of the tension between 3 different story conflicts happening on the same stage between Fassbender and Rogan then to Ortiz and then to Winslet. I really liked those aspects of the movie even if they do seem a bit contrive to fit the structure. The only areas where the screenplay doesn't work is that it leaves Jobs as a human a bit empty. With a structure like this and only brief flashbacks that last less then a minute it is hard to truly humanize Jobs progression as a human over time, it all has to happen in one location in each section of the movie. The ending also felt a bit out of place with how sentimental it got with an awkward tonally misplaced song use in the climax that could have been better if it was just a moment in the score. The score is also brilliant and props to the hair department of this movie for the drastic changes in looks some of the characters go through. Fassbender is great as Jobs, though blinking more could have helped him seem like a human and not a robot like he played in Prometheus, and he has this kinetic energy to play ball with any actor that comes in his path. He bounces off each actor with crisp timing even though sometimes he'll have false moments of changing his attitude over something he was persistently against and in a matter of one long argument giving up like he was always on the fence about it like actions involving his ex wife and daughter in terms of money but that was in part of a script flaw as well but Fassbender never really sold me on those moments where he was quick to take back something like with holding buying a house for his ex wife. Speaking of her, Katherine Waterston really impressed me as Jobs' ex wife. After her bland breakout in Inherent Vice, it was very refreshing to see that she actually has emotions as an actress. I've been very mixed with Kate Winslet over her two decade long screen work with more positivity towards her first half of work but this was a nice return to form for her. Though her accent was all over the place by the end of the movie especially in the 3rd part, she really held her own in the chaos that Fassbender was always in a shuffle with. She really gives one of her strongest performances since 2006's Little Children. Seth Rogan gave a really nice supporting performance, although he seemed to age backwards in time, having surprisingly greatchemistry with Fassbender. Rogan has the dramatic chops that he gave a little preview with 2011's 50/50. One of my favorite TV actors of this decade Jeff Daniels doesn't lose any of his Sorkin rhythm from The Newsroom to this. He is a bit underused but the whole sequence in the 2nd part of the movie between Fassbender and Daniels is breathtaking. There were moments in this movie that made me feel the same way with Mad Max Fury Road earlier this year. I had to take a large sigh of relief because I felt like I just went through an adrenalin rush with this movie being the dialogue rather than car chases in Mad Max. I also really liked Michael Stuhlbarg that gives his best performance since 2009's A Serious Man. He deserves more great work like this and I think he has a big part in Trumbo in a few weeks so I am looking forward to that. I also loved all the actresses that played Jobs' \"daughter\" as he denies throughout the movie especially the oldest in the last section. Though Sorkin's dialogue and the pacing and the look at someone most of us have admired but is taken in a more off-putting tone from the movie, this does feel like The Social Network in ways which makes you confused and have to remind yourself Danny Boyle is behind the camera and not David Fincher. Boyle seems very distant not allowing his fingerprints too much on the filming itself and doing as Jobs says in the movie conducting the orchestra that is made up of Sorkin, the cast, and the camera. If you are not an Aaron Sorkin fan, your mind will not change with this movie because this is definitely more like The Social Network and A Few Good Men rather than something a bit more restraint like Moneyball or Charlie Wilson's War. With the film's pacing, I was astounded when I looked at my clock real quick to see an hour passed by when it felt like 20 minutes went by. I actually think the movie could have been longer maybe delving into the conference before the iPhone was announced or adding some moments of really delving into the human side of Jobs rather than the take no prisoners work ethic he had. There is a documentary out this year on Jobs that I hear is a good counterpart to this that can fill in some of the parts that leave you empty here so I will definitely check that out once it is available on DVD or Netflix. I also want to give a shout out to the unique way the movie is shot. The 1984 and parts of 88 look very grainy and make you feel like you are watching an 80's movie but when you get to 98 you feel like you are watching a more modern movie with how crisp and clean it looks. So overall, it is a well constructed movie that is very dependent on every aspect working well with each other and it does for the most part and will leave you breathless after many moments. This is one to go into with an empty bladder because missing one beat of this train ride could throw you off its tracks.",

    "review": "  Solid biopic that features wonderful acting & innovative storytelling but plays to fast & loose with recent history. Fassbender is superb as Jobs, and while he doesn't quite look like him (at least in his younger days) he captures Jobs's brilliance & arrogance that somehow morphed into a charisma that made you like him even at his worst. The rest of the catch is equally excellent, with Winslet almost unrecognizable as Jobs's long suffering assistant while Rogen shows his dramatic chops portraying Wozniak as someone who loves his friend but just wishes he wasn't such a jerk. Behind the camera, Danny Boyle makes solid use of the story structure, anchoring around the three major launch events of Jobs's career (the Macintosh, NEXT, & iMac), trying to compact his epic life in a two hour movie. For the most part, it works, with subtle graphics & interesting techniques, such as using a different style of camera for each time period. The main problem is Sorkin's script, which does have some brilliant dialogue (of course) along with hints at future inventions (a scene over a wrist-watch by Jobs & Wozniak not only illustrates the differences between the two but hints at the IWatch). However, using Jobs's relationship with his daughter Lisa seems shoehorned in, as his wife & other children are not even mentioned, while his sister, Mona Simpson, gets only a passing comment. It does score points by not always portraying Jobs in a pleasant light and shows his relationship with his daughter wasn't perfect, even in the end. Overall, a solid film that does get to the essence of Jobs but not quite accurate & fully formed.",

Much like \"THE SOCIAL NETWORK\", Steve Jobs is an innovator and pioneer but also a giant asshole to friends, loved ones, and colleagues. Through the course of the film, his dynasty and digital revolution are brought to the epicenter and tested, and he must come to terms with while he may be a so-called genius in reinventing the way we use computers and digital devices--- as a person, he wasn't the most pleasant or decent human being. In some ways, how Sorkin and Boyle craft it, it's like a modern day \"CITIZEN KANE.\" We see the rise, fall, and rise again of Jobs.

    "review": "  WORDMAN: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Being An Asshole) - My Review of STEVE JOBS (3 1/2 Stars)Aaron Sorkin must have shit a brick when BIRDMAN came out, because STEVE JOBS, as audaciously entertaining as it can be at times, is THE SAME DAMN MOVIE! Told in three parts, all located backstage at significant product launch events in the Apple co-founder's career, the important people in his life congregate for their turn to yell at this difficult, arrogant, strategic, cunning, neglectful, impossible man. No, it's not told in a single shot and no, Michael Fassbender, who excels at letting us into the energetic mind of Jobs, doesn't levitate or sprout wings, but the dissection of a man as told by his coterie remains the same. Pairing Sorkin's wall-to-wall dialogue with the kinetic, visionary director, Danny Boyle, sounds great on paper. While written like a stage play, Boyle's hiring brought with it the possibility of infusing it with his boundless energy. Unfortunately, this is Sorkin's film all the way, and Boyle's stamp can barely be seen. In the trailer, there's a shot of the back of Jobs' head as he waits in front of a door, a pause, and then he bursts through. It's what I was hoping for from Boyle, this tension between stillness and action, but those moments are so few and far between. There's a beautiful wide shot in a hallway with a projected image that feels tacked on as a heavy-handed afterthought. A not-so-subtle rainstorm takes over the background of a key boardroom scene. It feels like Boyle is doing everything he can to get an \"ahem\" in there, but it's a losing battle against Sorkin's vision. It's not that the film is lousy. Far from it. It's just a one-sided marriage. This is tricky, adult, smart, vibrant storytelling, albeit the very type that won an Oscar a year ago, and wholly the work of its writer. In addition to the electric Fassbender, Kate Winslet, as Jobs' Polish Marketing Exec Joanna Hoffman, who can go toe-to-toe with him more than anyone else, gives a furious, committed performance. The heart and soul of the film, however, belongs to Seth Rogen as Jobs' former partner, Steve Wozniak. Rogen finds the humanity in the man who would eventually become overshadowed by the CEO in the glasses, turtleneck and Mom Jeans. Michael Stulhbarg, so great in A SERIOUS MAN, plays Andy Herzfeld , Apple's Chief Developer, with great underdog bravado, firing snappy one-liners back at Jobs with great skill. Same goes for Jeff Daniels as John Sculley, a one-time Apple CEO, who has to bring the hammer down on Jobs on more than one occasion. Katherine Waterston, so good in INHERENT VICE, proves that performance was no fluke, with her turn as Jobs' ex-girlfriend and impoverished welfare mother. They have a daughter together, Lisa, and Jobs' inability to recognize her as such is, along with Wozniak's storyline, the emotional arc of the film. STEVE JOBS shines a light on a man's fight to excel in business and innovation while his fundamental decency erodes. The baby steps Jobs takes towards his own humanity are presented in true fashion to its subject, without a shred of overt sentimentality. Instead, we're left with a warts-and-all portrait of a megalomaniac struggling with such things as gratitude and selflessness. Had it not been done before and so recently, I would be jumping up and down more for this film. Sure, it's less a biopic and more of a compact look at a man trying to get his way during the key moments in his professional career. I appreciate that it doesn't look at his entire life, intending to get at his essence instead. Sorkin refuses to dumb down his non-stop dialogue and characters, forcing the audience to stay alert. Cinematographer Alwin H. K�chler, who also shot Boyle's SUNSHINE, works overtime to make these backstage rooms sing, but there's no disguising the Broadway play just itching to get out from under the movie treatment. A film about a marketing master who, along with the real geniuses, has changed how the world interacts, is worthy. I was hoping, however, for a little more innovation, instead of the very \"Sorkin-y\" walk and talk on display. Still, I highly recommend STEVE JOBS, because movies about smart people almost never happen anymore. Jobs seemed to know that the only way to realize his vision was to be a complete jerk. Perhaps Boyle, who is known for being a truly nice guy, could have put his foot down and inserted his voice a little more, then STEVE JOBS could have been a brittle masterpiece. We'll have to settle for really, really good instead, and that's something Jobs would have never done.",

I never like Apple computers or Steve Jobs, who seemed to be to be 10% and 90% ego and the movie did little to do that. I am writing this on a MacPro, so times do change. The movie focuses on Jobs rise and repeated falls with computers and his highly charged relationship with his daughter. Michael Fassbender is in every scene and the movie is held up, way up, by his performance. Kate Winslet, his amazing co-star compared the role to Hamlet; not sure it's quiet that, but it is pretty good. I found this a remarkably will made movie as expected from Director Danny Boyle. Go if you get the chance, I'm sure you will like it.",

    "review": "  If you want to see great acting, check out this movie. Written by my favorite Hollywood writer Aaron Sorkin (West Wing, Social Network, Moneyball) this movie will demand you keep up with its fast paced dialogue. Not sure how much of the story is true (as with Social Network) but for a 2 hour movie of mostly two characters arguing, it builds up drama quite nicely. I would've liked to have seen more computer talk with a concentration on Apple's most recent products, and less on family squibbling, but the movie works. Seth Rogen has some good scenes and weak scenes, Jeff Daniels impresses as usual, and Kate Winslet steals the show as a Polish marketing mastermind. Then there is Michael Fassbender (Magneto) who will threaten for the Oscar. I would RECOMMEND, but it can wait for DVD release.",

The movie covers 3 times in his life. It doesn't mention he has a wife and family, that he has cancer and that he had wonderful adoptive parents. Aaron Sorkin has beefed up the role of Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) considerably. She was a minor character in the book. Way too much time was devoted to abandoned daughter Lisa.",

    "review": "  I go to 1 new movie a week and 2015 as been a veryforgettable year for movies...so far. Looking out onthe horizon for the balance of 2015, there are somepossible special movies but nothing I'm over the topexcited about.The advance \"buzz\" the new film \"Steve Jobs\" includedsome pretty eye catching adjectives and phrases. Thisdidn't overly impress me in that most anything associatedwith Apple and the late Steve Jobs always had the bestmarketing brilliance.Still, I wanted to see this true story on this amazing yetpolarizing business talent. At the end of the day, his productson his watched transformed generations with the personal/microcomputing/entertainment vision. Jobs had an unparallelledability to create brilliantly performing products in enticing \"configurations\" that the consumer desired. Hencethe success of his brand and products is world renown.So lets cut to the movie which from start to finish acutelyshowcases Jobs brilliance combined with his arrogance and acerbic nature. This man, played to an Academy Award level by Michael Fassbender, grabs us from the moment his face hits the screenand doesn't let go. The movie is built around several of Job'smajor product releases (Lisa, Next and IMac) and the near rockconcert level fervor of the techno community.Doesn't sound overly sexy or engaging, but folks it is quintessential excellent movie making and watching. Directedby Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 127 hours and more) and the screen play byAaron Sorkin (Social Network, Moneyball and much more), thismovie grabs you and holds you throughout.This movie isn't like watching a trainwreck to see/hear someuber-cold thing Jobs will say or do to his work colleagues orfamily. Because the \"tough stuff\" is balanced with businessbrilliance. That's what makes this movie so good and makespersonalities like a Steve Job so engaging.The guy is virtually friend and relationshipless (includinghis daughter Lisa) and his life seems held together in allareas by long time assistant (and business talent in herown right), Joanna Hoffman played incredibly by Kate Winslet.She sincerely deserves an Oscar nomination here.She spends her life putting out Jobs's fires while nudginghim on a path forward (professionally and personally) whilehis seems to unabashed to blowing up that journey with averbal bomb.This was a TERRIFIC movie on so many levels and too, I'm sure,because many of us lived thru and were impacted by theJobs/products/Apple era (pro or con).This was top shelf movie which will do very well in the boxoffice. Not a blockbuster but really well done, tight movieproduction that grabs you and doesn't let go....courtesy ofmesmerizing and complex Steve Jobs. Very, very well done film.",

    "review": "  When you watch the movie ?Steve Jobs? (R, 2:02), you are witnessing genius. That?s a word that shouldn?t be used lightly, but here it fits ? on multiple levels. The subject of this biopic is basically universally considered a genius for bringing personal computing into the homes of average people and changing our lives in other ways as well. But Jobs himself is only the most obvious example of genius in this particular motion picture. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who also wrote the TV shows ?The West Wing? and ?The Newsroom? and films including ?A Few Good Men?, ?The Social Network? and ?Moneyball?, once again shows his own genius for writing dialog and constructing scenes in which interactions among people become high drama. If anything, in the script for this film, he tops himself by giving the story a unique presentation. Add all that to the inspired direction of Oscar winner Danny Boyle (who won for directing 2007?s Best Picture Oscar Winner ?Slumdog Millionaire?), plus brilliant acting, and you have a film with genius to spare. Genius, however, doesn?t necessarily equal perfection.Steve Jobs, visionary genius that he was, was far from perfect ? as an individual or a businessman. He had a daughter with college girlfriend Chrisann Brennan, but denied paternity for years. Even after he accepted Lisa Brennan as his daughter, he had almost as much trouble relating to her as he did relating to others in his life. Think of a derogatory term, anatomical or otherwise, that people apply to males they don?t like, and Steve Jobs has been called it. Loyal to only a very few, no one was safe from Jobs? rudeness, often unreasonable demands or contempt when they disagreed with him. And let?s not forget that, at Apple, he developed the Macintosh, which flopped. He got fired from Apple, founded NeXT Computer and developed the NeXT Box computer, which also flopped. Even geniuses make mistakes, but what recommends them as geniuses, in the 20/20 hindsight of history, are the final results and long-term impact of their accomplishments. Steve Jobs scores undeniably high marks in those areas. The triumphs and tragedies, successes and failures, mistakes and mayhem in Steve Jobs? life, as described above, are all part of the film ?Steve Jobs?, but are encapsulated in a unique way. The movie takes place immediately before three crucial product launches staged in large auditoriums. The settings are the unveiling of the Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT Box in 1988 and the iMac in 1998. In each case, Jobs (played by Michael Fassbender), with his long-suffering PR manager, Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), at his side, he interacts with Chrisann (Katherine Waterston) and their daughter, Lisa (played at five, ten and nineteen by Perla Haney-Jardine, Ripley Sobo, and Makenzie Moss) as well as his partner in founding Apple, Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), Macintosh designer, Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Apple CEO, John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) plus others, through the various stages of warmth, apathy and conflict between them and Jobs at these specific moments in time. The movie gives us these three main scenes, adds a few brief flashback scenes to illustrate other important moments in Jobs? professional life, and that?s basically the movie. If that doesn?t sound interesting, it?s most likely due to my lack of genius in communicating the true genius of Sorkin, Boyle and many others associated with this film. ?Steve Jobs? is a terrific cinematic experience. Although Sorkin?s writing fabricates conversations for dramatic purposes, many of the people portrayed in the film have admitted that those conversations reflect events and feelings that were valid at those moments, and the script is vintage Sorkin. He has a particular genius for telling a story mainly through conversations which he manages to make dramatic, insightful and humorous ? and this may be his best work ever. Boyle?s direction, plus some creative and skillful editing, bring the script to life wonderfully and Boyle gets consistently remarkable work from his actors in roles large and small. The acting is of such high quality across the board, that it?s very tough to single out just one or two actors for special praise amid a long list of award-worthy performances. A few moments in the film do feel like they?re walking a line between believable and unrealistic, but those moments are few and far between. Like the real Steve Jobs? accomplishments, the accomplishment that is the film ?Steve Jobs? isn?t perfect, but at least in my MacBook, they both earn the label of genius. ?A?",

This movie is a far contrast from however from that, but the movie show's through it's unique three part structure, the behind the scenes life of Steve Jobs. His life was far from simple and efficient. His products are everything that he is not and what he wishes he were. Through the vision of Danny Boyle (Director of Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours), he gets the chance to show that Jobs was always inventing things within things in his life. Boyle shows how complex Jobs is and behind the fancy tech, OS, and hardware; there was love within his iconic products. Academy Award winner, Aaron Sorkin, wrote the screenplay. While it isn't his best work, he manages to be like the Apple company. Have a weak start, but finish strong. Ironically, Slumdog Millionaire has the same feeling. First hour of that movie sucked, but the second hour is just mesmerizing.",

    "review": "  When I first heard about the structure of the new Steve Jobs film I was hesitant. The film is broken into three main parts. The first being the launch of the Mac. The second being the launch of the Next computer. The third being the launch of the iMac. I was hesitant because I felt like the film should tell more and I thought that it might get boring just showing these events for 2 hours. I'm glad to say that I was completely wrong. I was also hesitant about Michael Fassbender playing Jobs. Not because he isn't a great actor because he is but because he looks nothing like Steve Jobs. Fassbender becomes Jobs in this film. I wouldn't want to see anyone else playing this iconic figure.Steve Jobs is hands down the best film i've seen so far this year. It's spectacular and sure to get plenty of Oscar nominations. The three nominations I'm sure of are Best Actor (Michael Fassbender), Best Supporting Actress (Kate Winslet), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Aaron Sorkin). Steve Jobs will at least WIN Best Adapted Screenplay. I also wouldn't be surprised if Danny Boyle got a Directing nomination as well as Supporting Actor noms for both Seth Rogen and Jeff Daniels who were tremendous in this film.There is so much tension between characters in this film that really make most of the scenes. The dialogue is brilliant. The acting is award worthy. I've never seen Seth Rogen give a better performance and Daniels really made up for that spit in the face film that I won't name here. Kate Winslet was really great as well. Her character gave a lot of heart to the film. The film did such a great story telling Jobs life within these three events. We didn't need a whole bio picture. These events told so much. Would I have liked to see more with these film-makers/actors involved? Yes. But it's not necessary. The relationship between Jobs and his daughter across this film is amazing to watch and my favorite part of the film. Overall, I would definitely recommend checking this film out as soon as possible.",

Very eloquent people.*Warning: Spoilers BelowSteve Jobs in all his (difficult) glory clashes with representative figures in his life: his daughter, daughter's mother, and work-wife; Apple partner, boss, and programmer.We are swept up in the backstage energy of pre-launch secrets and product issues, honesty spawning hysteria, friends emerging as frenemies,strategy for justice or revenge, ongoing ideology versus money, and at the heart of it all, deep beneath an icy, scathing surface: Steve's passion and his daughter.Three pivotal debuts of Steve Jobs as a creatorare brought to life by raw, brutally honest performances. The movie's orchestra of human nature plays no false notes.We empathize with everyone, even going so far as to dive into Steve's mind, achieved by seamless editing of memories that affect his present thoughts, particularly potent of father figure Sculley, and of his daughter Lisa.Conventional Computing Biographies condense a whole lifetime into a series of significant events. Inevitably, writers rewrite history and some parts are glossed over, left out, simplified, and customized to many, many different versions.iBiopic by Aaron Sorkin has a simple structure and intricate core.

The back and forth between characters in this movie left me in awe. Seriously jaw dropping stuff. Aaron Sorkin absolutely killed it with the screenplay! It's easily my favorite screenplay of 2015. I also LOVED the score. It had this old school retro beat to it and it fit the film perfectly.This movie is more so a drama than a biopic. This isn't a Steve Jobs life story. The movie focuses on the behind the scenes of 3 major press conferences Steve Jobs took part in. I really liked this aspect of the movie because the movie starts off with a bang and it doesn't let up. There's really no down time. If you're looking for an in-depth film about the life of Steve Jobs, I think a documentary would be a better fit. I myself plan on checking out a more in-depth documentary because now I'm really interested about learning more about Jobs.If the Oscar committee snubs this movie, I'm going to be legitimately pissed off. Steve Jobs is by far one of 2015's best films as well as Danny Boyle's best film. Such a captivating film overall. I loved every second of it.",

The whole script is jobs arguing with someone. If I wanted to see two people nagging at each other for two hours I would have gone to my in-laws for dinner. I read the Steve Jobs biography and I feel that the whole movie is a dishonest picture of the real Steve Jobs. He was indeed a complicated man, but I don't see anything worthy of an award or your money here. The whole movie takes place behind the curtains before Apple's product releases over the course of his career. It seems like we never leave the building, and all you want is a breath of fresh air outside, but every scene is jobs and another associate engaged in a bitter argument in a hall or dressing room. Instead of being inspired when I left the theater I felt exhausted after having to listen to that movies dialog.

And this one is just a mess.This movie depicts only several moments from Steve's life. Everything else we learn about Steve is done through fabricated conversations backstage at product launches. For the casual viewer this may be acceptable and they will feel like they learned a lot about Jobs. But for somebody who know the history of Steve and Apple there are no new revelations. Nor is it visually entertaining because we know these conversations are merely the creations in Aaron Sorkin's head. None of them actually happened.Hopefully somebody will eventually take the time to write an accurate script based on his biography and make a 10 hour miniseries that truly details the genius of how he changed multiple industries and the madness and chaos he caused with the people around him to do so. But trying to cram a wild and complicated life into two hours is a futile attempt and this movie points that out on so many levels.This movie ONLY worth seeing for the acting and the dialog, which are both great. But without actually depicting any real events from Steve's life, it's not insanely great.",

Sorkin has written a 3 act screenplay, each act revolving around a creation by Jobs such as the Apple II, the NeXT and the iMac computers, while Doyle films the first act in 16mm film, the second in 35mm and digital for the third act.It is generally known and accepted that Steve Jobs was a cold, dictating boss who never gave credit to anyone keeping it all for himself, gave more love to his technological creations than to any human being, never treated anyone around him fairly, was an impossible perfectionist, always composed, cool and in charge, comparing himself to G-d, Julius Caesar and seen as a bully but even those who hated him acknowledged him as a visionary.The fact that he was adopted and given back after a month to be adopted again, being brought up as a Catholic, refused to acknowledge the birth of his own daughter until she was in her teens and his long time, non-sexual, working relationship with Joanna Hoffman (Winslet) who was one of the few who could and did stand up to him, are never dealt with in depth which may have helped explaining the man himself. We learn little about the man himself which is a big failure of the film.There is no faulting of the actors from the three, Makenzie Moss, Ripley Sobo and Perla Haney-Jardine who play the daughter at different stages, Katherine Waterston who plays the mother, Mac collaborator Andy Hertzfeld, played by Michael Stuhlbarg, to all the supporting and bit players. Daniels takes his character from \"The Newsroom\" a step higher!Fassbender IS Steve Jobs even though he may not look like him to start with eventually he is the man you have seen on large stages introducing his products. He handles the pacing of Sorkin's words and Doyle's camera along with the anger he feels not knowing how to deal with feelings. The relationship between Winslet and Fassbender though her loyalty to him and why he would listen to her and not others is never explained but because of the actors you accept that it is just what it appears.For excellent acting, snappy, sharp dialogue and above average unobtrusive directing plus award conversations \"Steve Jobs\" is a film to see.",

    "review": "  A fascinating angle at flaws both human and technical, amongst blurred family lines and operating systems. Sorkin eschews a complete biography for an urgent feel piece - what it would be like to work with the man, the myth, and the father. The performances, exchanges symbolically employ just enough of a stage feel, and all the elements rise to the subject matter. As mentioned Fassbender and Winslet are at the top of their game. For Jobs, the clock was ironically ticking, the third time was the charm, and his orchestra didn't disappoint us. Same can be said for this very specific program.",

    "review": "  If you go into this movie expecting a film about Steve Jobs numerous achievements in the world of technology, this isn't quite that movie, this is more a movie about Steve Jobs the father. The film is anchored by terrific acting, character development, and pacing, which help make the film quite enjoyable. The story revolves not around Jobs entire life, but 3 separate events, and the minutia of the rest of his life, the structure to clarify is similar to last years Birdman, and the film is very different from 2013's Jobs. The acting in Steve Jobs is superb, perhaps most impressive of all is Kate Winslet's performance, as through most of the movie she transformed into her character, as did Michael Fassbender. Michael Fassbender will surely receive an Oscar nomination for this performance, as he literally transforms before the audience's eyes. Jeff Daniels is as was expected reliable and equally as great, but may get drowned out by the other performances. The other notable performance was that of Seth Rogen, who made a turn for the dramatic, and hit a home-run, completely selling himself as Steve Wozniak. The plot of the film is character driven, and in many ways the greatest strength of the film is the character development, especially that of Steve Jobs. Boyle and Fassbender perfectly capture the psychotic, frenetic, genius, bipolar attitude of Steve Jobs, while also showing a great character arch, as he evolves as a person. The film could have been a little too melodramatic, but the direction and acting save it. The acting and character development also help form the surprisingly frenetic pacing of the film. The film is paced like a day in a beehive, where every character is running in circles, never taking a moment to breath. On top of all of the acting, character development, and pacing the film is also funny, at times touching, and different from the other Jobs films. The film represents an award caliber performance by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, director Danny Boyle, and most of the cast. The only complaint may be the film's computer and business lingo is occasionally, not often but occasionally, too confusing for a non computer whiz to understand. Using great character development, acting, and pacing Steve Jobs is another great entry in Danny Boyle's ever impressive filmography.",

    "review": "  After the debacle that was the Ashton Kusthor Jobs a few years ago, Danny Boyles Steve Jobs hits it out of the park focusing on a through line of three product launches and the turmoil surrounding each one both professional and personal that helps shape Apple as a company as well as Jobs as a person. The acting as one might expect is first rate from Fassbender in the titular role, Winslet as his right hand strong arming the people and media around him to keep them from penetrating his protective shell, Rogen as Woz the best friend technician and Jeff Daniels as the wooed Pepsi CEO who eventually ousted Jobs after a disasturous product launch in the first third of the film when Jobs vision proved too early. The writing yet again is rat a tat by Sorkin who seems to have a knack for this larger than live tech figures, having been previously with the Social Network, and the direction for Boyle is sure handed and well crafted using three different film stocks to mark the three periods and use of a heightened reality in places to mark the passion of the art and style that the Apple founder had for his image and products. One of the stronger entries to fall prestige season and sure to garner some attention for its writing and acting.",

    "review": "  Most of the time through this movie I kept thinking, \"there isn't really a plot here.\" I think the actors did their roles well, and the story had great dialog and was able to create an impressive amount of emotion without bringing much to the table. But that was also the hindrance. More than once I felt myself asking myself what the point of the story was.From everything I have read about Jobs, he was very much like this. An *beep* who demanded people do and achieve more out of tools he had no idea how to use. Than when they were able to accomplish it, he just acted like they owed him great thanks for pushing them.It wasn't until the end that we finally got some relief as all the people he was always a dick to finally came back at him. Which is really all the movie is. It is people firing back at him at launch presentations because they all knew in the end what Jobs never did (in the movie). And that was created anything. He may in fact have \"played the orchestra\" and that does matter (think of the President, they don't do much of the work, but they drive the bus). Obviously his marketing and artistic talent show through, but like many bosses, he never actually worked on the nuts and bolts, and never knew what they were asking for.It felt very similar to The Social Network as portraying the founder (co-founders) of massive companies that broke the mold as complete *beep* I was actually waiting for an epilogue seen where Jobs would be dying in his bed of cancer and the word \"KARMA\" would flash on the screen. What was truly annoying was when at the end, when for 3 minutes he acts like a caring father, and suddenly everything is all right.I guess he gets points for admitting he is a flawed human being, but like with many other lines spoken in this movie, I wonder if they are accurate at all.",

    "review": "  Steve Jobs was an enigma of a man; I don't think we can draw exact conclusions to who Jobs was or his exact motivations regarding his family and his business. Apple impacted the world in so many different ways, some for worse or better for the computing world, yet the man behind is so vastly different from anyone involved with computers from that time. Was he nothing more than an intelligent businessman taking advantage of the home computer world or was he a genuine innovator in how home computers should be despite his own lack of involvement regarding the actual development of the computers. Steve Jobs (the film) works with whatever it can to give us the best possible image of the man, the film doesn't exactly claim to know all the answers, but it gives us an intelligent look into Jobs' world. Sorkin returns to writing autobiographical films in ways that no one else is currently doing. The screenplay of the film is both it's most fascinating and possibly flawed. The structure which follows through on the three biggest press conferences in Jobs' life is fascinating to see play out. On one hand this limits the film form to explore Jobs' life outside, but then again Jobs was all about his work wasn't he? Danny Boyle here seems to be channeling his strengths and manages to work out some of the flaws he's presented over the years. Once again he has a fantastic time with his cast, he manages to encapsulate Sorkin's style as best as possible (though not as well as someone like Fincher); Boyle manages to work his best gift of making the ordinary seem grand. It's perfect for the structure of the film and perfect for Boyle. It's almost pointless to talk about the acting as it's as good as you may expect. Fassbender, Winslet, Rogen, and Daniels all are outstanding and easily could be up for Oscar Nods. Fassbender fully encapsulates the strange nature and almost lighting fast speed of Jobs' brain as well his megalomania and capacity for caring. The mighty Kate Winslet returns with one of her best performances in a while as Jobs' smart-talking, intelligent, practical Joanna Hoffman, the more humane counter to Fassbender's more universal prattling protagonist. Rogen turns in a relatively short, but emotional performance as Woz which is sure to win the hearts of the audience and give the comedic actor some long due acting credit. Daniels is also in a short but sweet role as the former CEO of Apple who's inability to adapt to the times ultimately leads to something of an undeserving downfall. Overall though, Steve Jobs greatest asset is this blend that is both fantastic to watch but at the same time, lacking in something. Unlike something like The Social Network, which both encapsulates it's main subject as well as his creation, Steve Jobs isn't quite as deft as it's hand reaches out but doesn't grab everything. I still feel like I'm missing chunks of the important part of Steve Jobs (the man) despite knowing so much, I don't feel I exactly know enough to even draw a conclusion exactly. The film itself doesn't feel as intelligent to follow Jobs so we don't get the same fantastic feeling of understanding in Sorkin's previous modern Bio-Pic. As is though, Steve Jobs is still a very good film, not exactly great, but as far as the films pushing for major Oscar campaigns this year, it still will likely be better than most films coming up along with Fassbender's performance which will undoubtedly earn him a nomination and hopefully a win (because I'm sorry, DiCaprio doesn't deserve squat)",

His astounding achievements in the Apple corporate turnaround and the products he helped development are his lasting legacy. So, who will the world remember more; Bill Gates or Steve Jobs?

    "review": "  More of an 8.5 than a 9, but this a fascinating film featuring very strong acting.The film has a very interesting structure. It's divided into 3 segments, each one being a behind the scenes launch of a product Steve Jobs was involved with. The first is in 1984 with the launch of the Macintosh, the second in 1988 with the launch of the Next, and the final one in 1988 with the launch of the iMac. While the film isn't shot in one continuous shot, it does evoke similar feelings to last year's Best Picture winner: Birdman. For the most part, the framing device works. Each segment is clearly different from the ones before it and each one offers fascinating insights into the characters.Speaking of the characters, the acting in this film is phenomenal across the board. Michael Fassbender is perfect as Jobs, creating a wonderful portrait of the biggest asshole around, yet also bringing out the genius (often insufferable) of Jobs as well. The scenes of him with his wife and daughter are truly fascinating as is his relationship with them, which seems both cold and caring at the same time.Kate Winslet is the heart of the film, playing Jobs' PR person at each event. Her accent (She's playing a Pole) is fine, but her interactions with Jobs are what truly make her stand out. Winslet should be netting her seventh Oscar nod for this. She's the anti-Jobs in every sense of the word and she and Fassbender play off each other beautifully.The next two actors to be mentioned should also merit serious awards consideration: Jeff Daniels and Seth Rogen. Yes, really. Rogen delivers an Oscar worthy performance as Steve Wozniak, whose constant desire for Jobs to mention the Apple II just feels more and more hopeless over the passing years. Now for Jeff Daniels as Apple's CEO before Jobs, he's incredible. Most of Daniels standout moments come in the second segment, the launch of the Next. Daniels' best scene is one where he and Jobs discuss why Jobs was forced out of Apple in the first place and Daniels nails every second of it as he and Fassbender go at each other with what can only be described as \"verbal machine gun fire\". Both He and Rogen nail their Oscar clips.The film features some beautiful cinematography, amazing editing (each segment feels so seamless, but this is Danny Boyle. He's pretty good at that), and some really nice sets. It's well worth a look and it is without question one of the most fantastically acted films of the year with an equally fantastic script to boot.",

I've said time and time again that it is hard for me to watch a film whose protagonist is extremely dislikable, in my own opinion of course. One of the reasons why I don't like Pitch Perfect very much. But what made this film stand out was the outstanding performances and all-around great effort by the filmmakers. The screenplay was tight with some great dialogue and the directing was really well done too. But by far the best part of this film was the scene in which Michael Fassbender and Jeff Daniels argue about their real intentions at Apple. It's extremely intense even though it's just two people shouting at each other. The filmmakers make it seem more like a fast-paced gun battle then two people arguing. This film was really well-made and won't be surprised at all if I see this receive many nominations at the Oscars.",

I've not seen the other documentaries or films (Ashton Kutcher and Josh Gad, really?) so I can't compare it to any of them, but as a stand alone film this was quite well done. Each of the three acts is set on a different product launch ceremonies - the original Macintosh, the NeXT, and finally the iMac, with only brief flashbacks to other settings - but strangely enough the products only serve as a backdrop to his relationship with Wosniak, Sculley, and a lesser extent to Hertzfeld, but mostly on his relationship with Lisa. Quite good casting for her part, as the three actresses playing her really do similar enough that I never had to question who it was. Keeping the film centered on those product launches was a great idea, as it gives the film a focus while advancing the story throughout the years. The acting is great, especially Fassbender who nicely straddles the thin line necessary to portray a sympathetic jerk. Rogan might be the weak link, but even then that's only because I was very conscious it was him, as he's otherwise fine. It's certainly an interesting take on the person, and I'd give it a recommendation.",

    "review": "  Not nearly as perfect as David Fincher's \"The Social Network\" working from same screen writer, Aaron Sorkin. Although, Danny Boyle does a fine job here in what felt like a well done little brother's effort in comparison. I also know that with more views and with less hype behind me that I will come to love this film more with time. It wasn't entirely what I was expecting and I was hoping for more humor for some reason as well as more snappy aspects. Perhaps, I expected it to be a lot like \"The Social Network\", taking itself seriously while also still having a backbone and whit. This telling didn't always feel like it had a backbone unfortunately, but the characters and script in place were perfect here for what was presented from 3 separate 40 minute stage-like acts in Steve Job's life. All in all this was a great character study piece and powerhouse acting at it's best from all in house. I would say this one is slightly overhyped, so go into it with less expectations from it's rave reviews and you might love it. As far as this year in film go though, it is one of the best, I would say.",

The acting across the board is strong, with the only weakness being Winslet's disappearing accent. The movie is told in a three act structure with essentially one location each. At first I was a little confused why a movie about one of the great technological innovators would be told in such an old fashioned style. I should've trusted in Sorkin and Boyle as by the end we are presented with a strong picture of who he was even though we are only shown three moments in his life.",

What I mean is a balanced movie with complex characters that you can relate to and an exciting and interesting plot.Great, If you're a movie critic type person, who loves character studies of madmen or very depressing movies just because of good acting. People that knew Steve Jobs witnessed Steve creating a Reality Distortion Field.I think that is what the movie should be titled. Watching Steve's reality distortion field, and this movie, is witnessing a version of reality where only Steve's version of reality exists. No matter how much evidence there is that something is not real, to Steve it is real.We see this in the most in Steve's view of the Mac, at the 1984 launch event and in Steve's belief that his daughter Lisa, is not his daughter throughout the movie.The question is do great visionaries and interesting movie characters have to be A-Holes because the people around them don't see the world that they do?This movie believes they do. It is not a balanced look at Steve like you get in Walter Isaacson's book, but a very one dimensional character study without humanity.",

    "review": "  5/5 A burst of creative energy as well as a meaningful take on our relationship to technology and the complex figure behind it all. The screenplay, acting, direction, score, and editing are all orchestrated to perfection, and make Steve Jobs one of the year's very best films. Aaron Sorkin's script takes us backstage before three major product launches in Steve Jobs' career. The unique experience of the film revolves around this unconventional approach and Sorkin's witty, nonstop dialogue. The film forces you to remain upright and attentive as you try to absorb the densely packed dialogue, but this doesn't feel like a chore; it's more like a privilege. This is because the dialogue is genius, filled with lines so insightful and clever you'll take them for granted as they constantly zoom by. Sorkin will deserve the Oscar when he wins.Of course, the dialogue isn't much without great delivery, and the cast more than delivers. Leading the ensemble cast is Michael Fassbender, whose Steve Jobs unrelentingly manipulates the reality around him to fit the illusion that he's in command of his own world. He does this with distant emotional suppression and a harsh, cold exterior. His genius is there as well, and because of this, we can see how his egoism has gotten him so far, despite the poor way he treats others. Fassbender shows us all of this through his performance, avoiding the classification of simply being a \"dick\". His performance is far too complex for that, and he'll deserve the Oscar when he wins. Each scene is a sort of duel between Jobs and another character. Each character helps to bring about a different part of Jobs and each appears in each of the film's three parts either through working with him or by visiting him. Of course, this isn't likely the way things played out in reality, but Sorkin isn't trying to hide that. The way that the conflicts between the many characters played out were fantastic, with each player getting their own intense climax. Appearing most often among these supporting players is Kate Winslet, who makes it believable that her character can stand up to Jobs all the time, able to keep up with him through subtle understanding and care. Seth Rogen is excellent as well, proving himself to be a promising dramatic actor. I loved Michael Stahlberg's performance and Jeff Daniels was effective even if he mostly met expectations from the roles he's been doing recently. Katherine Waterson was great as well, going up against Fassbender with fierce sarcasm. Each of these actors gets at least one moment to shine, and boy do they shine when it's their turn in the spotlight. But possibly the most important character is Steve Jobs' daughter, played by three amazing actresses. The younger two convey an aching longing for a father figure when they're around the neglectful Jobs, and the oldest is a more mature version, understanding her father's flaws through the hole he's left in her life. Jobs' daughter is the emotional center of the film, and this center really is emotional at times. We can see how Jobs' neglect is suppressed and that it represents his biggest flaw. Jobs is unable to acknowledge mankind for its shared beauty, instead using his life to selfishly regain a lack of control that he feels as a result of his adoption as a child. The film expresses this theme not only through Jobs' character, but through the products he made. \"A computer is not a painting,\" Wozniak constantly says to Steve, though which he traditionally replies, \"fuck you.\" Jobs initially wanted to remove all compatibility options from the computer because of this viewpoint because he fails to understand technology and the human race as a collaborative effort. Although Jobs succeeded in many ways through his arrogance, the film argues that letting others in can lead to even greater accomplishments. Danny Boyle's typical visual extravagance is unleashed here at times, but he can be effectively restrained as well. He is great at capturing the hyper pacing of the digital age, making the film relevant by making Jobs feel like he's the very center of the technological revolution. Boyle takes scenes of pure dialogue and amps them up to create some seriously thrilling sequences. Some shots from the film are quite flashy and delicious, so creative compositionally that they should be placed in film textbooks. It would be wrong not to credit the editing and cinematography for much of this as well.Daniel Pemberton's score is one of the year's finest. His pulsating, bouncy electronics keep a rhythmic pace to the film that is effectively modern, and the more orchestrated tracks levitate scenes, making them feel virtuosic. A lot of people may feel that the redemptive ending of the film is odd, but in understanding how clearly fictionalized this film is, I didn't mind and thought the end really added to the film.Absolutely every aspect of this film makes for extremely entertaining cinema in a totally unique way. I enjoyed the film immensely both times I watched it, experiencing at once a great character study, an insightful look at our relationship with technology, and a moving drama. This is a must-see, folks.",

The three act play setup is wonderful. Instead of another generic biopic, you get a snapshot of a man at three very important stages of his life. Then, centering those stages in the minutes before a product launch is genius. It keeps the stakes high the entire time. Aaron Sorkin definitely hit a home run with this one. You also can't beat the cast of this movie. Michael Fassbender is more than worth the price of the ticket. But having Kate Winslet, Seth Rogan, and Jeff Daniels around doesn't hurt either. Fassbender is brilliant. We already knew he would be, but it doesn't hurt to reiterate it. It was a really honest portrayal, no sugar coating. We saw the great side of Jobs and also the side of him that was, to put it bluntly, an asshole. Then, keep it going with it being beautifully shot, even including the integration of some projections, and you have a movie that will be remembered for quite some time.",

I was also interested to see if Steve Jobs could finally be a good story for a film. Well, I can safely say that Steve Jobs is hands down one of the best films I've seen all year.The acting all around is astounding. I bought Fassbender as Jobs. His accent was spot-on and he really portrayed the man how he was: an asshole. I'm expecting a Best Actor nomination, and maybe even a win! Seth Rogan and Kate Winslet were both amazing as well. Steve Jobs has one of the best screenplays I've seen in years. Aaron Sorkin wrote yet another absorbing script with some of the most quotable dialogue I've EVER seen. There's a monologue from Woz that is utterly fantastic. There is very little action in Steve Jobs, but the captivating dialogue is constantly entertaining and interesting.Danny Boyle directed this film beautifully. It is split into a very unique three-act structure and it works amazingly. It is also very well edited, had great cinematography and has a fantastic musical score. The costume design, makeup and characters are also excellent.My only minor flaw with Steve Jobs is that there are occasionally pacing issues. It's barely noticeable, though.Overall, Steve Jobs is one of the best written and acted films to come out in 2015. See it ASAP!RATING: 9.75/10",

    "review": "  Steve Jobs (the movie), not the person (or is it?) is the new biopic directed by Danny Boyle, written by Aaron Sorkin and stars Michael Fassbender as the titular Apple Mogul Steve Jobs. Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen and Jeff Daniels are also a part of the cast as Joanna Hoffman, Steve Wozniak and John Sculley respectively. It follows the life of Steve Jobs around three major product launches in 1984, 1988 and 1998.If anyone was wanting a movie about the Apple company, then you'll be quite disappointed, but then again you would also be the one at fault for watching a movie called Steve Jobs and wanting more Apple. The first thing that you realize is the writing of the film and how inherently \"Aaron Sorkin\" it is. You may have become desensitized to the very \"talky\" way that Aaron Sorkin writes because of \"The Newsroom\", but for those who haven't watched the TV show, the sharp dialogue would be very noticeable with loads of walk and talk in true Sorkin esque fashion. This in combination with Danny Boyle's sharp direction results in a movie that rattles along towards its 122 min run time.The star of the film however, is Michael Fassbender in this neurotic portrayal of Steve Jobs. This performance would come as a surprise, not because of Fassbender (who is undoubtedly a great actor), but for those who actually were not aware of Job's personality of being a total ass to anyone he had an encounter with (which I did not know). This includes family, close workers and even friends. The story is revolving around Job's denial of him fathering a daughter and ultimately shows how that relationship is resolved over a 14 year period. The other supporting performances are absolutely great. Kate Winslet ever so good in another dramatic role who really is the only character that is able to sort of reign in Jobs. Seth Rogen was the surprise as Woz who was able to break out of his comedic shell and really held his own in his dramatic role. Jeff Daniels is once again in full Will McAvoy form from \"The Newsroom\" and that has everything to do with being around another Aaron Sorkin script and having three years of practice on how to deliver Sorkin's lines. This film is all about the performance of Michael Fassbender, who is sure to get a Best Actor nomination from the Academy, but it has a lot to do with the direction and the script of the movie. The plot does become repetitive within the three time points where you can sort of guess how each specific third of the movie will move along. However, the relationships between the characters and the dialogue (mostly due to Sorkin) are great, but it is a mish mash of three points put together and doesn't really become rounded by the end. Steve Jobs gets a grade of B+",

    "review": "  So let me start off by saying, Steve Jobs is a film that I'm actually excited to talk about! So I'll start off by talking about the unique narrative. Steve Jobs is set behind the scenes at three different product launches set in 1984, 1988, and 1998 basically playing like three short films. Each shot differently with 16mm, 35mm, and digital. Michael Fassbender gives an incredible and iconic performance as Steve Jobs! On the surface he may not look much like Jobs, but the way he embodies the character and makes you feel every type of emotion for him, you no longer see Fassbender on screen, but Jobs himself! The acting in this film is flawless! Kate Winslet electrifies and her chemistry with Fassbender is something special! Seth Rogen gives his best performance as Steve Wozniak who is at times uplifting while also downright heartbreaking, and Jeff Daniels really stole the show for me! Daniels lights up the screen with an energy and bravado that I was not expecting at all! The screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin is no doubt the real star of this film and unexpectedly so. An oscar nom seems like a lock at this point. Director Danny Boyle crafts this film in such a way that is unique and really unlike anything you've seen before! Everything from the editing, cinematography, and score are all pitch perfect! Although not the biopic some would expect or want for that matter, Steve Jobs features oscar caliber performances from Michael Fassbender, Jeff Daniels, Seth Rogen, the entire cast really, amazing screenwriting by Aaron Sorkin, and unique directing from Danny Boyle, and is in my opinion, the best film of 2015!! Check it out when opens everywhere October 23rd! 5 stars out of 5",

    "review": "  Aaron Sorkin�has made a career writing�clever scripts in which characters speak brilliantly conceived (if unrealistically articulate) lines of dialogue in well-structured dramas. Think�\"A Few Good Men,\" \"The American President\" (which led directly to the 7-season television series�\"The West Wing\") and�\"The Social Network.\" That last one is a perfect model for�\"Steve Jobs,\" since it concerns a man deemed both an irrefutable genius and problematic human being. Sorkin got the equation just right there, showing us the virtues and vices of Mark Zuckerberg�in a world that, though clearly a dramatist's construct, felt as if it got the essence of the story right ... or at the very least made it interesting. Director David Fincher (\"Gone Girl\") moved things along briskly, and a good time was had by all (well, maybe not by Zuckerberg). Unfortunately, in Sorkin's new script about another flawed technology pioneer, the construct overshadows the story, and we are left wondering why, as represented by this movie, anyone would want to make a movie about Jobs.Divided into three distinct acts,�\"Steve Jobs\" is a triptych aiming for a�Hieronymus Bosch�take on morality that ends up, instead, as a Margaret Keane air-brushed \"big eyes\" portrait: poster art, in other words, instead of grand painting. There's no shame in superficiality when that is your intention - some of my favorite movies are dumb pleasures - but when you aim high and fall short, the result is a mess. Or, in this case, a shame, since so many good artists give of their sweat and toil. First, we have Danny Boyle (\"28 Days Later\"), the director, usually so deft, who can do nothing with the story but light it dramatically and hope for the best; then, there's Michael Fassbender (\"Frank\"), great as always, who quickly makes you forget that he looks and sounds nothing like Jobs; Kate Winslet (\"The Reader\") plays Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' loyal assistant, the only person capable of standing up to the mercurial founder of Apple, and she is quite fine, too; Jeff Daniels (\"The Newsroom\") is here, as well, as John Sculley, the \"man who fired Steve Jobs,\" and holds his own. There's talent to spare, but it doesn't help the script feel any less schematic.The three sections each focus on a different product launch, first in 1984, then 1988, and finally in 1998: the original Macintosh; Steve Jobs' post-Apple venture, the NeXT cube; and his triumphant return with the blue and white iMac. If you know nothing about the man's life and accomplishments (where have you been the last 40 years?), I recommend Walter Isaacson's excellent biography, the likewise eponymous�\"Steve Jobs,\" on which Boyle's and Sorkin's film is ostensibly based.�The idea of comparing launches makes sense, initially, since Jobs was a master showman, known for putting together impressive introductions to new products. However, what sounds good as an idea doesn't work in practice, since Sorkin populates�each event with the exact same group of people revolving around Jobs, hoping to reveal truths through their changing interactions over time, straining credulity with clunky coincidence. Worse, he pares down Jobs' personal life to a single relationship, that with his daughter, Lisa, whom he refused to acknowledge as his for many years. That story is worth telling, but it can hardly be the only point of entry into the man's mind.I think this may be the worst thing I have ever seen written by Sorkin. Forced, packed with artifice,�with the engineering more visible than the design, the film is more PC than Mac. We feel like we're being lectured to, rather than being shepherded towards something new and fresh. I didn't like Alex Gibney's documentary about Jobs, released earlier this year, but by comparison it looks like the far superior film.",

    "review": "  As a techie I've always suffered from the inability to explain to my non-tech friends what is that exactly that I do for a living. It'd be cool to be able to share at least a tiny part of the world (you can call it bubble) I'm in, because it's an interesting world, competitive, elitist, subdued and often unintentionally funny. I had high hopes for this movie because I thought it will convey or even try to convey parts of that Silicon Valley vibe to people who aren't in it. But it didn't happen at all. It's really hardly believable, and at times reminded me of Interstellar. Change 'Lisa' to 'Murph', dress Michael Fassbender in a space suit, make him obsess over space rather than computers -- and you get 'Interstellar'. The dynamics between characters are so bland that they would really fit anywhere (like 'Interstellar'). So yeah, certainly better than the other 'Steve Jobs', but worse than 'Social Network' and completely unrepresentative of the real IT thing going on in here. Of course, dialogs by Sorkin and acting by Fassbender & Kate Winslet are brilliant, as always, but still.",

The performances are spot on, the dialogue is as snappy as any Aaron Sorkin movie I've seen, the structure keeps the pace going, and Danny Boyle gives the film an energy that compliments Sorkin's writing perfectly. All in all, even if just judging on individual scenes alone, Steve Jobs has some of the best moments in any film I've seen this year. And as a whole, it's almost as good as its excellent individual parts.",

Nein.Egal ob als Genie verehrt oder gehasst, niemand bestreitet, dass Steve Jobs die Welt mit seinen Ideen ver�ndert hat, wie kaum ein anderer Wirtschaftslenker seiner Generation.Sehen sollte man ihn unbedingt trotzdem, einer der Gr�nde ist sicherlich auch die Tochter von Steve Jobs, Lisa Brennon Jobs, die hier von drei Darstellerinnen gespielt wurde, die bestens aufeinander aufbauen: Makenzie Moss (spielt Lisa 5 Jahre alt), Ripley Sobo (9 Jahre) und Perla Haney-Jardine (spielt Lisa im Alter von 19 Jahre, sie spielte schon mit bei Kill Bill ? Volume 2 und Spider-Man 3)Lisa ist so etwas wie eine Klammer, mit der Regisseur Danny Boyle verschiedene Abschnitte in Steve Jobs Leben festh�lt, beginnend 1984 mit der Vorstellung des Mac, 1988 mit der NEXT Episode in Steve Jobs Leben und schlie�lich 1998 mit der Vorstellung des iMacs.Er konzentrierten sich auf einige wenige Episoden im Leben von Steve Jobs, in denen dessen Witwe Lauren Powell nicht vorkommt. Vielleicht einer der Gr�nde, warum diesem im Vorfeld versucht haben soll, den Film zu verhindern, es geht schlie�lich auch nicht mehr und nicht weniger als um die Deutungshoheit �ber das Leben einer Legende..",

    "review": "  Solid film here about three major events in Steve Job's life. The film itself centers around Apple co-founder Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender). The movie is shot following Jobs around before the three main events: the unveiling of the Mac in 1984, the NEXT in 1988 and the iMac in 1998. The film doesn't have any action per se, but is entirely driven by dialogue. It sounds like it could be slow and it actually is a bit slow, but the characters make it very interesting. Fassbender obviously doesn't look like Steve Jobs, but his performance is excellent. He portrays the right amount of craziness, egotistical mannerisms that made Jobs such an asshole to everyone, but it shows that he had a different side to him at times. The film also stars Kate Winslet as Jobs marketing advisor Joanna Hoffman, Seth Rogen as Co-Founder of Apple Steve Wozniak, Jeff Daniels as Apple CEO John Sculley and Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy Hertzfeld engineer and friend to Jobs. The movie is slow paced, but I enjoyed it and felt like it had a good pace despite only relying on dialogue and character interactions. A truly magnificent portrayal of Steve Jobs by Michael Fassbender gives viewers the in depth look into the perfectionist that was Jobs. If this at all interests you I would highly recommend giving this one a look!",

    "review": "  Granted, biopics are really tricky to pull off without the likes of Meryl Streep or Daniel Day Lewis. And, of course, there's usually criticism from those who either love or loathe the main character (for the latter see CBS's reaction to Robert Redford's 'love letter' to Dan Rather). But without pardon, \"Steve Jobs\", the Danny Boyle/Aaron Sorkin collaboration, so missed the mark that it gives credence to the venomous widow as well as to the former partners at Apple, over the depiction. Neither script nor direction were nearly sophisticated and nuanced enough to use the considerable skills of a terrific cast to make even a decent film. As good as he is an actor, Fassbender was miscast in the title role. Meanwhile, judging by the repetitive use of the same locations, the budget lent to this flawed endeavor was hardly 'Jobsian' either. One might consider this a 'Next' production, rather than a 'Mac' one.  Not surprisingly, given the fanaticism for anything Mac, in limited release, this film actually set per theater attendance records. The early adapters were treated with a Steve Jobs, as shallow as one might expect from an after school special. Even children's programmers wouldn't last more than a season airing a film that wavered almost deliberately between 'boringness and the unpleasant'; allowing virtually no insight on genius nor the excitement of invention that we all witnessed live (assuming you have not been in a coma since 1984). A dour tone was displayed immediately following a delightful :30 bit of archival footage, neatly placed at the front end of the film. That this was the film's highlight remains stunning. Notably embarrassing was the portrayal of the famous Macintosh launch, in which the on screen theater crowd was swept up in frenzied anticipation, including them performing the timelessly nerdy 'wave'. In sharp contrast, by the time the preview ticket-buying crowd was meant to enjoy the historic announcement, the air in the real theater had long since been completely sucked from the room. Viewers sat flabbergasted by the utter insignificance of this portrait. I noticed many heads looking around to see if they were missing something ( the universal sign of a film's failure to suspend audience disbelief - in other words, their not buying in.) I recognized this familiar vacuum and disillusionment during a showing of the insulting Jimi Hendrix biopic released last year (but, at least Andre3000 was believable in the title role of that turd). With all good intention, I desperately wanted to love this movie, as I admired so much its subject. Is true genius really that difficult to recreate in narrative form? Just maybe my view and these harsh words come from a deep disappointment that often accompanies unreasonable and then dashed expectations. But this sad entry still finds me kicking myself for wasting precious time, probably better spent watching Fox's version of our ill functioning Congress, Trump \"reality TV', Putin's Middle East folly and the ever present kicks to the groin of Barack and Hillary. Appendix:In hindsight, my eagerness should have been tempered, having read 18 months earlier, that fine filmmaker, David Fincher, originally tapped for this project, and a well know fan of the brilliant Mr. Jobs, left 'the scene' before the crime was perpetrated.",

    "review": "  Steve Jobs is written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle. Itstars Micheal Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels, andMichael Stuhlbarg.Set backstage at three iconic product launches and ending in 1998 withthe unveiling of the iMac, Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of thedigital revolution to paint a portrait of the man, his estranged familyand staff at its epicenter.I honestly can't start this review without saying this easily ties withmy favorite movie of the year, The Gift, for quite a few reasons. Truthbe told this movie has everything needed to build a classic and uses itremarkably.Writer Aaron Sorkin has quite a few gems in his filmography whichinclude Money Ball, Social Network and A Few Good Men. He is asversatile as he is brutal in honesty. He works wonders in this movierevealing the man behind the machine rather than the machine behind theman. Without any scenes of failure or success, Sorkin forces hisaudience to understand the complex and often times revolting centralCharacter. With extremely well written confrontations between Jobs andWozniak or Jobs and his Daughter or even Jobs and his Boss, Sorkinrelentlessly demonstrates the true nature behind the tech giant. Thoughthis movie's central family tension and the Job vs. Apple drama areenthralling, Sorkin injects just enough dry and black comedy to keepthe movie from becoming an influential figure's shaming. With thatbeing said Sorkin also understands that the enormous ego of Steve Jobshad to be exposed as a vice and plays on that brutal fact perfectly.With 4 dimensional characters, great central dramas and pitch perfectcomedy, this might actually be his best work yet.Accompanying the stellar writing was Danny Boyle's beautiful direction.Through seemingly unending shots and aggressive movements the audiencegenuinely feels like their in Job's presence which can be very hard tosit through at times but is ultimately rewarding experience. Withvisible passion from Boyle, this is one powerful ride.To my common readers I mentioned a few weeks back that Black Mass hadthe greatest ensemble cast of the year, I was wrong. This movies castnever really stops acting to the point of absolute realism. To startKate Winslet portrayal of real life Johanna Hoffman was as beautiful asit was naive. She brought the character alive in full force and trulydemonstrated she is one of the best actresses working. I smell anomination coming her way. I had referenced Jeff Daniel's acting lastweek in The Martian, well he completely out did himself. He was tenderat times and shark-like in others. He drew the line betweenintelligence and decency and walks this tight rope carefully. Five yearold Mekenzie Moss also offers an absolutely astounding performance,uttering few but heart wrenching words. Michael Stuhlbarg works wonderas well on a albeit smaller degree. Now onto the two heavy hitters. A surprise to me and my theater alike,Seth Rogan gives the single best dramatic performance of his career. AsSteve Wozniak, the literal opposite of Jobs, Rogan played the role withelegance and brilliance and I wouldn't even mind the Benicio snub ifRogen won the statue. The role demanded a sweet, naive, caring andultimately explosive performance and Rogan more than delivered makingthe scenes of abrasion between him and Fassbender iconic. I have been holding off that name for the entire review because MichealFassbender is the only thing keeping this movie from failing. He dawnsthe character in such a way, I can only compare it to Jake Gyllenhaalfrom Night Crawler and even then I don't think I could fully describeit. Filled to the brim with nuance Fassbender offers a cold,intelligent, manipulative, calculating, and over all disturbinglyrealistic portrayal of Steve Jobs. I really can't envision a bettercast lead than him. As calm as he is diabolical, Fassbender plays thisegotistical narcissist with such precision its close to horrifying towatch. Though calm through most of the movie Fassbender understandswhen to unleash the monster which lays in Jobs and is absolutelyvolcanic while doing so. Under all the deception, tyranny, andtechnological brilliance lays a purely adroit and masterful performance.Though Johnny Depp in Black Mass was great and Ian McClellan in Mr.Holmes was grand, neither of them embodied their characters much likeMicheal Fassbender and it would be a shame and a disservice to cinemaif he didn't with Best Actor. He has proved he is one of the bestactors of the generation.Steve Jobs was a privilege to see on the big screen and is so far tiedwith The Gift as my number one movie of the year. With Deft acting,exquisite direction, and powerful writing this movie is not far from amodern classic. Steve Jobs gets an A+.",

    "review": "  Boyle's unconventional biopic feeds off Aaron Sorkin's evocative structure to tackle the life of an uncompromising and disturbed visionary. In Steve Jobs there is an unflinching desire to portray the man and yet there is this idea that we we can't get to the depth of his complexity despite being told how layered he is. The filmmakers' kinetic, fast-paced and often time voracious inclinations service the pace but hardly the heart and what made Jobs such a seminal figure of our time. There are undeniable touches of greatness in Steve Jobs, mainly with regards to visual cues and Sorkin ever-so eargasmic banter. After all we are talking about filmmakers at the top of their game. The emphasis in style, however, proved to be a disservice to the cinematic language that could have been or, alternatively, that was meant to be. Perhaps that is why the end product, which runs out of ideas pretty quickly, seems meandering and lacking a clear goal whether that is emotional existentialist or even technological. The punchlines land, one after the other, but the essence doesn't.",

    "review": "  Steve Jobs is Aaron Sorkin gone wrong. It's a fast-paced mess of edgy dialog that barely goes under the surface, tells a story that's barely interesting (to me, anyway), and ends up in a place that finally DOES go somewhere, but in a forced way that comes way too late. I came close to leaving the theater a couple of times because I was simply bored. In fact, a slower-paced but deeper and more intriguing screenplay would have held be firmly in my seat. I found myself not giving a whit about Steve Jobs or the people around him, due to how little the movie goes beneath the surface. It tries to, but ends up focusing on the wrong things. I get why Sorkin chose to do it this way, but it was a mistake. In my opinion Steve Jobs didn't do anything significant as a human, aside from help shape some products that a lot of us like, along with some fantastic marketing...which is part of the problem with the movie. It underlines that fact, and it could have done so in a way that's more gripping and fascinating, but instead has a bunch of characters that are simply walking around and talking without much overall movement (again, until the very end). The biography of Steve Jobs is far more interesting, telling, and scintillating that this sleep-inducing effort. I felt no admiration for Jobs after seeing this flick, nor did I feel any supreme disdain, aside from him being a robotic, soulless man who helped market things well. There are some moments of interest and some great acting, but there's no real movie to found here.",

The actors handle Sorkin's relentless pacing brilliantly, making his trademark writing sing. That a film almost entirely constructed by dialogue can bring you to the edge of your seat is a testament to what truly remarkable talent can do when it's all brought together. Impeccably written, directed and acted, Steve Jobs is revolutionary filmmaking, which could not be more fitting for the story it tells.",

    "review": "  What a strange choice for a unique and highly visual real-character: Fassbender is not only inappropriate, but worse, totally unbelievable as Jobs. Also hard to believe that they even used a confusing title for this \"movie,\" given the recent one of such similar name (\"Jobs\" 2013) with a much more appropriate (and talented) actor in the role, Ashton Kutcher (directed by Joshua Michael Stern). The latter is no jewel of a script, and was largely panned by critics. But this was the result of some poor choices in writing and direction, certainly not because of the effort and qualities portrayed by Kutchner. Maybe someday someone will make a really good film about the most unique and complex character that Steve Jobs really was, based on some portrayal of the layers of the person that were so well described by Steven Levey in his book \"Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh, the Computer that Changed Everything.\" This version is not even good for entertainment value, unless all you want is an interesting but detached face.",

    "review": "  Aaron Sorkin's typically razor-ship insights and unique tongue-twisting but deeply intellectual and emotive dialogue get their best showcase yet under the masterfully symphonic direction of Danny Boyle and a totally on-form cast. Shot in three different film formats with an inspired framing device during peak periods of Apple and NEXT's product launches, the film magnifies the human drama of Jobs both in personal and professional ways and, despite his many real-life detractors, paints him with more humanity than he's been given in prior treatments. The film propulsively moves with the breakneck speed of the best action thriller without any explosions or set pieces. The best playwrights have said \"character is action\" and Sorkin deftly manuevers statistics, backstories, family drama and the relentlessness of the pursuit of perfection as themes spun into what amounts as an engineering feat of its own merits. Although it is a meant to be a portrait of a great, misanthropic and by mainstream understanding deeply reviled man, the men who put their blood, sweat and tears into this project ought to be revered generations from now for this once-in-a-blue-moon accomplishment.",

Michael Fassbender delivers a powerhouse performance never once betraying who this man was and the tone he set playing him. Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen and the rest of the supporting cast are great. What's so great about the film is that it doesn't sentimentalize the man at the core but still manages several humane moments with him and his wife/daughter.

    "review": "  While Steve Jobs feels like an already explored territory, with the long lines and satirical tone of an Aaron Sorkin dialogue, delivered in a very fast manner to create enough tension to make it as engaging as possible. You get the feeling from beginning to end that there's a trial to mimic The Social Network in terms of humanizing a tech legend and exposing his flaws on a different side of his life, but even if Aaron Sorkin is the same writer of both screenplays, Danny Boyle's vision is massively different from that of Fincher's, which resulted in a somehow fresh feeling in the delivery of events, pace and general atmosphere. Michael Fassbender is by far the best thing about Steve Jobs, he delivers another brilliant performance as usual and cements his place as one of best and most serious actors alive. Jobs has an all star supporting cast, though only a few of them shine in relatively new roles to their careers (Seth Rogen, Michael Stuhlberg), others fall desperately in between the unorthodox setting in the movie's events, the ,sometimes, tremendously forced dialogue, and ultimately fail in even giving an average performance (Kate Winslet, Kathrine Waterston, Jeff Daniels). All in all, even though the material has been used before, and Sorkin has lost his touch to an extent, Steve Jobs still feels like an original biopic, all thanks to a visionary director and a simple yet mesmerizing performance by its lead.",
