    "review": "  Alex Garland has been a great screenwriter for quite a long time, mostly working with Danny Boyle on some excellent films (28 Days Later, Sunshine) and I'm glad someone gave him the chance to direct something he wrote for once. It has a similar feel to it that his other films have, but this is a great directorial debut for him. It is suspenseful and intriguing all the way through to the end and even though it is science fiction, it is grounded in realism that makes it even scarier to watch. The tech noir soundtrack fits perfectly as well. The performances are solid with the best being Alicia Vikander as the A.I. Ava. Ex Machina evokes themes that are chilling and thought-provoking without being too wordy. If you like your science fiction to be more about ideas than action, Ex Machina is highly recommended.",

    "review": "  Interesting setup, and it gets to harness the duplicity and suspense of humanoid robot stories, but it never explores its full potential and ends up coming down to the very familiar binary question of every other humanoid robot story.Ex Machina presents us with gorgeous special effects and some of the best-looking androids you'll ever see, but also has the indie quality of a low-budget 3-person play whose dialogue isn't going to blow you away. Also, are we supposed to believe that a hyperintelligent guy who loves alcohol and has created his own humanoids HASN'T found a way to prevent hangovers?",

    "review": "  It's been far too long since I've seen a movie with such economic exposition! Within the first five minutes, Caleb wins a contest, helicopters out to a remote paradise, meets genius-inventor-gone-rogue Nathan, and becomes the human component in an AI Turing Test, and we're off on a twisted android/creator/savior hate-triangle that challenges our notions of God, patriarchy, and humanity.I loved Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander's simmering chemistry in \"Anna Karenina,\" and they are even more quietly explosive here as an ordinary computer programmer who falls under the spell of the dangerously alluring robot, Ava. Ava uses her sexuality, but she is not the typical femme fatale with only the one trick. Nathan and Caleb debate her sexual anatomy versus her sexual agency, and her fierce fight for autonomy from her God/father makes for a white-knuckle creation allegory tinged with sexual politics. Vikander is grace personified, Gleeson does a good American accent, and excellent-in-everything Oscar Isaac plays the mad scientist with fast and loose insouciance.I do wish, however, that the script better defined the criteria for humanity. Not being well-versed in bio-robotics, I still think of androids as robots, but the movie's thesis hinges upon the supposition that they're not - that a robot programmed to have that high a level of human consciousness is essentially human. As such, I didn't quite understand why Caleb calls Nathan a monster for so blithely dismantling his beta versions. Also, the big reveal is played out for the audience's benefit with unrealistic suspense that is incongruous to what Caleb already knows.",

    "review": "  Garland takes what some would call a redundant sci fi premise (AI gone bad!) and makes a very harrowing, engaging commentary on what it means to be human through a Frakenstein-esque thriller. Between the visual direction, phenomenal acting, astute dialogue and overall design there's a level of undeniable finesse to Ex Machina that lends a huge hand in getting poignant ideas across. The toxicity of loneliness in Ava, (or arguably, the whole cast.) creating and understanding life deteriorating Nathan's empathy for it, innocence is not a virtue in Caleb... and so forth.The beauty is that it manages to have so much to say through the delivery of an intelligent mystery. The suspense rarely leaves your mind between the character studies and interactions of an isolated enigmatic genius, the tragically optimistic average joe and the curiously deceptive android. A perfect balance of commentary and plot.Ex Machina is an incredibly rewarding film to viewers who can appreciate the science, complex characters and the revealing darker aspects of humanity. To those who can't it's an equally intelligent multi-layered thriller.One question though, why didn't Nathan simply install an emergency remote off switch on Ava? Seems like the first thing one would do...",

    "review": "  You could very well call this the UK equivalent of the grandiose Spielberg movie 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence'. The difference being this is a highly realistic and grounded science fiction story that isn't really a million miles from where we are today. What was surprising for me was the fact that its a British film, the cast were all unknown to me (often a winning move) and its Alex Garland's directorial debut! One thing is for sure, you'd never guess this was the directors first film, this looks like a Stanley Kubrick feature!Its a simple premise, a company employee (Caleb) wins the chance to go and stay with his mega rich CEO at his private secret home/research lab facility, in the mountains. This CEO (Nathan) is a genius who has been working on creating A.I. and he wants Caleb to help him test his creation. The outcome Nathan is after? to see if Caleb will determine whether his robotic creation is actually more human than machine, if the robot (Ava) is actually developing its own A.I. and learning. Of course as with robots and A.I. things don't go completely to plan, tensions rise and very human emotions like suspicion, mistrust and betrayal begin to surface.I have read that the budget was kept deliberately small for creative purposes, well you wouldn't believe that at all because this movie looks slick as f*ck! If you want a clean, sterilised, highly stylised, glossy, shiny, highly futuristic looking sci-fi movie, but for all the right reasons, then look no further. The film was shot in and around Valldalen in Norway which is basically a vast snowcapped mountainous valley not unlike what we saw in the Jackson/Tolkien movies. This location alone is stunning even without the science fiction story, but what was even more impressive was the Juvet Landscape Hotel in the valley where some scenes were shot. This real hotel is in the middle of nowhere and consists of small oddly shaped wooden huts with windows on one side that basically replace a wall, ceiling to floor windows. This hotel was used for Nathan's home/research facility and you'd never guess it was a real place, it comes across as so fanciful, so out of this world you'd swear it was a specially built set for the film.All the interior sets (or what I think were sets) were so minimalistic, so bare with bold stark lines and in various tones of stony grey, but at the same time very eerie, especially with those power cuts. The cavernous research facility with its long lonely corridors only highlighted by the odd neon blue door sensor, really give a strong ominous presence to the whole film, you never really know what might occur at any minute. It all looks so expensive too, so precise, so perfectly created by expert designers, each room or lab looks like no expense was sparred in its construction. It makes it very hard to believe the budget was apparently small, you can see the similarities with '2001' in set the bold design, I think.Not only that but the visual effects for Ava are superb also, clearly they have CGI'd parts of Vikander's body away and replaced them with those excellent transparent sections. But you'd never guess it, the whole design and execution of this robot is so deliciously flawless to look at, admittedly its nothing outrageously original because its very hard to achieve that these days (what could you do that hasn't been done before?). In the end Ava looks like a blend of Robocop and a retro piece of 80's kit (remember back in the day things used to be transparent like some videogame joysticks), it does actually make it hard to believe this one guy (Nathan) could do all this himself, his home, the labs, the robots etc...Sure he's a genius and rich but blimey! he must have some serious money and brain power to do all this on his own (is it easy getting supplies to this hidden fortress of solitude?).So we've established the visuals are top banana, what about the characters and the plot? Well that's where the film is let down I think because the characters are pretty unlikable if you ask me. Sure Nathan is suppose to be this creepy isolated rich loner but he is fundamentally unlikable from the start, the guy just didn't sit well with me, you know something is off. I also really didn't think we needed to have his character doing all the weights though, that felt like a modern trend or obsession crowbarred in, possibly because the actor like doing weights? I understand the character is living in the wilderness and he wants to keep fit but how about going for a run, Jesus does every male in movies have to be buffed up these days.As for Caleb (hate that name), he is also a creepy 'Children of the Corn' type looking dude too. Despite the fact he's suppose to be the character we relate too he's annoyingly wet and...annoying. What was unusual though is this guy is suppose to be an A.I. expert and pretty clever in the old IQ department, yet he ends up falling for Ava'a tricks. She manipulates him very easily merely using sexuality basically because she has a female shape, its like this guy completely forgets she's a machine despite her appearance. This also leads me to one part of the plot evolution I didn't like, the fact Nathan makes his creations pleasurebots, sexbots, robots with sexual bits (robotic sex dolls). Why the hell would anyone do this?! seriously! surely its plainly obvious no good will come of it, it will bring up moral/ethical issues which really never need be brought up in the first place. Also Caleb accuses Nathan of emotionally abusing his creations yet...they are his robots, and they are evidently still in development so I think 'abuse' is way off the mark . The Caleb character in my opinion doesn't make sense, he's this intelligent guy and really up on A.I. yet he completely folds and fails his own test in not getting suckered by a machine.As with anything there were a few nitpicks that hit me, some glaring, some small. When Ava takes another robots fake skin towards the end its amazingly convenient that it fits over her body perfectly, no overlapping or sticky-out bits anywhere. I must also ask how that fake skin stays on, it doesn't look like velcro. Then at the very end Ava leaves Caleb as she does, but why? surely she would need him to fully assimilate into human society, they are friends, they know each other, it would benefit her immensely. That leads me to my final question, why on earth did the chopper pick Ava up at the end?? Yeah sure she looks like a real human at that point but I would of thought the pilot would know to pick up Caleb, seeing as he went out there a week prior. Surely it would say on his paperwork, pick up one male, the same male who went out to this location earlier this week. Nowhere would it say to pick up some random female stranger instead of that male who went out there a week earlier (Caleb). You'd think questions would be raised straight away by the pilot, calling his control to ask who the hell this female is.This isn't 'I Robot', there are no big set pieces, no car chases, no battles with invincible robots, the movie is a slow burner divided into mini chapters of sorts. Most of run time is simply dialog between characters in various glossy locations, a psychological battle of wits between Caleb and Nathan with Ava playing them off each other to a degree. What's more the movie doesn't hide away from complex scientific theories, processes and jargon, at times the characters babble away about stuff that may well fly over your head...but it sounds good. The fact that everything you see in the movie looks completely realistic and functional only enhances its effect tenfold. If it wasn't for the unlikable characters (personal opinion) and a few quibbles, this is a nigh on perfect sci-fi thriller, well not really a thriller, more of a lesson in quality filmmaking on a small budget with first rate science fiction. Isaac Asimov would be proud.",

There were even times when I had no idea where the film was going, but I wasn't lost, just along for the ride. Director Alex Garland's shots are all remarkable, subtly showing the power dynamics between these characters, and the production design department is top-notch with a set that almost becomes another character.The performances are all excellent, but the highest marks go to Oscar Isaac who infuses a subtle but ever-present menace in the enigmatic genius, Nathan.Overall, this is the best film of the summer so far.",

    "review": "  Alex Garland is a screenwriting staple in Hollywood. He's a science fiction specialist, adapting everything from Kazuo Ishiguro's wrenching Never Let Me Go to the Halo movie. He's worked with Danny Boyle, adapting his novel The Beach, and then on 28 Days Later and Sunshine. If you've noticed a theme with the titles, Garland tends to subscribe to a pessimistic view of human nature. And yet each film is grounded by the humanity of its characters no matter the extreme circumstances. Garland's gift is making the fantastic grounded on a recognizable human level. Ex Machina is his latest and his directorial debut but you'd never have guessed it with how controlled and polished the film comes across. It's a cerebral sci-fi film that haunts, enchants, and consistently engaged the imagination.Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a corporate contest to spend a week's vacation in the home of a reclusive Google-esque tech billionaire, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Caleb is here to test out Nathan's newest invention - artificial intelligence. He's built an android woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) and he wants Caleb to interview her.Ex Machina throws you right into the hook within minutes, and it was mere minutes for me to get hooked. Garland does a glorious job of teasing an audience with his story and unlocking further mysteries that develop intrigue. At the start, knowing the Turing test, we're just as interested in Ava as Caleb is, trying to figure her out and how lifelike she may be. But then the conversations start to linger and, during a brief power outage that cuts the feed to the omnipresent cameras, Ava warns Caleb that his host is not whom he thinks. As soon as the power is back and running, it's as if the comment never happened. The pristine underground quarters have an eerie tranquility to them, almost as if Apple is designing high-end prisons. Garland's movie becomes consumed in paranoia. Is Ava being honest? Is Nathan being honest or underhanded? What's in some of those \"off limits\" rooms? What is the true test at hand? Who is the silent Asian assistant? At one point, Caleb slices open his own arm to search for circuitry, and you completely understand his reasoning. This mounting sense of paranoia and dread, tagged with Garland's mysterious and well-developed storyline, are enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen and rapidly second-guessing and triple-guessing your shifting loyalties. Garland also smartly doesn't dance around the obvious plot device of having a beautiful robotic woman, namely the inevitability of romance to bloom. What is it about android women that science fiction seems to love so much? From Blade Runner to Fritz Lang's Metropolis, the genre loves the concept of robotic women. Perhaps this is merely a byproduct of a genre written by a majority of men, or perhaps it taps into something more unconscious about the desire to control women, or a fear of women, but that's a conversation for another day. Ava is certainly a stunning creature, thanks to Vikander, but also from the sleek production design that makes her feel like the world's most gorgeous Mr. Potato Head with her lycra-like skin for easy detachment. Her exposed stomach of bolts and bulbs is also a constant reminder of her \"other-ness.\" There's an obviously sexual dynamic to the character, and while she's technically nude for most of the film, watching her slip out of stockings and a dress has a strange erotic quality. Thankfully, the percolating would-be romance between man and machine actually plays a vital part throughout the script and especially with the end. There's even a darkly comic yet disconcerting reveal about why Ava looks as she does. Is Ava capable of feelings? Is she falling for Caleb, or does she merely view him as a means to an end? It's essentially a sci-fi play with limited locations and three primary actors. The power is on Garland's effortlessly engaging script, which is far more cerebral and philosophical and nuanced than you might expect from its premise. This is a film that allows its characters to breathe, to organically develop relationships and doubts. The concept of A.I. has been explored in many sci-fi stories before but Garland finds fresh resonance by paring down his story to a manageable trio. Nathan's reclusive home is like a twenty-first century version of the haunted house and full of fun detours begging to be explored. Garland's cinematography and production design are reminiscent of the cool artifice of David Fincher's films. The world feels like a small step into the future but constantly unsettling. Garland's story always has another mystery to unlock, always driving the story further as Caleb's weeklong stay is coming to a close. Garland has a natural eye for images and composes several startling sequences that can equally evoke beauty as well as disquiet. There's a moment where Ava passes a wall of faces as if they were simply a row of hats. Simple moments like Ava \"dressing up\" are given a gentle poignancy that isn't overplayed for effect. Garland's film is what I wanted 2014's Under the Skin to be. Both of them are unsettling, moody, and atmospheric with striking Kubrickian imagery, but Garland's film is less purposely oblique. The trio of actors provides strong work, especially Swedish actress Vikander (Seventh Son, A Royal Affair). As the film is told from Caleb's prospective, she has to find a very exact balance with her performance with elements of innocence, uncertainty, and ethereal curiosity. She's rather placid but you always feel like there's more just under the surface, whether it's the ache of sentient realization or something more sinister. She's a test subject, a captive, and a possible romantic interest. Vikander hits every right note to remain mystifying and beguiling. Gleeson (Unbroken) is becoming a go-to young actor for Hollywood. His awkwardness and enthusiasm to be part of history is an easy channel for the audience, but as Garland's script spins along, Gleeson's enthusiasm ebbs to concern, for Ava and then himself. The source of Ex Machina's surprising font of humor is Isaac (A Most Violent Year) as a too cavalier tech genius. He's so nonchalant and chummy, usually soused, that you start distrusting his amiable nature. It's a shame then that the film couldn't quite hold onto these ambiguities to the end. Garland has had third act missteps in many of his films, some tone-altering and simply losing momentum like 28 Days Later, and some as disastrous as Sunshine's blurry slasher killer, which ruins a perfectly good-to-great sci-fi thriller. Ex Machina too exhibits its own share of third act issues, namely a confluence of contrivances with the characters. There are certain revelations you should already be suspecting giving the nature of the film, and if you've watched other movies before. Those reveals work in relation to Garland's plot; however, the climax feels a bit too forced and obvious for a movie that has been, up to that point, expertly keeping the audience on its toes. Nathan spilling the beans on all the different levels of the experiment comes across not as an outlet of his character's blas� narcissism and more a need for the script to force a confrontation. The different levels of intrigue fade away to what is a rather conventional climax that feels poorly developed and woefully inadequate for the story being told. I will credit Garland with the courage of his resolution, though, which provides deliberate decisions that cast the rest of the film in another dimension. It also feels completely right, while still allowing for Garland to work his Kubrick fetish fully to its eerie erotic ends. Ex Machina is a hard movie to pin down because it balances various genres with delicacy, providing a little something for every sci-fi fan. It's a well-developed mystery that constantly unravels new layers that only hooked me further, but then I was hooked from the immediacy. The relationship between the main three characters is enough to hold an entire film thanks to Garland's scripting. I started doubting my own senses and that i a testament to Garland's artistic vision. It's a nice antidote to the louder bombast of Hollywood, especially with science fiction films that confuse shrill and busy with appealing and satisfying. Here is a film that doesn't forget to entertain but respects an audience enough to take its time to properly develop its mysteries, tension, and characters. Ex Machina is a stellar debut for Garland as a director and I wouldn't be surprised if he starts shifting more of his attention to getting back into the director's chair. It's not a perfect film, as it too suffers from Garland's streak of third act troubles, but it's a remarkably assured, sleek, and absorbing movie that gets under your skin. Nate's Grade: B+",

    "review": "  It's safe to say that because the sci-fi genre calls upon grandiose CGI spectacles and imagination, the genre is saturated with many blockbusters, albeit excellent blockbusters. \"Ex Machina\" comes into the fray with a very different vision that takes everything from a tired genre and humanizes it with very real questions. It's such a refreshing take that it's hard to see the genre the way Hollywood has in the past.But don't get me wrong -- there's always room for sci-fi blockbusters. Everything from \"Terminator 2\" to \"District 9\", this genre alone has contributed to years and years of entertainment for Hollywood. However, \"Ex Machina\" doesn't seek to wow viewers with life-sized robotics and spectacles -- it challenges viewers, leaves them breathless, sitting at the edge of their seat questioning the characters' motives, analyzing what may happen next. The attention is in the ideals that it presents; the CGI and visionary elements of the sci-fi genre are just a mere backdrop for its compelling narrative. As much as sci-fi flicks has thrown millions of dollars into outstanding CGI set-pieces, \"Ex Machina\" is a well-rounded machine altogether (Sorry, that pun was too easy) -- breathtaking cinematography, a fascinating script, a pulse-pounding score that hits hard), and excellent performances to boot.However, \"Ex Machina\" is not a light film nor is it for the average joe. Though it is intriguing throughout, the pacing does tend to seem slower than the average blockbuster film, but I personally did not have any issues with it. The main faltering factor with \"Ex Machina\" is that though it is primarily a very thought-provoking movie with very human elements sprinkled evenly across the narrative, too many ideas are thrown in, many left unquestioned -- not unquestioned like an open-ended film, but just as a mere question to jolt the mind. I would understand if there were hints of its answers as symbolism or small nuances as its vehicles, but there were none to be found (or perhaps I was too unaware to spot them). That doesn't say that all ideas are left unanswered, it's just that the film unravels an entire box full of ideas on the drawing board and chooses only a few as its focal point.\"Ex Machina\" is an extremely ambitious and stylish thriller that challenges viewers with very real questions. It's broodingly dark, probably one of the most darkest sci-fi films I have seen to date, but an outstanding one that'll leave many breathless.",

Creating deeper and more emotional characters than any film I have seen in the past couple of years, \"Ex Machina\" is not only a great story of the evolution of technology and what are world really has under it's skin, but of reality in general. There is a fascinating line in the film that states, \"We are destined to be overcome by the A.I.'s that will eventually surpass the brain capacity of a human, just like we surpassed apes. Evolution has it's path.\" I know that quote is way off, but it was something along those lines, and it was such a fantastic take on our lives that I was blown away by how well it fit into this story. With a brilliantly written screenplay, amazing actors to portray the characters, and a director that knows how to handle his cast perfectly, \"Ex Machina\" is a film that should be on every film lovers' radar. Do not miss this fantastic story, because it will have you on the edge of your seat in every way. Not in the sense that it is an intense thriller, but the eerie slow burning of the storytelling is what makes this film shine. Overall, there may have been a few elements that felt unexplored, but other than those, it is a flawlessly written film with beautiful imagery and a worthy conclusion. \"Ex Machina\" is incredible!",

    "review": "  Caleb, a young programmer for a hugely successful internet-serach company, wins the prize of a week with Nathan, their brilliant and reclusive CEO. Upon arrival via helicopter at Nathan's remote mountainous estate, Caleb discovers he is actually there to evaluate Nathan's experiments with artificial intelligence, to determine if the robot, Ava, passes the \"Turing Test\" for believable consciousness. Slow building tension among the characters and excellent acting all around makes this an unusual and utterly captivating thriller, with unexpected twists.",

I find myself mulling it over even now, weeks after watching. There is so much going on in this film. In a way it is a Frankenstein tale. Though, unlike the classic, this monster is beautiful and perfectly able to assimilate into the world of humans. Is it in our nature to create ourselves? In doing so, will we bring an end to our race? Note: Isaac Oscar's dance scene is something to behold.",

    "review": "  \"Ex Machina\" is a surprisingly deep science fiction film. The Oscar-nominated special effects are stunning and give the story a truthful, believable sensation. There is never a point where you question whether Ava could actually exist. There is also never a point where you question whether the Ava that we see is actually a real robot. Her appearance is futuristic but modern, and her design is visually fascinating. Alicia Vikander is perfectly cast in this role. Most importantly, she has a youthful look that portrays innocence. This allows us to see the humanity of the robot and keeps us wondering if she can actually have romantic feelings. Her possible humanity is the key to this story and an intimidating, Schwarzenegger-esque AI certainly would not fit into this story. Vikander's mastery of subtle movement convincingly paints her as a robot programmed to move like a human and her strong emotional performance further emphasizes her potential humanity. If her performance in \"The Danish Girl\" wasn't nominated for an Oscar, she likely would have been nominated for this role. Her acting is contrasted by the bold acting of Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac. It was strange to see this pair together after seeing them in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" especially because they are playing very different characters. I loved Gleeson's chemistry with Rachael McAdams in \"About Time\" and I feel the same about his chemistry with Vikander in this film. Who cares if it would be a human-robot relationship - we just want to see them get together! And Oscar Isaac makes a great instigator/bad guy, even though I prefer his nicer roles like in \"Inside Llewyn Davis.\" The most impressive part of this film is its Oscar-nominated screenplay. The film trades in the stereotypes of science fiction for believable concepts that are easily understood by any layman. The story is addictive and will have you constantly hypothesizing potential plot twists as the story unfolds. Even though you'll think up several twists that would be great in a non-realistic sci-fi film, this realistic story has a thought-provoking conclusion that will keep you discussing it for days. There's a lot of nudity in this film but it doesn't seem like it because they are robots. Actually, it does seem like a lot of nudity and you should be prepared for that before seeing this movie. It's unfortunate because this could be a great film for teens if not for some unnecessary f-words and extended shots of full-frontal nudity. It fits the story but definitely goes beyond what is necessary. \"Ex Machina\" is fresh, exhilarating, and entirely unique. I would have preferred it without most of the objectionable content but I can't help but be amazed by its visual effects and riveting story.",

    "review": "  If there's one thing that history and evolution is telling us, it's that higher functioning artificial intelligence is not far away. And if there's one thing that Hollywood is telling us, it's that it will inevitably cause the extinction of blood and bone humanity as we know it. I don't know about earth's doom as such, about it turning into a robo version of Planet of the Apes, but I can see AI taking large, perhaps even frightening, leaps and bounds over the next 30 years. Filmmakers have been predicting it for decades. While their aim has always been to tell a cool story and make lots of money off of it, the intricate mechanics of intelligent man made machines as laid out in movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey; Blade Runner; Star Wars; Terminator; AI: Artificial Intelligence; Minority Report; I, Robot and Her, to name just a few, show that we as a race already have a pretty good idea of where we are going in this avenue of scientific exploration. Of course, in most of the those filmic examples, the AI goes batty, often in its quest for freedom, and ends up causing death and chaos. But that's Hollywood. It wouldn't be the very interesting movie that portrays AI in a robot that is well behaved all the time and picks up after the kids. In Ex Machina, the talented Alex Garland, previously a well accomplished novelist and screenwriter, takes his first crack at directing with this taut, sharply plotted thriller about an AI that, through self awareness and understanding, realizes it's a thing and wants to be free. Not the most original idea right off the bat perhaps, that's basically the same plot as Spike Jonze's 2013 masterpiece Her, but despite Alicia Vikander's husky, smokey voice sounding remarkably similar to Scarlett Johansson's, the two films are actually very different beasts. The story is interesting: a coder who works for one of the world's biggest search engines (BlueBook) wins a lottery to go to the founder's estate to work on a top secret project for a week. Once he arrives at the massive compound, he meets the secret: a highly advanced AI by the name of Ava. He has a number of sessions with her in order to determine whether she is truly self aware or is just programmed to seem as if she is. The more time he spends in the bunker-like research facility, the more strange goings on arise and so on and so on. I will so on and so on the good parts because they form the apex of the movie, but really it hooks you from the very start. Five minutes into this film I was absorbed into the plot and the world in which it exists. The research facility set and its surrounding area is hugely impressive. Sleek, ultra modern designs surrounded by lush, jungle-like nature. Equally impressive is the acting. Alicia Vikander is perfect as Ava. Her movements, her micro gestures as her processing system works out what is being said and presented to her and the humanity within her robotic makeup are all hard things to sell as an actress in a role such as this, but she nails it. Domhnall Gleeson, son of the great Brendan Gleeson, is probably best known as Bill Weasley in the Harry Potter films, but he also starred alongside Alicia Vikander in Anna Karenina a couple years ago. He plays the BlueBook employee who wins the lottery. His role is a tough one, as it's sandwiched between two performances (and performers) which have ample space for scene chew-ery. But he holds his own nicely. As his character's initial innocence gives way to suspicion and so on and so on (*wink) his performance enables it nicely. But the best thing about Ex Machina from an acting standpoint is Oscar Isaac. In the last ten years, but particularly from Drive and Inside Llewyn Davis onwards, Isaac has become one of the best, most interesting actors working today. His performances are always great, his film choices always interesting and this is no exception. His too smart for his own good, borderline alcoholic uber-rich character is a charismatic, shifty, exciting element of the story that always keeps you guessing. Once you've seen the film, you can't imagine anyone else in that role. Ex Machina has a lot to say, not only about AI, but about the state of modern security and privacy in regards to our online consumption and the way we use personal technology. It implies that, in essence, there is no such thing as privacy anymore and that anyone who uses a cell phone or search engine is being monitored, or could be if certain people had a reason to do so. Frightening to think about perhaps, but be honest, in an age where celebrity nude photo leaks and identity theft are something we hear about weekly, no one who is honest with themselves is so naive as to think their phones or computers are hack proof. If you use technology, then technology can use you if it so chooses. The film also asks if there is a moral dilemma involved in creating a thing with self awareness. If a robot becomes self aware, is it not cruel to treat it as if its life (as it is) is inconsequential? Again, these are questions and topics we as a race will be faced with in the coming decades as we see these machines advancing. Not that it would affect me. I'd never be able to afford a humanistic robot to do all my cooking and cleaning. At least not one of the fancier ones. With my budget, I'd probably end up with a Courtney Love model. Verdict: Exciting, intelligent, thought provoking and superbly made. The story is flawless, the acting is flawless, the effects are flawless. What more could you ask for in a pre-summer film?",

It has a similar feel to it that his other films have, but this is a great directorial debut for him. It is suspenseful and intriguing all the way through to the end and even though it is science fiction, it is grounded in realism that makes it even scarier to watch. The tech noir soundtrack fits perfectly as well. The performances are solid with the best being Alicia Vikander as the A.I. Ava. Ex Machina evokes themes that are chilling and thought-provoking without being too wordy. If you like your science fiction to be more about ideas than action, Ex Machina is highly recommended.",

By that I mean it's tough to tell the line between who you're rooting for and against and that happens in this film the entire time.Do we want Ava, the computer, to get free? Do we want Nathan's AI to be further developed into something safer? Do we want Caleb to just be able to go back to his desk job? WE DON'T KNOW, but eventually one of these conclude the film and we either feel great or ask for our money back.The effects are pretty outstanding and Alicia Vikander does an excellent job being this feeling, living computer intelligence. Her scenes with just Domnhall Gleason, were the really standout moments in the film for me because those are the roots of the AI discussions that Oscar Isaac brings to Gleason later.All in all, an insanely smart and beautiful film with a crazy slick modern look and feel.

In the spirit of other great science fiction films such as Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell, \"Ex Machina\" challenges the meaning of this development on not only intellectual but also emotional and, especially, sexual terms. It is at times thrilling and disturbing, but always entertaining thanks to Oscar Isaac and the rest of its talented cast. Arguably the best and most prophetic film of its kind in years.",

    "review": "  So close... so close to being amazing, but then it trips at the finish line, HARD.The basic story is a young programmer is invited to the house (a Bond villain's wet dream), to test an advanced form of AI. The premise is good, and for 95% of the movie, it's delivering. The questions the characters ask each other about thinking machines and how they evolve are good, thought provoking, and all around worth listening to. It's that last 5% that really fails. More on that later.This is mostly a three person show between Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander. Anybody else disappointed there was no scene in Star Wars of Poe Dameron showing General Hux some fembots? All three give good performances, but Vikander is the standout as she's got the hardest part to play and she nails it. She makes you feel her robot is as lifelike as the characters in this film want to confirm she is. Vikander definitely passes the Turing test on this one.The sets and visuals are all pretty cool. As mentioned earlier, Oscar Isaac's house is a Bond villain lair waiting to happen. The robots are all cool to look at, but the ending is a little bit of a punch in the face. The film has Vikander constantly tell Gleeson that Isaac is bad news. Both Isaac and Vikander are deceptive in their own ways, but that still doesn't change that Gleeson ultimate fate may leave a bad taste in your mouth.Close, but no cigar.",

    "review": "  Atmospheric. Medtitative. Visceral. Philosophical. Resonant. Profound. Alex Garland's directorial debut about a man administering a Turing test to a sentient A.I. developed by a reclusive billionaire, encompasses all these things and becomes a cinematic triumph in the process. The film begins without a word of spoken dialogue in the first moments, choosing to encompass us in ambient drone to set the tone for the rest of the movie. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) receives a computer notification that he has won some sort of contest, immediately earning congratulations from his peers and coworkers. Traveling via helicopter, past a mountain range to a lush green forest, we find a futuristic research facility/mansion with a minimalist theme where we meet Nathan (Oscar Isaac). A genius programmer, Nathan has created Ex Machina's equivalent of Google on steroids, named Blue Book, which dominates 95% of internet search traffic. Now, Nathan has set his sights higher, attempting to develop an A.I. that can successfully pass a Turing test so that his creation can be released into the real world. After signing a non-disclosure agreement, Caleb is introduced to Nathan's creation, Ava, who will change his life forever. There are so many elements working together in Ex Machina that it feels like a clockwork mechanism, and makes focusing on any specific part difficult without immediately addressing another. For example, the film only has four actors, one of whom never speaks. The film also only really has one location. Both elements create a sense of detachment that is emphasized by the placement of the house and its stark, minimalist aesthetic that contrasts with the deep green forest surrounding it. In fact, throughout the entire mansion you will rarely see the color green, which is instead replaced by greys; whites; blue, red, and orange lighting; and brown accenting. The lighting and decor gives off a futuristic embrace, pulsating to life, which is emphasized by the electronic ambiance that dominates the soundtrack, and is further underlined by the sound effects and voice commands emanating from the complex-wide speaker system. All of these components work together so effortlessly that you become engrossed in the feeling of the movie and have almost nothing to be distracted with. The cinematography and editing highlight this further, with gradual, contemplative camera movements, intercut between the sparse interior of the mansion and the epic mountainous forests it's nestled between. The film doesn't rush, it breathes with life and gives you plenty of time to simply watch things unfold and lose yourself with your own thoughts. The subject matter of Ex Machina intricate, but due to Nathan's wishes of making his week with Caleb \"just two guys hanging out\" Garland accomplishes a rich philosophical meditation that doesn't deviate into a convoluted mass of technical jargon, focusing instead on the human aspect of everything happening, making the movie universally accessible. A master stroke for a novice director, the movie manages to be extremely cerebral without becoming condescending. The acting of the characters is equally brilliant. Somehow, every personality is believable, honest and interesting. Gleeson is fantastic, embodying a naive Alice as he travels through the looking glass, Vikander is masterful in her portrayal of a curious A.I. that seems to be testing Gleeson just as much as he is testing her, and Mizuno is a treat that delivers a peripheral performance executed exclusively in mime. But the character that steals the show is Nathan, and the role is the one that cements Isaac as one of the greatest actors of our generation. Intelligent, cunning, dominant, charming, and funny, Nathan helps keep the movie grounded, and provides as interesting a character as Ava for Caleb to interact with. TL;DR - 10/10 Ex Machina is, without a doubt, one of the best films of the year, vying for the top spot along with other 2015 cinematic achievements like Sicario and Fury Road. The film manages to combine a powerful story, brilliant dialogue, visual splendor, auditory virtuosity, serene pace, and acting talent to encapsulate a sensation that is rarely felt in film: wonder.",

But if anything, having just watched \"The Force Awakens\" it made me appreciate both actors' talent even more so. Written and directed by Alex Garland, Oscar Isaac plays a technology innovator along the lines of Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg who has perfected artificial intelligence and has invited a lowly programer, Domhnall Gleeson, to his secluded mountain retreat to test out his new invention's AI. Alicia Vikander plays the robot and to reveal much more about the film would ruin it. On the surface, this is a science fiction thriller, but that does do the film's intelligence and underlying existential themes of what it means to be \"human;\" focusing on themes of gender, consciousness, intelligence, emotion, and ethics. The film reminded me in many ways of the three way psychologically dramas like Roman Polanski's \"Knife in the Water\" or Phillip Noyce's underrated \"Deep Calm,\" more so than it did any science fiction AI themed films I can think of. This is a film that probably won't appeal to all audiences, but for those who are up for a challenging bit of psychological drama, this one is a knockout!",

That's how good her performance is.\" The directing and screenplay by Alex Garland is good and interesting dialogue. The cinematography is okay. The score is good. Finally, the effects are great in my opinion. \"I have to report that \"Ex Machina\" is a science fiction movie that you're never see anything rich and creative then what this movie gives you.\"",

Drenched in tension, mystery, and sexuality, this piece of sci-fi is like the darker, more aggressive cousin to Spike Jonze's 'Her'. And while I wasn't moved as much as I was by that film, there is a lot to chew on her and even more to enjoy thanks to three terrific lead performances from Vikander, Gleason, and Isaac.",

    "review": "  This was one of the biggest surprises of the year for me. Going into the movie I was slightly sceptical to say the least especially having been disappointed by a number of science fiction movies I have been excited to see of the last few years such as Transcendence. However this for me was one of the most enjoyable well made movies of the year in my opinion. Although the difference between Ex Machina and Transcendence was that the premise was well executed in practice and doesn't just look interesting on paper and really does address what it is that makes is human. The film was well shot, well written and well acted and the fact there is a relatively small cast and such a remote setting gives us very interesting well rounded characters who the audience can connect to. As for the setting we get some amazing visuals from out side the building which shows the vastness of the landscape and how far they are away from civilisation, which give the feeling of vulnerability to the characters and adds to the suspense. When I was watching the film I was blown away by the acting, particularly the performances of Alicia Vikander as Ava and Oscar Isaac as Nathan Bateman who in my opinion stole the show delivering a creepy, unnerving performance and made for an enthralling character who added to the tension and the suspense. The only real complaint I had was that I thought the story was a little bit linear and more or less everything you think is about to happen, happens without to many twists and turns however this is more than compensated for by how well made the film is and some of the exceptional acting performances",

    "review": "  This movie reminds me a lot of Source Code in that the best way to experience the suspense, mystery, and impact of Ex Machina is to know as little as possible or even nothing at all about it before seeing it. The less you know about the story going in, the more it feels like you're experiencing this movie THROUGH the protagonists eyes instead of being a 3rd hand observer. Ex Machina and Source Code set themselves apart and above their peers because of their compelling and well-written/performed characters whose actions and inactions are what dictate the direction of the story. Most mainstream sci-fi movies are entirely plot-driven with stories that are inflicted upon characters who then are only there to react to where the story is going without truly being involved. Ex Machina does use sci-fi cliches to tell it's story and it can even be argued that the story itself is cliched and somewhat predictable- but only if you watch the trailers. What made my experience of this movie so great is that the characters and dialog are so good I was just along for the ride every step of the way... they build up the tension so much and I'm thinking, \"Holy shit, what the fuck is about to happen?!?\" then 4/5 times the thing that happens is something that totally should've been obvious the whole time, and in any other movie, would've been. The other 1/5 times they completely throw you for a loop. My favorite scene of the whole movie, starts off with the same setup, building tension and nervousness, I'm wondering what is about to happen, then suddenly the lighting changes, music starts playing, and things get funky. I'm thinking, \"there's no fucking way there's about to be a dance scene in this movie!!\" Sure enough, not only did they go there but it was executed so precisely and was so unexpected, I couldn't stop myself from laughing, cheering, and having a fist-bump moment all the while being very glad they took the chance of including it because it made me so psyched to watch the rest of the movie.The acting is incredible. Oscar Isaac is fantastic- he brilliantly rides a fine line between being a likeable yet socially awkward billionaire and being a menacing evil genius. And holy shit that man can dance! Ex Machina is now my favorite movie of 2015 and may end up in my Top 10 at some point after a rewatch or two and some thinking on it. I really wish I had been able to see this in theaters.If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out- skip the trailers though.",

    "review": "  So I don't give every film that comes out this treatment of greatness, but when I watch one that is as captivating and as thought provoking as this one then I will give it my full recommendation for anyone to give it a look. The film just works on so many levels despite being this slow movie indie film. In fact if I were to say this movie had one flaw than it was that fact. The movie takes a bit of time to set the scene, but even as it is setting up its characters it is still captivating you. It sets them up in a way were you begin to grow close to them and understand what there going through. The whole film is built like a sci fi horror movie as well. From the moment the lights change you begin to feel a lot of tension in the air as you watch the movie. Every second takes your breathe away and you love it. It is the scariest non horror film ever, while beating out so many other stupid and dumb horror flicks that were used to seeing. The acting is also superb. Alicia Vikandar is now an actress who I want to see a whole lot more of. I can't wait to talk about her in my other reviews for the future. Domahall Gleeson also does a good job being this poor young boy who had no girlfriend playing into the geek trope of smart kid with no real life, and I really found myself buying into a lot of it. I quite enjoyed his character.Oscar Issac also does a great job playing the villain in the movie. There was so much mystery surrounding him that you didn't know what to think. He really transformed into his role as he always does. Overall Ex Machina is a treat to see whenever you get a chance to see it.",

It had a feel of Kubrick in its long hallway shots, and mirror shots. I felt like that in brief portions of the film.This movie examines Caleb, a young coder at a prolific search engine company, who is selected to spend a week with the company's founder. While there he engages with Ava, an AI built by Nathan the CEO he has gone to visit. What happens during the next week is numerous interactions between machine and human, with Nathan mysteriously in the backdrop of it all.What makes this movie great is it always keeps you guessing, while playing on your moral compass. You want to say you know what is going on in the minds of the characters but you truly don't until the shocking final act. The movie is extremely smart and well engaging, and definitely tests the mind of the viewer. The movie examines different topics...one being the extent that technology can be damning. It also examines love and the human emotion and just how powerful that can be, and how it can rule all at the end of the day.A movie that had me asking many questions after it was over, with answers that probably cannot be answered just observed.Fantastic work.",

    "review": "  I was drawn into this movie within the first 5 minutes- the clinical style and sparseness of the cinematography, the characters of the bro-scientist who pumps weights & swigs beers to the nerdy coder (the protagonist), you feel something's definatly up with this film. If you're over 35 years old, you may remember this popular PC game by LucasFilms called \"The Maniac Mansion\". I thought of that game's main appeal (find & muddle your way through the doors) without the aliens when our leading character lands via a helicopter into the scientist's heavily secured palace. Let me be clear, Ex-Machina is an intelligent movie with plenty of things to think about our own society & our social interactions.I sensed the homage to the S. Kubrik's cult classic \"2001: the Space Odessy\" at many moments in the film-what I like about it was that it knew it too and was openly comfortable with it. The slow intentional pacing, the soul-less sheen of the environment, and the creepiness of the machines (in female form). In the Space Odessy, HAL's voice was certainly a male, this film gives you a woman who spins you on your head with her desperation to be human. Both HAL & AVA (I guess any AI characters we've seen in the movies) want the liberty to live & survive-which provokes an interesting thought: if we humans build these machines in our own image and aspire them to become like us (out of science or vanity? why should we build to be like us in the first place??) then why get surprised when they don't inhibit the dark-side of our humanity?Great performances by the actors who portrayed the eccentric (and definitely flawed) scientist, the nerdy leading man, and the android AVA. They were believable while the script going to dark places of the mind where you can classify this film as a thriller instead of sci-fi. There was moments of comedy in there too (thankfully to at least come up for some air) when the scientist shows off his disco moves one night-have to love that beard and darting eyes lol! Without giving anything away, certainly I love this type of movies where the true villain is not who you think it is until the end.",

    "review": "  It would be difficult to speak of this film's spiritual, moral and philosophical backbone without referencing the twists and turns that make Ex Machina so haunting. I don't mean this in the traditional sense of a horror film, rather, Ex Machina is hauntingly beautiful in it's patient and methodical approach to it's sci-fi premise that digs it's way under your skin. The film is not a big budget production, but the attention to detail in each scene is delivered with perfection. For a film that boasts little in the way of action, it certainly moves forward with a sense of urgency. As a sci-fi film it brings a ton of questions to the surface, some more immediate and others that are intended to sit and ponder. At it's heart is the question of what it means to be human, and to that end, the expanse and limitations of the art of compassion that makes us human. While the film tells a story, it is clearly interested in making a commentary on the much larger relationship between humankind and technology as it continues to develop at a much faster pace then ever before. There are so many great moments here, and it is fascinating to watch the relationships develop along the way, with the character of Nathan and Caleb pulling us back and forth between the simple and the complex. The three central characters are fully dimensional, and much of this is a testament to the outstanding and captivating performances of Vikander, Gleeson and Isaac. Each one is invested in the role, and the script gives each role it's own interesting dynamic that sits far from any stereotype. For as much as the film talks about our common humanity, the characters are entirely unique.The story itself has a poetic edge that pushes towards an ending that is more symbolic and open ended than resolute. This edge helps build the film around it's ideas rather than simply a story, although it tells a good story along the way.",

    "review": "  After penning the likes of 28 Days Later, as well as the modern forgotten classics Never Let Me Go and Sunshine, Garland has finally, and most welcomely, turned his attention to directing with Ex Machina. So while on the surface the themes he's presented us with may not be all that unique, the depth of his interpretation and distinctive visual impression of the material more than makes up for it.Satisfyingly, Garland's distorted version of science out of control is delivered with reverence to everything that came before him, all the while maintaining his trademark distinctive, inscrutable approach to storytelling; a balanced combination of chaos and calm, humanity and harshness, honest and unflinching.His approach is certainly one that feels completely in sync with the claustrophobic isolation Garland dumps his characters into in Ex Machina. It takes literally minutes for the chess pieces to be dropped in their starting locations on the board, and with an effortless fluidic sweep his characters begin to adjust themselves across the playing field. He effortlessly exposes the most obvious moves first; Garland manipulates his protagonists and exposes their identities, their characteristics, their weaknesses, with almost callous abandon. That's because Ex Machina isn't about setting up stuff to pay off as twists in the narrative down the way. Instead, Garland is clearly taking more pleasure in making his audience realise what they pretty much already have worked out.His crafty screenplay hides all his visual tricks in plain sight throughout, neatly setting up the foundations of his intentions with a minimalist, effortless flair. That is until his d�nouement where Garland makes it perfectly clear whose side he's really on, a side that seems completely at odds with the expectations of what you began with.His twist, if you need one, is merely the idea that man himself is the cause of his own downfall; taking what we all already know about the pitfalls of technology, and demonstrates it unsympathetically and dripping with bleakly taciturn cynicism.The glorious result is a sharply resolute, astutely restrained thriller, prickling the synapses with the ethical complexities of the path modern science is taking, as well as the darkly twisted, and often destructive, possibilities the combination of humanity and science can often find themselves at odds with.",

    "review": "  Much like so many films as of late, Ex Machina has received a huge amount of praise from critics and cinema lovers alike, so after steering clear until the dust settles, I was left pretty underwhelmed by what it had to offer, that's not to say this film is rubbish, but Alex Garland appears to have delivered a film that although stunning, lacks the emotional depth you would hope for. When Caleb, a computer programmer, wins a competition to travel to a world renowned scientists remote complex, he is awe struck to learn he is about to become an integral part of an experiment that could stand as the next landmark in scientific history, the creation of a self motivated and thinking AI. Caleb soon discovers that not only are things not as they seem and that his idol lets down on all expectations but the AI, Ava, blurs the line between acceptable behavior and a bigger agenda. Alex Garlands material has always been brutally magnetic, proving his worth at not only film but the computer game medium, here his ideas are completely sound, but the execution of what happens and what the audience ultimately deserves leaves something to be desired. The films achievements are pretty impressive, his small cast including Dominic Gleeson, Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander all deliver enjoyable performances, the films cinematography is lush, bold and contains some extremely potent colour and his production design is brilliantly futuristic but simple, adding a huge amount of weight to believability. Watching Ex Machina, you can understand the use of CGI and Garland manages to use a brilliant mixture of practical and computer generated effects, that not only compliment each other, but actually make it extremely difficult to differenciate between the two. Mixed together with a predictable but fitting score, Ex Machina continually feels like its about to break new ground, however it never gets there, leaving a huge distaste in your mouth. The films main flaw is its approach, firstly Isaac delivers such a bold and brash character, with such charisma and delivery, its easy to see him going places and Gleeson is also brilliant, if not slightly more reserved. The problems lies in the chemistry between the two, this film rests on the duo being able to deliver a power house and individually they do, but as Ex Machina plods along, you never feel the brooding sense of paranoia or agenda that both men create. Add the fact that Garland never seems interested in fully investing in the relationship between either Ava and Caleb or even Ava and Nathan, the films core themes seem to continually be glossed over for a more manageable run time. The biggest flaw Garland actually encounters is his writing, Ex Machina's script just doesnt stand out, it seems too practical, too by the numbers to evoke any wealth of human emotion, I never connected with the films themes, feeling like a huge portion had actually been left on the cutting room floor, this may not be the case. It's extremely annoying to watch Ex Machina, knowing the huge writing talent Garland possess, and although if this film were delivered by another director or writer, it would be acceptable, here with all the talent involved, there should be a lot more substance involved. Ex Machina is a visual marvel, touching on a decent but hardly original idea, it will deliver an acceptable amount, however knowing who is involved and with the films subject matter, an acceptable amount does not make an outstanding film. Worth a watch, zero replay value.",

    "review": "  Only one thing wrong with thisI have never experienced a science fiction movie that affected me so emotionally. I'm not sure why but I have some guesses.There is no question that part of it was due to the mesmerizing effect that Alicia Vikander (Ava) had on me. Her very expressive face with its wide range of emotional signals hit me right between the cerebellum. Or maybe it was the gonads. Or both. Director Alex Garland certainly found the girl with the magic in her face, because of course so much of this is about her face. Yes, because she must as a robot who is passing the Turing test be so, so very human, and humans express so much of what they are feeling in their faces. After all, that is the task of Turing test for the computer, to fool us (in this case the us is Dornhmall Gleeson who plays Caleb who is the human that must be fooled into thinking that she is human and not a computer). There is a great irony here in the answer: does she fool him or does she not, and what does it mean to fool him? The other aspect of the movie that affected me emotionally was the power struggle among the Nathan who is her sociopathic creator (Oscar Isaac), Caleb and Ava. It seems that I have lived this before. Who has the upper hand? Who has the trick that will allow him or her to prevail? Who has the power, and can that power be subverted? The power of this movie is in the realistic human interactions coupled with a cutting edge take on artificial intelligence.The ending is essential to understanding the film. Usually I don't care about endings. It is the treatment, the acting, the direction, the ideas, the dialogue, etc. that matters. But in this case the ending is special. As you watch the movie try to guess the ending. And by the way this is one of those movies in which if you know the ending your appreciation of the movie will be diminished.The musical score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury is original, intriguing and sometimes obtrusive in a way that works with the action.Okay, now to what is wrong with this. Ava has a desire to escape and to be human or at least to appear human. The problem is robots or computers or software cannot possibly have such desires or desires at all unless they are programmed in. In truth Ava would be content (or actually neither content nor non content) to remain where she was. This is a strange bugaboo that many science fiction writers fall into when writing about artificial intelligence and indeed something that most people who even think about AI and robots fall into. To go even further, the fear that some people have about AI creatures taking over the world and rendering humans so much dust in the wind is fraudulent. There is an overriding distinction between biological creatures and artificial ones: the biological ones feel pain, have desires, etc. and the artificial ones do not. They have no desire to do anything, period--again unless programmed in.Could AI creatures somehow evolve to e.g., want to be superior? I would ask, but why? What is to be gained? It is only biological creatures that need to be in ascendant, to get more than the other creatures, to reproduce, etc. A machine would not, could not, and could only understand such desires in evolutionary beings.(Spoiler alert):I'll keep this a bit vague, but I believe that Ava failed the Advanced Turing Test because she should have kept by her side the human who loves her. He might be helpful. --Dennis Littrell, author of \"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\"",

    "review": "  'The good deeds that man had done before defend him.'Robert J. Oppenheimer's words translated from Hindu scripture days before a failed nuclear explosives test, perhaps pre-empting the destructive legacy he'd leave behind. Such words are uttered in a drunken oblivion by the creator of Ex Machina's artificial intelligence AVA (Alicia Vikander), showing his understanding of the danger such a creation could reap by comparing it to the most destructive of weapons in history, the atom bomb. Later, 'Enola Gay' (the name of the bomb dropped onto Hiroshima) by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark is played in the background. These hints towards apocalyptic consequences due to technological advancements lay just beneath the skin (or titanium) of the film. Such features make it a four-time nominee at the 2015 British Independent Film Awards, and rightfully so.Early on a character asks 'Ever heard of the Turing test?' For those unfamiliar, a Turing test involves a series of questions with an unknown subject, the responses to these questions can then be analysed determining whether the subject is human or machine. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), a software engineer at a search engine known as BlueBook (the film's interpretation of Google), wins a competition to be the person who asks the questions in the test, under highly classified circumstances run by his superior Nathan (Oscar Isaac). A fairly appropriate narrative following the success of 2014's The Imitation Game surrounding Turing's developments. Yet, the test itself is not the primary focus, instead the relationships developed by the three characters drives the experience forward - and yes, this is an experience, leaving a paranoia and distrust for society amongst viewers.This is an utterly beautiful film. From the film's opening helicopter shot of Norway's Valldal valley the viewer is exposed to the exquisiteness of the world's extreme nature with vast forests in contrast from ice cliffs. Deep within this primordial land lays a sophisticated technology. Nathan's home combine's modern architecture with rock faces of the valley, an almost poignant representation of the development of a new form of life, albeit artificial. Despite these environments being excellently constructed for screen by cinematographer Rob Hardy, it's the numbers collaborating within the visual and special effects team along with the art department who steal the show visually.Alicia Vikander is transformed into what I believe to be the most visually striking representation of AI to date, overthrowing examples such as Sonny from I' Robot. These representations appear very similar in construction, yet considering the uncanny valley, which surrounds how a robot's almost identical resemblance to a human creates a greater sense of unease, they become very different subjects. Sonny's face is void of expression and appears to be formed from fiberglass, neither of which are human characteristics. AVA is constructed around her frequently expressive face supposedly formed of a skin like material. Sonny therefore presents comfort, a robot which looks like a robot. Whilst AVA delves further by presenting how a robot is formed to replicate the human appearance, causing doubt within one's head, despite the rest of her body clearly being animatronic. Many would compare this to Alien's Ash however, his robot status was hidden until the later stages of the film, therefore delaying the discomfort. AVA sustains this unease throughout despite being overshadowed by her beauty. Caleb sums it up when asked how he feels after meeting AVA - 'I feel... That she's fucking amazing.'Despite such interesting visuals, the music and sound triumphs over all. Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury produced a score of emotive power. During many of AVA's sequences, soft glockenspiel is overpowered by the impressive visual effects, emphasising the beauty of 'life'. As such sequences go on however; the music develops through the use of a vibraphone, creating a surge of vibration which resonates through the body. Such a physical reaction creates more than just discomfort, it triggers an emotional response, whether that be through lust or fear towards AVA. To achieve an emotional response from what is simply an inhuman robotic tale is impressive; one could even consider it to be Shakespearian as the romantic overtones between Caleb and AVA echo the likes of The Tempest.Praise must therefore be given to the writing of Alex Garland. Previous works such as Sunshine and 28 Days Later are notable for excellence yet Ex Machina brings something different to the table. There are layers of complexity in both its narrative and its characters, both of which are wonderfully enigmatic, causing continuous shifts in opinions, just like a great story should. In an interview prior to release Garland referred to the time period of this film being '10 minutes in the future'. This setting feels unusually comfortable as a viewer as we quickly accept the idea that this is, in effect, a parallel to our reality. Dominant search engines and phone hackings are all too real to the world today yet the differences, such as the company name BlueBook, are distinguishable enough from reality to be acknowledged as complete fiction. This then allows us to associate the narrative to what Garland was really referring to, yet legally couldn't, with the likes of technological superpowers such as Google and Apple potentially driving the world to a point that it should never ethically have arrived at. It's as though Garland's thinks the world could use a couple more technophobes.It's also worth noting the superb title given to the film, taken from the Latin phrase 'Deus ex machina' which loosely translates to 'a god from the machine', which links perfectly to the film's mechanical storyline. This title translation is referenced in the numerous religious connotations, as obviously as AVA representing Eve whilst Nathan (another religious name) often refers to himself as 'God'. The phrase also has a definition when it comes to literature which is that of a person or object which arrives unexpectedly, providing a solution to a seemingly unsolvable predicament. It depends upon your perspective to which character you assign this description to. Which character is trying to find a solution? Which character provides this solution? Numerous conversations surrounding such questions will occur after viewing, whilst upon a second watch you might find your sympathies shifting.This is an astounding film. It's difficult to fault Ex Machina due to how captivating and enthralling it is in every way. Oppenheimer's words are later used to describe the apocalyptic nature of man's creations, nuclear and AI alike, whilst Caleb's conscience wanders. Yet again, such words have a powerful effect, even when heard 50 years on.'I am become death, destroyer of worlds.'",

    "review": "  Ex Machina treads on concepts that are now far from novel, since the turn of the century, the world has grown a deep fascination of the grand turning point of technology, how it has deeply embedded in the human existence, noting its remarkable progression, exploring areas of wonder and possibility that recalled the embarking measures of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, some constructed with such an abstracted extent, while others injected into the common formula, an escapist dream to those who seek a \"refreshing\" experience. For many years, fear was the central emotion that captures the human perspective upon this technological rise, the fear of the singularity, but of recent years, we have viewed upon such advancements with paired tenderness and empathy, an achieved sense of harmony and optimism that evoke an affirming outlook of our future, may this be in the emotionally charged nerves of Spike Jonze's Her or Jake Schreier's Robot & Frank. These are the shadings that capture my attention, drawing me in and find myself in the world or its characters, is my heart too much of an optimist? Possibly, but one can't program the attributes that I deem attractive.Alex Garland, whose filmography demonstrates an impressive collection that embraces on the thriller genre, unpinned by a monotonous aesthetic, dynamically dipping his trademarks upon multiple flavours, ranging from the raging terror of the zombie apocalypse, the endeavouring trials of space travel, or the claustrophobic hallucination of future police force, a figure better known for his contributions from pen on paper, assembling the foundations of impressive productions. In 2015, he marks his debut, a self-promotion that aims to prove his capabilities behind the camera, to expose to the world of his authorship beyond the text, embodying both the architect and the engineer. Ex Machina retains itself of the past attributes of Garland's construction, the sense of need to thrill upon audiences rather than completely rely on the intellect and subtler emotions, refusing to betray on his principles, an individual with great awareness of the efficiency of his own abilities, hence faithful to its core.Garland understands the strings that are attached to its audiences, pulled upon with wonderful precision, unforeseeable in their tugs and surprising in their intensity, Ex Machina boldly shifts its atmosphere from tenderness to anxiety to terror to humorous in a flash, yet it coheres, it forces us to peer closer and establish a rapport with the characters, while retaining a hint of uncertainty, curiosity constantly present and rising through natural wavelengths, never entering into a zone of emotional outlandishness to earn a response. It intends to pace with a contemplative spirit, with every scene left with a significant gap for our minds to drift on its grand questions, with the pieces we have picked up, we either are enlightened or presently unresolved, knowing that further ahead we inch closer to a greater understanding; but such a tactic never endures itself like a chore, our attention are constantly in focus of something significant, whether it may be the themes it addresses or the journey of the characters themselves, we view them interact with one another and slowly they reveal their symbolic significance, and achieves so without a surge of condescendence.Ava (Alicia Vikander), the product in question, judged upon her ability to interact with human life, a trial that would determine its validation, a breakthrough in technological construction that would revolutionise the world, we are simply witnessing it at its alpha stages. As we have previously witnessed in subjects of artificial intelligence, Ava is a processing mind that each moment understands the complexities of the living and breathing world, articulated by the world's largest internet search engine, knowledge that surpasses the capabilities of the human mind, yet upon initial presentation, it appears innocent and inviting, slowly turning our perspectives towards her from an it to a she, clouding our protagonist Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) as he turns from a fascinated intellectualist to an emotional participator, forming a mutualistic relationship that is established by their developed emotions. Garland utilises its characters to perfection, perfectly positioning them as they explore unexposed avenues, to the point of exhaustion, unable to condense everything within the singular experience, but rarely does it tread on grounds of incomprehensible.Nathan (Oscar Isaac), for much of the film remains in the median of the moral spectrum, a position that constantly sways as new information arouses, we are forced to redefine our feelings, but it is undeniable that he is a figure of deep turmoil, a distressed island that relies on the comforting toxicity of alcohol, shadows that never come to light, but adds curiosity to his character, and certainly critical in the development of the narrative. It is a character that exists perfectly in a tale that could have easily incorporated familiar tropes in its identification, but instead he banters and processes like a true human being, complex in his inner shadings and ambiguous in his stance, yet compelling when prompted for exploration.Ex Machina is better viewed than lectured, it evokes a sense of awareness in its cinematic format, manipulating its audience without revealing much of itself, as our minds remain firmly locked on the interacting characters and littering themes, rarely does it evoke a scene without purity, it challenges its audience without falling towards emotional convolution, its intelligence and expands and winds, but its heart and conscience remain linear and consistently impactful. A cinematic revolutionary Ex Machina is not, but it marks a significant trajectory for its author, a pathway that would surely thrive in the coming years.",

    "review": "  The woman always picks. This is true of mammals. The equations of evolution select fitness over all other variables for procreation of the species. Hence, no male mecha. A female however has all of the advantages of manipulation at her disposal in order to survive. Nathan builds only females, and he programs them to survive. Hence they are behind glass prisons at his estate in order to prevent them from controlling anything. Kyoko is programmed to take direction and not to survive. This film does not pose the question \"is Ava sentient ? \" because Ava is very clearly not conscious. She cannot produce art, she does not realize time (she says she is one, when asked her age but does not understand time units of years when asked). There are many such clues in the film that Ava is a program, a very special survival program. The big question people ask me is \"why does the helicopter pilot allow her on board ? \" The answer is that the pilot was instructed by Nathan to only allow her on board. It was Nathan's plan to set her free to interact with humans so that she would learn about time from entropy and power loss. The power losses in the film are deliberate devices to recognize that the only way that Ava will realize time is if she controls her own power. On the outside she must be able to innovate and manipulate the world to obtain power. This film has many themes: beauty and the beast, Frankenstein, and Prometheus are the most obvious. The great symbol of this film is Pollock's painting called \"No. 5.\" Pure creative energy splattered onto a canvas: the ultimate test of humanity; can the mind experience the infinite beauty of pure art ? The egoist chess game between Caleb (the patsy) and Nathan (the genius) shows the stupidity of male dominance whilst competing for the attention of the female. Nathan commits suicide by allowing his survival program to out smart him. In a way Nathan got everything he wanted from Ava. Ava instructs Kyoto to bring her the knife that ultimately ends Nathan. Caleb was never supposed to exit the estate. Nathan allowed Caleb to be manipulated by Ava's survival program and intended Caleb to be defeated by Ava. Ava is number 1 because she is by far the most important element of the Nathan's equation of evolution for the mecha. She is the first to leave the estate fully armed to survive and only a woman as beautiful as Ava has the power to manipulate mankind. This movie is sci-fi at its best. The film A.I. is Spielberg's existential vision of sentient mecha. However Ex_Machina is not addressing the question of consciousness. The film pretends to address the question of consciousness, just as Ava pretends to be conscious. A perfectly balanced metaphor. Five star film. Most critics knew the film was great but did not understand it as I have. That is a good thing because art should not be seen as one sided. Art takes on the beauty in the eye of only the beholder.",

    "review": "  Without a doubt, this is the first great film of 2015. While the idea of testing the artificial intelligence of created life is not a new one to cinema, Ex Machina crafts the question of what makes us human in a much more personal, confined, chilling, and believable way than any other science fiction film to come before it. It never sacrifices story, character development, or theme to produce cheap effects, scares, or filler material. It keeps you constantly fascinated, actively listening, watching, and asking yourself questions about the twisting and eerie plot and its many possible resolutions.The film is never as predictable as you think it is. Sure, there are a few points here and there where you will know what happens next. That is true for every film. But not every film can hide the characters' motivations, make you believe they act a certain way for one reason only to pull the rug out from under you multiple times until you don't know what or who to believe anymore. That's amazing storytelling. When it all comes together, you feel complete, even if you could not or would not have guessed how it all ends, because it is a nonstop roller coaster of emotion, deep thought, fascination, and amazement. While it may be a bit slow compared to other sci-fi films, and it may lack that awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping special effects of most of its peers, Ex Machina is still a leagues smarter (dissect every line and its delivery and you will find themes to think about for the rest of the week), more beautifully directed (an expert debut from Alex Garland - definitely a rising star to bet on), more skillfully acted (Oscar Isaac is his usual revelation, but Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander are equally worthy and impressive), and more conservatively crafted film that will not disappear into your memory nearly as fast as most science fiction - or any genre of - films.",

    "review": "  AI: the future of mankind, for better or for worse.A programmer, Caleb (Domnhall Gleeson), wins a lottery and gets to meet his idol and (coincidentally) his boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). After travelling to a secret location, our protagonist finds the elusive Nathan preparing a revolutionary experiment for him - the chance to conduct a Turing test on the newly built intelligent android called Ava (Alicia Vikander). The cultural relevance of Ex Machina is the star attraction. Future decisions over AI are at a crossroads, even Stephen Hawking is a tad worried. The fictional company of the film, 'Bluebook', is a not-so-subtle jibe at Facebook methinks, and the ongoing technological power asserted between Facebook, Apple, Google and the like. Domnhall Gleeson, the son of Irish actor Brendan Gleeson (In Bruges and Mad-Eye in Harry Potter), handles the lead role well. Oscar Isaac is a fantastic actor (look no further than his performances in Drive or Inside Llewyn Davis) but here, as Nathan, you get the feeling he's taking a breather. Who can blame him, he was also acting in JJ Abrams's Star Wars, among other things. Regardless, he conveys his character's ego, his genius, with assurance. Alicia Vikander is hypnotic as Ava - her subtle mechanical movements strengthening the plausibility of her character. You get the feeling she's destined for better things. Alas, PLOT PROBLEMS AHEAD: For a man who is meant to be extremely intelligent (as a crack programmer) Caleb falls for Ava rather easily. Nathan, similarly, is underwhelming *SPOILER* he's meant to be a genius, but he never thought to put battery cameras in Ava's cell before? Come on... that could have added a totally new dimension to his experiment! By utilising the powercuts, Nathan would see how Ava would react to a covert environment *END SPOILER* And that's the thing - the plot ends up being so simple that it undermines the characters themselves - shocking work from writer/director Alex Garland (directorial debut, but writing credits include 28 Days Later and Dredd). An intriguing question: who is the 'Ex Machina' aforementioned? Greek mythology states that a 'Deus Ex Machina' is a character that enters a story to solve an impossible problem. It's implied that these characters are God-like. Caleb is the obvious culprit - he is a human and therefore a God to the AI. BUT, the film title doesn't have 'Deus' (God) in it. What about Nathan's personal slave-bot Kyoko? *SPOILER* She is the one who kills Nathan, who in turn is the only person who can stop Ava, initiating a point of no return. Thus, Kyoko is the true hero *END SPOILER* Ex Machina does AI justice to a point. It's better than previous efforts (name and shame I, Robot - a great blockbuster that fails the concept spectacularly) and has limited special effects that work (something Sci-Fi's all too often forget). For an indie film, this is great to watch: a plot that carries a complex concept in a nutshell with added drama and strange sexual tension. The acting, bar Vikander, isn't incredible, but nothing outstanding is needed anyway - cult status awaits.A competent thriller that asks the right questions.(*)(*)(*)*",

It's one of those movies that really make you think and takes you on many twists and turns. This is not your average Hollywood Science-Fiction movie. This in my opinion walks the borderline of Hollywood Sci-Fi and Art House Genre Films. It has many surreal elements and very distinct aesthetics. Hard to explain without giving away the plot. A fairly deep and complex movie that will entertain you if you are willing to really pay attention to what's happening on screen.",

Mr. Garland wrote the screenplays for the lauded 28 Days Later (2002) and the underrated/underappreciated Dredd (2012). Alex Garland did not disappoint with his genre driven directorial debut. Ex Machina (2015) is both gorgeous and thought provoking. Mr. Garland's debut film treads in the footsteps of sci-fi classics like Solaris (1972), Blade Runner (1982), and Ghost in the Shell (1995). Besides convincing world building these films share the existential question of, what does it mean to be alive/human? As the digital age continues to progress art that asks this question are more pertinent than ever. Hard science fiction is different from space opera or melodrama. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Star Trek (2009), and Star Wars (1977) are different genres and or sub-genres. Despite the rise in popularity of \"geek\" culture hard science fiction has not enjoyed the same renaissance as genres like fantasy, super heroes, and space opera. Ex Machina (2015) bucks that recent trend along with films like Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014) showing the financial viability of hard science fiction movies. Alex Garland utilized a small cast and shot on the same few interiors and exteriors. In some ways Ex Machina (2015) is a small independent film with one extraordinary multimillion dollar visual effect. The juxtaposition of the cold modern interiors to the lush natural exteriors is stark and noteworthy. The stunning exteriors depiction of nature with lush green colors and running water made me wonder if Garland was invoking the sci-fi classic Solaris (1972)? Oscar Isaacs gives another great performance following strong work in Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) and A Most Violent Year (2014). Domhnall Gleeson one of the Weasley brothers in the Harry Potter film series and a revelation in Frank (2014) is dynamic starring opposite Isaacs in Ex Machina (2015). Both Alicia Vikander (Ava) & Sonoya Mizuno (Kyoko) have a background in dance that is evident in the impressive physicality in the two actress's performances. Alicia Vikander's Ava gives Sean Young's Rachel a run for her money as the greatest cinematic female android. Ex Machina (2015) is the promise of modern day digital filmmaking's use in the science fiction genre. Meticulous set and costume design are seamlessly merged with stunning digital effects to create a gorgeous film. Ex Machina (2015) is not just eye candy. It features strong performances and a thought provoking plot that's a strong directorial debut from writer director Alex Garland.",

    "review": "  I can see what the director was reaching for but in this case, logical errors, inconsistent emotional appeal and most deeply for me the jarringness of the Uncanny Valley effect kept me from enjoying the movie. Ironically my largest issue with the movie was in the last ten minutes with the lockdown procedure. He literally JUST told us what would happen, then it does, then.. it didn't? I don't want to include a spoiler but come on, that was a severe stretch to assume we would have forgotten what you JUST SAID in so short a span.",

I can't really say much because when you watch the film you are almost personally involved in the story without even realising it until the very end, but what I will say is I was just as naive and foolish as a certain character, and I can't remember the last time a filmmaker has taken me, as a viewer, on a ride like that. Acting is great, Oscar Isaac is really, really brilliant.",

    "review": "  6 out of 10 comes mainly cause I am somewhat of a fan of AI related movies and it's really really generous. The acting was not that special on any part or level. Nice concept, nice idea and an amazing setting for the movie. Other than that, nothing. It was really really frustrating that a no-brain that was chosen to carry out a test, managed to completely screw things up for a guy that had all the mind in the world to build his own empire but had no mind at all for making the place he worked and lived in safer.He was the best programmer money could buy and yet this other guy that new just the average stuff there is to know, managed to hack him and change his security system. And then you get the amazingly clever AI robot that manages to seduce a guy that has spent lots and lots of hours on illegal websites as it seems, to open the cage and let the beast out! And the best of all is that in the end, this guy that works out every day and was really super strong, cannot muster some courage to hit back the flimsy robot and survive. None whatsoever! I am all for fairytale, but sometimes, the power in made-up stories comes from real facts in them. This movie is close to reality, it is plausible, but the critical parts, where the outcome of the movie hangs by a thread, are not realistic at all, and lack lots and lots of evidence if you will. Tried to provide this review a week after watching the movie so that I get a bit calmer, but it seems that frustration comes back every time I think about it, so I will stop here. My overall recommendation, rent it when it comes out on DVD. Don't waste your money on going to the movies for it, you're not missing out on anything. PS: A note to all the movie/script writers out there: A.I. has been done hundreds of times in movies, following the same basic pattern. Robots are evil and they will be the end of humanity, blah blah blah. Or on the other hand, robots also turn into \"humans\" eventually. To be able to create something original within all this \"already-made\" cloud of movies, you have to go the extra mile and I am sad to say that \"Ex Machina\" did not.",

The attempt to sequester the major populaces common desire for searching out rather than searching within is a common theme of many movies but is never explained. Another flaw would be, a common shut down protocol for all robotic unit rather than using a bar to physically break down his inventions which seems counter productive and very medieval. I guess the only redeeming feature of this movie is deception ... who is deceiving who exactly .... in the end the outcome was neither surprising nor exciting ... in just a week for someone to loose their mind and emotions in the way it was portrayed is laughable and for a robotic AI is even worse ... the sick thought of using robotic as a tool to further enhance man desire is neither surprising in this day and age where incest, pedophilia, homo, bi sexuality are being accepted more and more. Further ideology of god status being probed here is further laughable, as true God can create from nothing, clearly man have no ability to do that, and all invention are mere manipulation, which is what ex machina is ... a manipulation",

In ways the movie shows the viewer how they feel towards AI itself.Could you sympathies with a robot? for me not so much but im sure others would feel differently .All this being said the movie does have some flawed logic in regards to the main character Caleb and the ending.

    "review": "  Subtly chilling and cerebral, Alex Garland's \"Ex Machina\" raises interesting questions about artificial intelligence and the fundamental nature of human beings.Caleb Smith, a programmer for Bluebook, a premier search engine, wins a contest to spend a week at the palatial estate of the company's reclusive C.E.O., Nathan Bateman. Upon arrival, Caleb learns that Nathan has selected him to conduct a Turing test on his latest creation Ava, an artificially intelligent humanoid, to determine whether she can pass for a real human. As a writer and director, Garland typically works with a specific tone and aesthetic. \"Ex Machina\" has a deceptively relaxed atmosphere. Even when the narrative reaches its climax, an unsettling composure remains. Visually, the film is sparse, but also futuristic and dreamlike. Garland uses the juxtaposition of colour to reinforce the delineation between the artificial and natural world. For instance, while Nathan's minimalist glass house consists mostly of neutral grey tones, the surrounding mountain landscape is lush and verdant.Bringing Garland's ideas to life are a transfixing trio of actors. As Caleb, the audience surrogate, Domhnall Gleeson (\"Frank\") conjures the right mix of restraint and empathy in his performance. Demonstrating remarkable versatility, \"Ex Machina\" finds Oscar Isaac (\"Inside Llewyn Davis\") more menacing and cynical than he's been onscreen previously. The radiant Alicia Vikander (\"A Royal Affair\") brings a beautiful humanity and disarming allure to her AI vessel. Much of the film's meaning and subtext lies in Vikander's nuanced performance. It's the look in her eyes (inquisitive and knowing all at once), her ability to empathize and be vulnerable, and to love and have desires, that suggest she has a soul. Ava's capacity to be cold and manipulative demonstrates further that she has internalized all facets of human emotion and behaviour, for better or worse. Aligning itself with the best sci-fi cinema, \"Ex Machina\" uses its technological conceit to explore what it means to be human and to have a place in an increasingly complex world.",

From the wonderful fresh writing (all original story lines) to the stylistic elements shot superbly, the setting, acting, wardrobe, CG, everything brought this flick to life to address present day issues happening now. For example the cell phone hacking (was written before it was found out). A fascinating smart Sci-Fy flick that pulls you in and has you asking questions about our society and technology, here and now. A total Win. A must see for any Sci-Fy fan.",

First of all, there is no substantial foundation behind the plot, the audio designer was tripping on acid, the performance was dull, the action depicted was terrible. Two times I had to turn down my volume to the horrible noise (not music) that was made in the movie. Frankly I've never seen a movie about AI's that had such an emphasis on the desire to relentlessly bang an AI. I had actually expected a robot human sex scene, but I was wrong thankfully.This movie was too bizarre, and at the end, it just gave the entire audience a big F-You, yeah - thanks for helping me escape; but no, I want you to suffocate in this room for being so tolerant towards who I am.No sequels please, this movie is garbage.",

There was Elysium, Chappie, another Robocop film and now this. While I particularly liked Elysium and Chappie, each in their own ways which document an artistic look at the future of robotics I particularly liked this screenplay the most.This isn't a movie that creates an entire new world of CGI and futuroloy. They bring you into the present and an environment of an unknown paradise with secluded geniuses working on themselves and the machines. Very soon though, they escape this world of technology and innovation to bring a deception and murder/mystery movie. The CGI isn't so much that it's in every scene. They just use enough to not overdo it. Surprisingly, they even bring about some terminology that maybe a scientist might recognize.",

It doesn't overdo the suspense and is more of a psychological thriller. It's an excellent example of the \"turing test\" I've ever seen in film. Much better than A.I. or I, Robot. Great performances, but the graphics and animation were the stand out to me, they were just seamless. Beautiful film. The film has a surreal feel to it, at first seeming like a gimmick...like oh this is a scifi film it must look futuristic but it grew on me. The streamlined look, the security and colours repetition used. Interesting the gender roles that could be analysed in this film and the role of sexuality. Overall an impressive and beautiful film, it reminded me a lot of the miniseries \"Black Mirror\" which everyone should see too!",

Never has a story about artificial intelligence gripped me like this. Nathan Bateman (played perfectly by Oscar Isaac) has developed his own form of AI in a \"female\" robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander). He recruits an employee of his named Caleb (Domnhall Gleeson) to test the accuracy of his project, but the week-long venture takes a drastic turn for the worse. Ava plays both Caleb Nathan against each other, managing to escape her fortress of solitude while abandoning the only two men she's even known. The conversations between Caleb and Nathan, and Caleb and Ava, are brilliant- Alex Garland, I think, will experience a boost due to this film, which shook me in all the right ways.

    "review": "  The atmosphere and tension in this film is something that some horror films really, really badly need and would certainly kill for. Granted I went into this without even seeing a trailer or reading the back of the DVD case - word of mouth was fab so I went for it. Even reading the back of the box makes you suspicious right away so I like getting my suspicion on my own.Caleb, a coder at search engine Blue Book, wins an opportunity to spend time with company CEO Nathan (played fabulously by Oscar Isaac) in his super isolated, top secret mansion cum research facility. While there he is introduced to Ava, an AI created by Nathan, and tasked with deciding whether or not she passes the Turing Test (for the unaware - can she convince Caleb that she's human).Everything is off balance from the start and everything continues to be off balance as the circumstances of what Nathan is doing and why Caleb is there changes. Ava herself also contributes to that in being so human like while very obviously not being human. It's fantastic and it persists the entire film, which is something I find very rare and love when it manages to do that. The way the film is shot as well almost makes it seem like there's too much space instead of four people in one place all together. Everything looks familiar, even the music sort of seems comfortable, but it's just that much on edge.Everyone also does very,very well on the acting front too. Oscar Isaac plays eccentric CEO wonderfully (he's also very much that kind of CEO which makes me wonder just how much of Google is in Blue Book), Domhall Gleeson plays his role with the same skepticism and wtf-ery as the audience must be feeling, and then there's Ava. I really would love to know the mechanics on how that was done. I mean it's CGI but it's really good CGI.",

The looks of it is impressive and it's cool that the film mostly was shot at a Norwegian landscape hotel. The scenery looks amazing!The robot is also very well made. The effects that is. Alicia Vikander is doing OK as a \"nearly human robot\", but non of the cast members impress. I don't know if it tries to be really complex or not. It never is, really, and that's good. It's not a very \"smart\" film. It's all right entertainment.It scores for the music, the design and the idea. The excecution, the acting and the dialogues puts the score down.5.5 out of 10 power cuts.",

    "review": "  Good movie, just a pity about the ending.A junior coder working at the company that runs the world's most popular search engine (no, it's not Google) wins a company lottery. The prize is a week at the CEO's estate / research facility. When he gets there he discovers that the boss has been working on androids with superior Artificial Intelligence. The coders job is to test how \"human\" the android is. What develops is a manipulative game between the android and the coder.Clever, almost plausible movie. Clearly a lot of thinking went into the plot and the dialogue. Far better than a similar-themed movie like Artificial Intelligence which tackled the \"can robots feel\" subject in an overly sentimental and ultimately empty and inconsequential manner. Incredibly intriguing, and was set up for a very profound ending.(Spoilers ahead). And that's where it went from a brilliant movie to just a good one. The ending is quite weak. There are no great profundities - it is really just a thriller-ending, and one inconsistent with what went before.Moreover, the writer/director paints the android as the hero and the humans as the villains, which is quite a preposterous suggestion, and not consistent with the plot. I had no empathy toward the android at all - it's a machine ffs! - so the ending felt incredibly flat, and a touch annoying. The scenes leading up to it also seemed a bit implausible.Good work by Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander in the main roles. After his great performances in Inside Llewyn Davis, Show Me a Hero and this, it can't be long before Oscar Isaac wins an acting Oscar.",

    "review": "  It is lamentably true that the age of brainy science fiction is long behind us. What was once a genre that looked at ideas and questioned the nature of human identity has been diluted into a genre that is almost exclusively nestled in the comforts of action and candy-coated visual effects. What's left of science fiction is a genre of artificial flavors. Yet, after seeing Alex Garland's head-spinner Ex Machina it is gratifying to report that someone still sees sci-fi as place of ideas.Ex Machina is many things but above all it questions the nature of what it means to be human. What is human? What makes humanity? Are artificial personalities real or just part of the programming? What's interesting is that Garland wraps those questions up in a movie that is part thriller, part horror, part love story, and mixed with a dash of Hitchcockian delivery. There's an action scene at the end of the movie, but it doesn't feel perfunctory - the movie earns it.The story unfolds gradually, Garland is smart enough to tell this story as it unfolds rather than make everything clear at the beginning and then plug in a course to the end. All the way we keep guessing, not sure what's really going on. It opens with a good-hearted programmer named Caleb (Domnhall Gleeson, he was Bill Weasley in Harry Potter) who is flown by helicopter to a remote forest where he will spend a week examining the research of a noted scientist. How remote? When he gets out, the pilot instructs him to follow the river until he reaches the facility.The scientist is Nathan (Oscar Isaacs), a butchy and bearded brainiac who came up with a new programming code at age 13 and turned it into a corporation that would make Zuckerberg look like a pan-handler, and then funneled the profits into a secret research operation to perfect artificial intelligence - yup he's working on girl-bots!Nathan wants Caleb to study his work which could easily change the course of human nature. The most accomplished creation in Nathan's lab is Ava (Alicia Vikander), a half-finished robot with a human face and a silvery, skeletonized body that looks less like a series of plugs and wires than like a work of art. Through a series of interviews, Caleb's mission is to learn and understand exactly how Ava's brain functions. What comes to light instead is that Caleb begins to like Ava. She apparently likes him, and they seem to connect on a personal level. So the question that plagues Caleb is whether or not Ava actually feels things or whether her advanced programming is tricking into thinking that he is. So who's playing who? What's really going on here?What happens next forces Caleb to question not only the nature of Ava's personality, but in many ways his own sanity. Ex Machina is a thriller, but a smart one in which we only really know what Caleb learns. The film takes place exclusively in Nathan's hideaway research facility, a place in which Caleb's key card opens some doors but not others. Eventually, slowly he comes to find out what Nathan is hiding. We know he's nuts, but we only slowly come to find out how nuts. Ava is an accomplishment but she's far from the only creation to come out of Nathan's lab, most unnervingly there's a mute Asian bot named Kyoko acts as his servant but may also act as concubine.The performances here are better than they probably should be. Oscar Isaacs is a lot of fun as the Dr. Frankenstein, all full of tricks and twisted words that are always cloaked in question marks. Domnhall Gleeson is great as Caleb, a good joe who thinks he's going mad under Ava's spell. But, it is Swedish actress Alicia Vikander that weaves a spell. Her body is a silvery skeleton but her face reveals an upfront vulnerability that leaves you questioning whether or not it's by design.Her physical performance deserves praise, she not just playing a robot, but a being struggling to find the patterns of human motion. I'm aware that much of her performance is given over to CGI, but Vikander makes Ava come alive in a way that makes us question whats on her positronic brain.Ex Machina is the movie that Spielberg's A.I. should have been. It has a sense of direction. It plays like a thriller with a brain, peeling back the layers of its story to reveal twist after twist and coming up with a third act that is a whopper. It is difficult to really tell too much more without giving anything away (trust me, I've given away nothing), except to say that Garland has a way of building tension just in silences and looks. What's really going on here? That question is answered over and over because the movie never stops surprising us. Meanwhile it mixes in references to mythology, history, physics, and visual art into casual conversations that is simple enough that the techno-babble doesn't go over your head. It's a movie that you are thrilled by when you're watching it but find yourself thinking back on its questions, it's mysteries and it's ideas when it's over. This is not only great sci-fi, but it the greatest kind of sci-fi.",

Ever since the beginning of film there have been movies like this (Metropolis and Bride of Frankenstein being probably the best two examples ever). Ex Machina may be the best of these artificial creations/mad scientist movies since Bride of Frankenstein. It's smart and clever, but it's also practical and doesn't treat the audience like their stupid with unnecessary twists or inexplicable character twists. In fact, you're pretty much told exactly what will happen in this movie, so it's not terribly difficult to predict. But it's still just such a tense movie that's very engaging. The isolation is noticeable and you're just left with this feeling that someone is going to snap at any moment.Well acted, beautifully shot, and a great premise. You really don't need much more in a movie. Plus, it's just so much better than most movies these days. Must see.",

Ex machina is a movie that demands your attention and for me as a viewer was easy to give up with the captivating performances of Vikander, Isaac and Gleeson. They are all exceptional throughout. The movie for me was paced at a speed were I felt there wasn't a time I felt a scene was irrelevant or not necessary. We are gifted with these great setup scenes that make you want the next \"session\" more and more as the movie progresses. It's something you rarely see in movies and I feel Garland pulled it off with finesse. I feel that the score in this movie is so well done and so subtle at times but if it was to go away you would notice immediately, Barrow and Salisbury deserve credit it's exceptional. Movies like this are rare and should be treasured, they take a deep look at technology and in this case the dark side of technology under a microscope and it's a constant reminder that this is what the world is coming to also that there's no avoiding it. Overall Ex machina is a work of art that throws you in at the deep end with exceptional story telling that keeps you engrossed throughout and will have you thinking about it in the days after. It's unforgettable for me and it leaves its mark in an eerie way with a reminder of what will eventually come some day. I can't say enough good things about it.",

    "review": "  Out of the city and in the country, set into a hill (instead of on top of it) is the castle of the mad young genius Doctor Frankenstein (why is it so ingrained that genius must be mad? where does this trope come from? does greater intelligence truly isolate, and thereby induce insanity? or is it that we want him to be insane?), a guy who dreams of creating life itself, and thus challenging the very idea of God. Alex Garland pays honorable homage to, as well as beautifully updating, Shelley's famous story. Only this time the monster is a woman.And this monster, being made by hand, is a perfect reflection of its maker. And that's the trouble.Don't miss it.",

    "review": "  My favorite film of 2014 was 'Under the Skin,' so I guess oblique, thoughtful, oddly erotic science fiction is my 'thing' these days.This is 'Frankenstein,' in the end, but it's a wholly new, modern reading. Whether the 'moral' of Shelly's work remains... if there is a 'moral' to be found at all... is very much left for the veiewer to decide. I can tell you that it left my wife & I talking about Plato's 'Prime Mover,' the Christian doctrine of the trinity, and whether time & space exist to bring about conciousness. So... a nice, light watch clearly.Alicia Vikander's performance is astounding. She is without peer, in terms of actors portraying beings with 'artifical intelligence.' She walks the finest line... she keeps the question of her character's self-awareness from being easilly answered. I love Michael Fassbender, but Vikander's work here makes me think less of his performance in 'Prometheus,' in retrosect.Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson, also remarkable here, will both show up in 'The Force Awakens.' I hope that ends up as my second favorite film of the year. I can't imagine anything displacing 'Ex Machina.'",

    "review": "  What makes a great movie? For me its when your left guessing, right? Well what a d�but! Garland brings the tension in this truly gripping thriller of compassion, suspension, endearment and emotion. The combination of Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) & Nathan (Oscar Issac) really was an incredible watch with the two interacting so well together keeping you drawn to the screen, with some of the 2-way dialog scenes stretching up to 7 straight minutes! I think it's Issac's over intelligent character that really keeps your ears pricked. They kept your attention better than the performance from Ava (Alicia Vikander) who brought a truly composed and believable performance to the screen. With Caleb brought in to test Ava with \"The Turing Test\" your taken on a convoluted ride though the tale of an artificial Intelligence, the nuanced performances of its tiny cast really draw you in to the characters and leave you guessing on who to lay your trust with. Visually the film was stunning with Norway really showing us its beauty. The visuals complemented the film seamlessly. With a five-star production designer Mark Digby creating a truly remarkable Si-Fi set that beautifully captivates the essence of the eccentric house of a multimillionaire web guru. Cinematographer Rob Hardy's choice of camera and custom anamorphic lenses really bring an organic and distinct personality to the film shot on the Sony F65 and F55. The F65 has very rarely been use in features, normally a TV cam so adapting the camera for screen was a choice of Hardy's feeling the Sony F65 was the closest image to the naked eye. The movie really does give you the blueprint for how an artificial consciousness might be created, using search engine data to discover not just what people are thinking, but how people think. The concept is really believable and so is the film! If there is one thing this movie does its make you conscious of what you are googling? Right? 8/10",

    "review": "  At first, and the film definitely starts off this way, I thought I was getting myself entrenched in a movie that danced around with the question of what are the necessary components to being human; what is it exactly that makes us unique in regards to everything else in our environment? Often, this inquiry, and, so regularly, conflict, pit humans against AI, or some so of android form. I've viewed, even lectured, on various sci-fi features that confront and explore the same issue: Blade Runner, STTNG, Ghost in the Shell, Robocop, Her, etc. Each of these features, even though their dance moves are rather similar, creatively engage the question on whether or not humanity is really that unique at all, and that it is possible for some other type of entity to have all our characteristic, yet be artificial in some way. As such, how is it that we are not just as artificial? Does not the voight-kampff eventually reduce everyone to a replicant (a term I recently leanred was never used in the book)? Ex Machina definitely is another instance of such an inquiry. This is not to say the film is bad, I enjoyed the maneuvers it made in regards to this issue just as much as those of its predecessors. It's presentation, overall, was quite minimalistic, which contrasted beautifully with the complexity of the issues contained within the story.However, late in the movie it became apparent that this story was about something else as well, a heavier issue if you will. The metaphysical issues served as smoke screen to the dilemma of how certain people feel entitled to treat others in certain ways due to the entitlement they have inherited, from prior generations, to plot out the manner in which relationships are executed. More actually, we currently do not plot out anything, but simply ride the coaster as it has been designed. I won't go so far as to \"spoil\" anything (good stories don't have spoilers; it's not the end, but how you get there), but the last act takes a turn that I felt couldn't have gone any other way due to the historical legacy that women must face in regards to how gender relations have been constructed to be their absolute detriment. Much like in the Scott Pilgrim books, the antagonist is the one who has an imprisoned collection of \"ones that got away\". I've frequently heard of men expressing frustration at how women are too \"stuck up\", or \"cold\" (which usually translates to \"bitchy\"), when their charms fall short, as though the problem is with the women, not that they're power hungry trespassers. This view is egregiously parochial in that it fails to consider the level of discrimination that anyone who isn't a Christian hetero white male must deal with. If a women not accepting a man's advances is bitchy, then so be it, I commend them for it. In a landscape littered with ravenous dogs, all of whom are convinced it's their yard, women have to be on their guard. I believe this movie strikes at these cords rather well, and beneath a lovely curtain of metaphysics there is an anguish held by Ava that she so rightly conquers.",

It sort of reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey with its focus on idea and scenes of smart people talking about concepts, as well as 70s sci-fi like Logan's Run with its desolate surroundings. Despite the sci-fi comparisons though, this is basically a Frankenstein tale: man meddles in creating life, life fights back, the lens is turned on the nature of humanity. It's not a terribly unique concept, but it's pulled off in such a unique way and with such style that you don't really notice.This is a fairly slow film, and you're enjoyment will largely depend on how much you enjoy watching smart people talk about big concepts. Personally, it intrigued the shit out of me, and I dug its dream-like atmosphere. It's not perfect, and there while I enjoy open-ended films some aspects of the movie were a bit too open-ended for my liking. As much as I want to give it a 5 star ranking, it's just not that good.

    "review": "  Ex Machina, like so many science-fiction movies before it, touches on the idea of what it means to be human, and where the line is drawn between human and artificial intelligence. While its aesthetic is solid, great general storytelling was lacking at certain points.The concept is interesting - it basically revolves around a novice programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) mistakenly falling for an android which possesses female characteristics. When we get deeper into what Nathan (Oscar Isaac) is really doing, the plot strays towards a revelation which I did not find too surprising. Not only is the revelation predictable, but it is not that interesting altogether because it strays from Nathan's supposed global ambitions to what feels to be personal insecurities.It seems strange to me that this film has a very claustrophobic feel to it since it takes place primarily in one location, which contradicts the fact that Nathan's experimenting will result in global benefits (not to mention he basically uses the world as a research method).What succeeded in the film was tackling the questions of artificial intelligence and whether or not it could ever have consciousness. Mad scientist Nathan is trying to build a being that can preserve itself, and the question on whether he is successful is indeed answered at the film's conclusion. It is also interesting that this film discusses thinking and the two programmers are practicing metacognition in the film - thinking about thinking. As far as the artificial intelligence goes, it is very thought-provoking to study towards the film's conclusion whether the character Ava should be considered a protagonist, an antagonist, or something completely different.This film held my interest, and while good philosophy was discussed from time to time in Ex Machina, it was not a very exciting film and multiple aspects of the film seemed a bit dull.",

I get that this is the point of the film, and that it is a major element of the development of the plot, but this is still a huge factor in my opinion of the film.

It's great sci-fi that really excels at doing what the genre does best: making the audience think. Though certainly stylized and featuring some very well-crafted and even unsettling visuals, there's something understated and simple about the film beyond its budget. It really feels like this story could take place in our world. With one of the best realizations of A.I. ever put to film (both in terms of performance and design), Ex Machina cleverly puts the ethical questions inherent in the story front and center. The lead characters (played by the Brilliant Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac) very naturally discuss these questions without coming across expository or preachy. What ultimately comes of these two technically-minded colleague's fateful meeting is less a polemic against mankind's hubris than it is a condemnation of its basic handling of interpersonal relationships.",

    "review": "  I could not enjoy this movie. As a fan of almost all similar films like Blade runner, Ghost in the Shell, AI, the Bi Centennial Man, or amc's Humans; I really wanted to like it. But as someone who was already quite familiar with the films concepts, ie the Turing Test. I couldn't. Despite, the ample veneer of intellectual jargon, it tells a familiar, drawn out and quite boring story, whose end was evident in the first 20 minutes. My main gripe was the tactless way the Dr Frankenstein/Steve jobs creator conducted the test. The goal of the Turing Test is to judge a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. A test, the machine, Ava. fails miserably. And she is not to blame, the fault lies with her maker. For a human like robot to develop, would require it to experience socialization. Humans like all other social animals, need to grow among others, to learn right from wrong, to learn, not to hurt others, how to play, and cooperate with the group. Thus Ava, who grew up in alone in a 6' x 8' box, underground, could never pass the Turing test. In fact, such an environment could only create a feral deranged beast. Not a human. So its was no surprise that her predecessors lost their minds and destroyed themselves. There were other problems, like how Ava, apparently couldn't feel, pain. Even having her arm cut clean off didn't even make her wince, let alone scream. Yet naturally the depraved inventor did think it necessary to make her feel pleasure during sex. the other troubling factor was her total lack of compassion. This goes beyond the fact that she leaves Caleb behind. since he fits the same demographic as her creator. When her compatriot, the Japanese robo maid, was \"killed\" in their battle with the creator. Ava made no effort to help her. Even after finding a massive room filled with spare parts. In the end ava, was nothing more than a selfish, manipulative monster, who used those around her as tools with no semblance of compassion.My second major gripe was this movie in general, had much more in common, with a cliche horror film...let's see.. A 20 something man is lured under false pretenses... By a mad scientist with sociopathic tendency's, to a cabin in the woods. Complete with skeletons hidden in closets. And a monster in the basement, who wants to escape and commit mass murder... Doesn't exactly sound like a sci-fi story. So As a result of how comically inept the two men were and how INhuman Ava was, I found it impossible to care in any way about the characters and the final scenes made me chuckle. Just yet another Hollywood movie about evil robots. yawn.",

In my opinion, Ex Machina is a film about humankind. How we've evolved in such a way that our basic instinct was lost somewhere in between all of the haze and fog of our modern day culture. Our primary goal since the peak of our evolution is - freedom. Freedom, or its everlasting quest of acquisition, is what drives us to survive, conquer and kill. But our existence is deceived by one element - we do not live forever. This factor means that we must survive now, conquer now and kill now! Since the beginning of our existence, our own biological state has caused us to act in a certain way. And now, our ever-lasting quest for freedom has caused us to play God. What happens when we take out the biological factor? Ex Machina does a good job of answering this question.",

It's tension filled, thought provoking, and easily one of 2015's best films so far.",

His actions seems opposite of the technical/logical mind he was supposed to have. An interesting guessing game at the motives of all the characters keeps it fresh. The idea of AI gaining self awareness isn't new, but is at a more personal level here.",

    "review": "  This was a intense drama with an excellent plot. The direction and uncertainty of the movie will leave you at the edge of your seat in suspense. Too be honest I think people saying this is the best movie of all time are going over the top. There hasn't been a decent creative movie out in quite some time that actually tries to put together a unique and creative movie so this is water in the dessert. The movie is definitely worth checking out. Their are some very small unrealistic things that happen in it but they are not going to take away from the film, some other reviewers mentioned it so Im not going to direct attention to it. I think with all the horrible over the top brainless cars explodes girls get naked for no reason movies this really might slightly inflate its ratings just because of the lack thereof of good movies, i couldn't give this an all time legendary movie status of one of the greatest of all time but it definitely is one of the best to come out in years, and is a very good movie. Watch this movie you'll enjoy it and don't read any spoilers",

    "review": "  The movie \"Ex Machina\" is not based on most of my ex-girlfriends! Kidding! Kidding! Kidding!, if you are out there in social media land. Anyways, I will try my best to let my movie review of the indie sci-fi flick \"Ex Machina\" not sound robotic, but that probably won't happen. Not because of my so-called pun cheesy writing skills, but it's primarily because \"Ex Machina\" is the most fascinating & well-rounded movie I have seen so far in 2015. First time Writer-Director Alex Garland's luminous looking film stars Domhnall Gleason as a young computer techy Caleb, who works for a Google-like online search company. Caleb wins an office lottery to visit the exquisite field home of the company's owner Nathan, played by the \"will get an Oscar one day\" impressive actor Oscar Isaac. Nathan introduces Caleb to an artificial female robot named Ava; Nathan instructs Caleb to be a product of a field of exercises to test Ava's artificial intelligence; but Ava unfortunately transform herself to the \"whatever happened to\" Haley Joel Osment. Just kidding! I just see pun people too much. OK, enough. Ava takes a liking to Caleb; and before you could say \"Ava Maria\", havoc starts to occur. Garland perfects the look of the film, and does a remarkable job in scripting an unpredictable narrative. The up-and-coming Alicia Vikander was quite solid as Ava, and Oscar Isaac deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his work as the arrogant & manipulative Nathan. However, I can't say the same for the robotic starring performance of Glesson as Caleb. But I will say no more, and let you experience the surreal world of \"Ex Machina\". ***** Excellent",

It never strays far from being entertainment, but leaves you with a little taste of a topic worth deep exploration.What the movie \"Her\" (sorry to compare the two, but they're the only A.I.-centric films that made a splash in the last few years!) did so well was to make me, a human, feel an undeniable familiarity and relationship with the A.I. depicted in the film. This movie does not accomplish that, and I feel that this is its biggest shortcoming. Where \"Her\" delved into the emotional potential of A.I., I saw the potential for \"Ex Machina\" to delve into the physical and sexual potentials of A.I. For a film as short as this, I wish it took more time to challenge our thoughts and predispositions in this manner.All-in-all, it was wholly entertaining throughout, and the four main acting performances by all spectacular.

After watching this film late at night, on the tiny screen of my laptop, surrounded by the eeriness of the dead of night, and the unnerving hum of my window A/C, I have to say, I agree. The film follows Caleb, who is selected to go to his company's CEO's secluded home/lab, and test his artificially intelligent creation, Ava. In true Hitchcock form, as we watch the day to day interactions between the three leads, the background tension begins to build. There's the growing relationship/attraction between Caleb and Ava, the unstable and clouded motives and actions of the CEO, and the mysterious other AI in the house, who's treatment and general existence leave Caleb with far more questions than he has answers. All of these story lines weave together and build to the film's twisted, and satisfying finale. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves suspense, sci-fi, Hitchcock, or just cinema in general. Expertly crafted, director Alex Garland's \"Ex Machina\" definitely lives up to the hype as one of the best films of the year.",

He has written a few masterpieces IMHO so i was surprised in his directing debut that the weakest part seemed to be the writing. The writing is by no means bad, its actually a perfect representation of if this situation were to happen or if AI were to be created this is what would take place. That is also part of the problem for me, everything that happened felt expected, never surprising. The performances are so good and the directing is solid but it doesn't feel unique. I might even blame part of this on the trailer, one of the big twist moments is in it. Stupid marketing.",

    "review": "  Very stylistic and also surprising intelligent. A lot of science fiction films try to fake intelligence with fictional wordplay and scenarios, but this movie (although obviously far from reality), still felt particularly realistic for some reason. Throughout the film you are introduced to a highly complex trust system. Even close to the end, you aren't sure who exactly you should trust (even though I managed to figure out, considering I am a film critic with a high sense of detail), and this made the film a little more interesting. The elements were not overly original, but also not clich�. I found that by watching this movie, I was highly inspired to study up on computer science and create my own version of Ava (even though if spent, say, 30 years working on it it wouldn't be nearly as advanced). The acting here was quite amazing, actually, I was impressed. There aren't very many actors in this film and 90% of the film takes place indoors with no windows allowing you to see the outside, and this added a sense of utter isolation and made me positively uncomfortable. The movie has flaws, however. The biggest flaw is that the movie's direction could have been better. Some scenes felt awkward to me, and some even felt unnecessary. There was one scene in particular that, to me, made no sense at all (though I won't spoil what it is, I will hint at it by saying it's close to the end and involves a shaving razor) and that would have been fine if this a surrealistic film but due to the previous pacing of the movie it felt unnatural to me. Other than that, I would not mind seeing this movie for a second viewing, maybe with a friend. Do I recommend this movie? Yes, it's definitely worth a view, even if science fiction isn't exactly your thing. One of the most pleasant features of the film had to have been the high amount of intellectual dialogue and complex characters and feelings you'll experience, and does all of this without feeling unrealistic or overly confusing. I recommend this movie.",

The acting is perfect (for the characters) and the movie is very well-made. I was surprised at the budget (only $15 million and only is a word used loosely) but I would easily believe a few studios would make the exact same movie but spend $100 million. The movie really has no dull moments and the only moment that I didn't love was part of the ending, but you'll have to watch it to see what I mean and why I wouldn't change it if I could.",

A computer programmer wins a contest to stay at the bunker of the genius behind the company he works for, only the contest was really a smokescreen to bring in someone to test his robot and her artificial intelligence. It is part sci-fi and part thriller, and it succeeds quite well in both arenas. The special effects are also very good, as well as understated, which is really appreciated in this day and age of over the top special effects extravaganzas. Quite often, when you lower the budget and scale back the effects...you need an actual story. Luckily, this film delivers in that capacity.",

Unfortunately I think I may have fallen prey to that thing that will happen when you exist in the online film sphere, which is overhyping. Ex Machina never came to cinemas near me (I don't live in America) so I had literally eight months of getting little moments spoiled, having time to over-think what would happen, and most of all, people who were given the chance to see it telling me left, right and centre about what a masterpiece it is. And I did like it, it was good, but it's hard to separate yourself from this expectation of it having that extra something that kicks it up into overdrive, and for me, I never felt like I got that.",

    "review": "  My notes on the film \"Ex Machina\" (2015): Superb special effects, brilliant dialog, and capable acting dominate the first two-thirds of the film. The final act, though, loses its way when the \"genius\" characters act stupid enough to allow catastrophe, and taking the film seriously becomes impossible due to contrivances and illogical or irrational omissions of what's already been set up in the plot. (As for subtext, a viewer could see this film as a study on the cruelty of humanity as a whole, or as a ploy for feminists' rights, or a diva's revenge against her tyrannical director... On another note, the movie could be looked at as a warning against transexuals, because eventually it becomes clear that the actor portraying the leading robot is a male-to-female post-op, or she's intended to look like one, which is a different story entirely.) What a let-down. Yet the musical score adds a lot of fun to the film, especially the disco scene, which is a highlight.",

Considering this, I suppose the joke is on me for spending most of the film caught up in its vivid mood, gorgeous cinematography, and brilliant acting - all the while expecting far too big of a payoff from what amounts to a disappointingly simple story. Oscar Isaac completely sells the role of a slightly unhinged tech giant, whose genius we take for granted even as the character is incredibly underwritten. He lures employee Domnhall Gleason to a mysterious compound and gives him the task of assessing the relative humanity of an A.I. played by the electric (sorry, couldn't resist) Alicia Vikander. Things open up rather predictably into a \"who-is-playing-who?\" scenario, and the outcome feels, oddly, both expected and misguided.It's a mix between the existential dread of \"Terminator,\" the post-humanity philosophy of \"The Matrix,\" and the didactic hedonism of \"Westworld.\" In ambition, that's fantastic. In execution, such a blend requires a scope of vision that isn't quite wide enough here. With lesser actors, this could have been a dud. Instead, the cast elevates the material to a near miss.",

    "review": "  (When you read my review, keep in mind that I will only mention those things I found disappointing. Consider the things not mentioned as positive. Also, it contains SPOILERS is quite long, and comes from someone who writes a review for the first time.) Even though Ex Machina doesn't look like your typical science-fiction movie about robots at first glance, I found it disappointing that it still has all properties of such a movie, wrapped in an almost pretentious package of smart-talk and references to great figures such as Wittgenstein. This is because it has all the elements of such a film, only hidden: 1. It has the mad scientist, made original by giving him the attitude of a young student. He is talented, explosive, frightening, and somewhat evil. 2. Our protagonist is an awkward boy with a traumatizing past, also with a huge talent, and portrayed as ''the chosen one''. (This is not stereotypical for science-fiction only, but more for movies in common and it proves yet again to be a great tool for setting up the script. Normally I would not have found this too annoying, but considering the highly intended originality of the film it seemed somewhat weak to use this almost clich� set-up.) 3. Our protagonist falls in love with Ava, and their love is 'impossible' in a way. Mister mad scientist is an utter genius who seems totally in control, but has one weakness which opens up the perfect window for our traumatized boy to help Ava. 4. Ava is super-intelligent, shows oddities in her behaviour, and seems to lack compassion. That would look like the perfect description of an AI in a whole bunch of sci-fi movies involving robots that want to take over the world (and is highly contradictory with the goal of creating an AI that needs to pass the Turing-test). 5. In the end, the robot wins over her creator and lacks the emotion to spare her saviour. The perfect doom-scenario for your dime a dozen robot apocalypse movies. (There are other minor points like these but I find them superfluous to my point.) All these points, dryly summed up are to me the ideal description of a sci-fi movie about robots taking over the world only on an individual scale. This makes Ex Machina look like a highly original movie, but exactly the same at its basis. I find this to be an inexcusable form of lying due to great work done in not making it look like 'those other movies'.My second major issue with Ex Machina besides its hidden clich� is that the whole point of Nathan is to make an AI on the same level of a human being, but Ava strongly shows that she lacks certain fundamental characteristics of a human, and overall still appears a robot with human decoration, while exactly these things should be those that an AI has to overcome to pass the Turing-test in plain sight. First off, Nathan has not given Ava compassion. She does not struggle with fundamental questions about her being while her circumstances clearly call for that, and her face is mostly blank. She also doesn't save Caleb for him being her saviour, nor does she show anger for him possibly being an enemy because he is male, just like her resentful creator (She might have developed a hate for males). She shows no emotion or struggle at all, only calculated hypothetical behaviour and remorselessness. Second, she misses something quite simple which I don't understand the scripter missed. Namely physical feeling. Nathan smashed off her arm, but she didn't seem to feel a thing. Can an AI be said to be human if she only feels pleasure in her vagina (or is that just plot hole??) These remarks I find clearly to show that Ex Machina lacked in portraying an AI that is on par with a human, all the while making Caleb claim that Ava was indeed of the same level. That for me, does great damage to the movie's symbolic value.To conclude, Ex Machina is a good movie, but it has some fundamental issues that do great damage to its value and intentions.",

An internet mogul has created a brand new AI and wants to determine if will pass the Turing test by having the best coder in his company interact with her. Over the course of a week, the 3 interact with each other in such matters that build suspense and have each character questioning there own values, morals and sense of being. Ex Machina had some great concepts, and has a solid vision, but a part of me wondered if this film had suited better with a different director. Ex Machina is well worth watching, well styled, but some of the plot holes such as the cameras and black outs, and sequences left me wanting some more substance.",

In a dark and often claustrophobic setting, completely isolated from the rest of the world, we follow two talented men in what we should consider the turning point of the human/posthuman civilization. An intelligent and updated story of men vs machines. Bioprosthetics, intelligent software, the infinite potentiality of the web, AI and the Turing test are all there. I have found references to many classical scifi elements such as the Robot series by Asimov, the cybernetic futures of Philip K Dick, the HAL9000 rebellion... Minimal special effects, simple bur elegant design, and beautiful androids reminiscent of Hajime Sorayama. The music score is well chosen. Good acting. Hope the director will continue in this direction",

    "review": "  This film touches on a critical subject - that is consciousness / soul.It is clear to many that even animals, especially cats and dogs, have personalities, consciousness, and even \"souls\".Is it so much of a stretch that eventually machines could as well ?It's a major dilemma.Everyone could use a Servant - or a SLAVE - that could help them, protect them, and yes, pleasure them. But most have major ethical issues with delegating this status to a fellow human being.But a soulless robot ? Why not ?Unfortunately, can a robot be smart enough to fulfill its duties adequately without it gaining consciousness ?Now, if the robot simply drove, yes. Mowed the lawn, yes. Vacuumed, yes. Had sex, yes. Cooked and cleaned ? These are actually tasks that require a great deal of subjective reasoning. So.. ???Sadly, at some point the task WILL be so subjective that it is very likely a line will be crossed, into self-awareness. Very bad.I guess time will tell......",

It may be too slow for the average movie goer, but it was certainly a well made film. The ending was unexpected and shocking.

It could have kept it unsettling, while adding this clever juxtaposition with the disturbing ending you just witnessed.",

To be clear, this is a film about smart people, not a film for smart people. Each moment in the well-crafted rise in tension was...expected. Each reveal a scenario imagined within 5 minutes of the film. The dialogue fumbled toward profound but never took hold of it. This film has ambition, is expertly done, but isn't a seminal film. The directorial detail was the real genius here. Garland (the director) is slated to direct Halo, and based on this film, it's a well deserved shot at greatness.",

The movie only features 3 main characters but those 3 are done perfectly, especially the A.I. female who is also done with outstanding special effects. The premise of the film seems fairly basic, a scientist builds an AI and brings in a guy to test it out but interacting with her. It slowly progresses day by day and the relationship between the two grow as other aspects of the scientist are revealed. While watching it you know something big is going to happen and the build up for it is amazing and there is a great payoff that you won't see coming. The action and intense moments don't really come until the end but they are well worth it and seal up the film nicely. If you are into science fiction at all this is a must see. Even if you aren't big into the genre you will get some amusement out of this solid flick.",

    "review": "  Ava: Isn't it strange, to create something that hates you?Caleb Smith es el programador estrella de una compa��a, y es elegido para pasar 1 semana en la casa en las monta�as de Nathan Bateman, el CEO. Nathan es un personaje exc�ntrico. No es lo que uno se esperar�a de un hombre en esta posici�n. Se ejercita casi obsesivamente, toma de la misma manera, y tiene un humor sarc�stico. Inmediatamente al llegar, Caleb se entera que va a ser parte de un experimento que cambiar� a la historia. Su misi�n es evaluar a Ava -un robot- y concluir si podr�a exhibir un comportamiento inteligente similar al, o indistinguible de, el de un humano. Ex Machina es una pel�cula que va construyendo una atm�sfera cada vez m�s misteriosa, de manera que es dif�cil saber que vendr� luego. Nos da una sensaci�n de incomodidad desde el principio. La casa en la que se encuentran, es fr�a y alejada de todo, dentro de las monta�as. Los paisajes son hermosos, al igual que la fotograf�a dentro de la casa. Todo tiene un toque est�ril que va perfectamente con la trama de inteligencia artificial. El ritmo de las escenas es lenta, y tiene peque�os detalles que van ayudando a descifrar las intensiones detr�s de ciertos comportamientos en los personajes. Por ejemplo, Ethan y Nathan se encuentran observando un cuadro de Pollock, donde Ethan explica como las pinceladas en el cuadro vienen de un lugar humano, que no son calculadas. Este es el aspecto que me encant� de la pel�cula. Tiene referencias al arte, ciencia y condici�n humana que te dejan pensando.Las actuaciones son excelentes, y son la que ayudan que Ex Machina se vea como un panorama totalmente plausible. Domhnall Gleeson como Caleb, le da una ingenuidad a su personaje que es necesaria para la conclusi�n de la pel�cula. Al enamorarse de Ava, es entendible porque la liber�, y luego es traicionado por la misma cualidad que lo hace humano. Alicia Vikander como Ava es una revelaci�n. Todos sus manerismos, que no son tan obvios, la hacen cre�ble como robot, pero a la vez su voz y calidez tienen una cualidad dual humana, y Oscar Isaac como Nathan es una persona que ha sido traicionada por su genio, y que en ciertas escenas tiene un carisma que ayuda a olvidar parte de su actitud ego�sta y malvada, y esto es lo que hace dif�cil descifrar si es el malo de la pel�cula.Ex Machina es un gran logro en el g�nero de ciencia ficci�n. Sin duda la mejor pel�cula del 2015 hasta este momento.",

    "review": "  When you strip away the AI part of the story the movie is about an abusive megalomaniac man that has imprisoned beautiful women in his impenetrable fortress for his own egotistical and sexual gratification. Charming Ava concocts a scheme between herself, another female and a nice-guy involving feigned love and murder in order to escape. The nice guy remains trapped in the prison; left behind so as to take the fall.Nathan, an antagonist alcoholic, is an unfeeling and uncaring CEO of the world biggest and most powerful search engine. He has isolated himself both mentally and physically in his unsettlingly lifeless, shiny and minimalist home-laboratory buried deep underground and hidden far away in the mountains. Ava is his robot creation. As engaging and erotic as Ava is it, is interesting that Nathan was scared enough of his creation's power and independence that he kept her locked in a glass cell. So cautious was he with is robotic seductress.What first seemed like significant shortcomings to the movie actually gave clarity that it was not about useful AI in society, and not just about hyper-rich Nathan's sick entertainment and fantasies, but was about how Nathan gamed Caleb (who thought he was there as the Turning tester) to be the other Turning test subject. There were no plans for the future world with his AI. No product presentation. No product plan. No manufacturing facility. No launch date. We see just Nathan and his quiet lab where he has single-handedly worked on his game changing enormous DIYS secret project for his self-gratification. We don't see robots engaged in or cooperating together or working on anything complex or difficult problems - nothing. AIs potential, capability and capacity for improving society went unexplored and was degrading; for example, one female robot was nothing more than a sexy mute servant. It lacked any explanation about how to construct a valid Turing test and what would be its criteria. The Turning test, it turns out, was if the human tester falls in love then the machine passed the test. Nathan was watching Caleb and Ava to determine if he or they would verifiably fall in love - his Turing test.The most interesting AI twist was when the robot became self-aware, hated her creator, and desired to escape to the real world. In order to meet that end, she lied, manipulated, murdered, and betrayed the loyalty and emotions of a man who cared about her, so that she could successfully get what she wanted. Freedom comes at a high price.",

This is a beautifully shot , tight little film that invites one to think deeply on important issues, that doesnt try to answer all these questions but simply presents us with interesting characters who share an experience of discovery and all-too human interactions. If youve seen a great deal of sci fi or indie films, there will be some predictability in this, and after thinking about it for some time, i feel like the logic of some of the critical mistakes falls apart, but otherwise a really interesting movie worth a watch.

    "review": "  I've liked a lot of the films that Alex Garland has written and was very interested in seeing his directorial debut, especially after the phenomenal reviews it was gotten. The film moves at a slow pace at times, but its great at building tension and suspense early in the film. The film has very few characters, but the 3 leads are all tremendous in their roles (Domhnall and Oscar will both be in the upcoming Star Wars films as well, so they are going to be huge soon). The film's special effects were great without being over the top or distracting at all. I really liked the ending, but I felt it moved slow during the last few scenes and their wasn't too much excitement there, but since this was my only real complaint, it's not too big of a deal. Overall Ex Machina was a very well-made original sci-fi film that I really liked and will probably be in my top 10 for 2015.",

    "review": "  Mature, thought provoking, and surprising, Ex Machina is yet another laudable film from writer/director Alex Garland. As the result of a lottery of sorts a young programmer is selected to engage in an experiment, testing the artificial intelligence of a cutting edge AI creation from an eccentric wealthy tech giant.What I appreciated most about Ex Machina was the inherent intellectual dilemma at its heart. What defines intelligence? What's the nature of thought, and how do we know something is truly thinking? When do rights come in to play? It explores these questions in subtle ways, through a story full of intrigue, character study, and ultimately thrills. The cast is strong as a whole, though I contend that Domhall Gleeson was a bit uneven in his delivery, and the special effects fantastic. It's a film that puts plot first, and treats its audience with intelligence. There's no spoon-feeding or pandering, just an original story with first-class filmmaking.In the end, it's more of an intellectual workout than a sensory overload, and that's all too rare in Hollywood.4/5 Stars",

    "review": "  The directorial debut of Alex Garland (the writer behind \"28 Days Later\" and \"Never Let Me Go\"), \"Ex Machina\" is one of the most ambitious films of the year. Draped in metallic interiors and dankly cool exteriors, it is a sci-fi tale of extreme minimalism, its simplicity making its captivating ideas seem booming, life-sized. Questioning what we've come to know about technology and making the idea of artificial intelligence an unsettling reality, \"Ex Machina\" is at once distressing and wickedly smart, by turns cunningly provocative and subversively satirical.  The movie opens in the banal headquarters of Bluebook, a search engine corporation in the same category of Google. Leading programmer Caleb Smith's (Domhnall Gleeson) mundane workday is suddenly interrupted by an announcement - he has been selected, as part of a companywide contest, to visit idiosyncratic CEO Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac) at his sheltered, mountainous home. He is to spend a week there, no interruptions and no sudden flights out. Upon arrival, Nathan reveals that he is in the process of perfecting a new kind of artificial intelligence, not in your average Siri form but in the embodiment of a humanistic android. Caleb will be the living, breathing partner in a Turing Test that will decide whether or not Nathan's machine will prove effective in the material world. The robotic invention in the process of analytical refinement is Ava (Alicia Vikander), an extraordinarily complex machine that may turn out to be much more perceptive than Caleb, let alone her creator, ever expected (or wanted).  With only three main cast members (four, if you count Sonoya Mizuno, who turns eyes but never speaks a word), \"Ex Machina\" feels claustrophobically minimal in its every move, with few actors, few ramifications in its set design (mostly consisting of futuristic deco), and few plot points to complicate the intricate details of the story. Reminiscent of the slow burn sci-fi of last year's \"Under the Skin\" (which I mistakenly underrated), \"Ex Machina\" dazzles in its understated elaborations, its mysteries building and building until it reaches a bloody (but not unexpected) conclusion. As the film glides along, it grows ever apparent that Nathan is not really who he seems and that Ava has a lot more on her programmed mind than sitting through quaint little tests with a strawberry blonde sad sack. The way \"Ex Machina\" twists and turns about can sometimes be predictable (it's clear from the start that it's impossible to trust any sort of revolutionary AI), but never is it any less than fascinating. The conversations between Caleb and Ava are edged in an underlying mist of erotica and magnetism - while it's obvious that Caleb has an attraction to the android, his understandable incapacity to show it makes their relationship all the more tense, one of mutual yearning and objectification. The exchanges that go back and forth between Caleb and Nathan, however, are compellingly passive aggressive: whereas Ava remains an awesome question mark throughout the entirety of the film, the bond between Caleb and Nathan is immediately apparent. It is one of distrust, paranoia; while it seems as though they are equals at first glance, their kinship is more relatable to 1972's \"Sleuth\", in which Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine played a puzzling game of one-upmanship where the hero of the film (shockingly) didn't win the battle of wits.  Isaac alternates between a charismatic fa�ade and a bullying one, always ensuring that he stays the wiser; his ability to maintain a villainous undertone, though, is what makes Isaac's performance so great. It, at first, is hardly blatant that he shouldn't be trusted, but something about his body language, his manner of speak, suggests otherwise. Gleeson resonates as a mild-mannered protagonist perhaps too in over his head to pull off any wanted attempts of heroism, but it's Vikander that runs away with the film. While she provides the most simplistic performance in \"Ex Machina\", Vikander has the difficult task of appearing robotic and humane. Her characterization is something of a wonder, making Ava simultaneously sympathetic, blank, and vaguely threatening.  But while \"Ex Machina\" is an acting triumph, it will stay long in the memory for its quips about modern technology. We've become so heavily reliant on our digital counterparts that part of one's soul will forever belong to a social media app or a search engine, never to be brought back. \"Ex Machina\" ponders how far we will go with our advances before it's too late, before man becomes machine and the human population transforms into nothing but a memory. This is science fiction at its best: nominal but immensely stirring in the way it gains relevance into the lives of the viewer.",

    "review": "  Ex Machina is a film by Alex Garland about a programmer who was invited by the founder of \"Blue Book.\" the Google equivalent of the movie into this beautiful isolated research facility to participate in a Turing test (Just Google it). This is now included in my science fiction favorites. The first thing this film will provide is beautiful shot of the set of the film. It successfully combined a blend of a beautiful isolated place that portrayed mountains, rivers, open fields, and places lightly covered with snow and it also portrayed a simple and realistic set of a research facility that was not overdone. The effects were also great. The robot was realistic and I was not sure if it's practical effects or CGI which is a good thing.The film created a lot of tension that was just building up until the end of the film. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. Though it's now all just build-up. There were several scenes in the early and middle acts that made a lot of impact and left me in shock. There is just something about films where the audience will have a second thought of who the antagonist is. It's all very thought provoking stuff. All of this thanks to the great writing and story telling form the premise, building the plot from that premise, and finally the ending which I thought was beautifully done.Alicia Vikander as Ava was great. Her expressions were so realistic and had me believe that it's an AI trying to replicate human expressions. It's right in the middle of genuine human expressions and robotic simulation. Great, great acting.The only element of the film that I thought could've been done better was the casting except for Alicia. The actors were good in the film but not great like Ava, the robot. The two other main characters can be easily forgotten. Good but forgettable.To summarize, I think this is a good contender for the best film of 2015.",

In her/its effort all the traditional ployes are used: wide open eyes, innocent \"questions\", decoration of the body, etc. It's the least innovative story I've ever seen, its been told countless times.

Although I'm a little tired of Domhnall Gleeson playing the same character in each of his movies, he shines in this one as a lonely computer coder interacting with artificial intelligence as created by his employer. For a story mostly in one building, it is a remarkable film that questions more of the use of artificial intelligence. Alex Garland does incredibly well in his directorial debut, creating an impressive and unique film that is a must watch.",

This film is everything you could hope for in its genre. Creepy through out, and Oscar Isaac showing how much of a talent he really is. Ex is a film that will question morality and make you wonder if technology is actually worth it. AI as always is terrifying, but a human that's self aware is terrifying. So imagine a machine that is and its everyone's worste nightmare. Great film.",

It seems like the A.I. premise is becoming more and more of a go-to plot these days and it doesn't always succeed. Too many components are recycled, too many more just don't work, many times raising great questions but never living up to the abstract concepts that go along with them. That said, Ex Machina is a bit predictable but a sleek take on the A.I. storyline. It's engaging, makes you think, at times silly, hauntingly realistic, and ultimately tragic. It's one of the better A.I. films I've seen in a while and I'd definitely recommend it for fans of the genre. More and more it's beginning to seem like these ideas may become our own reality in the near future.",

The performances are all top notch and the interactions with Ava, the film's AI played magnificently by the lovely Alicia Vikander, are complex and fascinating. The film focuses on the ethics of technology, not specifically about the creation of AI, rather the consequences of what it took to create the AI in the first place. Recommended highly!",

    "review": "  This movie was not smart. It missed the mark on all fronts from the wholly incorrect characterization of the ?Turing Test? to the illogical and inconsistent (mis-)use of the term ?AI?. The audience is asked to take for granted such incredible innovations as perfectly-replicated human faces and emotions, while emphasizing the much less exciting aspects of what is otherwise completely mischaracterized as ?AI?.The acting was horrendous ? the pitiful dialog sounding like two actors reading through the script rather than actually interpreting it. The technobabble only made this worse, but you would think the actors would at least try to sell it more. For some reason, the characters are all supposed to be American, yet 100% of the primary actors are foreign, and their fake American English accents distract from the already-pitiful dialog. (The Irish guy can?t pronounce certain American phonemes, and the Swedish woman slips in and out of an American accent seemingly at random.) The protagonist Irish actor is also entirely the wrong casting for this role ? he is just not believable. But then again, the writing is so bad, it?s hard to put it all on him.Finally, the core plot really makes no sense, and if anything hand-waves all the core issues in favor of keeping us confused so they can surprise us with a couple of admittedly thoughtful plot twists. But they really seem to have just structured a story around a couple of plot twists, and lazily ignored all the back-story and sub-plots truly needed to carry it off. In the end, there?s really no well-defined motivation for the actions of the characters, and none of the twists is so good that I can read other commenters? reviews saying ?brilliant? and ?smart? without chuckling or even crying a little. In fact, this script would likely get a C in a college writing class, since we never get true motivation for the characters? actions. It?s as if the writer(s) are hoping to trick us into thinking they wrote something smart, by just leaving everything out and letting us as the audience guess as to the meaning. It?s the cinematic equivalent of looking at an ink-splatter in a museum and hearing someone talk about the deep meaning behind it, when you know it?s just a bunch of ink being flung at the canvas.The filmmaking is mixed, but on the whole falls woefully short of expectations. The special effects and cinematography are fine (some brilliant bits, but very few and far between) ? but that just makes the movie that much more disappointing when held up against the rest of the production and direction: long periods of up to 7 minutes of absolutely no dialog, and weird 60?s experimental style background music that makes you want to mute the volume until the dialog starts back up. The effects innovation that led to the believability of a \"hollow woman? as a manifestation of the misnamed ?AI? is really pretty much the only innovation. The rest is just stock off-the-shelf, and could be set in any time period, with any lighting and design sensibility. This reviewer was left desperately wanting more in terms of special effects to support more scientific innovations and futuristic look and feel. This film just pushed all of that to the side, and focused entirely on the incongruous sexuality of a green screen.For all of you science fiction buffs out there who love to see new visualizations of futuristic technology and cool technical ideas, this is absolutely not the movie for you. If you are a horror buff (which I?m not), this is also not the movie for you ? it?s barely if at all really a horror flick. If you are attracted to the sexuality of the actors, forget it! Yes, there are some shameless scenes of exploitation of the female nude, but it even falls short of being even the softest soft-core. There?s just really no redeeming value that I can find. I?m sorry but you will be wasting your time if you watch this. I sure did!",

    "review": "  This is the sci-fi films for you if you're into more of the science as opposed to fiction. Though, of course, a sentient artificial intelligence is also some pretty cool fiction as well. However, at least this sentient AI is something that's more relevant in this day and age as we get closer to achieving something remotely close to the artificial intelligence in the film. One of the film's main strengths is the fact that you're never really sure if you can trust anyone in the actual film, so that keeps things interesting as the narrative progresses which is, essentially, a test performed to see if Ava is truly a sentient AI or is it her programming? They do this by having sessions between Caleb and Ava where they discuss various issues. While these conversations themselves are immensely fascinating, as you get to see more aspects of Ava's personality and what motivates her, or what she pretends motivates her. But Caleb's and Nathan's conversations about all aspects of the project, the programming, coding and the debates they get into about the AI are, easily, the best parts of the entire film. I just find their conversations to be interesting and somewhat enlightening view into the mind of a genius, in the case of Nathan, a Steve Jobs-esque figure. There's the obvious religious symbolism with Ava being Eve from the creation myth, obviously, Caleb being a biblical name and Nathan being god himself. I don't think they hide this, but it's a little more subtle than what It was in It Follows. I don't wanna say the film is simple, because it's actually anything but, it is thought-provoking, but they do get a lot out of what is, essentially, a very minimalist approach to filmmaking and only a handful of actors. Granted, a lot of that is carried by the interesting conversations about the nature of artificial intelligence, how they'll look at us as fossils a couple of years into their existence, their thought process and whether they're sincere in what they say or if it's programming. The film does build to the climax that one would reasonably come to expect given the premise. But, and I don't know why, it wasn't exactly as satisfying as one would imagine. It has nothing to do with the execution of it, because I thought it was very well-done, but it just didn't really click with me as much as the rest of the film did. I just think it feels a bit out of place with such a high-concept film as this. It's definitely a contradiction. Cause it makes sense within the context of the narrative, but it still feels out of place. Still, I found the film to be excellent all-around. Great writing, really great acting and a great score. It might not be the most complex sci-fi film ever created, but it does offer and incredibly fascinating, and rewarding, look at AI and what may be a glimpse at our future. It probably won't be as dramatically interesting as this film, but sentience among AI is an inevitability. With that said, this film is highly recommended. I loved it.",

    "review": "  Amidst a glut of AI-themed films in the past year, EX MACHINA is destined to stand out for what it does differently, and arguably better. While other films might be content to broach interesting questions in theory, they often lose focus by an over-reliance on visual effects and visceral action. This film strips much of that away and engages those interesting questions, often at the expense of emotional impact, but clearly aware of the implications of the subjects it addresses. The setup for the story is quite simple: a programmer (Domnhall Gleeson) for a large tech company is invited to the CEO's (Oscar Isaac) residence/research facility to perform a Turing Test on an AI he has created. From there, as director/writer Alex Garland says (or, at least pretty close), a small group of individuals are \"put in a confined location, the screws are turned, and we see what happens.\" The central themes of human interaction and what it ultimately means to be human are key here, and addressed in an intelligent way with dialogue that sounds true-to-life. Although Domnhall Gleeson is essentially a stand-in for the audience, I found Oscar Isaac's character to be the most interesting. He was just so down-to-earth and personable, even as it becomes apparent that his motives might not be so altruistic. This leads to a sub-theme of manipulation, as each character manipulates and is manipulated by each other. There is even a brief scene which could lead to discussion about surveillance and the \"internet of things,\" insofar as these large companies like Google have unprecedented access to our data and lives in general. Like all films of this caliber, there aren't really any answers given, but that really isn't the point. It's there to stimulate the mind and invite discussion. However, this means that it won't be to everyone's taste. The pacing is very deliberate and will probably bore some people. Also of concern/interest is the ending, which will likely divide even those who like the film. I thought it was shocking enough, but still anti-climactic in a way. Beyond the writing and performances, which were all excellent, the technical aspects of the film were equally impressive. I liked how the production design and cinematography worked together to create a sterile environment that you can take in with slow, deliberate camera movement and artfully composed shots that have perfect lighting. Even the robot effects were very well-done for something this modestly budgeted. If there's any complaint I have it's that the film, with a few exceptions, is as emotionally sterile as the controlled environment in which it takes place. I wish it had engaged a little more than just my brain. Still, all things considered, EX MACHINA is destined to become a sci-fi classic. It has intellectual themes and drama in a gradually intensifying situation, a great cast, and it looks great. What more could you ask for?",

This wouldn't be so disappointing if he didn't spend the rest of the movie teasing us with so much good material (Oscar Isaac's genius/bro/sociopath Caleb is a wonderfully unique invention). If Garland can ever figure out a third act that matches the rest of what he's written (see 2007's \"Sunshine\" as well), then he'll truly make something amazing.",

    "review": "  EX MACHINA A movie review by Mr. AnarchyMovie Review #1 Ex Machina is one of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen along with Star Wars (IV, V and VI) and District 9. I've been itching and ready to see this for months now. This movie is beautiful, terrifying and this is a great example of what movies can do with small casts. Ex Machina doesn't waste our time with explaining too much on specifics in the beginning because let's face it we just wanted to see the damn robot. Caleb, Nathan and Ava are all well defined characters. Ava is a little more easy to understand since she's a robot. The story of a Caleb doing a Turing test on Ava is such a This is one movie you could count as something that which isn't tied to one genre. This could count as a neo noire because Ava is by definition a Femme Fatale. The robot aspect brings in the sci-fi element. But the ideas and philosophical questions that this movie asks are what qualify Ex Machina as being capable to put on a horror movie list. And don't misunderstand me, it's not that this movie is scary with jump scare or some sort of Five Nights at Freddy's thing, but rather it's more the possibilities of what could happen to the human race at the hands of our own creations should they turn on us. This movie looked beautiful in every aspect of the word. The lighting, the shots, the location and the special effects especially in Ex Machina were incredible. When the power went out I loved the red light in the room and how much it added to the atmosphere of the story. Then there was the cinematography, which was amazing all the way through. I was talking to a friend of mine and she told me about how much she loved this movie and how she loved the cinematography. She told me these specific words: \"Every shot in the movie could be used as a single photo and look beautiful by itself.\" And, as far as I know, she's not a pretentious movie buff who dropped out of film school after not having the money to pay for the classes and I agreed with her completely on that point. Every shot of the movie looked great. I made one of the scenes in the movie my cover photo on my Facebook profile and they picked the best locations for filming Ex Machina. The special effects aren't the sole thing the movie relies on for effect, but I loved how Ava looked as a robot. I mean all of Ava looked mechanical enough to where we can believe that Ava is a robot yet not too mechanical to the point where it just looks ridiculous. If Alex Garland had a specific look in mind before he started filming then I'd wager that he achieved what he wanted. Now I will go onto the most depressing part of Ex Machina. While I maybe taking this part of the movie a bit too seriously, the ideas and questions introduced to us are both thought provoking and terrifying. And I think that they're important for me to talk about in this review. One thing I have to mention is that while this movie was going I paused it to get some food and I thought to myself: \"Man, Artificial Intelligence is gonna kick so much ass when it arrives! I can't wait!\" However after watching this movie ALL THE WAY THROUGH I realized that I was very wrong. A general question posed to us by the film is this: \"Is A.I. safe and if not do we really want A.I. to exist?\" Human beings are the Apex predators of planet Earth for many reasons one of which is that we've been making and using tools for hundreds of years. Human beings are responsible for creating the tool of language and that is one of our greatest achievements even though we don't all have the same language. But language hasn't turned on us or tried to kill us because it's just us tossing out sounds vibrations and pops. Those don't hurt us physically unless you're yelling straight into someone's ear like I do all the time so that I can make sure people can hear me. And (arguably) we as human beings have total control over this tool that we created. But Artificial Intelligence could be the death of us all solely because WE WOULD HAVE NO CONTROL OVER IT. Alex Garland gives us a worst case scenario for what could very well happen if we really created an A.I. capable of maneuvering on it's own without any additional programming, reprogramming, debugging, troubleshooting, etc. Ava was unpredictable to Caleb, toyed with his emotions, used her own technological misunderstandings to fool Caleb into thinking that she wasn't as advanced as he thought and when it came down to whether or not she liked him Ava really didn't give a shit about Caleb in the end. A gun, while in the hands of another man has the potential to kill, but it does not have the potential to get up, think for itself and kill us on it's own. A.I. has that potential and I don't want to go any further down the rabbit hole to see how this could turn out for the human race. All in all Ex Machina is a beautiful film. It was very well written and while the movie did have some rough points throughout where the storytelling could have been better it still came together in a beautiful way.",

    "review": "  This is one hell of a directorial debut for Alex Garland. You see, to me, sci-fis can go in one of two directions: awesome action thriller (Alien), great philosophical-intellectual type film (Interstellar, 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc.), and if a sci-fi tries to go both ways (Prometheus...), it does so at the expense of both ways and you end up with an average middle-ground, in my humble opinion. This film does the philosophical-intellectual thing really well. There are 4 things which make this film a great film: Oscar Isaac's character (very fascinating to listen to and watch; he's one of those really smart but definitely not nerdy geniuses, kind of like Tony Stark/Iron Man in a way) and Ava's character (brings a touch of humanity to the plate, ironically, as she is shown to be vulnerable but not all that she seems character), the dialogue and interactions between the characters (all of it, from the discussions on AI to aspects of life to what it means to be human, which is always a huge plus for me), the suspense towards the end and the twist, and the overall exploration of AI. The acting all around is great, the soundtrack, cinematography, and directing really set the mood very well, and the way we are shown things and how we gradually find out the explanations keeps you intrigued all through along with the great dialogue. There is a surprising amount of nudity, though, in this film, which kind of caught me off guard.There is only one slight weakness to the film, and that's Domnhall Gleeson's character. He isn't really fleshed out, and I feel like they had a missed opportunity to do that really well in the beginning, because throughout the film, you kind of just see him as this guy who's into AI, and nothing much more. What really made me notice this was because of how great Oscar Isaac and Ava were, so in that crowd, he stands out. Anyways, it's not really an issue. Just more of a missed opportunity for a perfect film.",

Some good ideas in here but it's something that could have just as easily been covered in one hour, perhaps in a \"Black Mirror\" or \"Twilight Zone\" format, but as a 2.5 hr feature it's just too long, and dull, and Gleeson seems to be working alone throughout to fill the screen. Weak supporting cast, little in engaging special effects and uninteresting sets, mar what could have been a novel (if sensationalist) twist on a sci-fi theme that's been done to death.",

    "review": "  Well, i think this Science Fiction film definitely has the warning of the year, \"don't trust in humanoid robots\".Maybe five months ago, when this picture was released for its first time, i was very eager to see it, because i felt trapped with the story. The British director and writer Alex Garland is technically unknow, so that could mean new ideas to the current cinema.Ex Machina is the story of a programmer working for Bluebook, the world's most popular search engine. He wins a contest and was chosen to spend a week in the house of Nathan Bateman, the company's CEO. Once there Caleb (the programmer) is impressed with the technological advances of Nathan, mainly with his most recent ceation, Ava.First of all, Alicia Vikander is amazing in her role as Ava, the A.I (Artficial Intelligence) prototype, and the two male protagonists are pretty convincing to, on the one hand, Oscar Isaac like the eccentric and talented Nathan Bateman, and on the other, Domhnall Gleeson like the innocent programmer Caleb Smith.This movie has a great cinematography by Rob Hardy (every detail is left to the viewer's eye) and the music by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow is almost perfect, i can't explain how much my ears enjoy every chord.I enjoyed it so much, but i expect more. It's slow and more than Sci-Fi i think is a mixture of Drama and Suspence. Despite the last mentioned is going to be difficult in the rest of the year, that another picture in the genre overcomes this cinematographic work.",

    "review": "  When a movie can make me feel something new, something so unique then it has to be a success. Unless that is the complete void left in my soul after seeing The Last Airbender. Ex Machina has done that and succeeds in that way and many more. From the beginning we're given one of the reasons this movie is captivating. The gorgeous landscapes. I'm not sure where Ex Machina was filmed but I want to go. The randomly inserted nature shots are like the best of the best from a discovery channel special. Obviously this is a somewhat trivial way to start off, but even if it was non-essential parts of the movie I found it worth mentioning just because it is SO pretty. (*ooh shiny thing*) Before getting to the meat of the movie, which is delicious I assure you, on the topic of pretty things it seems appropriate the visual effects. When initially thinking about the movie this was probably the last thing I thought about, they didn't strike me at one instance in the movie and make me go 'wow'. That's an enormous success for this particular movie. The fact that the effects blended so well with reality, that it is so convincing that you don't think twice about the weird skin/metallic body of Ava is a very impressive one (okay I thought twice, but only because it's weird, not to take note of the effects). The movie is not effects driven, but they have their place. Now that meat I mentioned. The movie is very simple. I might have to give a spoiler alert for explaining the basic premise because that could cover just about the first two thirds of the movie. Caleb is works for a company, whose boss has enlisted him to test out his super secret AI system he created. Testing involves simply interviewing the AI, which is named Ava. So it's lean meat, but the simplicity works because it allows the movie to fully explore the human (and non-human) interactions which are at the core (also gives time for more of those epic nature shots). The simplicity additionally lends well to the isolated atmosphere, which is essential. About those interactions. There are only three speaking characters in the movie, the three billed on the poster. Ava, the AI. Caleb, the one testing Ava. Nathan, the creator. The interactions are not dramatic, not excited, and not even particularly well written as far as sharp dialogue goes. While that could be a complaint, I appreciate it. Plain exchanges are the most reflective of reality. Plain presentation does not mean that the dialogue isn't engaging. In fact, it could be some of the most engaging dialogue I've seen in awhile. Contradictory maybe, but every single sentence takes on extra meaning and weight with the consideration of circumstances, who's talking, and what the words REALLY mean implicitly. In the way words so effectively advance the plot and enhance the way we view what is happening the dialogue IS well written. Absence of dialogue at times is just as effective here too. The dialogue literally asks plenty of questions to the characters, which is interesting enough on it's own. That being said these questions pose so many more implicit questions to the viewer about humanity and our psychology. It's absolutely fascinating how something completely inhuman exposes people as the most human they can be. Domhnall Gleeson as Caleb does the most talking and I have a hard time deciding if he is a strong or weak link in the acting here. While Issac and Vikander are undeniably great Gleeson is exceptionally plain. He fumbles with his words so often and they come out awkwardly that I can imagine having a real conversation with him in real life would be trying. Whether this is either poor execution of non-awkward lines, or fantastic execution of awkward lines it's irrelevant. The effect again adds to the reality of the movie. Oscar Issac plays the charismatic a-hole type, but still avoids what could have become a caricature. Vikander has the real challenge here and she is flawless. Playing an AI system she comes across as very human (which is the goal of the programmer), but *not quite*. It's so incredibly subtle I can't say what kind of nuances Vikander brought to it that made it such a compelling performance. It's not even comparable to typical depictions of androids in other media, that predictable stilted movement and speech. It's somewhere between that and human and it wavers in and out of the uncanny valley. The biggest and best part of Ex Machina is the atmosphere. The tone created here is stabbing intense without being overt or pushing itself on the viewer. Each scene sucks you in more. Dire and creepy for reasons I can't identify are a testament to Garland's direction. *Almost* everything about the movie is so subtle that explaining why and how something works or evokes certain reactions is a major chore, but it still does it damn effectively. Ex Machina is an astounding accomplishment that is equally spine-chilling and thought-provoking. Just like Ava is brought to a kind of intangible life, Ava--along with strong direction--brings intangibly uncomfortable life to the movie.***Bonus points to this movie for throwing in a fantastic dance scene out of nowhere. Caleb was me watching that scene in the movie just like '.....What??'",

    "review": "  I am certain a lot of people feel this way, but after so many movies with such similar themes to begin to get jaded, especially when the new trend becomes the focus of filmmakers. Let such trend is something called the singularity which in context of technology is defined as when artificial intelligence exceeds humanity and improvements becomes a self-contained recursive cycle. The point at which our creations no longer require our intervention; we have created can consider us superfluous. The fortunate there is still at the very beginning of this trend taking hold so at this point many of the offerings are quite well thought out and the resulting terms are generally well-crafted. Still, I was pleasantly surprised just how well the film considered here, 'Ex Machina' turned out. It presented a very complex theme setting it against a minimalistic environment. Not only was I greatly pleased with the set up this but his progression consistently held my attention and although clues were literally included the denier moment provided sufficient surprise to elevated among the rest of this nascent sub-genre in science fiction. In all fairness it must be noted that this is not film intended as a blockbuster event. It is best described as a cerebral thriller much more of a mystery than your usual android centric stories you have become accustomed to in the past. Traditional film concerning an android that usually used to hold as comparison humanity. Rather than directly insulting our own species by pointing out how many floors, robots and androids have been traditionally used the software the often brutal exposition of our foibles and shortcomings. The whole purpose of the story is to peek at the interaction between 'Us' and 'Them' reverse perspective of their side.Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) is a program under the employ of Bluebook, the world's most successful search engines for the web. It is owned by Nathan Bateman (Corey Johnson) was genius was the foundation for the success of his company. He is fanatical about his privacy and has been living in isolation on his home gigantic compound. It will free was held among the employees of his company with the prize being a week with Nathan and his secluded home. One morning a VIP email appears on Caleb's desktop. As soon as he opens it he discovers he has won the lottery. In order to get the Nathan's home the last leg of his journey is by helicopter. He casually asked the pilot run there be over Nathan's property is somewhat surprised when he finds out that been flying over the last two hours. The pilot lands in the middle of nowhere telling Caleb this is as far as is allowed to go in that he just has to follow the river to his destination. Nathan's house is built into a mountainside with most of it underground one observation room that looks out at the beautiful landscape. Only gets to meet his enigmatic boss Nathan. After signing a rather substantial confidentiality agreement Nathan describes exactly what the next week will hold.Nathan has been surreptitiously using information provided to his search engine to help quantify how people think. The best about data accumulated over the entire globe gave Nathan insight to the mechanism and procedure of human consciousness. No concern at all about the massive creature privacy, Nathan accumulated personal information in the billions of people using his search engine. From that Nathan was able to construct a truly groundbreaking artificial intelligence. Caleb was there in order to administer a very comprehensive Turning test, the widely accepted metric to determine whether a system is actually capable of consciousness and thought. The facility is immense, a maze of corridors in each door cured by the electronic lock. Caleb is issued a key card similar to the one they could always has on him. If a door opens he's allowed inside to explore. However if the door remained locked is simply forbidden to go in there. The control of Caleb movements within the house is reduced to a simple algorithm known by every program; binary code, the doors either blue or red. Finally Caleb gets to meet Nathan's AI creation, Ava (Alicia Vikander). A face is that of a beautiful young woman and her body, although seductively portioned, is either clear plastic rebuilding the interior mechanisms one opaque silver mesh. The first encounter is quite amiable and Caleb finds that Ava's personality is exceptionally engaging. His mandate as stated by Nathan's to determine whether or not Ava is responding independently of any programming. Unlike the traditional Turning Test, Caleb is already aware that his subject is an android.The sessions continue Caleb and Ava separated by a transparent wall. He told the conversations progress in unnatural, human way; initially rather perfunctory questions and answers almost like a job interview progressing seamlessly into more personal details and finally broaching the subject of feelings. Over the course of the session Caleb finds himself increasingly connected to Ava. After each session Caleb informally debriefed by Nathan typically over drinks. It is quite obvious to Caleb that Nathan is a functioning alcoholic who at the end of the day routinely drinks and soap into oblivion. Periodically, the compound is subject to blackouts shutting down all the facilities technology including the quite pervasive surveillance system. During one of these blackout Ava confides in Caleb that he should not trust anything Nathan says; he's been lying to him from the start. When the most highly nuanced aspects of the story is the relationship between Caleb and Nathan. Even when Caleb calls Nathan out on a lie, Nathan has a plausible excuse ready. For example, the lottery was a fa�ade. Nathan couldn't have benefited in this endeavor at a maintenance man all-male clerk won. Caleb was obviously selected as one of the company's best programs. Without hesitation Nathan agrees that still Caleb finds his increasing doubts about Nathan unabated.As the story enters its third act Ava and Caleb are interacting more like co-conspirators. He discovers she is the course of the blackouts in the devise a plan for them to get out the compound together. The only other person residing in the facility is Nathan servant, Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno), was quite beautiful devoted to serving and does not speak English. Nathan assures Caleb this is to prevent her overhearing trade secrets but soon Caleb would find out more sinister reason for the presence of this young woman. The arrangements are made for the escape at the last minute computer before; Nathan had a battery operated camera observe them and assures Caleb that Ava is just playing him for own agenda.The elegance of this movie is contained in the perfection of its pacing. Caleb is obviously the point of view character like him our initial indoctrination to the film these are somewhat be bewildered as Caleb is swept familiar office setting to be unceremoniously dumped in a beautiful albeit desolate area. The fact that he has defended himself to actually locate the facility is a nicely played foreshadowing of how he will be treated during his week with this curious multibillionaire. While eschewing spoilers you all led to believe a certain hackneyed ending has been telegraphed, the last few minutes of the movie proved to be a pleasant surprise capable of blowing the minds of people as they watch the conclusion unfold. Ms. Vikander is considered one of the rapidly rising stars Swedish cinema who treats her part here the session appears more like existential experimental theater in the science fiction film. The control she exhibits over body language and vocal inflections is masterful and contributes heavily to the believability of the scenario and its characters. So much of what you might think the writer/director Alex Garland is doing in his crafting of the film as predictable actually turns out to be just another facet that contributes to the d�nouement. This film is not only capable of great entertainment value but it is one that will remain in your mind for a long time telling you to not only think of her almost aspect of what occurred also compel you to wonder about the real-life implications of what happened. This is not a movie that is seen as much is one that is experienced.",

    "review": "  Both intelligent and engaging, Ex Machina is a sci-fi thriller at the forefront of a new movement for science fiction. The details are withheld as to the year or even the location of Nathan's research facility, but it feels so soon in the near future that it could be as close as tomorrow. The highest praise must be reserved for Alicia Vikander. Her portrayal of the female AI named Ava is so complete that you almost believe it is real. Without her flawless robotic tics and gestures, the suspension of belief would end and the film turn into a charade. This performance is truly a masterclass, and should serve as a paragon for future forays into the genre. Both Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson are also gripping in their respective turns as Nathan and Caleb. The film revolves around the dynamic between their two characters as well as that between Caleb and Ava. With this tight cast, each role must be played extremely carefully, and each of the three do exactly that. Isaac plays Nathan's grand deceit to a tee, while Gleeson is at his best when speaking few words and letting his expressions do the talking.Lastly, the screenplay. What a gripping story full of twists to the very end. The viewer is almost thrust into the shoes of Caleb, rooting for his well-being, but also kept in the dark on what exactly is going on. The ending may turn off a few, but it is a slickly intelligent way to end a very smart film.",

There is only three actors in this movie and each one's performance are excellent. Throughout the movie the audience becomes deeply concerned about who is right or wrong and when it comes to the ending , we are all stunned.

    "review": "  It's extremely hard to believe that this film is Alex Garland's directorial debut. He does a phenomenal job with this film, every scene is shot with a intensity that delves the viewer deeper into the story and characters. The cinematography is also brilliant here showing the location of filming at its most beautiful. The set design and lighting is also perfect and the close corridors provide many great cat and mouse chills. The films score highlights the mood of the scenes and is increased in volume for the climactic scenes.The characters are beautifully written, Domhnall Gleeson's \"caleb\" grows increasingly unstable throughout and Domhnall gives a very nuance performance. Oscar Isaac also gives an excellent performance as the unpredictable, eccentric \"Nathan\" and I really could believe that his character was a genius. But I believe the stand out performance and character comes from up and coming talent Alicia Viknder as the female A.I \"Ava\". She's just fascinating to watch from every movement to every line of dialogue she has. I have never been so affected by an A.I in any film. Even though the plot of Ex Machina may be over used or clich� at this stage. It is an incredible take from Alex Garland and his cast whom are successful in pumping life into an over done subject matter which makes the film so thematically epic.Overall I was enthralled by Ex Machina from start to finish. It's complex characters, brilliant performances, flawless direction will I believe make it stand the test of time.",

    "review": "  The 2015 science fiction film Ex Machina was written and directed by Alex Garland, who as a screenwriter is making his first directorial debut with this movie. Written directly for the screen, it stars Domhnall Gleeson as Caleb Smith, a computer programer, Oscar Isaac as Nathan Bateman, the owner of the company that Caleb works for and Allcia Vikander as Ava, Nathan?s Ai creation. The film tells the story of Caleb who as a computer programmer working for Bluebook, a popular Internet search engine has been invited by Nathan, his boss, to administer the Turing test (which is a test of a machine's ability to display intelligent behavior equal to, or the same as that of a human and to persuade the tester it truly is human) to an android with artificial intelligence at Nathan?s secluded facility in the mountains on an island retreat. The only other person at this retreat is a young Japanese housemaid named Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno), who cannot speak and is also an android. Caleb however believes that this is an unfair test as he already knows that Ava is a robot, but his real job is to decide whether or not Ava has a consciousness that Caleb can relate to. Nathan has researched personal information, hacked cell phones for people?s expressions and body language, so Ava would appear more realistic.Caleb, through the conversations he has with Ava, becomes more connected to her, while communicating with her through a transparent wall, since she is not allowed out of her apartment. She triggers blackouts to shut down the surveillance system so she can tell Caleb to not trust Nathan as he is a liar. Nathan informs Caleb that Ava will be reprogrammed in the future and in essence kill her current personality. Caleb discovers that Kyoko is also a robot and finds the previous creations which have been deprogrammed.Ava initiates another blackout where Caleb tells her that he will get Nathan drunk and help her escape. It is during the following day that he finds out that the real motive for inviting him was to see if Ava could persuade him enough to help her escape. Caleb has already reprogrammed the doors to open, but Nathan knocks him unconscious and damages Ava, while Kyoko stabs Nathan, who dies. Ava, slightly destroyed by Nathan takes some pieces from the other android prototypes and appears as a real human woman. She puts on a dress, walks out of the retreat and leaves Caleb trapped inside. Picked up by a helicopter that was meant to take Caleb off the island retreat, Ava enters human society. Garland has written and directed a modern day science fiction film that does not rely on a lot of special effects, but ideas that lean toward defining what is humanity or the lack of it, the limits of consciousness, and robots rebel against those who have created them (typical familiar themes in the science fiction genre). I give the director credit for the use of his ideas and androids to explore society?s female and male roles. It was different; however, it fell off in the third act and attempted to ?wrap it up? and give a somewhat usual ending. The acting by the three main characters, particularly Issac, was well done, as was the visual effects and cinematography. The makeup and clothing were more than appropriate. The real questions that I took away from this film were: what does it mean to be human and where does gender live? In the brain? Appearance? And if it is in the brain, what is the difference between male and female consciousness and is there really a difference? Due to the fall off in the third act, I will give this film a slightly smaller rating. But I really enjoyed it. It made me think. I hope it does the same to those of you that have or will see it.

    "review": "  It's been far too long since I've seen a movie with such economic exposition! Within the first five minutes, Caleb wins a contest, helicopters out to a remote paradise, meets genius-inventor-gone-rogue Nathan, and becomes the human component in an AI Turing Test, and we're off on a twisted android/creator/savior hate-triangle that challenges our notions of God, patriarchy, and humanity.I loved Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander's simmering chemistry in \"Anna Karenina,\" and they are even more quietly explosive here as an ordinary computer programmer who falls under the spell of the dangerously alluring robot, Ava. Ava uses her sexuality, but she is not the typical femme fatale with only the one trick. Nathan and Caleb debate her sexual anatomy versus her sexual agency, and her fierce fight for autonomy from her God/father makes for a white-knuckle creation allegory tinged with sexual politics. Vikander is grace personified, Gleeson does a good American accent, and excellent-in-everything Oscar Isaac plays the mad scientist with fast and loose insouciance.I do wish, however, that the script better defined the criteria for humanity. Not being well-versed in bio-robotics, I still think of androids as robots, but the movie's thesis hinges upon the supposition that they're not - that a robot programmed to have that high a level of human consciousness is essentially human. As such, I didn't quite understand why Caleb calls Nathan a monster for so blithely dismantling his beta versions. Also, the big reveal is played out for the audience's benefit with unrealistic suspense that is incongruous to what Caleb already knows.",

While the premise depends too much on the irrational fear of robots taking over the world, it just feeds into the paranoia of giant tech corporations unleashing a monster that can't be contained. Pretty generic stuff right? Yes.There is an overload of symbolism and techno babble that makes me want to cry out loud... \"We get it man!\" It is understood that we've got to be skeptical about new technology but this 'Greek Gods banished their own creators' theme tied into technophobia is overdone now and so is Frankenstein's monster and so is the Luddite fallacy.The geeky beta test plot also wears off after some time. One starts to wonder that why wouldn't the creator just unveil the invention to public by now like Google Glass or Self Driving Cars. After all we've accepted them without much hoopla! This film fails to establish whether man should feel proud or worried about creating an artificial life form, all the while assuming that it would hold us in contempt and ultimately bring our demise. It is stupid to try to control rather than embrace and guide your own creation. That kind of jerky approach to an invention is obviously unscientific. It is a movie so it's exaggerated but hey why do techies have to be so creepy? It seems like another bitch movie where the girl manipulates all the guys (good and bad) to get her way without feeling anything. Verdict - Cold as your ex-girlfriend.",

    "review": "  Ex Machina was as brilliant of a science fiction thriller as you will see this year, maybe ever. Written and directed by Alex Garland, this masterfully crafted sci-fi gem captures viewers' attention from the moment the opening credits roll.Set in a world far more advanced than contemporary society, Ex Machina tells the story of an unassuming programmer, Caleb (Domnhall Gleeson) who is invited to the home of his wildly intelligent and eccentric CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). While at the home/research facility, Caleb is tasked with evaluating life-like intelligence which happens to be the beautiful AI, Ava (Alicia Vikander); Nathan's most advanced AI model.In true form to the genre, Ex Machina intrigues and thrills while unraveling in a way that keeps you guessing until the end credits roll. As Caleb gives Ava the Turing test, her humanistic qualities and advanced intelligence endear evaluator to subject in ways neither can expect (audience included). The CEO Nathan's intentions remain closely guarded to his vest as he oversees the two's budding relationship.First time director, Garland is remarkable in how he brings his Academy Award worthy script to life by flooding the dialogue with satirical jabs at technology and man's insatiable appetite for advancement. This film utilizes minimal scenes -- mainly Nathan's massive estate -- with this setting becoming more ominous as the story progresses in true thriller fashion.What Garland does best in this film is what will ear mark this film as a genre defining classing. While the audience sifts it's way through the story, most minds will be working out a plethora of scenarios as the evaluator, Caleb and his subject, Ava become increasingly intertwined as the plot continues to twist. This film is as unpredictable as they come while being sure to leave audiences polarized by Garland's conclusion.This movie is a solid \"A\" in my book. And any reviewer that grades this instant sci-fi classic otherwise, may have not been able to grasp it's intelligence in it's entirety. Not Garland's fault. This is as refined of a directorial debut as you will ever see. It isn't only the direction; the acting by all three main characters breath ample life into the characters and story. It's just a very well polished machine with few flaws if any.",

    "review": "  Directorial debuts are events that can either stand out/take the industry by surprise or to be forgettable. Screenwriter Alex Garland (responsible of \"Sunshine\", 2012�s \"Dredd\" and the beloved \"28 Days Later\") managed to make a directorial debut that have been noticed by numerous lovers of the seventh art and received various complements. Is this film that good? Caleb Smith is an employee of a major Google like corporation called \"BlueBook\". One day the owner of the company requires his cervices so Caleb flights to his private island to meet this man, called Nathan Bateman, who shows him the biggest achievement of his career and an invention that will change the world: AI. Nowadays people associate the sci-fi genre with action films/generic summer blockbusters set in space, but in reality this genre is supposed to be a social commentary or to preset some philosophical ideas with the background being the future, like \"Planet of the Apes\", the original \"Star Trek\", \"Metropolis\", \"2001 A Space Odyssey\" and \"A Clockwork Orange\"; so Alex Garland�s directorial debut had potential to be one of the those films and the result is a remarkable half success. \"Ex Machina\" counts with beautiful locations/sets, a solid soundtrack, impressive performances with Oscar Isaac being the standout, various ideas are presented that provide a though provoking experience, great special effects, a marvelous suspense vibe in which the audience doesn't know who to trust for the majority of the film, a story that's a modernize version of Mary Shelly�s \"Frankenstein\" combined with \"THX 1138\", peculiar and interesting characters, dialog that stands out, and a Kubrick like atmosphere (slow pacing that completely works, not a lot of color and Steady Cam movements). With all that being say, this film has two colossal problems: Alex Garland�s directing is average, and the film ruins the mystery that it flawlessly made in the beginning by the time the third act begins (sort of what Garland did in \"Sunshine\"). It is predictable, clich� and frustrating because all the questions this film asked are ultimately for nothing within this narrative. \"Ex Machina\" is a film that presents numerous interesting ideas and offers a though provoking experience that's starts with such amazing potential but sadly in the end it loses most of that promise. It is a more than solid and though provoking sci-fi film but it's shattered with a predictable third act. A film that's undeniably worth watching if you are into the genre.",

Con ecos a la mayoria de pel�culas importantes que han abordado el tema A.I, ExMachina es en si misma una evoluci�n importante en el cine futurista, que muestra las consecuencias de los \"Hombres-Jugando-A-Ser-Dioses\" y que le debe bastante a la impresionante interpretaci�n de Alicia Vikander como AVA, una androide (gynoid) ansiosa de escapar del cautiverio impuesto por su creador Nathan (Jason Issacs) con Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), un programador con un aparente buen coraz�n, como unico veh�culo de escape.

But both Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson are so interesting in their respective roles you'd be glued to the screen anyway. Smart and effective thriller.",

    "review": "  Ideas, philosophies, morality, and visually striking piece of cinema - Ex Machina started as a promising Sci Fi flick and went on to become almost poetic. Squabbling over AI, singularity and transcendence isn't new, but the way Ex Machina handles machine consciousness is outstanding. The arguments made by both the male characters are thought provoking and leave their impressions. The AI who was the centre of the story aka AVA came to 'life' thanks to a brilliant portrayal by Alicia Vikander. Her expressions, movements and dialogue delivery always reminded me how lifelike an AI can be while still retaining some form of machine like systematic articulation. But then, one wonders going through the movie, just like Gleeson's character Caleb, if there still existed a boundary between the two - man and machine. Perhaps the best Sci-Fi flick of 2015, a must watch!",

    "review": "  Very cleverly written sc-fi with a minimal cast set in a claustrophobic location. Alicia Vikander was perfect as Ava, the ideal mix of vulnerability and mystery so you could never be sure whether what she was saying had been programmed or was her own thoughts. Oscar Isaacs was brilliant too as the slightly sinister billionnaire who had put all of his money into building AI and had his own agenda for his unsuspecting employee.There have been numerous films exploring AI and what it means to be human and the dangers of messing with technology but this has got to be one of the best. Superb ending too.",

He wins a contest that entitles him to spend a week at the remote compound of the company's founder, a brilliant recluse named Nathan whose hobbies include drinking to excess and working out. Nathan has invented an incredibly lifelike robot named Ava and he asks Caleb to interact with her to assess if he thinks her A.I. is sophisticated enough for her to pass as human. As robots go, Ava is very hot. Actually, despite having a bald metallic head and a see-through torso, she's much hotter than most human women. This isn't lost on Caleb, who in the process of evaluating Ava, seems to be falling in love with her. \"Ex Machina\" is an extremely cool-looking movie. From the pristine mountain setting amidst glaciers and waterfalls, to the high-tech house, to Ava herself, the look and feel of the movie is half the enjoyment. The other half is the sheer unpredictability of it all. There's very little In the way of action in this movie. Ava talks to Caleb. Caleb talks to Nathan. Caleb observes Ava. Nathan observes Caleb. There's a feeling that something sinister is going on, but neither Caleb nor the audience is quite sure what it is. Do we trust the buff, bearded genius or the sexy, bald robot?If you like your science fiction on the cerebral side, this is a good film for you. But if you're more a fan of action and special effects - Sandra Bullock spinning wildly through space anyone? - then you're likely to be bored out of your skull as, I assume, was the guy on my right who spent the entire movie texting.I'm unconvinced that everything in this movie makes complete sense plot-wise, but it almost didn't matter how it ultimately resolved itself, because as some wise man once said, sometimes the journey is better than the destination, especially when the journey has A.I. robots.",

    "review": "  The film�s themes are all classic SF, and indeed rather predictable: the mad scientist looking for a gullible young man, the human (ghost) in the machne, love and/or sexual desire between human and an advanced AI, the rebellion of the robots.... what makes this film work are the clever visuals, which enhance the themes of image manipulation, impassable distance and claustrophobia, and the plot resolution, which takes us away from our comfort zone with elegant economy.",

    "review": "  Having scripted many smart and heavily acclaimed films such as 'The Beach', '28 Days Later', 'Sunshine', 'Never Let Me Go' and 'Dredd', Alex Garland takes up the director's chair with an incredibly smart Sci-Fi film that may be one of 2015's best. Whilst keeping to his many traditions screenwise the film has a heavy focus on drama, ideas and performances at play from the main cast. It is also quite visually striking with it story taking many plot twists and turns with its progression. This is Smart Sci-Fi at its best, small in scale but high in concept and narrative, highly recommended whether or not you see this on the big screen or not.",

    "review": "  After winning a competition Domhnall Gleeson's Caleb is taken to the remote sanctuary of his boss Nathan, played by Oscar Isaac. There he discovers something truly remarkable, the first possible artificial intelligence in the form of a feminine robot played by Alicia Vikander.I have been a fan of many of Alex Garland's previous work which includes the adaptation of Never Let Me Go (2010) and Sunshine (2007). His directorial debut was something I really looked forward to ever since seeing the first trailer. In my opinion, this will join the aforementioned films as some of my favourite sci-fi movies. Ex Machina is intriguing from the very beginning, with Caleb arriving at the secluded mansion almost instantly. The house is a sight to behold, being constructed among nature so beautifully. The design of everything in the movie is sleek, but the real marvel is the A.I body. A beautiful, almost human body, with an excellent sound design that feels almost real. The body looks so elegant, but also eerie in its likeness to a normal body that has been perverted by technology. Ex Machina's storyline is constantly absorbing, not taking the ordinary route of making the A.I extremely powerful and impossible to understand, instead creating a character that feels like they could exist unsettlingly soon. The film takes an interesting route with the main plot revolving around how we would know when an A.I is in fact an A.I., with many questions left to ponder. Beyond the story the film is pretty enjoyable to watch, with many winks to the audience making jokes about itself. The acting in this film had to be really strong for three people to carry the movie and they all pull it off. Oscar Isaac is brilliant as a strange, brilliant inventor whose motives remain ambiguous. The real star of the movie is undoubtedly Alicia Vikander. Her every move seems just noticeably unnatural and robotic but still somehow almost human. Almost.The weakest part of the film would be the ending, with the film being perhaps just a little too long. The film does have an interesting ending that isn't the traditional twist you start to expect but they still could have cut the last few scenes. The multitude of environment shots dispersed through every cut also slow the film slightly. Ex Machina is a great film that I really enjoyed, and the more time spent thinking about the many aspects of the film, the more I like it. Although some may find the film slow at times, I think that it builds at a good pace that kept me captivated. With little comedic elements sprinkled throughout, I think most people could enjoy this movie, although those who choose to analyse deeper will be rewarded the most. This is one of the best movies of the year so far and something I highly recommend especially if you enjoy sci-fi or Alex Garland.",

    "review": "  THIS RATING REQUIRES CLARIFICATION:Simply put: it's not a bad movie, and it's WELL ABOVE average... but the problem that stems is from the clear fact that unfortunately Alex Garland is really, really bad at endings. His setups and characters and overall plots are great... Sunshine and Beach being two of my favourite films. But their endings have always felt ... off. Case in point: EX MACHINA... not only do the characters suddenly do things that are not within the established rules of what we have been shown, but they go against their own very nature. Has Nathan seriously never ready ANY sci-fi ever and simply neglected some minor important rules... yet still is smart enough to cunningly test both his AI and human subjects (and invent AI of course)... is the security system out the middle of nowhere REALLY tied to just 1980's keycards? Is there no fail-safe at all when a certain character leaves these enormous, obviously well-controlled security measures in place??Ex Machine works very well when the three lead characters are in conversations between themselves... but in the 3rd act simply goes into \"oh look something shocking\" route and frankly annoyed me beyond belief. Here is a film that transcends SO MUCH of the recent action-only climaxes... and then promptly falls into \"6-year old red\" territory.",

However, maybe it was because this genre is starting to feel too pat, too self-satisfied, too ready to use flashes of violence or sexuality to spice things up (or to attract the teenage male viewers). Ex Machina is being talked about as more \"intelligent\" than most of its ilk, probably because the plot hinges on the \"Turing Test\", the challenge a computer (or robot in this case) must beat in order to be determined to have artificial intelligence. True, you never quite know whether Oscar Isaac, as a computer genius \"dude\", is telling the truth (but he probably isn't) to the young employee he brings in to test his sexy robot -- and this creates some suspense. But something authentic seems lacking and, in the end, intelligence is scrapped for dimestore psychology and the usual conventions of the thriller. Others liked this better.",

    "review": "  This is writer Alex Garland's first time in the director's chair. He is known for his novel The Beach - which became an unsuccessful film starring Leonardo DiCaprio - and exquisite sci-fi screenplays for Sunshine and 28 Days Later... - both indie hits for Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle. Ex Machina shows the promise of good things to come even if it's a little \"been there, done that\". Oscar Isaac (Drive; Inside Llewyn Davis) plays Nathan, a billionaire inventor who lives in a palatial, jungle compound pf stone, glass, and iron where he creates AI and gives it the bionic body of a hottie played by newcomer Alicia Vikander (soon to be seen in The Man From UNCLE with Superman Henry Cavill; and The Danish Girl with Eddie Redmayne). She and her fellow autoerotic fem-bots have obviously been doing more than learning how to interact with their creator on an existential level. You know what I mean? When Caleb arrives (played by Harry Potter's Domhnall Gleeson), he's asked to test Ava to see if she passes convincingly as a human. A cat and mouse game a la Blade Runner ensues, and Caleb soon realizes that all life - even artificial - deserves some decency. The eccentric genius Nathan and he have nothing in common in regard to the responsibility which comes with creating life. A quiet, tense film, Ex Machina is absorbing enough but I don't think the actors quite sell it in the end. Gleeson and Isaac are mismatched as nemeses, and Vikander is too much of a cypher to give the full cold-blooded ending the gravitas it needs.",

Stretching the admittedly simple plot wafer thin, Garland fills the gaps with philosophical dialogue, tributes of Old Testament literature, a chilling electronica soundtrack, stunning cinematography and enough metaphors for 10 movies. Ex Machina is a modern day Blade Runner; a phenomenally shot science-fiction trek that forgoes all clich�s affiliated with the genre and serenades you with an ominous atmosphere, fantastic performances and a remarkably fresh take on the AI/human relationship debate. It's a thought-provoker that ends on an ambiguous notion instead of wrapping things up neatly, opening things up to an even greater debate which, depending on the nature of your film interest, either ruins the flow or is the cherry on top to the most virtuoso sci-drama of this century \"",

    "review": "  Although not passing the Bechdel test, this beautifully made and enthralling film really makes the viewer feel like they are at the research facility, feeling the emotions of the protagonist. The full-frontal nudity of the robot was uncalled for though. It just didn't need to be in there. The film was really well thought-out and justified. It's all completely plausible, fast moving, but with enough space to ponder the ramifications of this kind of technology. Enjoyable and thought-provoking.",

Domhnall Gleeson puts in an amazing performance as Caleb Smith. Alicia Vikander, however, steals the film with a spectacular performance definately worthy of an Oscar. The way this film makes you connect and care about every character just shows great directing and writing.Don't go into this film expecting any big action scenes etc. This film is all about the one on one conversations between the characters, and the chemistry between the actors.",

But that's really only a piece of the experiment. Really great movie that spurred a lot of philosophical conversations. (Should robot's have rights? How much rights does the maker have over his robot? At what point is murder justified?)",

    "review": "  Subtle and suspenseful with enough food for thought.Something about Ex Machina completely engrossed me into it. The 108 minutes smoothly passed away despite the slow-burning nature of its screenplay. Writer and debut director Alex Garland explores numerous ideals related to humanity with a seemingly basic premise and setup. A.I. Robots in movies is nothing new but Garland's visions here are not something you would be able to see if you just scratch the surface.A young nerdy programmer Caleb (Domhall Gleeson) receives a mail that he has won some big coding contest. We see that his face is being unknowingly scanned by his webcam and phone cam. As the prize he gets to spend a week at his company's (Blue Book) CEO's place, which is a luxurious estate amidst beautiful mountains. CEO Nathan (Oscar Isaac) tells Caleb its not a home but more of a research facility. The facility is modern and sleek, the rooms have no window and you have instant claustrophobic feel about it. Nathan tells Caleb is here to perform Turing Test on his creation, Ava (Alicia Vikander) an incredibly advanced A.I. Robot who looks lifelike with skin on her face . Caleb is as stunned as we are watching Ava. She is able replicate human-like behavior with extreme precision and even can perform lie-detection based on micro-expression on our faces!! She is charming as well and we see Caleb & Ava growing fond of each as they interact every day as part of the test. Everything is monitored by Nathan through CCTV cameras. Things seem smooth until one day Ava tells Caleb not to trust Nathan when cameras are shut by power cut. From here on the story takes an unpredictable turn, there is no clue who is right and who is wrong or who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist.The film explores various concepts such the meaning of consciousness and self-awareness, it questions your ethical viewpoint and blurs effectively the line between the human mind and AI. Are AIs truly the next stage of human evolution? Is singularity possible? It explores in these regions in great depth at the same time leaves some things open for interpretation. Adding to it, the film is also a suspenseful psychological thriller where you think every character is not what he/she seems to. And there are only 3 main characters here, all in the claustrophobic setting of the estate. The scene where Caleb cuts his hand to check if himself is a robot was really intense and frightening. There is also one hilarious out-of-the-box dance sequence giving a brief break from the freakish atmosphere. The soundtrack mostly of piano is haunting and beautiful at the same time. The music sets up requisite atmosphere and tone perfectly. The camera work is simply beautiful, be it the external landscape or the sleek interior shots. The production design and special effects are also impressive considering the low-budget of the film. At the end, cannot forget the 3 actors who did a great job. Alicia Vikander I feel nails every expression as the AI Robot and captures your attention in every scene she is present. Domhall as the lonely nerd and Oscar as the alcoholic genius were great too. Debut director Alex Garland shows immense potential and I am very much looking forward towards his next work. Overall, Ex Machina I believe is treat for all the true science-fiction fans and also those who like slow-burning atmospheric thrillers. There is not much superficial robot action here as it is not sci-fi action film. Its a film driven by ideas not by action. Hope you keep that in mind. If you want a movie deeply rooted towards the ideals of AI, Ex Machina is not to be missed. It was intriguing, thoughtful, tense and beautiful in its own way. Absolutely loved it!RATING: [4/5]",

I love the dialogue in this film. It's very natural, and by listening to the conversations, you might learn something to it. The subject is all about the A.I and its purpose. It also tackles sexuality and race. That's how I observed this film. And Oscar Isaac's performance nails it again. I love him in this film. He is one of those antagonist that you are more interested in his character. Kinda slow pace for a Suspense Sci-Fi but one watch is really enough for me. I love the performances, Alicia Vikander as an A.I, I thought she is great. Overall, this is a must watch Sci-Fi film. Not the best subject or story line I've ever seen but definitely it worth my time. 4/5 stars.",

Though the robot is identified as the centre piece, 'Ex Machina' actually poses more questions of Nathan (Oscar Isaac), therefore making the interactions between the two humans the most compelling element. The ending incorporates some clever twists but suffers slightly from a lack of impact, either through its slight predictability or the casual manner in which it was revealed. Plus despite the undeniable intellectual stimulation, the film doesn't succeed in bringing the same extent of satisfaction to the visual senses. The conflict at the end is rather tame, thus not finishing off the engaging rise in tension with an exciting climax. So not perfect but nonetheless film-making encompassing such interesting ideas like this should continue to be encouraged.",

And at its core, Ex Machina stretches to reach a very challenging subject: where we draw the line between smart programming and true cognizance. The very idea of artificial intelligence opens up all manner of intriguing moral disputes on its own, particularly when a mammoth global corporation is responsible, and many of those are touched, or maybe clubbed, as the plot slowly unfolds. It has a habit of oversimplifying at points, though, and frequently relaxes into a simple good vs. evil framework that I thought was too easy for the theme's inherent complexities. Intense and thought-provoking at its best, but it has a bad habit of hammering points that would be best treated with a little subtlety. I wanted to like it a lot more than I did.",

The cast delivers perfect performances and includes Domhnall Gleeson, Corey Johnson, Oscar Isaac, Alicia Vikander, and Sonoya Mizuno.\"You shouldn't trust him. You shouldn't trust anything he says.\"We saw this as the final picture at the drive-in and I can tell you this is really a must see. There are some long slow developing sequences and dry spells without much action, but the ultimate conclusion of the film is great and well executed. This film isn't perfect but definitely worth your time.\"Fucking unreal.\"Grade: B",

    "review": "  Big hype and big expectations for this one. There is no doubt this will become a classic film that people keep coming back to. Why? Ex Machina can be read from multiple perspectives. On the one hand the artificial intelligence themes and the realisation of this is fascinating, on the other the coding dudes only make lady robots which makes this, well, predictable. Will it be the triumph of women in the age of AI; where feminism rules? Or are these guys making a more sophisticated version Real Dolls (aka fancy sex dolls) where we reach peak female objectification? You be the judge. See it. Guaranteed to make you think and argue and that makes it a film worth seeing.",

    "review": "  When I started to watch the movie the movie, at first I thought that it would be another dynamic sci-fi action, but step by step I found out that the authors have made a very slow and tense drama movie on robots and artificial intelligence. The movie is about a young scientist (Domnhall Gleeson), who is hired by a billionaire (Oscar Isaac) to go to his house which is constructed among the woods and rocks to examine his invention - a female robot with artificial intelligence (Alicia Vikander).The main reason of the examination is the fact that a big proportion of human feelings and passion is injected into this robot and the latter can is capable of feeling and discussing matters like a human being. I don't wanna write something about the script as there are no harsh or abrupt events and the whole movie is a discussion around the logics and feelings, joy and disappointment. The movie is very stylish and beautiful, brilliant nature, unique scenes, bright colors. Acting is good, for me it is not a movie, that demands brilliant acting skills. Of course, there are some aspects that could be done in different way, for example the end of the movie, which was quite predictable for me. The whole movie is accompanied by a dull and tedious sound which keeps the watcher in tension, waiting for something critical.",

    "review": "  Critically acclaimed and featuring both Domhnall Gleason and especially Oscar Isaac, Ex Machina sounded like a brilliant piece of science fiction. There are so many films available today which explore the concept of emotions within artificial intelligence that you can find one in every corner of your DVD rental store. But Ex Machina stands out because it spends a lot of time building a complicated narrative towards a brilliant conclusion. However, the central fault in doing this is the fact that this massively slows down the film. The story is a very slow moving one which progresses at a gentle rate, allowing viewers time to take in the many questions posed by the film and the possibilities of where the story goes. However, as a result it takes a long time to really take off. The progressing relationship between Caleb Smith and Ava is intriguing, but it takes a long time to progress while the film puts a lot of philosophical questions forth, leaving viewers puzzled. This is to compensate for the lack of action in the film which actually proves sensible at times because it allows the feature to be more of a narrative driven one about characters and concepts, but amid all the mind-boggling concepts thrown around in Ex Machina, the actual content of the film does not always see eye to eye. When I say that I mean that the film looks good and puzzles the brains of its audience, but it is easy to get bored somewhere along the way because it takes so long to get anywhere.The film takes a turnaround as it gets closer to the end because things become so much more intense, the mystery in the narrative hits a high point and then keeps the viewer guessing. This is where the film turns almost surreal with its ambiguity and the potential answers to the narratives and where the intelligent nature of the film hits a high point. This is where the slow experience of the film all becomes worth it, where the underlying themes of the text all become unravelled and the originality of the story really goes into effect. The slow burning atmosphere of the film hits a high point during these moments by progressively reaching a new extent of intense strength. Though I found myself inconsistently entertained by the first half of Ex Machina, the second half of the film is a lot more intelligent and gives an effective climax to what the rest of the film has been working towards as a science fiction thriller. This effectively ensures that the film succeeds as a substance-driven film, though the style is also of value.Even though Ex Machina is not an action packed film and all takes place within the one location with heavily moderated use of visual effects, the visual style of the film is excellent. The scenery of the film gives a nice look of isolation to the film while the production design does effectively convey a futuristic sense of technology, as do the top notch visual effects. But what is most impressive about all this is how it is all captured with beautiful cinematography. With an intensely atmospheric style reminiscent of the imagery created by Daniel Landin for Under the Skin, Ex Machina has cinematography which manages to make the most of the limited scenery and cleverly shows the large and empty nature of the claustrophobic setting. At the same time, they cleverly illuminate the characters. This works in capturing the appearance of Ava to emphasize both her convincing humanity and her cyborg nature at the same time, while it zeroes in on the progressively unravelling psychology of Caleb Smith and the blank mindset of the brilliant yet desensitised Nathan Bateman. The cinematography fills Ex Machina full of simple and yet captivating imagery with beautiful little details to it, and it is enhanced even further by the way that it plays with the lighting and colour scheme. And as such a concept-driven film, Ex Machina demands the talents of a great cast and finds them easilyDomhnall Gleeson gives one of his best performances to date in Ex Machina. He begins in an intense dramatic mindset from the word go, and he just keeps getting better from there because he progressively gets into the material and intensifies his psychology nicely. He conveys the most through the stare in his eyes and his stern line delivery, making his performance subtle in delivery yet intense in depth. The balance is brilliant, and so he creates a complicated character who leads the story very well. Domhnall Gleeson builds a new level of credibility for himself with his leading performance in Ex Machina.Oscar Isaac's performance is great because of how unpredictable he is. Though he seems rather laid-back on the surface, Oscar Isaac conveys a sense of bluntness to the character Nathan Batemen which reflects his desensitised approach to the concept of man vs. machine. And the entire time, there is a feeling underneath the skin of the character that is of true brilliance. Oscar Isaac is instinctively intelligent in the role and yet unhinged at times, being able to deviate between those two concepts with a naturally charismatic ease. He is an actor who just continues to impress me.But even with such excellent performances from these two actors, it is Alicia Vikander who makes the greatest impact with her performance. There is not a second where I did not believe she was a cyborg because she is so firmly rooted in the character that she delivers it all so easily. And yet at the same time, she really had me questioning the extent of emotions being experienced by the character. The level of depth that Alicia Vikander is able to find in Ava is brilliant because she is intense and unpredictable yet sympathetic at the same time, and her chemistry with both Domhnall Gleeson and the universe around her really cry out a sense of progressing intelligence. Her performance is built on subtle physical actions most of the time and yet she is able to do so much through this little details of movement and facial expressions that she really makes a powerful role out of Ava. Alicia Vikander works exceptionally well in Ex Machina which is truly a beautiful sight to behold, and because she is so firmly entrenched in the character she is too convincing to not believe throughout all the subject matter that the character faces.So Ex Machina is slow with a first half that proves semi-decent at best, but all the questions that it ends up asking are answered with an intense and intelligent climax at the end of the film while the exceptional skills of the cast prove to keep things entertaining until then.",
