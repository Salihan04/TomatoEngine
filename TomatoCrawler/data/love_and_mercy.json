    "review": "  \"Love & Mercy\" follows young and older Brian Wilson and his band, The Beach Boys. While we flash back and forth between the bands struggles and triumphs, and into the future where he is trying to find love and dealing with Schizophrenia, the film's deep vibes and meaningful visuals made me very emotional. Paul Dano is incredible in his portrayal of Brian Wilson and John Cusack plays his illness very well. Elizabeth Banks really felt like someone who had no idea how to handle this situation. In the end, \"Love & Mercy\" satisfies with brilliant writing, superb direction, and a story that is much more worth telling than I expected it to. I really loved watching this film and it displays amazing performances all around and celebrates their best music in style. This is not a film you should miss. Definitely worth it's praise.",

    "review": "  Brian Wilson's records Pet Sounds and, in another story, falls in love with a car dealer.This film alternates between two stories of Brian Wilson's life, and both are compelling and incredibly well-acted. John Cusack and Paul Dano are at top form, and their performances are the highlights of this strong, interesting, and heartfelt film. Paul Giamatti plays older Wilson's psychiatrist cum legal guardian, who is scamming Wilson for his fortune and talent, and younger Wilson's Beach Boys brethren vie for control of the band, the artistic sense of which Wilson wants to take in new Beatles-imitation directions.For a while, I was so compelled by the pitch-perfect story-telling and wonderful performances that I considered whether Love and Mercy might be the best film of the year, better than Ex Machina, but no, sadly, Elizabeth Banks's role fall in to the \"helping woman\" cliche, and there are some objectiveless, wandering scenes that only Dano's talent makes interesting.Overall, God only know what would be a better Brian Wilson biopic.",

    "review": "  In the vast ocean of clich�d rock star biopics, this plunge into the troubled but brilliant mind of Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson wisely tries to avoid much of the saccharin and focuses only in two of the most important events that led Wilson to his much publicized mental disruptions, without neglecting his sparks of genius, both instances are treated with visual and sonic sensitivity. Paul Dano and John Cusack manage to define the man, separating the young persona with a stubborn but evolving artistic vision from his broken down older self, who has ceased to strive for perfection, but now does for acceptance.",

    "review": "  Breaking away from conventional biopic structure, LOVE & MERCY is a well-crafted and deeply-intriguing examination into the life and mind of a uniquely-talented yet tortured individual. While Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys makes for a strong central character - with Paul Dano giving an off-kilter performance that further solidifies his skill in tackling emotionally-complicated subjects as well as a resurgent turn by John Cusack, Bill Pohlad's directorial debut displays a surprising discipline towards characterization as it never allows the narrative to stray too far, thus providing a film that is insightful and sympathetic yet filled with smooth editing, fun music, and a distinct and very fitting visual palette. Specifically, the scenes of Wilson's recording sessions in the studio with both his band as well as the studio musicians are some of the best moments in the film; they effectively give viewers a glimpse of authenticity and a seemingly exclusive behind-the-scenes access despite it being a re-creation - undoubtedly an impressive execution.",

    "review": "  It is 1966. While returning from a successful tour, Brian Wilson(Paul Dano) of the Beach Boys suffers a debilitating anxiety attack on the flight home. So, he opts out of the Japan leg of the tour in favor of recording some new music for the band. Now all he has to do is figure out how to get the horse inside of the recording studio.It is 1985. Brian Wilson(John Cusack) would like to buy a car. And not just any car, mind you. Which Melinda Ledbetter(Elizabeth Banks), a salesperson, would like to help him with. That happens under the very watchful eye of Dr. Eugene Landy(Paul Giamatti).\"Love and Mercy\" is a thoughtful movie about the intersection between madness and genius which also takes the time to redeem the critical reputation of the Beach Boys. The story is set over two time periods which are linked by two surprisingly matching performances from Paul Dano and John Cusack.(Dano plays Brian struggling to communicate while Cusack is the empty husk of what is left.) While each time period is clearly demarcated by its respective fashions, they are joined in one mindbending segment late in the film. The problems arise in how the movie plays out, namely in seeking as pat a resolution as humanly possible for mental illness for which there is no real cure. And I never quite grasped the importance of the will in all of this.",

Like most biopics, it does occasionally get bogged down in needless melodrama but unlike most biopics it never gets lost there. The dual narratives focusing on two parts of Wilson's life compliment each other nicely and the small scale focus ensures that \"Love & Mercy\" never ends up being another montage movie that only focuses on events rather than the characters.",

The re-creation of the studio sessions of PS and SMILE are pure magic. Elizabeth Banks (very stunning in an 80's way) plays his second wife Melinda who is Brian's loving antidote to an overbearing father Murry Wilson (Bill Camp is great) bloodsucking shrink Eugene Landy (bad wig Paul Giamatti) and irritatingly short-sighted cousin Mike Love.

John Cusack was amazing, as always, but as big a Cusack fan as I am, I thought he was miscast. Dano was good too, and Banks could have lit a fire in a eunuch's loins.

Besides his struggles with mental illness, Brian Wilson was used and abused by both his father and his psychiatrist during different periods of his life. Both narratives are masterfully juxtaposed in this film, fueled by the strong performances of both Paul Dano and John Cusak. Both give a striking rendition of the film's protagonist, while Paul Giamatti is at his villainous best as Eugene Landy. Love & Mercy raises the bar for what a music biopic should be.",

Watching somebody make art in the movies is typically a hot mess, but here, we see a process, made coherent because we know where it's going. I'm less enamored of the Cusack segments, bringing the story into the 90s when he is rescued from a Svengali huckster psychologist, not only because Cusack's look is so different, but because there was so much missing between the different slices of Wilson's life that the latter felt contrived and conflated. Which it is, if you read Wilson's bio. Oh well, it's not perfect, but the music is, and the scenes where the music is central are just so wonderful for this nostalgic geezer who lived through it all. I used to go to the Beach Boys concert every Christmas. Until, of course, the Beetles.",

Love & Mercy is the story of the Beach Boy's Brian Wilson played by John Cusack depicted in the late 80's and Paul Dano as young Brian Wilson during the 60's and 70's. The movie goes over Wilson's creative emergence during his time with the Beach Boys and the crazy mental illnesses he battled for the rest of his life. The film is told in a series of flashbacks while Wilson meets a lady named Melinda (Elizabeth Banks) who finds Wilson's life style to be super puzzling. Because of his mental breakdowns Wilson is under guardianship by Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti) who is forcing Wilson to take more and more medication and controlling every aspect of his life. It soon becomes apparent in the present time that Melinda and Brian need to break away from Landy. In the past we go over how Wilson discovered different sounds and his downfall with drugs and alcohol. It's a nice little bio pic that works a lot of the times especially the scenes from the past. Each scene from the past sets up something that happens in the present and at these times its a much more smoother riding picture. The present time just doesn't wrap up nice enough. I felt like the movie had another twenty minutes or so. Overall, solid film. If you like the Beach Boys at all give this one a look!",

    "review": "  Paul Dano and John Cusack star as young and old Brian Wilson, respectively, in Love and Mercy. It's basically the story of Brian Wilson, from Wilson's perspective.I had no idea what Wilson went through; it's really interesting. Love gave this musical artist a new lease on life, after he lost his rights to psychiatrist and manipulator Dr. Eugene Landy. When Brian meets car saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter and falls for her, something special happens for them. Melinda soon comes to see that Dr. Landy exerts an unhealthy control over Brian's life, frequently overmedicating him and preventing him from having normal interactions with his family and friends and making normal choices, and using abusive tactics to control everyone around him, especially Brian.With the help of staff Gloria, Melinda finds the evidence she needs to show Brian's family what's really going on, and basically saves his life. Dr. Landy ultimately loses his long held control over Brian along with his medical license in the state of CA. Brian regains control over the right to choose his own destiny, and he and Melinda choose each other.The movie also takes an interesting look at Brian's younger days, when he was churning out songs, experimenting with drugs, living with his first love, and spending a lot of time with his brothers and the rest of the Beach Boys. It also looks at his relationship with his father, and what living and song writing with his mental illness was like for him. The guy felt some torment, but he found a lot of satisfaction in his craft. He got to do what he loved: make music! And he's still doing it, decades later, with his love Melinda by his side. Brian Wilson's story has a positive upbeat turnout, light at the end of the tunnel.Of course, this is one-sided. Dr. Landy's side is not told.For people with mental illness, those with family and/or friends willing to fight for them have a better outcome, from what I've seen, than those who get sucked into \"the system\" with no one on their side. I know of a lady, a friend of a friend, who, like Brain, lost her right to make her own decisions. Her house was sold to pay for her institutionalization, and she is a lifer in her institution, because she was depressed after her husband died and was lucky enough to receive \"help\". She fills a bed, and social security pays the institution for their services, so she will never be allowed to leave and have a normal life. Her rights to self determination will not be returned to her, for money reasons, although she is not a threat to herself or anyone else and is no longer grieving for her husband. She is heavily medicated, has a poor quality of life, and has no right to decide any of it. If she wanted a second opinion, no one gives her that option, because she has no rights.Too bad every depressed or otherwise mentally ill person doesn't have a Melinda Ledbetter to fight for them.",

Both Cusack and Dano do really great suitaly portraying the twitches and difficulties that Wilson had to battle through, as well as portraying how Wilson came up with some of the most iconic soundscapes of the California rock sound, while Giamanti has the market cornered on corrupt music managers, A must see for all music fans :)",

There were a couple older ladies sitting behind me who chatted a little during the movie (not enough to ruin it really), and they seemed very familiar with the events of Brian Wilson's life - when Gene Landy shows up they knew immediately, and a couple other times. But it almost made the film like a MCU movie where there's this world of the film that people are familiar with the characters already. Just a note, seemed like an odd epiphany I had.But! The film itself was VERY good. Paul Dano and John Cusack both brought different but appropriate energies to the different versions of Brian Wilson - eerily so on Paul Dano's performance. It was crazy to see his mannerisms and voice coming out of Paul Dano's boyish face, when Brian Wilson for much of my life has been an older man. Either way, they both brought great skill into portraying the visionary musician.The other stand-out parts of the film were the incredible sound design and the non-linear editing. The story hops back and forth between the 60?s and the 80?s in a way that really keenly tells the story of Brian Wilson's mental decline and later abusive relationship with Landy. The key moments that really triggered some innovative storytelling were Brian's first acid trip, Mike Love's disgruntled reaction to Pet Sounds, the development of Good Vibrations, and then of course, Elizabeth Banks's Melinda Ledbetter taking down Landy with the help of the Wilson family near the end. THE SOUND DESIGN THOUGH. it just so evocatively displays, in tandem with Paul Dano, the \"music in his head\" enigma and really contributes as a tool to the storytelling throughout the entire film.It might be tough to find (limited release I think?) but definitely worth seeing in a theater with good sound so you can be totally immersed. It was great, would definitely recommend!",

    "review": "  The best biopics don't attempt to tell the whole story. And thankfully \"Love & Mercy\" adheres to this adage. Instead, the film focuses on two key moments in Brian Wilson's life: as her conceives of the group's transformative sounds and of his rebirth two decades later when he is saved from the grip of his controversial, 24-hour therapist Dr Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). This is helped by the decision to cast two actors to portray Wilson: Paul Dano and John Cusack, both of who do a good job. Elizabeth Banks, too, gives a good performance as Wilson's now-wife, Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks), who he met inside a Cadillac showroom. The other star is the '80s clothes and d�cor that features in the latter story, which is a retrospective feast.",

Skipping the usual 'rise to fame' story of The Beach Boys and focussing its attention on the peculiar life and psyche of one of its members.At the one end we have Paul Dano slowly slipping into madness, while at the other end we have John Cusack desperately trying to climb out of it.It doesn't quite cut deep enough (Paul Giamatti's manipulative Eugene Landy is underused and Banks isn't much more than a pretty guardian angel) but it's an interesting portrait of an equally intriguing musical genius.",

While everyone else had KISS and Pink Floyd stickers on their notebooks, I proclaimed the greatness of The Beach Boys! I had few friends. I digress. This is really a pretty fantastic biopic, despite only focusing on a couple very specific periods in Brian Wilson's life. John Cusack was amazing, as always, but as big a Cusack fan as I am, I thought he was miscast. Dano was good too, and Banks could have lit a fire in a eunuch's loins. Great film, especially if you're a fan. Plus a half star 'cause fucking Beach Boys!",

This is not just your typical music biopic as it is unique and I'm still not sure how I felt about them casting two different actors in the role. The music is great and Atticus Ross does a great job incorporating The Beach Boys songs into the film and adding his own twist to them at times. But it is Paul Dano who really steals the show here; I've always known him to be a great actor, but he is absolutely great in this. I thought the film did run a little too long and wish they would have shown a little more of Brian Wilson's 70s stage, where he stayed in bed (but not with a 3rd actor). I also felt the ending wrapped things up a little to quickly and wish that would have been a little more fulfilling. Overall a solid film that I wanted to give 4 stars, but I had a few little problems with the film that stuck with me.",

    "review": "  This film suffices the standard for biographical pictures and carries multiple strong performances, and it really shows Wilson's love for music and the struggles that he went through in his lifetime. Okay, so I knew nothing about this movie going into it, and I barely even knew who The Beach Boys were. For me, this film was as entertaining as I thought it could've been , and although this is a quality made film, I didn't love this film or anything. That doesn't stray from the fact that this was a good movie, just not an outstanding one by any means.I can't write this without saying that the acting performances here were breathtaking. There were multiple stand-out performances here that really made the movie for me. Both Paul Dano and John Cusack did amazing jobs as the role of Brian Wilson, and I truly thought that they gave some of the best performances of the entire year. They both portrayed this character so genuine and so realistically, and I was astounded by their performances. Elizabeth Banks was also great in her role, along with many others who all depicted the characters nicely. I also really loved Paul Giamatti, and these were all performances that will truly be remembered for a long time.Ultimately, the movie flips back and forth between two periods in Brian Wilson's life. I actually liked that aspect of the movie, but one caught my attention more than the other. I really enjoyed when the movie focused up on Brian Wilson's younger life, where he was played by actor Paul Dano. In those moments, we saw Wilson as a young member of The Beach Boys, and he was someone who had an immense passion for music. I loved seeing someone so intimate and passionate about their music, and seeing someone so engaged in their work is inspiring. It was amazing to see how he viewed the world from his point of view, and it was also shocking to see just what he went through. Although the other half of the story was good enough (Wilson as he was older), I wasn't necessarily as hooked as I was in the other moments. Although it's not the main point of the film, it was awe-inspiring to watch this man who had a gift for sounds and art, and it made me admire him a lot more.This movie really is a biographic on the life of Brian Wilson, and with that being said, Brian Wilson (spoiler) suffers from Paranoid Schizophrenia. This is a belief where a person has false delusions that a person(s) is plotting against them, and these delusions can lead to things such as depression. They really took a respectful, yet very real take on this disease, and that was also one of the most interesting parts of the film. They really handled it very well, and there were plenty of moments in this movie where we really saw this disease present itself. It was a really unique story to tell, and one that I would love to learn more about.I also really liked how this movie was shot and filmed. There were certain times where it was shot like a documentary, and that made the film seem so much more real. Everything about this film made it feel very real, and their depiction of the story felt very natural and honest. I can at least credit the film for its realism, and it really does make this film worth watching.In the end, this movie was good. Although I really have no glaring negatives about it, that doesn't neccesarily mean I was head over heals for this film. It's a great film with spectacular acting, superb shots, and a great vision. Although it really was a quality production, I just wasn't hooked throughout the movie. I caught myself dozing off a few times and my mind wandering several others. This is truly is a quality produced film, but its just not one that neccesarily hooked me.",

In fact this film is about that one special Beach Boy whose name is Brian Wilson, who is perfectly impersonated by two actors. One for the young Brian who was a studio workaholic, a sound perfectionist, the genius who masterminded those unmatched melodies. The other Brian Wilson is a lost person under total control, who fights the daemons of the past. But there is a glimpse of hope for the later, as he gets to meet a very kind woman who quickly understands Brians worries and supports him in her best way. The permanent switch between past and present of Brians's life makes this film even more interesting and catches the curiosity of the spectator. The scenes are of course strengthened by the matching Beach Boys songs.Cusack\"s Part is just a bad addition to the film.",

Paul Dano is incredible in his portrayal of Brian Wilson and John Cusack plays his illness very well. Elizabeth Banks really felt like someone who had no idea how to handle this situation. In the end, \"Love & Mercy\" satisfies with brilliant writing, superb direction, and a story that is much more worth telling than I expected it to.

Let's not leave out Elizabeth Banks who plays Wilson's love interest and Paul Giamatti who is scary as Wilson's medical guardian.

    "review": "  It's really well done, especially since it has a rather unique framing device.The film is split in two intertwining halves. In one half, a young Brian Wilson (Paul Dano) struggles to create music for the Beach Boys. In the second half, a now older Brian Wilson (John Cusack) is dealing with a few demons, both physical and mental as a lover (Elizabeth Banks) helps him over come them.Let's take them one half at a time, starting with Dano. He is absolutely incredible as the young Brian Wilson. Watching him struggle with creating news songs has Dano running through many emotions: frustration, the looming sense of failure, disappointing his family (especially since they're his bandmates). Dano nails every single one of them. The scene where he comes up with the melody for Good Vibrations is particularly noteworthy as it's the only time Dano asks someone else to help him write a song. This is absolutely wonderful work.John Cusack doesn't quite reach the same highs as Dano does, but he does do a very respectable job. He makes his portrayal of schizophrenia believable. His romantic scenes with Elizabeth Banks have that right sort of awkward charming you'd expect from someone with a few ants shy of a picnic. This is a good performance by Cusack. He's just not really given as much opportunity to reach the same heights Dano is. Elizabeth Banks is really good, too. She is a bit of the standard \"concerned girlfriend/wife\", though. The film does leave a question or two unanswered. Dano's descent into his mental issues is well documented, but his drug addiction feels a tad glossed over. It is a little difficult to see how Dano's problems come back to bite Cusack. Mostly because it feels like we went from point A to F while skipping everything in between. However, Cusack's and especially Dano's performances are so good, that they nearly overcome this issue.",

    "review": "  There have been plenty of great musician biopics over the years, but I can't remember there being two incredible ones in the same year. Straight Outta Compton and Love & Mercy are two very different films in terms of structure and story for that matter, but both are equally as gripping and satisfying.Focusing mostly solely on Brian Wilson, The Beach Boys leader, Love & Mercy tells the story of Brian in the early days of the band, and also his days in his 40's when his therapist controlled most of his life. The film's structure goes back and forth between these two eras with Paul Dano playing Wilson in his early days and John Cusack later on. Both of the performances exude a great amount of pain and suffering while still feeling relatable at the same time. Bill Pohlad also deserves a lot of credit for his ability to weave the two time periods together in seamless fashion.The music of The Beach Boys will suck you in from the start, but it's really the writing, direction, and performances that keep you watching. The eerie tone is not that of a mainstream film, but that's a good correlation to the not-so-mainstream 'Pet Sounds' album the group worked on for a majority of the early years scenes. The film also does a good job of portraying the crazy genius that Brian Wilson was. His ability to mix song structure and break the norm of music at that time and even stray away from where the group was is unparalleled and extremely risky.Paul Giamatti plays a similar back-stabbing character as he does in Straight Outta Compton, but it fits perfectly for his strengths. Really, there aren't any real weaknesses of this film. It's captivated throughout and the performances may even be worthy of some recognition come awards season. A job well done.+Both lead performances+Strange tone+Bill Pohlad's consistent direction+Who doesn't love the music?8.2/10",

    "review": "  'Love and Mercy' is a Biopic that doesn't really focus of the 'Beach Boys' and their music, rather it is a very personal story that explores the life of Brian Wilson from some of the highest points in his life right down to some of the lowest. I knew nothing about the Beach Boys or Brian Wilson except for their biggest hits but man i can't deny that i am really interested to find out more about Brian. This film really goes to places i never thought it would upon hearing about it, it does have its fun light-hearted moments but the majority of this film is really about the personal struggles of Brian Wilson and how he had to overcome these obstacles in his life. The film has an interesting structure, rather than focusing on a specific time in his life and showing how he changed progressively, the film follows a younger Brian played by Paul Dano and a post Beach Boys Brian played by John Cusack. This odd structure of highlighting these two times in his life concurrently throughout the film allowed the writers and director to get creative with the way they represented Brian in both times and how they ultimately depicted his transition without showing what happens in between. On a personal level, and in terms of the way they represented and depicted Brian in these two stages of his life and connected them this film was incredible. But from a storytelling perspective, it was a little off. The two times were shown in a way that made them feel like a series of events in Brian's life rather than a flowing story. The way it switched back and forth with all the jumps in time worked to show off Brian's story and quickly develop his character but as a cohesive start to finish story, especially with the younger Brian, it didn't work as well as i would have liked. As the film progressed, this structure of swapping between the older and younger Brian worked more and more but initially for the first 20 minutes it felt a little choppy and hard to get used to. If i go back now after having more experience with that structure it may work better, but just a minor thing.Oh, the performances in this film were just unbelievable. From Paul Dano and John Cusack playing different versions of Brian, to Elizabeth Banks as Melinda and Paul Giamatti as Eugene Landy they were all incredible, powerful and amazing performances. One of the more fascinating things was how Paul Dano and John Cusack managed to somehow play what are essentially these two different characters in a way that you still saw elements of Brian's younger self in his older self and vice versa. It really was great to see, but seriously already, when is Paul Dano going to get some Oscar recognition? This guy is a fantastic versatile actor, from Prisoners to this he really is shaping up to be an incredible dramatic actor and i only improving over time. Elizabeth Banks also puts in a very very emotionally driven performance and in her limited screen time still made her presence felt. But what may have been the most powerful performance in the film was Paul Giamatti as Eugene Landy. I don't know how this guy does it, he literally transforms into this character and where at first you go 'Hey, thats Paul Giamatti'', by the end of the film you completely forgot it was even him. You can draw many parallels between his character in this film and his role in 'Straight Outta Compton' and that is a really good thing as both performances are ones to remember from this year. Don't worry, even though the main focus on the film is almost exclusively on Brian Williams, you do get to see some of the behind the scenes of making some of the Beach Boys' biggest hits. Their music accompanies the film so well and they really did have a song that fit the tone of the film at all moments throughout. So in the end, if you are a fan of Brian Williams and the Beach Boys and you know the story i am sure you will get a good kick out of the film. If not, i would still recommend you check it out because it gives you very interesting insight into the troubled life of Brian Williams and shows off his character really well supported by great performances. - 7",

As an historical biopic it contains many set pieces and quotes straight out of the catalogue, although I do think that non-fans would find it somewhat confusing at times. But as an entertaining movie I was a little lost. It was often too slow and un-involving, especially in the first half. Some of the acting was ordinary and it somehow felt amateurish.

    "review": "  Brian Wilson's records Pet Sounds and, in another story, falls in love with a car dealer.This film alternates between two stories of Brian Wilson's life, and both are compelling and incredibly well-acted. John Cusack and Paul Dano are at top form, and their performances are the highlights of this strong, interesting, and heartfelt film. Paul Giamatti plays older Wilson's psychiatrist cum legal guardian, who is scamming Wilson for his fortune and talent, and younger Wilson's Beach Boys brethren vie for control of the band, the artistic sense of which Wilson wants to take in new Beatles-imitation directions.For a while, I was so compelled by the pitch-perfect story-telling and wonderful performances that I considered whether Love and Mercy might be the best film of the year, better than Ex Machina, but no, sadly, Elizabeth Banks's role fall in to the \"helping woman\" cliche, and there are some objectiveless, wandering scenes that only Dano's talent makes interesting.Overall, God only know what would be a better Brian Wilson biopic.",

Besides his struggles with mental illness, Brian Wilson was used and abused by both his father and his psychiatrist during different periods of his life. Both narratives are masterfully juxtaposed in this film, fueled by the strong performances of both Paul Dano and John Cusak. Both give a striking rendition of the film's protagonist, while Paul Giamatti is at his villainous best as Eugene Landy. Love & Mercy raises the bar for what a music biopic should be.",

The story unfolds very nicely through glimpses of Brian when the Beach Boys rose to fame (expertly played by a very talented yet underrated Paul Dano) and glimpses of Brian years later (well done by John Cusak). Paul Giamatti does a wonderful job as the unethical doctor that claims to have full rights to the care and well-being of a very confused and overdrugged Brian. Elizabeth Banks does a fine job as the girlfriend of the older Brian. The past glimpses of Brian played by Paul Dano really help to setup the final stages of the movie by bringing it to a very powerful conclusion that leads you wanting more from this very talented man.

    "review": "  Breaking away from conventional biopic structure, LOVE & MERCY is a well-crafted and deeply-intriguing examination into the life and mind of a uniquely-talented yet tortured individual. While Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys makes for a strong central character - with Paul Dano giving an off-kilter performance that further solidifies his skill in tackling emotionally-complicated subjects as well as a resurgent turn by John Cusack, Bill Pohlad's directorial debut displays a surprising discipline towards characterization as it never allows the narrative to stray too far, thus providing a film that is insightful and sympathetic yet filled with smooth editing, fun music, and a distinct and very fitting visual palette. Specifically, the scenes of Wilson's recording sessions in the studio with both his band as well as the studio musicians are some of the best moments in the film; they effectively give viewers a glimpse of authenticity and a seemingly exclusive behind-the-scenes access despite it being a re-creation - undoubtedly an impressive execution.",

Like most biopics, it does occasionally get bogged down in needless melodrama but unlike most biopics it never gets lost there. The dual narratives focusing on two parts of Wilson's life compliment each other nicely and the small scale focus ensures that \"Love & Mercy\" never ends up being another montage movie that only focuses on events rather than the characters.",

Love & Mercy cuenta su tr�gica historia, lidiando con esquizofrenia. abusos de sustancias y a avaricia de las personas a su alrededor.Los Beach Boys desde afuera parec�a la familia perfecta. Un grupo de hermanos tocando m�sica alegre juntos, pero poco se sab�a de la vida secreta detr�s de esta fachada. Love & Mercy es una de las mejores pel�culas del 2015 que fue completamente dejada de lado a pesar de ser un �xito con los cr�ticos. Es una de esas pel�culas que no puedes sacarte de la cabeza, y que puedes estar pensando en ella durante meses. Wilson siempre fue una persona talentosa y creativa, y por su entorno, ten�a la sensaci�n de nunca ser suficiente, y esto lo llevo a tener a las personas equivocadas a su lado, de manera que su felicidad fue completamente sofocada. Por suerte esta historia tiene un final feliz, al conocer a Melinda, quien logra salvarlo de toda la locura en su vida. Esta pel�cula cuenta la historia en el pasado y en el presente. Paul Dano interpreta a Wilson mientras est� con The Beach Boys, y John Cusack cuando ya es mayor. Ambos actores traen distintas facetas de Wilson a la mesa, y se destacan en sus respectivos papeles. Dano especialmente, es excelente. No me sorprender�a si es nominado para los Oscar por su interpretaci�n. Elizabeth Banks como Melinda da una actuaci�n incre�ble y natural. Paul Giamatti como Dr. Eugene Landy, da una de las interpretaciones m�s enfuriantes de los �ltimos a�os, y esto habla de el talento de este actor, para provocar esas emociones.La historia salta constantemente en el tiempo, pero est� hecha de tal manera, que no resulta confuso, y le trae a�n m�s riqueza a la narrativa.

    "review": "  Though Love & Mercy tries a little to be a little more than a paint-by-numbers troubled musician biopic a la Walk the Line, it still collapses into all the same tropes that make traditional biopics a little insufferable. That said, Love & Mercy has enough interesting moments to make it work a view. The sequences where Paul Dano's Brian Wilson explains the pop masterpieces in his brain to a group of studio musicians and we get to watch Pet Sounds take shape are inspired and captivating. Dano's performance on the whole is outstanding and his career has reached a point where it's like, \"Paul Dano's in it? I'm in.\" The film jumps back and forth between Dano's Pet Sounds Wilson and Cusack's being-held-prisoner-by-a-crazy-doctor Wilson and the latter Wilson segments are where most of the trouble lies. There's nothing wrong with the performances from Cusack, Elizabeth Banks, and Paul Giamatti. Everyone is terrific, but the character building of the latter Wilson is too one dimensional to be compelling. It turns him into a victim and reinforces this general theme of \"Brian Wilson was a musical genius and everyone tried holding him back from creating the beautiful music in his troubled brain.\" He's either misunderstood or a victim the whole time and this clouds any sense of us getting to know who Brian Wilson really is. He's never really on the hook and the movie tries to make a saint out of the man while glossing over his troubles and struggles and putting the blame entirely on Mike Love and Eugene Landy. Although maybe including or even mentioning Wilson's struggles with drug addiction would have just ticked another box on the biopic cliche list, and zooming out, this is still a fascinating story even if it feels like they were trying a little too hard to appease the Brian Wilson camp.",

    "review": "  I don't think I've ever seen a biopic quite like LOVE & MERCY before, and I'm still processing what I've seen, to be honest. Focusing on two time periods in Brian Wilson's life, it explores the Beach Boys' heyday in the 1960's (with Paul Dano) and a low period in the 1980's (with John Cusack) during which he meets his second wife, Melinda (Elizabeth Banks), who helps him out of his precarious situation with Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), a psychologist who is very controlling of his personal life. Unlike GET ON UP, the James Brown biopic from last year that followed a stream-of-consciousness approach to narrative structure, LOVE & MERCY is very linear. The two timelines do kind of fade into one another, but the end goal of Brian Wilson's rehabilitation is always front and center. The best aspect of the film is dual performance by Paul Dano and John Cusack as Brian Wilson. Although they each play him differently, due to the different circumstances in those periods of Brian Wilson's life, they still felt like the same person. Paul Dano gets the showier performance, but John Cusack still does excellent work as the heavily medicated Wilson of the 1980's. And, both of them accurately portray the loneliness and isolation that Wilson must have felt. The supporting cast do just as good, though. Paul Giamatti was suitably slimy as the Eugene Landy, the psychologist who takes advantage of Brian Wilson in his weak state, and Elizabeth Banks was very charming and grounded as Melinda Ledbetter, the woman who finally rescues Brian from the prison that his life became. From a technical standpoint, LOVE & MERCY is very competent, with occasional flashes of brilliance. One particularly memorable shot was a long take around a recording studio as Brian is instructing two cellists on the sound he wants them to make. There were also a couple similar shots in Brian's Malibu home (in the 1980's period). There was also a few sequences where the footage was degraded to look like it was recorded a long time ago, which I thought was creative. Then, there's the music. It's been a long time since I've actually listened to the Beach Boys, but it was refreshing to hear it. The score by Atticus Ross was also quite good, its sparseness capturing, again, the loneliness and isolation in Brian Wilson's head. If there's anything negative I have to say, it's that there are some sporadic pacing issues, but nothing so egregious as to make the film unwatchable. Besides, the ending was rather satisfying anyway. Overall, LOVE & MERCY was a uniquely structured psychological portrait in lieu of the typical biography, and it should be commended for that, in addition to the excellent performances and music. As to whether or not he was a genius or madman, I guess it's a little of both (but mostly genius, in my opinion).",

    "review": "  Love & Mercy is a very good portrait of musical genius, Brian Wilson, at two pivotal moments in his life. Eschewing the comprehensive life's story approach that most biopics use, Bill Pohlad decided to focus on the periods surrounding the making of the 'Pet Sounds' album and how he met his current wife, subsequently purging a very toxic individual from his life (ex-manager Eugene Landy). This is a nice change of pace for the tired old musical biopic genre.Paul Dano is great as young Brian Wilson. He portrays Wilson as a tortured, but brilliant puppy dog of a man that he was with heart and sincerity. John Cusack on the other hand is quite simply serviceable as elder, nearly zombified Brian Wilson. Paul Giamatti and Elizabeth Banks are good in their supporting roles.",

Telling two stories of Brian Wilson at different times in his life, actors Paul Dano and John Cusack were both astonishing as Wilson! John Cusack in particular! Cusack gives his best performance in years and shows that he really is one of the most underrated actors working today! Someone give him an Oscar! Elizabeth Banks also gives her most engaging work to date! The music unsurprisingly is great too. Although the two stories didn't mesh together as well as I'd hoped, and Paul Giamatti is stuck playing a two-dimensional villain, Love & Mercy is one of the biggest surprises of the year for me and I hope most of you check it out!",

Freed from the grip of evil psychiatrist by his love, Melinda, he released his single \"Smile\" winning two Grammies.

    "review": "  \"You need to get back to yourself\".I'm on board with any music related biopic, regardless of decade, genre of music or whether or not I even like the artists group. It's usually a fascinating story showing the tortured soul of the musicians rise to fame - through managers, family problems and any other number of things. Occasionally the whole tortured soul thing is a gimmick used to amplify things for the audience. Yep, you guessed it the story of 'Brian Wilson' (Paul Dano/ John Cusack) (assuming this is 100% true) genuinely applies to the tortured soul motif.However, I do now feel full of cringe feelings for using that phrase. My knowledge of 'The Beach Boys', 'Brian Wilson' and even this film are next to none. Iv'e heard of all three - the music and a trailer for the movie. I didn't even now it specifically about 'Brian Wilson' so my ignorance was in full force go into it. There are glimpses of childhood but it doesn't start there. Opting instead to start in the 1980s where 'Brian' first meets 'Melinda' (Elizabeth Banks) a car saleswomen who he takes a shine to. It's oddly paced particularly in the beginning with it almost literally switching between 1980s and height of 'Beach Boys' fame in the 1960s every 5 minutes. It gets a little difficult to get a gripe of things at the start but things eventually spread out. It has a nice balance of the two eras and neither really stand out from one or other.Both 'Dano' and 'Cusack' do well enough and when it gets to the severe state 'Brian' was in (in both 60s and 80s) it can be quite startling. But doesn't go far enough, the reveal of what 'Eugene Landy' (Paul Giamatti playing another nice at first guy) is doing is horrible but the film doesn't give it much weight - or show it for how severe it is. It's more of a \"oh wow\" than a horrified gasp. For all the excellent casting and performances (Dano and Cusack are wonderful) aside when something like that severity crops up or when 'Brian' starts to fall apart it all feels a little, understated.The use of the bands music throughout is one of the smartest Iv'e seen used. Holding back the urge to use them at every and any interval. It's intertwined in Brian's battle with his own psyche with swirling music cues from their various songs all-together. That's the films narrative strength - almost beautifully - showcasing Brian's inner thoughts and eventually battle with schizophrenia.The plaudits should rightfully go to the acting of both 'Cusack' and 'Dano' because in the end it's all just decent. The story is decent but lacks the punch it needs in emotionally charged scenes. All the way through I was interested without being totally engaged, I constantly felt disappointed and I'm not sure why. There's nothing bad here, it's all just very inoffensive.",

    "review": "  Love and Mercy is a biopic about Brian Wilson the, arguably, most well known member of the Beach Boys. It takes place at two different time periods in Wilson's life, the first is of a young Wilson (Paul Dano) as he creates the album Pet Sounds and the hit single Good Vibrations. The second takes place in the mid eighties after the fame has begun to wear off and Brian Wilson (John Cusack) is now a broken shell of himself and shows him falling in love with Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks). Both time periods also show Wilson's struggle with mental health.Things I Liked:Paul Dano. Dano plays the 60's Wilson. He has a youth and ambition to him that really works well. Dano has a knack for playing tortured characters and he shines through at times being able to showcase a number of believable dualities of his personality including: profound and childlike, driven and hesitant, commanding and walked over. Dano shows the early moments in Wilson's mental decline and he really shows it well over the course of the movie.Elizabeth Banks. Banks plays Melinda Ledbetter, the older Wilson's love interest, and eventual wife. Banks brings a strong and compelling characterization to Ledbetter and it's a very different role than we usually see from Banks and it was a nice reminder that she is a skilled actress beyond the world of hokey comedies.The Soundtrack. I mean how could you not make a movie about the Beach Boys and not have a good soundtrack. The movie plays a wide variety of hits from Wilson's career and all of the Beach Boys' classic songs make an appearance including, Surfin' U.S.A., Good Vibrations, Wouldn't It Be Nice, and so many more. The soundtrack plays an interesting parallel to Wilson's life and his state of mind throughout the movie.Things I Didn't Like:John Cusack. John Cusack gives a decent performance as the older Wilson, but one I feel is unneeded. Paul Dano gives such a compelling performance that I was much more interested in the younger Wilson and wished that they has simply let Dano play the part in both times through aging makeup and other effects. Cusack is fine but forgettable next to his younger counterpart.Paul Giamatti. Giamatti is apparently working hard playing every single douchebag manager in every music biopic ever. And it's getting a little tired, stale, forgettable, and cartoony at times. This one is especially so. He is an overly-belligerent short fused hot head at times, he plays a sort of action movie manipulator at others, twisting and beating Wilson's psyche throughout the film.Overall. Overall, the movie is a success. It's an interesting an compelling story. The dual plot lines make for neat parallels and the performances are mostly strong. Dano outshines Cusack and makes you wonder why they chose to split to role in half. Banks shows her dramatic chops and reminds you that she is a skilled actress. Giamatti is the only major role in the film that feels over the top and out of place. But the story succeeds and the soundtrack that accompanies the film is a fantastic wave of nostalgia that works through the cracks to tie the entire thing together. A very enjoyable film.",

    "review": "  Watching this movie was like watching all the documentaries I have seen on the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson over 30 years. It's cliche, it's rhetoric of the 4th hand kind for example - the part in the studio with Brian making it 'clear' to Tony Asher 'no one has heard of the wrecking crew' is case in point as the wrecking crew although were dubbed that later, were very well known in the profession as they later solidify with the guy playing hal blaine (who can't even act - watch the way he smokes a cigarette) lists just a few of the artists they played under)- just not to the 'audiences' Such ridiculousness. The acting throughout is atrocious, the camera work shows how weak Hollywood is. The guy playing the 'older' Brian Wilson threw me off at first as I thought it was Landy he was playing (in the car) but then it's not it's Brian. So how did the young Brian suddenly change every thing about his looks and mannerisms, but old and new ACTUAL film video footage of Brian you always see a resemblance in his voice, movements, ect. EVEN when he was on that SNL skit all bloated on the beach. Very disappointing movie. I'm glad TPB exists so I can spend my money on an original pressing of Pet Sounds and not some false rehash of Brian Wilson. Oh and Brian Wilson did not try LSD first during the Pet Sound sessions. At least 2 years before. BUt I could pick apart so many details it would run a novel. Just read Brian's own words or listen to his actual interviews. I won't even mention the sound quality. Even with bad hearing, Brian could get a balanced sound. Not this collection of Jewish film makers.",

This highly acclaimed film I must agree is very well made, cleverly filmed and supremely performed especially from Paul Dano who portrayed BW in the 60s up to the completion of the Pet Sounds album when he had his psychotic break and John Cusack plays him in the 80s when he met his second wife who single-handedly cured him. The director constantly switches the time zones back and forth thus making it much more interesting to view especially with the famous Beach Boys songs interspersed between the flashes. A must-see for all Beach Boys fans, even if you're not, the songs alone will move you.",

    "review": "  So when watching any biopic about a musician of any kind I just instantly compare to the run of flicks over the years including Walk the Line, Ray, Amadeus etc. Now we have Love & Mercy, and this one takes a different approach then all those other movies. Most of the time you get the story from young to old. Kid is young, discovers music, something bad happens, leaves home, gets famous, parties too much, hits rock bottom and then learns the lesson. What is good about Love & Mercy, in it's exploration of The Beach Boys lead Brian Wilson, is it tells his story but from the point of two short sections of his life. You get a brief look at The Beach Boys rising up and then the movie comes in showing you younger Wilson as he wants to expand his music into something more then just pop surfing hits, and older Wilson dealing with voices in his head and over-medication. Both Wilson's are portrayed quite well by Paul Dano and John Cusack and the rest of the cast is top notch. The writing, the way this film is shot is all done quite well and the movie is at it's best when young Wilson is in the studio creating music. This isn't a feel good story at all, and that took away from my enjoyment of it, and learning that Wilson isn't a fan of his earlier work is a bit of a downer for me as well. Where I didn't like the direction is that Wilson comes off very sympathetically in the movie, as in he's a misunderstood genius and that he's dealing with health problems and he deserves plenty of sympathy. However, Wilson didn't start hearing voices in his head by his own admission (not portrayed in the film) until after he took LSD. He was a heavy drug user and there isn't much accountability of that usage in the film. If you are looking for a history of The Beach Boys, this isn't your movie at all. What it is thought is a movie about another musician who struggles to keep up with his own success and dealing with a troubling past that would make us all go a little nuts. If you know going in what type of movie this is, I think it makes it a better watch.",

Starring John Cusack and Paul Dano both as Brian Wilson, in different stages of his life, \"Love & Mercy\" shows how someone as creative, imaginative, and successful as founding Beach Boy Brian Wilson can fall from the top of the pops to the bottom of the abyss. Paul Dano shows the cheerful, younger side of Wilson, back when the Beach Boys were crafting some of the best pop music known to man- his transformation for the role involve weight gains and singing lessons with the man itself, so it goes to show how deserving he is for some attention from the Academy. He shows Wilson soaring high, but finds him collapsing into himself just a few short years after his fame: and Dano captures this perfectly. Cusack plays a more subdued Wilson, after he's regained some composure, but after he's fallen under the spell of Eugene Landy (played by Giamatti). The tragic rise and fall and rise again of Brian Wilson is played out beautifully, soundtracked to some of the best music ever made, and it shows so much humanity in such a brief window. Easily one of the best films of 2015.",

    "review": "  I like maybe 3 Beach Boy songs. It may be more of my father's genre. However I though the movie did a fantastic job in depicting two periods of Brian Wilson's life. An excellent Biopic movie. I thought Paul Dano did an excellent job in depicting Brian Wilson's younger self. Kudos to Paul and he out did John Cusack in this movie. It tries to shine a light on mental illness and how stigma and misdiagnosis can nearly destroy someone especially if they have a Psychiatrist that is out to take advantage of them and especially for their own self interest. I believe the Psychiatrist may have very well been more mentally ill than Brian. Brian is a musical genius that had an ungrateful and abusive father, battled depression, and was able to overcome through new discovery of oneself and the love and dedication of a fantastic woman who became his wife. I enjoyed this movie and recommend it for rental but maybe not the full price of seeing it in a Theatre. If you like the Beach Boys, it's a must watch and is full of some of their best songs. After watching this movie, I have a new admiration for Brian Wilson, and a new found like for some of their top hits.",

    "review": "  The bio flick \"Love & Mercy\" tells the tale of the professional and personal life of Brian Wilson, one of the key members of the infamous Beach Boys band. OK, so let's do the math here, I do include an enormous amount of puns in my movie reviews, and I am reviewing a movie about a Beach Boys member. So you know what that means, will have \"puns, puns, puns\" til my readers start to run away!!! Anyways, Wilson's challenging dilemma was no laughing matter. He battled schizophrenia throughout most of his adult life. Director Bill Pohlad marveled in presenting a double-sided chronology to Wilson's story; first as a young successful songwriter/producer/member of the Beach Boys who thought that \"wouldn't it be nice\" for the band to transform into a more avant- garde sound which dismayed his Wilson brother bandmates, but most notably his cousin bandmate Mike Love. Paul Dano's performance as the younger Dano was right on key. On the flip side, John Cusack magnificently plays the older Wilson who was already diagnosed with full-fledged schizophrenia and is profoundly controlled by his psychiatrist Dr. Eugene Landy. When the older Wilson meets Melinda Ledbetter, a former model turned car saleswoman, it simply leads to better times for the mentally ailing Wilson; but not without a control fight from Team Landy; let's just say Dr. Landy was a real kokomierda. \"Love & Mercy\" is an excellent piece, but not a perfect film; the screenplay at times was bit disoriented and repetitious. But from the instant, I picked up \"good vibrations\" from the supersonic performances from John Cusack and Paul Dano as the Brians, and ledbeter not forget Elizabeth Banks rousing work as Melinda. \"God only knows\" how people can take so many puns in movie reviews, but \"don't worry baby\" because I'm just about done here. \"Love & Mercy\" is worth riding its cinematic wave; in other words, it's beaching, I mean bitching! ***** Excellent",

Paul Dano and John Cusack manage to define the man, separating the young persona with a stubborn but evolving artistic vision from his broken down older self, who has ceased to strive for perfection, but now does for acceptance.",

Una de las primeras cosas a destacar es que es imposible llegar a diferenciar entre Paul Dano y el verdadero Wilson, y su actuaci�n seguramente le valga alguna nominaci�n, pero no es el �nico que sobresale en la pel�cula. Cusack por su lado presenta una actuaci�n m�s sutil pero igualmente excelente, y no se puede dejar de lado a Paul Giamatti y Elizabeth Banks que tambi�n est�n muy bien en el film.M�s all� del casting, Love & Mercy se destaca sonora y visualemente (las reconstrucciones de las sesiones de la d�cada del 60 son impresionantes y se escuchan de maravilla) lo que hace que la pel�cula se pueda situar por encima de la mayor�a de las biopics musicales.Si les gusta la m�sica no se pueden perder esta peli.

    "review": "  At the helm of this unique biopic is Paul Dano, who deserves a round of applause for his role as singer/songwriter/musician and co-founder of the Beach Boys, Brian Wilson. Dano excels in the film at playing against type and turning in an awe-inspiring, stellar and heart-breaking performance as Brian Wilson in the hay day of the Beach Boys just before they released the equally against type Pet Sounds album. Above all, Dano owns the movie with his charismatic, sweet-natured and quirky take on a troubled musical icon. Fast-forwarding around twenty years later in the late 1980s, Dano steps out and lets the impeccable John Cusack step in, who plays the man with a distantly dreamy and crushing desperation for something to hold onto, with his mind now much more faded and having become a child stuck in an unwilling man's body. Luckily, Wilson finds an anchor in his newfound love, Melinda Ledbetter, played with a seeming ease and motherly quality by Elizabeth Banks. However, the dividing factor between them comes in the form of Dr. Eugene Landy, the maniacal, insatiable tormenter of the broken shell that is still only just Brian Wilson. Paul Giamatti, who plays Landy, is remarkable and many times overwhelming in every second he is on screen, taking advantage of every moment to convey the doctor's deranged obsession with Wilson's every move and the move of every one that tries to stop him. Some of the best scenes are in the studio during the creation of the quintessential songs in Pet Sounds, involving the viewer with the music through the breaking down and assembling of each sound and rhythmic beat. The studio is also the room where much of the 1960s Brian Wilson seems to slip ever closer towards the madness we know he did slip into, but meanwhile the music is phenomenal and truly gives off good vibrations.",

Individually, those narratives can be conventional because you'll guess where the story is heading - but that perhaps is underselling the film as there are some good acting here and the way it is cleverly juxtaposed and presented, elevates what would've been another rock n' roll biopic into a higher and more special/less televisual level. Paul Dano and Elizabeth Banks are both a joy to watch and isn't it nice to see DTV-Cusack doing something understating and more befitting his acting abilities?",

    "review": "  Fascinating, tragic and inspiring; Love & Mercy explores the emotionally turbulent and musically brilliant times of Brian Wilson, co-founder and lead singer of the Beach Boys. Bill Pohlad's absorbing drama is unique from the traditional biopic concentrating on the underlying drama behind the music, rather than the music itself.Brilliantly depicting a complex, creative and highly tortured man obsessed with pushing the boundaries of his talents whilst trying to survive against mounting pressure, the story cuts between key moments in two time windows of the singer/ songwriters life from the late 60s and 80s, both marvellously portrayed respectively by Paul Dano and John Cusack.Rightly perceived as breezy through there wholesome, carefree, toe-tapping sound, this film bypasses the California Girls image of surf and sun, bikini ladies into the major conflicts with his band as he endeavours to make the greatest album ever through some unconventional methods.It also brings light to the physical and mental abuse Wilson received at the hands of his record producer father (Bill Camp), Wilson's struggles with voices in his head and subsequent questionable medical care of Dr Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti) as a self-appointed gate keeper.Occasionally jarring and long winded in its editing, this movie shines through the stunning strength of its actors performances. There is charming chemistry between Cusack and an empathetic Cadillac dealer Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) who becomes Wilson's saviour (and future wife).The Verdict: More interesting the well-executed, switch from major to minor key in seconds.Published: Canberra Weekly MagazineDate of Publication: 16/07/2015",

The only problem with the movie is the blocking. If Brian Wilson is deaf in his right ear why is Ledbetter always on his right? Who is the vain actor? Cusak or Banks.

    "review": "  Love and Mercy focuses on the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson's descent into self-imposed exile caused by a lethal combination of pre-existing mental illness and drug use, though Wilson's self-medication is heavily censored in this version of events. As the creative genius at the centre of the Beach Boys Brian Wilson's story is an intriguing one, but Love and Mercy is a slightly jarring experience mainly due to its use of two different actors to play the younger Wilson (Dano) and older Wilson (Cusack). Both handle their parts superbly, especially Dano, but this feels like two separate movies inter-spliced. The circumstances surrounding Brian's split from the Beach Boys and his drift into the manipulative hands of Dr Landy are not fully explained, but the scenes involving the creation of Pet Sounds are done so superbly they are worth the price of admission alone.",

    "review": "  This was a good movie, but I had high expectations and the film failed to meet them. There were a few reasons for this.1. This was essentially 3 movies in one -- a movie about a young Brian Wilson, at the top of his game; a movie about an older Brian Wilson, a sad shell of his former self; and a documentary on Pet Sounds. It's very hard to put together 3 good movies in a single film.2. Because there was so much to cover, there was little time for character development and most characters came across as boring and one-dimensional. Mike Love was an annoying, difficult obstacle to Wilson's creative genius; Ledbetter was a purely saintly figure; Landy was entirely evil. Characters are more interesting when we understand their motivations and see things from their side. But this movie was mostly caricatures, not characters.3. John Cusack was a poor casting choice. He looked like he was playing John Cusack, not Brian Wilson.4. Hopping back and forth between the 1960s and 1980s didn't work for me. I would have preferred that the pre-credit sequence simply show us a \"flash forward\" to Brian Wilson in his 1980s, incapacitated state, so that the viewer knows where the film is going. After that, the movie could have focused solely on the young Wilson until the point of his post-Pet Sounds breakdown, then say \"20 years later.\"This was still a fun movie to watch, and the Pet Sounds studio sequences were worth the price of admission alone.",

Fans of Paul Giamatti will want to see his portrayal of evil Dr Eugene Landy. *Spoiler alert* all ends happily, but the film is very good at showing the pressures on Wilson that led to mental problems. It also captures very well the recording process for the classic \"Pet Sounds\" and the whole 1960s era. The narrative structure is disjointed, which for me rather detracted from the film, but worth your attention if you like Pet Sounds.",

Genius and insanity are often linked, and the character of Brian Wilson even refers to his father's abusive behavior as being partially responsible for his ability to write music. Both Dano and Cusack give Oscar worthy performances that capture Wilson's sweet, odd, intense ...and crazy persona. The film itself is impressive in its cinematography, and helps to take you inside the head of the mentally ill artist. Also, Paul Giamatti (who I always appreciate) played a great bad guy. I never knew this story, but it is both tragic and triumphant. Love Brian Wilson and glad to know that his success continues!",

To call a man a genius is to suggest he does it all alone. It's a very American idea. Brian Wilson is not a genius. He's a pretty good composer, piano player, bass player and singer. This bio- pic starts to de-rail when it idolizes him for genius; after awhile Brian starts to believe it. There is a scene where the wrecking crew ( studio musicians) hail him--through studio drummer Hal Blaine--that he's the greatest. Of course, they get paid by the hour and the longer they're in studio the more they make. His addictive personality betrays him, and it's difficult for him to go outside his comfort zone.

It doesn't matter that they don't look at all alike because they both inhabit their characters so well. Caught between an abusive controlling father and an abusive controlling 'minder', the tortured genius breaks out of the constraints of the art form and creates music that is genuinely new and fresh. Elizabeth Banks portrays the woman who rescues the older Brian from the monster that has him trapped (played chillingly by Paul Giammati). Her character showcases the power that women have to heal broken men and bring them back to their best selves through tenderness and courage. The moment she stares down Giamatti's crazed minder and completely disempowers him is astonishing. Then of course there's the music. The early Beach Boys material is nicely captured in an early montage (with cleverly constructed period effects) so that the bulk of the film can concentrate on the recording of Brian's masterpiece Pet Sounds. To see these great songs constructed layer by layer is a real treat for those who know and love the album. Those who don't will want to download it immediately. The final credit sequence gives us the real Brian Wilson with a live performance of his late period song 'Love and Mercy.' 'Love and mercy that's what we need right now.' Yes indeed. Brian received both and gave the world through his music so much love and joy. This film (unlike some more formulaic biopics) is a genuine honouring of his legacy.",

    "review": "  It's hard to make biopics. Only recently have major films managed to hit the mark. Selma and Lincoln hit the sweet spot by only focusing on one major part of their subject's life (the march of Selma and the 13th amendment respectively). Yes, other films have managed to cover up more time of their subject's life and have managed to be successful (Milk and Walk the Line are examples), but it's harder to do and therefore more unadvisable. Love & Mercy, a biopic on Brian Williams, member of the Beach Boys, tries to go the harder route and almost makes it. Love & Mercy takes place at two different times of Brian William's life. One is when he and the Beach Boys are rising to fame in the 60s (here he is played by Paul Dano), and the other is in the 80s where we see him broken down and on the verge of insanity (there he is played by John Cussack). In the 60s we see Brian and his genius spurn out tunes for such memorable songs like \"Good Vibrations\" and \"God Only Knows\" but we see fame get into his head and his work soon takes over him; he begins to hear voices in his head, becomes overweight, and starts fighting with the other band members. Fast-forward to the 80s we see Brian Williams meet a car saleswoman named Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) and they begin to date. Through Miranda's perspective we see how Brian is at a physical, economical, and psychological low; because of this Brian's Dr. (a maniacal Paul Giamatti) takes advantage of him and abuses Brian to his benefit. The film is great in all aspects except one: John Cussack. Cussack is a great actor and he does a fine job in this film, but the problem is that he becomes to focused on his own acting. Yes he portrays Brian's senseless torment with the most curtailed of details like finger twitching, but with this egotistic focus he completely breaks apart from the rest of the cast. This makes all of his interactions with Elizabeth Banks seem non-credible and downright boring. Banks tries her best to fix the divide, but Cussack is too stubborn. Also Dano's performance and Cussack's performance are completely different which makes me see two completely different people in every aspect, they weren't both Brian Williams, and this lack of coordination was on the verge of being fatal for this film, after all Cussack's scenes were half of the film. Fortunately the other half of the film was handled expertly. Paul Dano once again show's that he is worth more than a simple supporting actor (he first surprised me in There Will Be Blood). Dano perfectly transitions his Brian from eager to mad in a way that makes us feel sentient for him as well. Essentially Dano accomplishes the whole point of the film, which is to glorify Brian for the artist that he is. Because of Cussack's solitary performance half the film is slow and boring, but Dano and his portion manage to make the whole film worthwhile.",

Dano plays the younger Brian Wilson, while John Cusack plays the older version.Everyone knows the Beach Boys and everyone knows who Brian Wilson is. He was the icon of the 1960s. He was much loved and had the albums to prove it. He was a \"genius\" with music. But his father was hard on him and abusive. Brian needed a break from touring and wanted to record an album, (the now-legendary \"Pet Sounds\"). It was a flop. That's when Brian began heading voices.The movie is told through flackbacks. Now, his in 40s (Cusack) was been manipulated by Dr. Eugene Landy, his psychiatrist who is played by Paul Giamatti. Brian is cut off from is family, and his only source of companionship is a female car salesperson from whom he bought a Cadillac.Not much comedy to break up the misery. And, the love story fell a bit flat. Or maybe she felt sorry for him? Pohlad is known for his producing (\"12 Years a Slave,\" \"Into the Wild\" and \"Brokeback Mountain\") with two stints as a director.

So, he opts out of the Japan leg of the tour in favor of recording some new music for the band. Now all he has to do is figure out how to get the horse inside of the recording studio.It is 1985. Brian Wilson(John Cusack) would like to buy a car. And not just any car, mind you. Which Melinda Ledbetter(Elizabeth Banks), a salesperson, would like to help him with. That happens under the very watchful eye of Dr. Eugene Landy(Paul Giamatti).\"Love and Mercy\" is a thoughtful movie about the intersection between madness and genius which also takes the time to redeem the critical reputation of the Beach Boys. The story is set over two time periods which are linked by two surprisingly matching performances from Paul Dano and John Cusack.(Dano plays Brian struggling to communicate while Cusack is the empty husk of what is left.) While each time period is clearly demarcated by its respective fashions, they are joined in one mindbending segment late in the film. The problems arise in how the movie plays out, namely in seeking as pat a resolution as humanly possible for mental illness for which there is no real cure. And I never quite grasped the importance of the will in all of this.",

    "review": "  Set to please cinephiles and music lovers alike, Love & Mercy truly is a collective effort of great beauty and touching, raw filmmaking. From a layered, complex and surprisingly gut-wrenching script by Oren Moverman and Michael A. Lerner, Bill Pohlad deconstructs a subjective, fragmented and equally intricate vision of one of the most gifted artists in music history. The film - doted with a surprising high-degree of artistry and narrative sophistication - is graced by a fundamental kindness that strongly enhances the beauty and soul-crushing performances by Dano, Cusack, Banks and Giamatti - all names to remember come award season. In addition - and because this is a film with strong sound roots - one could hardly let the phenomenal work by the sound department go by unnoticed, which, in addition to Atticus Ross' score, underlines the already staggering and groundbreaking sonority of The Beach Boys. Supporting the sporadic eargasm is Robert Yeoman's lyrical execution behind the camera, binding together two periods in time and two lives in constant turmoil, that eventually come together in beautifully cathartic fashion to quiet a soul and harmonize a genius. Love & Mercy justifies its title, living off pure vibrations that weren't made for these times, or any times for that matter, for its protagonist still continues to transcend time.",

It's a startling look into the musical genius and troubled life of Brian Wilson, a man who wrote some of the most popular songs of all times. It interchanges, with great skill, two stages of Wilson's life. The Pet Sounds era of the 60s and the broken man of the 80s. We see the music take shape and we see the genesis of his troubled life. It's well written and very engaging and the performances are truly first class.

    "review": "  The movie brings back a lot of memories from the mid-60s. Most of my LP album purchases in those days were The Beach Boys. Poor old Brian Wilson was pretty messed up in spite of being a musical genius and pioneer (good role for John Cusack). Paul Giamatti always plays weird characters and his portrayal of Jean is no exception (Jean is actually a very scary person and Paul plays him well). I was expecting a little more music in the film but I liked the movie (now, if I can just find my old albums, even though I don't have an operational turntable anymore, I do want to look at the covers again).",

    "review": "  Dano's performance makes real the era and the raggedy tragedy of Wilson's art and life. I especially liked the scenes in the studio. Watching somebody make art in the movies is typically a hot mess, but here, we see a process, made coherent because we know where it's going. I'm less enamored of the Cusack segments, bringing the story into the 90s when he is rescued from a Svengali huckster psychologist, not only because Cusack's look is so different, but because there was so much missing between the different slices of Wilson's life that the latter felt contrived and conflated. Which it is, if you read Wilson's bio. Oh well, it's not perfect, but the music is, and the scenes where the music is central are just so wonderful for this nostalgic geezer who lived through it all. I used to go to the Beach Boys concert every Christmas. Until, of course, the Beetles.",

    "review": "  Much of the credit for the artistic merits of \"Love & Mercy,\" the new biopic about Brian Wilson, co-founder of the Beach Boys, goes to screenwriters Oren Moverman (\"I'm Not There\") and Michael A. Lerner (\"August. Eighth\"). Together, they have fashioned a story that ping-pongs back and forth between Wilson's early heyday as the brilliant creative force behind the Beach Boys' success - and his subsequent mental unraveling - and the dark period of the 1980s when he languished under the autocratic care of his guru-like psychologist, Eugene Landy. The result is a masterful portrait of a troubled genius, the tolls of fame, and the virtues of perseverance and love.The film (which takes its title from a 1988 song by its subject) is as much a portrait of the creative process as it is of Brian Wilson. We learn plenty about the Beach Boys and about Wilson's private life, but some of the great joys of the movie are the scenes in the music studio. In particular, we see how both \"God Only Knows\" and \"Good Vibrations\" were recorded - or, at least, how the screenwriters and director imagine they were made - and the sequences reveal how much of an innovator Brian Wilson was, in spite of his growing problems with mental illness. We need to understand the genius in order to mourn his loss (and hope for his recovery).Much credit should also go to director Bill Pohlad and his cast. This is only Pohlad's second feature film as director: his first, \"Old Explorers,\" was 25 years ago. Since then, Pohlad has worked primarily as a producer, including on \"The Tree of Life\"; he shared in that film's Best Picture nomination. Here, he has assembled a first-rate group of actors, and made the vital decision to cast two different actors as Wilson, both of them up to the task: Paul Dano (\"There Will Be Blood\"), as the younger, 1960s Wilson, and John Cusack (\"The Paperboy\") as the older, 1980s Wilson. Given that Dano is in his early thirties, it's legitimate to wonder why he couldn't have also played the older Wilson, with added makeup. But therein lies part of the brilliance of the film. Casting two such different actors to play the same character at different stages of his life - the one before a major physical and mental cataclysm, the one after - helps to underline that character's significant transformation, and the obstacles in his way as he tries to recover. Cusack has further stated, in a recent interview, how even though he and Dano studied Wilson's life with a similar intensity, neither consulted with the other to make the two performances match in any way. They end up both delivering fully committed portrayals of the same man at vastly different times in his life, and it works perfectly.The rest of the cast is quite strong, as well. Elizabeth Banks (\"Pitch Perfect 2\"), as Melinda Ledbetter, the woman who helps Wilson in his struggles to free himself from Landy, is a marvel of warmth and restraint. Paul Giamatti (\"Sideways\"), as Landy, has the difficult task of playing the villain, but he succeeds in making him three-dimensional, if not sympathetic (which the film doesn't intend him to be). If their final duel is as scary and cathartic as it ultimately is, it's due to the power of these two actors in these roles. It's too bad that not all of the other actors - in particular, the rest of the Beach Boys - are as strong, but at least - with Dano, Cusack, Banks and Giamatti - we have a formidable foursome.What surprised me most as I watched the film - and made me fall in love with it - was how unconventional it was in its approach to the material. Because we are dealing with a man - Wilson - who suffers from both severe hearing loss in one ear and auditory hallucinations - the soundtrack quite often reveals completely unexpected noises, or sometimes drops out entirely. In fact, the opening of the film almost feels like there's a problem with the projector (be patient), because we start on Dano at the piano, in distress, then cut to black, then land on Cusack, and then slowly begin to discern other sounds as the credits begin. Though the movie settles down, for a while, to tell enough of a story for us to gather salient facts about Wilson in both the 1960s and 1980s, it returns, time and again, to these experimental techniques, reminding us that art - like Wilson - when made with purpose, can seem as it if knows no boundaries. This is a movie with a definite method to its madness.",

    "review": "  Saw LOVE & MERCY today, an intelligent film about two periods of Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys life. There's a vivid half with Paul Dano (excellent performance from this slow rhythm actor) and a well cast band tracing hois most creative period and the decent to paranoia. The second part is the sad story of Wilson in the 80's, manipulated by a quack doctor and finding love and perhaps rescue from a car saleswoman (Elizabeth Banks). Both parts are interesting stories, but the earlier story is more fun to watch. John Cusack does a sensitive job as the older Wilson--but he doesn't look like Wilson or Paul Dano, so that may throw you. The scenes in the music studios are the best part of the film--you feel the positive, creative energy--the Good Vibrations, I guess!",

While likely just as demanding, John Cusack's role of the late 1980s Brian Wilson doesn't come off as resounding as Dano's, due in large part to the narrow scope of Wilson's character by this point in time (as he was psychologically and physiologically manipulated by Dr. Gene Landy).",

    "review": "  Hollywood at its best, with first class production values. But from the first set of chords that Dano's Wilson picks out on the piano, that you think are leading you one place, then with their complexity take you by surprise, to Cusack's beautiful serenade to Melinda, to the brilliant studio sessions, this film is a true education in the art of musicianship. In a masterpiece of editing, each scene of a song being worked in the studio is like a song in itself. If you find the rhythm of the first musical segment, and keep following it through the pause that follows while it's being discussed, you will pick it up again exactly in the next bit, and this continues for the length of the scene. Brian Wilson's art is deservedly paid the highest of compliments by the musicians. The entire cast is excellent. Elizabeth Banks as the lovely Melinda turns up in full American regalia - big hair, lots of makeup, sparkling smile, tons of glamour; be not distracted, because her Melinda has an unshakeable sense of self, intelligence and understanding, and she inspires complete confidence in the people whom she needs, to help to turn Wilson's life around. Someone remarks to Wilson, 'who do you think you are, Mozart?' to which Dano responds with perfect understatement. Dano's portrayal of Wilson's singing is also brilliant. If you never listened closely to the Beach Boys, as I hadn't, do so now. Rarely does Hollywood produce a film with this sense of reality, combined with complex technical content of real interest, true compassion, and sheer beauty of characterisation. The ending is wonderful.",

    "review": "  Biopics typically tread similar waters. Filmmakers who dabble in the true-life stories of renowned geniuses offer exceptional depictions of such people, yet they all follow the same tired formula. 'Love & Mercy' is anything but a typical biopic. Its single greatest strength is its unconventionality. Rather than paint its subject simply as a damaged genius, the film humanizes him a great deal and makes viewers feel like they're sitting next to the musical legend, offering them the most unique window into the psyche of any biographical subject depicted on the screen. However, like other biopics before it, 'Love & Mercy' is only as good as its cast, and this one is nothing short of phenomenal. John Cusack displays some great work as the older Brian Wilson, but it is Paul Dano who absolutely nails it as the younger Brian Wilson. His best scenes are when Wilson is seen giving notes to his fellow musicians while recording the \"Pet Sounds\" album. Elizabeth Banks also turns in a fine performance as Wilson's second love, Melinda. Cusack, Dano, and Banks expertly provide much of the film's human touch. On the other hand there's Paul Giamatti as Wilson's ferocious therapist, who sounds like he may still be in the mindset of a disturbed antagonist from a different film set. Nonetheless, he gives another solid performance. Aside from stellar acting, the film itself is a revelation. The cinematography, editing, musical score, and sound mixing transcend the limits of traditional biopic filmmaking. There's even a sequence near the end of the film that will remind film buffs of the last ten minutes of '2001: A Space Odyssey'. It may baffle uninitiated viewers, but the sequence is truly no small feat for such an audacious picture. Only a few minor tweaks could be used its dialogue (which sounds ever-so-slightly clich�d towards the end) and its pacing (some scenes carry on for a while), but 'Love & Mercy' is a near-perfect experience in terms of getting inside its subject's mind, heart and soul.",

Giamatti plays his role intensely, maybe too much so; but it allows the audience to identify him as the antagonist. Paul Dano does a fine job of playing the younger Brian Wilson in all of his moods and possessions, and John Cusack (haven't seen him in any films for awhile) performs convincingly as the emotionally tortured Brian Wilson in his later years.",

    "review": "  Biopics are typically a boring \"best-of\" montage, episodic without any real arc. This one is completely different, a real breath of fresh air. Its parallel timelines are intriguing, and the creative process (as well as psychological strain) brought to vivid life. The fantastic ensemble cast turn in wonderfully passionate performances. And the sound design - oh, man, that sound design is just brilliant.",

The story line was riveting & heartbreaking as the biopic follows Brian Wilson's struggle with the after-effects of abuse from his Father and the subsequent drug abuse and mental problems. Not necessarily a feel-good movie, but a story of survival by one of the great musicians of our time.",

    "review": "  For music or culture fans this is a fascinating look into the troubled mind of musical genius Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. I grew up in Southern California, and the band's hit 'I Get Around' was the first record I ever bought with my own money at 15. I thought I knew something about the band, but this movie was a real eye opener. We see great performances from everyone involved, especially Paul Dano and John Cusack as the young prodigy and the older Brian, fighting to break the figurative chains thrown on him by his Dr. and keeper, Eugene Landy, played to an almost over the top crescendo by Paul Giamatti. Elizabeth Banks is perfect as the woman who rescues him and literally saves his life. One of the best movies of the year.",

It's for Beach Boys fan(atic)s, musicologists, and movie nerds who like unconventional efforts for the sake of unorthodoxy (which helps explain the cult adoration of Tarantino and Pulp Fiction). The parts (Dano, Cusack, Giamatti's scenery-chewing, clinical insights into Brian's muse and his music-making process) are greater than their sum. Having said that, it's one of the very few films of recent note I could stand to see again. Go figure.",

    "review": "  \"Love & Mercy\" is a biopic based on the life of Brian Wilson, the lead singer of The Beach Boys. The film lapses between Wilson's younger self (Paul Dano) and his older, more conflicted self (John Cusack). In the film, Wilson suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, and Paul Giamatti, his legal guardian, controls him incessantly and wants to impede him from having a relationship with his love interest (Elizabeth Banks) for his supposed \"own good.\" Though I thought the film was an interesting biopic with some good studio scenes, I thought the narrative was uneven in parts and that some of the plot was lagging. If I was producing a movie on the life of the Beach Boys, I would focus more on the music and the legacy than painting Wilson as an impotent drool monkey, which I feel the film does. His character is entirely under the whim of Giamatti, which I feel detracts from Wilson's legacy. The film also does not feature \"Kokomo,\" which was the band's biggest hit, an exclusion that is unforgivable in my book. I'm not also sure that Paul Dano really captured the essence of Wilson and instead made him look like a self-righteous bigot who only wanted to write his own songs and go against the grain of his fellow group members. The film was a nice character study, but it lacked the narrative holism I was looking for ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- B-",

    "review": "  Love and Mercy is the latest in a series of biopics that have been coming out lately. I wouldn't normally consider this to be my genre, but I give them credit for making a convincing trailer. I went in hoping for a movie about the creative process and a thoughtful look into the mind that creates great music. I was not disappointed...sort of. In a way, it did it all too well. Sometimes the overly romanticized creative process is actually an unpleasant hellscape, full of delusions, hearing voices, self doubt - in other words, sometimes creating something means you must experience the opposite of that thing. Instead of feeling invigorated as I hoped, I was given a sharp dose of reality. One other thing to go along with that, apparently Brian Williams was into drugs for a period of his life and suffered from some schizophrenia. In some parts, I found myself having a hard time figuring out what they're going for, but so did Brian Wilson as he lived through it. So I can't fault them completely for being occasionally incoherent. All that being said, the movie is very well made with a lot of very touching scenes. The actors are well placed, especially the two leads. (though I must admit that I was more intrigued when the Paul Dano side of the story came up on the screen.) The story is good, and I love movies like this that dig deep into how the human mind works. There's a large portion of movie goers that would find the movie too slow and many scenes unnecessary and nonsensical. Fortunately for this movie, I doubt many of those people would ever find themselves watching it anyway. My Grade: B-",

The soundtrack is amazing and that from someone who has really never been a Beach Boys fan. The direction is smart and tight and the script avoids most of the cliches that burden biographical material.

Not that the acting wasn't good. Just that the movie was slow, not enough of their music and too much of the tragedy that was an integral part of Brian's life. My life is a lot poorer and my dad was abusive but he didn't hit me evey day and kill my right ear and sell all my music rights for $750K.

    "review": "  \"Love & Mercy\" is less a bionic than it is a true examination of a life time of mental illness. In this film, we are introduced to an already flourishing Beach Boys with their fandom at an all time high, leaving the band at this point to hit the daunting task of staying on par in order to keep relevant. We're shown through an opening mini montage that the band is already famous, so from there its off and running. I appreciated that about this film. Its not intended to be a biopic about how the Beach Boys came to be. Its center is more thoughtful and interesting than that.I think these days its important to mix things up if you're planning on making a true and honest character piece about a famous person's life. \"Love& Mercy\" is that film. Its spends its full running time explaining to us, the audience who Brian Wilson is, why we should care, and what makes him not only interesting, but so important to music history. This film does what I to this day believe that \"Walk the line\" should have with telling the Johnny Cash story. It uses non-linear story telling to get the audience more invested in the presentation of the film, instead of simply hitting the bullet points of Brian Wilson's life. There are many open holes and unanswered questions come the end of the film. That's the beauty of it. Life doesn't work the way a movie usually displays it.\"Walk the line\" faltered simply because it didn't want to confuse its audience or disrespect the subject matter, but what if that's what Cash would have wanted? He too was an open book and one large unanswered question. \"Walk the line\" was a watered down version of the actual events that he himself describes in his very own autobiography \"Cash\". So perhaps he would have wanted a more honest and brash depiction instead of the stiflingly boring \"Walk the line\". The reason I bring this up is to prove a point. Biopics are tricky. They can easily fall into fluff pieces with too much of the artists music in the background and not enough exposition of the reality of things in which case they can become self parodies.\"Love & Mercy\" takes all the conventions of the usual biopic and flips it on its head. It tells two completely different stories in two completely different times in Brian Wilson's life. Its the juxtaposed story telling here that sets \"Love & Mercy\" apart from all the rest. One story being told in the mid 60s and the other in the late 80s. Two completely different narratives with completely different styles of film making. Paul Dano plays the young Wilson in the 60s as he struggles to exist with the other members of the band and battles the early stages of his illness. John Cusack plays the older Wilson having been babysat literally for most of his adult years by his shady therapist played by a very creepy Paul Giamatti.The 60s scenes play out more of the traditional biopic style with us witnessing Wilson's genius as he writes and creates \"Pet Sounds\" which is believed by many to be one of the best albums of all time. Paul Dano is magnificent as a young Wilson obsessed with his music to the point where we wonder if he ever needed the Beach Boys. His mannerisms are amazing and his look really makes you feel the performance. The supporting cast of the other members are all really good as well and it was good to see that they were not shut out of the film and reduced to extras like all the members of The Doors in Oliver Stone's \"The Doors\".The scenes in the 80s are more the after math of what we see from the 60s, plus a lot more that we apparently don't see. John Cusack, in his best performance in probably 20 years nails it as the already broken Wilson. Here he meets Melinda, played with poise and grace by Elizabeth Banks and we witness a real friendship start and blossom into an amazingly sweet and intense romance. Cusack really becomes the Wilson that we've seen in the more recent interviews with his high dose of meds making him dry mouthed and constantly licking his lips. Everything from the way he stands, walks, and flicks his finger tips, we really feel as we are watching Wilson and not Cusack, which I guess is the point. Elizabeth Banks surprises as many of the heavy scenes are carried by her as she watches Wilson unravel all over again. Its heartbreaking watching what Wilson went through at the same time infuriating watching how his therapist manipulated him for so many years. Giamatti was really fantastic. Its not easy to hate Giamatti, but here, you really really do.I applaud this film for making something different. It has the courage to try and make us think of what happened between these two timelines. They never meet right in the middle, only mere suggestion of whats to come. The story telling is what really sells this picture. The acting is first rate and the writing is perfect. I'm not entirely sure if this type of film hits what the academy looks for when it comes to best picture, however, I'd like to think some consideration will be in order when it comes to the acting and perhaps the writing. Time will tell. Either way, this is a pretty great film. In addition, we are treated with the experience of watching how the album \"Pet Sounds\" was created and it is truly a joy to see how that happened.",

    "review": "  Successful producer Bill Pohlad (Brokeback Mountain; Into the Wild; 12 Years a Slave; The Tree of Life) has made the move into the director's seat with some astonishing results. Love & Mercy is an amazing biopic, and Beach Boys genius Brian Wilson - simultaneously played in the past and present respectively by Paul Dano and John Cusack - is a fascinating enigma to behold. The Screenplay by Oren Moverman (The Messenger; I'm Not There) and Michael Lerner deftly bounces back and forth between the 1960's when Brian Wilson was succumbing to paranoia and delusions while crafting musical masterpieces and the 1980's where he lives as a prisoner under the care of a ruthless therapist. In the 1960's, Wilson is portrayed by Paul Dano (There Will Be Blood; Little Miss Sunshine) was gives the best performance of his young career. Dano captures all the tender genius in Wilson's heart. And if Dano is the heart of the movie, Cusack is the soul. The veteran actor plays Wilson in the 1980's where he meets the lovely Cadillac saleswoman Melinda - played by a red-hot Elizabeth Banks - and struggles to make human contact while drugged-up by his surreptitious benefactors. Cusack and Banks create quite a unique love story as she deals with Cusack's fragile emotional state and the ego-maniacal terror embodied by Paul Giamatti's Dr. Landy. Cusack and Dano could perform the unheard of feat of both earning Oscar nominations for playing the same character in the same film. Banks and Giamatti are equally worthy. And props to the technicians! Along with the perfect soundscape, The Grand Budapest Hotel's cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman beautifully renders the 1960's with grainy period lighting and film stock. The production team expertly captures time and place with art direction and costuming. Who wouldn't know it was 1985 when Elizabeth Banks slinks in with her electronic blue dress straight out of Cybil Shepherd's Moonlighting wardrobe?Love & Mercy should be discovered by all adult audiences.",

    "review": "  Had a chance to obtain an early viewing of the film and I approached it with a positive bias since I've been a big fan of the Beach Boys during their prime (1960-1970) given that Brian Wilson was one of the most talented songwriters of his day, even if he lost his magic touch some time ago. Unfortunately, the film happens to be a tremendous disappointment on several levels. First, when casting a living celebrity who is recognizable to millions, it is imperative to find an actor(s) that bears some physical resemblance to the icon...or, at the least, convert the actor via makeup, hair dye, prosthetics, etc., into an acceptable simulacrum. As much as I like Cusack, at no time could I suspend disbelief and think of him as \"Brian Wilson,\" not for a moment. Second, the film had the feeling of a TV Movie of the Week, thanks primarily to the wooden dialogue and the mundane, conventional, directorial interpretation. This biopic, in the hands of a far more talented writer such as Aaron Sorkin and a more imaginative director such as Milos Forman, likely would have been an extraordinary creation, since the life of Brian Wilson is genuinely a fascinating rise-fall-resurrection tale. Essentially, what the film really needed were powerful visual biographers who could awe the audience in the same manner that Brian Wilson could blow away his fans, thanks to his oft, out-of-the-box songs, such as, \"Good Vibrations.\" Unfortunately, where Brian Wilson's songs could be astounding works of art, this biopic only will appeal to those hard core oldster fans (the majority now firmly ensconced within their senile years) who worship the man as a veritable god, ready to fall in love with any mediocre mention or trite paean to his life. Yes, it was very nice to hear all those Beach Boys songs again...but, hell, today, I can steal all of the music for free from the internet, so why would I pay a single penny for the experience? Sorry to report that Love & Mercy is more in the vein of \"Banal Vibrations,\" and can only recommend this for a free TV viewing, and merely for those who might find it of academic interest.",

    "review": "  Thoroughly absorbing and brilliantly executed, the bio-pic of American's boy genius of 60's sun, surf, sand, parties, cars and cruising for girls, follwed by his later pop music #1 mega hit Good Vibrations, is a unique exploration of the haunting combination of musical genius almost blocked out due to emotional and mental delusions making every day life painful, first at the hands of his violent, abusive and dismissive father followed by total emotional domination and exploittation by his full time therapist Eugene Landy (well played by Paul Giamatti with a bad toupee [is there any other kind?]}. As played by Giamatti, \"therapist\" Landy was the portriat of wickedness masquerading as full time TLC. The idea of two physically different, facially different actors, both well known for other work (especially the always watchable John Cusack) along with the less known but possessing first rate acting chops by Paul Dano as the young Beach Boy founder, a better character study is not know by this reviewer. Paul Dano plays the younger Brian tormented by his constantly critical father as well as lead singer cousin Mike Love who doesn't understand Brian's constant search for new sounds, instruments, counterpoint harmonies and musical exploration. The film opens with Cusack as the elder Brian shoeless \"test sitting\" a Cadillac Fleetwood in a showroom when his future wife Melinda (empathically played with just right touch of strength, curiosity and vulnerability by Elizabeth Banks (recently director of Pitch Perfect 2 as well as Efie Trinket of the Hunger Games series) makes a deal to sell him a car. Adding to the realism is the director's choice to not just play original Beach Boys finished songs as the film moves from one hit phase to another, interrupted by Brian's mental problems. Rather the skeletal song parts are there supplemented by the actors' singing whle making records in the studio. As is always the case, there is no substitute for a good story. Briam Wilson's long anguished journey from tormented, shy, introverted emerging songwriter barely 20 years old, dreaming of his Surfer Girl In My Room who later emerges as a bloated, sleep addicted psyedelic LSD tripster who falls under the spell of Landy. Cerebral and engaging, Love and Mercy has both.",

    "review": "  One of the top films of 2015. Love & Mercy is a tour-de-force of acting and visual craft. As erratic, unexpected and joyous as the noisy mind of Brian Wilson. Rarely, has a biopic been made that accurately depicts the wresting demons of an artist quite like this one. Many try, and fail. This one has a bevy of material to work with, and doesn't waste a drop. Paul Dano, once again, gives a performance that will leave you speechless. It astounds me how vastly overlooked he is an an actor. His work in Little Miss Sunshine and There Will Be Blood should've garnered him two Oscar nominations by now. John Cusack gives another Oscar worthy performance as the older Brian Wilson. This is essential two stories in one. The rocky rise of Brian Wilson, and the love story of his later years. Each connect due to the two people in his life that keep him from living; his abusive father and his abusive, leaching, Hollywood psychotherapist, played incredibly by Paul Giamatti. Elizabeth Banks also gives a pretty impressive turn as Melinda. After leaving the theater, I've fallen in love with The Beach Boys all over again. This is the movie fans have been waiting for. You don't want to miss this one, folks.",

    "review": "  Unfortunately, genius and mental illness sometimes go hand-in-hand. Too often, the kind of genius that represents truly original thought is so unusual that it's perceived as \"crazy\", but sometimes when a term like that is used for someone who thinks and acts very differently than others, it refers to a literal, clinically-defined mental or emotional impairment. In those cases, the issue becomes whether the mental illness is the cause or the result of the sick person's genius. It's a kind of chicken-egg question, but no matter which came first, mental illness hurts. It hurts the person suffering from it and those who care about him or her and, left untreated (or poorly treated), it can destroy those interpersonal relationships and, of course, the person who is ill - genius and all. This was the problem, and nearly the fate, of Brian Wilson, founder of The Beach Boys. Wilson's struggle is the focus of the innovative and insightful biopic \"Love & Mercy\" (PG-13, 2:01).Part of the problem in describing this movie is that the term \"biopic\" applies only in the loosest sense. This film is not a valentine to the Beach Boys, or even a chronicle of all the important events in the life of Wilson himself. The story's unusual structure is meant to convey a single major issue in his life - an ongoing struggle with mental illness. The plot revolves around two pivotal periods in Wilson's personal history - the late 1960s and the late 1980s - when his illness began to have a significant effect on his life, and, later, when the treatment he received was exposed as more harmful than helpful and Wilson was able to start receiving proper care. Constructed as it is, the film's creative team decided to have two actors play Wilson - Paul Dano for the earlier portion of the story and John Cusack for the later part. Those separate periods in Wilson's life unfold throughout the movie, which skillfully alternates between scenes from each, similar to the way \"The Godfather, Part II\" tells its tale, but without the sense that the earlier scenes are flashbacks. Both stories are told chronologically and as if they are happening simultaneously, both bringing Wilson's life to points of crisis and ultimately, to redemption.The late 1960s' Brian Wilson was a young genius, at the height of his powers. A few well-chosen scenes (displayed as if they're bits of genuine archival footage) show The Beach Boys at their most popular - clean-cut California kids cranking out hit after feel-good hit. By the late 60s, most of their biggest hits are behind them and Wilson is trying to move the band in new directions, gaining inspiration from his natural musical talent, innate creativity, some illicit drugs, and the voices and music that he hears in his head. The main focus in the late 60s scenes is the production of the classic album \"Pet Sounds\", which was critically acclaimed (and is now considered one of the greatest albums of all time), but was dispassionately received by many Beach Boys fans due to its radical departure from the band's signature upbeat songs. Except for a few scenes in which we see the band create \"Good Vibrations\", the focus is not so much on the music as on the man. It's a very human story which is both more personal and more relatable than a traditional biopic.The late 1980s' Brian Wilson is a broken man being rebuilt by the radical 24-hour therapy of his psychiatrist and legal guardian, Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). There are bits of dialog to let us know how Wilson got to this point and how much Landy did to bring him back from the brink, but most of what we see in these portions of the story is the complete control that Landy exercises over his patient's daily life and personal affairs. Landy, or those on his staff, follow Wilson everywhere he goes. We can tell by the way Wilson talks and acts that he needs some level of supervision. What isn't as clear is whether his need for Landy's care has more to do with Wilson's actual mental state, the huge amount of medication Landy has Wilson taking or the near complete physical, mental and emotional dependence that Landy has caused Wilson to have on him. This is the situation that Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) walks into. She's a former model who is now selling cars. She and Brian meet when he comes to buy a Cadillac from the dealership where she works. In spite of Wilson's off-beat way of talking, Melinda is drawn to his sweet and fragile disposition and it's obvious that Wilson is immediately attracted to her too. As the two grow closer and Landy allows her, as he says \"unprecedented access\" to Wilson's life, she sees Landy's manipulations for what they are and feels compelled to help, regardless of the cost. Those who can watch \"Love & Mercy\" without being distracted by the unconventional story-telling style are likely to find it both enlightening and enjoyable. The film provides rare insights into mental illness and shines a light on the need for the families and friends of such patients to remain active and attentive regarding their loved one's care. Beach Boys fans, and really, all music fans, will enjoy seeing the creative process behind one of the most important influences in the history of American popular music. And those who like a good romance or human drama will get that too. Last but not least, movie fans will appreciate the outstanding performances and will likely hope, as I do, that they are remembered come the next awards season. However, the film has a few too many slow moments, it could have done a better job of filling in some of the obvious gaps in the story, and the prevailing tone of the film is a little depressing, but its compelling story told in such an original way with such great actors outweighs its few imperfections. \"B+\"",

    "review": "  +I had a hard time getting into, letting alone understanding, \"Love and Mercy\" and more than once during the first hour I wanted to bolt the theatre but I stayed and finally figured it all out!While the bulk of the film is carried by John Cusack and Paul Dano, both as Brian Wilson, it is the performance by Elizabeth Banks that holds it all together. Dano is Brian during the late 60s and we see how he wrote the music that would become a thread in so many lives while Cusack plays Brian in the 1980s who came under the control of a manipulative shyster, Dr. Eugene Landy, played by Paul Giamatti, who just oozes evil, who was given all legal control of the musician's life, though how is not really explained. Banks is Melinda Ledbetter who meets the latter Brian and sees the man he really is, who helps him get away from Landy and would eventually marry him.This is not a play by the numbers Hollywood biography though there are many elements from the abused children angle to the real possibility of a man being easily dominated by another father figure. Yes there are the drugs, the high living, the 'mad' genius aspect but this is more of getting into the head of a songwriter and how and where the music comes from and into his descent into an unexplainable diagnosis as a paranoid schizophrenia with hearing voices and LSD which doesn't help him.There is no resemblance between Dano and Cusack nor do they ever move or talk the same but both are believable as being the same man. Many of Wilson's hit songs are heard but not as in a concert but how they sprang from the man's mind. One example is how much the difference of the sound between a father slapping his son so hard that the latter loses most of his hearing in that ear and a spanking can bring different tones to a song. Another prime example of what made Wilson such a perfect musician was his search for the exact sound of the cellists in \"Good Vibrations\".There is not a false movement by any of the cast and the direction by Bill Pohlad, with the screenplay by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, take this far away from 'just another musical Hollywood biography'. The sound editing by Atticus Ross and the sound mixing by Edward Tise are works of perfection.This is not an easy film to watch, get into and/or understand but it is worth the 2 hours of your life to watch it--and how many movies can you say that about?",

While showing the utter musical genius of Brian Wilson, the film focuses onhis mental illness issues that start early on and journey right thru middleage. Besides an abusive Father, sort of non supportive brothers and cousins,Wilson ends up being heavily medicated, monitored and controlled by a whack jobtherapist/legal guardian (never really explained) played really well by PaulGiamatti. The latters role is very reminiscent of the \"controlling\" role playedby Steve Carell (Academy Award Nominee) in Foxcatcher/2014...a sick, scary, weird,faux father figure with ulterior motives.Elizabeth Banks plays Cusack's love interest who is a very strong, independentand successful woman who clearly sees the real Brian Wilson (and inner horror he's going thru). I must admit I was moreso distracted by howimpeccably dressed she was in many different scenes. Not something I normallynotice but boy did she visually steal every scene.This movie is very well done just not fun, summery, upbeat.

Fittingly, the subject is Beach Boys maestro Brian Wilson, the innovative songwriter and composer whose musical experiments generated some of the most beautiful and iconic music of the 1960's. Instead of having one actor portray Wilson, who fought a long battle with drug addiction and mental illness, director Bill Pohlad gives us two terrific performances. First there's Paul Dano, who packed on some pounds to get Wilson's likeness just right for the 1960's version, when he was at the height of his artistic powers. Then there's John Cusack, looking very much unlike Wilson circa the 1980's, fighting against the pill-induced haze created by his therapist Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti, totally nutty). He's rescued from oblivion by Cadillac saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks), who became his second wife.Ledbetter herself was a consultant on the script. Does her input stifle the film dramatically? Possible, probably. But the taught script from Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner fights against lame cliches, as does Dino Jonsater's editing, which jumps between time periods until sharp juxtaposition generates true clarity. Musically, the film is outstanding. Just watch Wilson in the studio, wrangling musicians around while recording 'Good Vibrations' and his opus Pet Sounds, utilizing literal bells and whistles, along with bicycle bells and even barking dogs to get close to the music Wilson is hearing in his head. It's a sharp contrast from Cusack's performance, focusing on introspection. But it's Dano who is truly electrifying, award-caliber. Just try taking your eyes off him.",

    "review": "  I love Brian Wilson. I love Pet Sounds To hear about a biographical film of him and the time where he and The Beach Boys were working on the album, I know I had to go see this film. Also, to have Paul Dano casted as Wilson himself, I knew this was gonna be an emotional ride and indeed it was. I wasn't sure about John Cusak playing older Brian but seeing him as Brian, I was dead wrong.Me and eggsslut? saw Love and Mercy last night at the Arclight. It's such a great film that draws you into the world of a genius and his harsh struggles, also giving you insight of history being re-created right in front of your eyes. This film paid so much attention to detail as far as casting and the shit that was going down. I was obsessed with Pet Sounds when I first heard it (still am in a way). It's such a great album. There's so much in there and you only think that it was something being made but it's quite the opposite. A lot of creativity was put in there. A emotions were mixed in there fueled by the people very close to Brian. The stuff he did in there, people didn't think it would work or amount to anything for half of the part. It was way ahead of its time. Dano as well as Cusack played Brian so freakin' good. Dano has a good voice. I felt Cusack did a better job. I mean the state that Brian was in during that time, it takes somebody with that range and he pulled it of. I focused a lot on Cusack's hands, his eye and even his mouth. There's so much that he does with each of those things I mentioned. He played somebody who has problems and still be able to communicate with people well. Dano knows how to keep it together in his scenes. Brian was like that during his creative time in the Pet Sounds sessions. He was a very emotional guy and Dano brought out the need Brian wants from people. He was determined to make something beautiful. I love how the director casted the rest of the band and them involved during that process. I never thought Mike Love was that much of a dick during that time. I did know that their father was manager and that Brian was tired of making the same 'ol surf music. Older Brian's scenes were a bit more intense. Elizabeth Banks really impressed me with her acting. It's crazy how somebody can hold in through a lot for somebody who was just a customer for cars. Paul Giamatti scared the hell out of me. He always knew how to play wired up characters in any kind of genre. I never thought he can take it up a notch. The casting is great. They bring out the people very well, even for the session musicians. I recognize some of the musicians from archives photos. I just wished they focused bit more on the things Brian was doing when he was older or the things after Good Vibrations. I remember the scene where he was trying to pick out the vibes at a space but wasn't able to. I wish there was more to that. We see the things but we want to go deeper because we're used to see a lot already from this film, it's like can you go more? The sound editing is beautiful. That's where the heart is in the technical blueprints in this film. Hearing the voices Brian is listening, us eavesdropping on the things he would say to the musicians, him freaking out to the utensils in the dinner. As far as sound, that's one of my favorite 'cause they even managed to make a beat to it as it was going on. My favorite scene is probably the scene where Brian and Melinda sit in the car together. It was played out so well. I loved the dialogue and camera work in that scene. There's a cut where it lingered on Banks for quite a moment. The special car. Did he ever get that car? Wouldn't it be nice if he did?",

The Young Brian Wilson is portrayed by Paul Dano and the older Brian Wilson is portrayed by John Cusack. Young Wilson is at the peak of his creativity while making the famous Beach Boys album Animal Sounds. He doesn't have the full support of his band mate but his collaborators love his innovation. The older Wilson is dealing with his mental illness and a controlling doctor Eugene Landy played by Paul Giamatti. He meets a car saleswomen Melinda played by Elizabeth Banks. She falls in love with him and will top at nothing to help him rid himself of the crazy controlling doctor Landy. Love & and Mercy is 1 of the best musical bio-pics ever. Dano and Cusack were perfectly cast as young and old Wilson. they both capture the 2 sides and time periods of Brian Wilson. I give Love & Mercy a big see-it from Dan Skip Allen",

Both the casting & acting was extraordinary. I was unsure at first how john cusack's \"everyday look\" was going to translate into portraying Brian Wilson, but was immediately convinced by his performance . The ONLY thing keeping me from giving 5 stars & telling everyone that this is the greatest musical biopic EVER made is that I feel like the screenplay could have been MUCH better. The lack of character development with his father, carl, dennis & mike love was clearly evident, along with the complete absence of the entire 1970's decade. Obviously, a life story such as Wilson's could be made into an entire mini series, so 120 minutes leaves lots of swiss cheese in your mind, but while many (too many) scenes are showing Dano alone in a room, or cusack staring at Elizabeth banks, I feel like the relationship between his brothers & the band could have been expanded. Other than that, it was very satisfying & well done. In regards to the music, LOTS & LOTS of classics were left out, but the ones that weren't were beautifully done & extremely fun to watch being written & performed.",

    "review": "  I used to work at Pacific Ocean Park (POP) at the same time that the Beach Boys hung out there, so I was certainly a part of that beach culture that they helped to create. After that, I kind of let go of my interest in them and moved on to the British Invasion. I only paid minimal interest in them from then until I got re-married in '99 when my bride wanted to select \"Wouldn't it be nice?\" has her bridal theme song. She was a fan, but knew very little about the band. Last year, we attended a Brian Wilson concert, and I grudgingly went. However, once we saw the concert, we were astounded. Something was different than any rock performance that we had ever seen. Brian was completely passive until the music started then he became alive. Clearly, something was going on that we did not understand. Since that time we have been discovering Brian's story. This film bring authentic clarity to all of it. I left this movie, and the surprise panel with Brian and Melinda, with such an uplifted feeling that I wish that I could share in words. The story could not have been told better nor performed by less of an ensemble. All I can do is enthusiastically recommend this film and wait until we can own our own copy.

I am a huge Brian Wilson fan, and I walked out of the theatre very happy, and I can be tough on movies. They depicted everyone very well from personality to looks (especially Van Dyke Parks on the latter)! They handled Brian being casted by 2 actors very well by bouncing back and forth between the periods in his life so you do not get too attached to one face. They filmed some sessions in Western Studios and did a great mixing job on incorporating the real session tapes in with the actors singing. Although the movie did a great job at capturing a lot of the pressure put on Brian, but they didn't mention Capitol's pressure as much as they should have, but at least they touched on it in a couple of lines. I'm glad they even took a swipe to discredit Brian's \"autobiography\" (which was basically his psychiatrist writing the book and portraying himself as a messiah for the entire second half of it). This movie is DEFINITELY worth seeing and they did a fantastic job at mixing (hope it gets the Oscar!) so definitely try to see it in a theatre with good sound if possible!!",

    "review": "  Love & Mercy brings its protagonist to life in a way that few other biopics do. The schizophrenic Brian Wilson, with all of his troubles and oddities, still feels completely understandable, and that's quite a triumph. This is the kind of movie that's engaging and entertaining because of the character driven drama, not just the stuff that the people in the movie do. Dano and Cusack each craft two sides of the same person, seeming to play off of each other even though they're never seen together. Dano's version is a younger Wilson, at a creative peak and at the start of his mental issues, and Cusack plays the older Wilson, with his issues having taken hold of his life, and a struggling relationship with a new woman. This is the unconventional but extremely affective way that this biopic is told. Dano and Cusack probably share an equal amount of screen time, and this unfolds the character with twice the depth. We come to understand both Wilson's skillfully at the same time as the film switches back and forth. Knowing the man in two states, after seeing the film, feels like the only way to truly know him. I knew almost nothing about this movie, or Brian Wilson before I came into the theater. Because of this, I noticed how Wilson, as well as several other characters in the film, are revealed to us by time. If you didn't know Wilson was schizophrenic before watching, you wouldn't for quite a while into the film. It chooses to reveal its characters like how we get to know people: we see how they behave, and as we spend time with them, understand their struggles and depths. Giamatti's Eugene Landy and Elizabeth Banks's Melinda work in similar ways. Giamatti is a scene stealer as Landy, sometimes very funny, and sometimes not all after his character's motivations are revealed. Banks is excellent at convincing us of her character's emotional connection with Wilson, even though it's a seemingly strange combination. One of the film's great achievements was that I felt that I understood Wilson's schizophrenia so much that to even think of describing him as insane feels completely inappropriate. He was a creative spirit in need of solitude and freedom, and the world, as well as important people in his life, were unable to give that to him. It's extremely rare in a movie to find that level of depth in a mentally unstable character. Audiences can relate to him as artists or creative people, or just people who have too many others trying to pull them in directions away from their own.In the end, we get a clip of the real Brian Wilson singing Love & Mercy, and understand what the song means to him. This is an emotionally satisfying and entertaining movie because of how the film treats and understands its characters. Other biopics can place too much emphasis on the physical achievements of their subjects, but this one knows where the good stuff is and how to access it while avoiding conventions with ease. I think everyone will enjoy this movie and go see it.",

    "review": "  The movie about the young genius behind Pet Sounds, one the greatest albums in the past 50 yrs. Better than I could hoped it would be. Having bought and listened to the album on release this movie made my youth come rushing back. I bought Pet Sounds based on loving the earlier Beach Boys songs but, like Mike Love, was a little taken back at first. Unlike Love, I fell in love with it after about 3 times though. This movie shows how much we may have missed hadn't his; dad, Parks, and Landry messed with him. The movie version of the Pet Sounds studio sessions totally blew me away and I had all I could do to control my emotions watching listening to them. Danno, as the Pet Sounds era Brian, hit it out of the park and deserves a best actor nomination. Danno playing Wilson during the sessions made me 100% believe we we're witnessing the genius first hand of Brian Wilson and the crack under the radar Wrecking Crew studio musicians. Cusack, for me, did a great job of portraying the older Brian but I couldn't quite get past the fact that he doesn't physically resemble Wilson, at all. With lots people likely chomping at the bit to play Wilson you would think they could have found someone else equally talented with more resemblance to Wilson. That for me was the one and only minor flaw to this awesome movie. Bill Pohlad, producer and son of deceased local billionaire & MN Twins owner Carl Pohlad was the subject of a lot of abusive commentary online after the movie was reviewed and highly rated by our local newspaper critic. Lots of jealous people basically saying \"anyone with his money could make this movie\". That's 150% BS! Bill Pohlad did a fantastic loving job of putting us right back in the 60s, 70s and 80s with Brian Wilson and the music that impacted my life and so many others. Loved it! Thanks Brian and Bill!",

The acting and music here, as expected, is fantastic. However, the story and the editing/directing lacked any form of subtlety. It's hard to explain in words, but all the dialogue, and all the visuals were hammering in what you were supposed to be feeling at a particular time. The story is told out in a semi-linear fashion, in that it jumps back from the 80s/90s to the 60s, but each time period is shown in order. It mostly works, although it seemed to me, \"Good Vibrations\" took weeks to record, not the months it actually did. Still, I can't call this bad, and it's worth watching for the performances.",

    "review": "  An amazing journey through the life, relationships and talents of the great Brian Wilson. There should be many Oscar nominations here including 2 best actor, Best Actress, best supporting actor and best Direction and script. In other words a masterpiece of the highest magnitude. The Dual performances of Dano and Cusack make it seamless and impossible to even detect. I know Brian is proud and it is satisfying to say the least to see this tortured Genius given his unanimous respect and admiration. To create this much beauty in these conditions is truly a miracle. Do not miss this one folks!",

We will also see him as an over medicated patient of a greedy doctor out to take him for everything he has. Brian's journey is an interesting and poignant story and the acting is superb. Paul Dano is excellent as the young Brian; John Cusack is equally as good as the older Brian/ Elizabeth Banks gives one of her best performances and proves she is more than just another pretty face. Go see this one, it's very good.",

    "review": "  A very well done bio pic that might disappoint fans going into this thinking they are getting a Beach Boys biopic. It is more about the creative genius of the band Brian Wilson with the other \"boys\" pushed to the side. It is a really great character study of a man's decent into madness caused by creative stress, parental abuse, and in his later years a mid life crisis of sorts. Paul Dano is one of our great young talents blowing me away ever since Little Miss Sunshine and There Will Be Blood and this will go down as one of his best performances along with those titles. John Cusack has been winning me over with this and earlier this year in Maps to the Stars. I haven't been a huge fan of Cusack in the past but I thought he gave the older version of Wilson nice subtle moments and lovely chemistry with Elizabeth Banks who also is having a great year. Banks has always been a charmer and here she gets to use that in a very nice way as Cusack's future wife. Even with those impressive performances, I have to say the stand out performance came from Paul Giamatti. With only about 4 or 5 scenes, he really gets under your skin and gives one of his best performances this decade so far. The costumes and sets are all great judging around time periods and keeping a clear distinction from both periods through the art and camera work. I loved the documentary feel to the recording sessions in the flashbacks but I wish that they didn't film all of the flashbacks like that. That kind of cause a separation in my mind that we were really watching two different movies and it got too in the way sometimes for Dano's performance to breath. Speaking of flashbacks, they were done well to a point. Lots of modern biopics love this new trend of out of place storytelling and flashbacks thrown in at random moments but this one balances them well but it still would have been nice to watch Wilson's character progress into his madness. I really hope this movie's sound design is remembered come award season because it is really interesting and creatively done to represent the mind and madness in Wilson's head plus they really capture the Beach Boys feel with Dano doing his own singing. I don't know if this was just an issue in my theater or if my eyes were deceiving me but the movie looked really dark even in scenes where the whole room was white. Watching trailers and clips on my TV and on my computer make me feel like that was just an issue in my theater but time will tell if that was an actual issue of the movie when it comes out on DVD. I would have liked to see more of the actual Beach Boys collaborations focused upon but it did make some sense for the story this movie wanted to tell and focus on Wilson's life rather than the band's journey. Overall, it is a great acting piece and character study with a few Beach Boys songs thrown in here and there but works. I just hope we will get a Beach Boys band biopic one day to go along with this one. Also, please remind your mom/dad/grandparent/family member that this is not a sing along. Please keep that to the car ride home. Some people in my theater did not get that memo.",

Focusing not only on his demons but genius as well from the early 60's through the mid 80's. Two great performances by Paul Dano as the younger Brian and John Cusack as the middle age Brian. I would not be shocked if each earned a best actor nod come the Academy Awards & wouldn't that be something? Along for the ride in a break-out role is the beautiful Elizabeth Banks who will virtually stop at nothing to save the man she loves. One of the best of 2015!",

However LOVE & MERCY approaches things a bit differently... and it does it very well. John Cusack and Paul Dano deliver strong performances that fit together seamlessly as famed musician Brian Wilson. Rather than focus on the rise to fame, the film takes the path of Brian Wilson struggle with depression, schizophrenia and social anxiety. In doing so, the glitz and glamour fades as we are presented with a very human story few fail to realize is the center of what made The Beach Boys who they are. Money machine, genius, icon, chess piece... It is a brilliant and oft misunderstood life that could have had tragic ends had it not been for a chance at love that changed it all...",

When I first heard that 2 actors were going to portray Brian Wilson, I was skeptical. Now that I've seen it, I realize how wrong I was to doubt the creative brilliance of director Bill Pohland. both Paul Dano and John Cusack give amazingly spot on portrayals of Brian Wilson. Also giving great performances were Paul Giamatti as Eugene Landy and Elizabeth Banks as Melinda Ledbetter. I know that the film has been edited a bit from it's original debut at the Toronto International Film Festival last year or so I believe. I am very satisfied with the cut I saw.

But by 3/4 thru it..i got the point of it that this was Brian WIlson's story his genius and his trials not so much the group in itself.. I really realized by the film how much Wilson put into his sound his brilliance in having multiple sounds and his tireless quest for perfection. Again..it felt lacking as to his background ..his dad, how his brothers fit in ..how he ended up in a bed for almost 3 yrs ..how he grew huge in gouging himself..lots missing..but there was enough going on mentally that you did not need all those details..and i was blown away by the female who saved him ..but i had to ask why had no one intervened who cared before her.. so again..questions and voids. The actor playing the young brian was awesome..wasn't so impressed by Cusack..just ok. So i think i all in all this was haunting and made me want to know more about Brian Wilson's life story and give him more respect as i was not into the cali surfer type music in my youth.",

Love and Mercy is a film as beautiful and imaginative in its storytelling as the music. Pohlad, as the director of only his second feature, does an assured and ambitious job of dramatic condensation while keeping his ear to the studio door and our minds on the greatness of the music. Shown working feverishly on Pet Sounds or extricating himself from Dr. Landy, the film does justice to Brian's spirit and creativity in a way that is artistic My prediction is that this is nominated for a best picture, best director and best screenplay Oscars in 2016.",
