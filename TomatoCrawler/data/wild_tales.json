    "review": "  Mild Tales. I was expecting an edge-of-the-seat stuff, but the movie failed to fulfill that expectation. It's quite mediocre and predictable for most of the part. The shock value, which I feel inevitable for such movie, was negligible. The twists are meaningless as they're pretty predictable to be a twist in its real sense, thereby adding to the dissatisfaction. But since the stories, excluding the last one, weren't a drag and overall it was about average (having okay performances, not extremely boring, etc.), I decided to give it such a fine rating.",

    "review": "  While it is certainly true that movies have been accused and not without good cause of misleading audiences, \"Wild Tales\" delivers on its promise with its six short movies about revenge that while wickedly fun also do so with more than the normal amount of ambiguity. That starts off with perhaps the best pre-credits sequence ever that also makes a great case for never getting on another airplane. Unless I'm mistaken, there is not a gun in the entire movie. Instead, there are cars, with three of the segments being centered around them, an Audi, Chevy and BMW respectively. For the record, that's not product placement. Rather, it represents different economic strata of society.On the other hand, maybe the fourth and fifth segments do not work as well as the rest. But the fourth one has the great Ricardo Darin in it, so there's that. And while I just saw the latter scenario play out again on a television series, there are still a couple of twists to keep this version fresh.And then \"Wild Tales\" ends on an up note with a wild and frenzied wedding reception that hinges on a massive dose of jealousy.",

    "review": "  DON'T CRY FOR ME, ANTOLOG�A - My Review of WILD TALES (4 Stars)Argentina's Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominee for 2014 is an audacious, edgy, hilarious collection of 6 short films by writer/director Dami�n Szifron called WILD TALES. While none are directly linked to each other, this group of short stories seems to share similar themes of rage and revenge and of people caught during their most stressful moments. Its opening credits alone, a series of wildlife stills indicates we're about to experience behavior of the basest levels. We follow people on a plane, in a diner, on the road, at a towing facility, after an accidental hit & run, and at the world's most insane wedding reception ever and I spent a good half of the time with my hand over my mouth trying to suppress either laughter or an \"Oh no they didn't!\". It's almost impossible to discuss this film without mild spoilers, but I'll do my best not to reveal anything too specifically.The film opens with its shortest tale, a group of passengers on board a plane who quickly discover something diabolical is afoot. It ends with a gasp-inducing freeze frame you won't soon forget. It deftly sets the stage for the sick and twisted stories to follow, all displaying varying degrees of anger at the world and the terrible luck so many suffer. Shot with great muscularity by cinematographer Javier Julia, and infused with a wonderful nihilistic sensibility, each segment has its own style, and I felt like I was experiencing a great Coen Brothers film at every assured turn. In a secluded diner on a rainy night, a server finds her sole customer to be an arch enemy from her past. Goaded on by her increasingly sadistic co-worker (memorably and hilariously played by Rita Cortese), this revenge fantasy simultaneously raises the dramatic stakes while playing off our distaste for awful, entitled customers and slow-moving service people. I loved how quickly one character wanted to murder another simply based on another person's recounting of past events, a perfect encapsulation of our too-quick-to-judge, don't believe everything you read on Facebook culture. From there we're racing along a desert road as a handsome, well-to-do driver (Leonardo Sbaraglia, who first came to my attention in the film BURNT MONEY) gets stuck behind a slow-moving and weaving vehicle. His ill-advised choice to yell at the man leads to a face-off which redefines taking things too far even by Tex Avery standards. Imagine Steven Spielberg's DUEL cranked up to mythical proportions. It's in this segment where every single shot meant something, with the camera put in just the right place, and the editing and writing ratcheting up the tension with perfect, inevitable ease. Clearly final shots mean something to Szifron, and it's in this story where his last moment adds an extra, juicy layer to the storytelling. Next, one of Argentina's most famous actors, Ricardo Dar�n (THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES), expertly mines every moment of his put-upon sad sack who naively takes on the system after getting towed. What makes this segment sing is the fact that his character is set-up as a man addicted to causing drama. I found my loyalties shifting constantly from his p.o.v. to those of the bureaucrats he torments. Again, every moment counts, from the initial set-up at a construction site to its homage to TAXI DRIVER. The film continues with an unfortunate hit-and-run accident perpetrated by the son of a wealthy man (a great slow-burn by Oscar Mart�nez), who keeps making one ill-advised decision after another in an attempt to make the situation go away. This story exposes the never-ending levels of corruption and greed, placing a sad, lower class patsy into the mix (a terrific Germ�n de Silva) to remind us how stuck the 99% often feel in their lives. Knowing full well that no good can come from this situation, Szifron ends this tale with abrupt and off-camera sounds, putting just the right capper on its hopelessness. Finally, a wedding reception from hell ends the film on a funny yet disturbing note as a cheating groom played by Diego Gentile (clearly Argentina's answer to Bradley Cooper) faces off against his distraught bride (Erica Rivas, explosively going past any semblance of sanity). Their performances are electric, and I wasn't surprised to discover that nearly the entire cast received nominations from Argentina's version of the Oscars. The jealously and rage of our newlyweds keeps boiling over, ending (here we are again with Szifron's mastery of final shots) on an image combining sex and messiness. It's a perfect way to summarize the experience of this thoroughly entertaining, not-to-be-missed film.",

I must say I'm not a big fan of anthology films (also not a fan of reading short stories, though I love reading books), but Wild Tales is one of the very rare ones that I thought was really good. One of the major reasons most anthology films don't work for me is that most of the time, even if there's a few good sequences, there's usually one or two weaker stories that are there to just pad the time. Wild Tales luckily isn't like that, while one or two of the stories may feel \"lesser\" than the others, they are still good on their own and because of either runtime or subject they just may feel a little slighter.",

    "review": "  The daily lives of any person in this world is filled with failures, success good times, bad times, and crazy times. This could be the easy way to explain the film Dami�n Szifr�n \"Wild Tales\". Following the footsteps of famous directors like Robert Altman with Short Cuts and Paris, je t'aime with the directors: Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen, Walters Salles, Alfonzo Cuar�n, Wes Crave and Alexander Payne.Wild Tales is a collection of 6 short films compiled in a single film. Every stories doesn't have a particular connection from each other, but the relationship of success, failure, death, revenge, love and life, is present and should be the crucial link from each tale that you see on film.With Argentinian all stars such as Ricardo Dar�n (The Secret in Their Eyes and Nine Queens) Dar�o Grandinetti ( The Dark side of the heart) Leonardo Sbaraglia (Cenizas del Paraiso) is just a few of the actors who bring to life the stories: -Pasternak the story of a disappointed human being who finds the revenge by get rid of everyone who hurt him. -The Rats The story of a waitress revenge against the responsible of her family demise. -The Strongest The story of two drivers who clash till the end to see who is the bravest.-Little Bomb the story of a explosive specialist haunting unfairness in the daily life system.-The Proposal: A hit and run will turn into a greedy fight for money.-Until death do us part a wedding turn into a bloody warThere is no much to say about this film, is masterful with a very dark humor and realistic situations that appeal to everyone who wanted to fight the system and find meaning to daily conflicts in daily life.Pedro Almodovar produce this instant classic, Gustavo Santaloalla delivers a beautiful score and Javier Juli� create a wonderful cinematography inspired in the look of several films.",

    "review": "  Argentina's submission for the Best Foreign Language film Oscar race lives up to its title. This wicked and funny farce about revenge and the extremes of human behavior is fierce and ferocious. Writer-director Damian Szifron has not made one single film. Wild Tales is six films, all stitched together under one title. Some audiences may not be able to handle it. Oh well.Take the opening vignette, 'Pasternak', set on a jet in which the passengers all realize they've wronged the same man, named Pasternak, in one way or another. No fair spoiling the surprise, but it's a story as gonzo-crazy as anything ever dreamed up by Pedro Almodovar, who serves as a co-producer.Things get darker in 'The Rats' where a waitress (Julietta Zylberberg) finds herself serving the criminal who drove her father to suicide. In 'Road To Hell', a stuffy driver insults a redneck. And then there's 'Bombita' starring Ricardo Darin, Argentina's biggest star, is a demolition engineer who must contend with a towing service and the DMV. It's a lot more riveting and wild than it sounds.'The Deal' has fewer laughs, a story in which a rich man attempts to pay off a gardener to take the fall for his hit-and-run on his own bratty son. But it's the final story that really ignites. That would be 'Till Death Do Us Part', set at a Jewish wedding where the bride (Erica Rivas, amazing) takes revenge on her cheating groom (Diego Gentile), turning the whole party into a gladiator match. You'll be laughing till it hurts, which is of course the point. Filmmaking is seldom such a breath of fresh air like Wild Tales.",

    "review": "  Wild is the right word for this anthology of savage scenes from contemporary life. It takes place in Argentina, but with the exception of a few logistical references and the language, these tales could occur in New York, London, Madrid, nearly anyplace where people are angry at their loss of control. This is an angry film disguised as a comedy, very dark comedy that makes you laugh while squirming at the violence, rudeness, injustice, pride -- well, there you have it, the seven deadly sins. Produced by Pedro Almodovar and his brother, it's easy to see the lineage, especially in Szifron's visual style and use of music, both of which contribute to the joyride rush of these stories.",

The shock value, which I feel inevitable for such movie, was negligible. The twists are meaningless as they're pretty predictable to be a twist in its real sense, thereby adding to the dissatisfaction. But since the stories, excluding the last one, weren't a drag and overall it was about average (having okay performances, not extremely boring, etc.), I decided to give it such a fine rating.",

    "review": "  \"Wild Tales\" is the raucous movie of the winter season and, it's barely a movie. The premise of the movie is six short stories, each darker than the last, about injustice, poverty, and violence that grip much of the world. Each story is simple: one is a wedding, one is a business trip, and one is even a visit to a local diner. And each is immensely bloody, like a long, chopped up spaghetti western. \"Wild Tales\" is massively funny, yet scary, all at the same time. It was acted beautifully and, despite having to read subtitles, it was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen this year.",

    "review": "  To fit the span of a character's entire story is no mean achievement; to do so for six characters and take in a swathe of tumultuous Argentinean culture while you're about it, and taking in the themes of despair and revenge for kicks is just showing off. Written from the confines of his bathtub, Dami�n Szifr�n wove the demented, wickedly dark tales of six people's overdramatic lashings out against those who wronged them. Barring the shared themes, there is no narrative link between the six stories, Szifron quite literally spliced together six short films and called it a day. He could've easily coasted on the coattails of the unique structure and made something admirable, but he injected every atom of black humor and twisted sociological expose that the script could contain without imploding, and hired what seems like every great actor in Argentina. As a result, each story is so deliciously acidic, you simultaneously don't want the chapter your watching to end, yet can't wait for the next one to start",

I must say I'm not a big fan of anthology films (also not a fan of reading short stories, though I love reading books), but Wild Tales is one of the very rare ones that I thought was really good. One of the major reasons most anthology films don't work for me is that most of the time, even if there's a few good sequences, there's usually one or two weaker stories that are there to just pad the time. Wild Tales luckily isn't like that, while one or two of the stories may feel \"lesser\" than the others, they are still good on their own and because of either runtime or subject they just may feel a little slighter.",

    "review": "  With the name of Pedro Almodovar tagged to the film, Wild Tales instantly made it clear that talented people were involved in the production.Of all the films to be nominated for the 2014 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film, Wild Tales proves to be best option on the list. I've never seen an anthology film with quite as many contrasting stories that all maintain such striking dramtatic strength yet little minimal relevance to each other. The only thing consistent over the course of the narratives in Wild Tales is the general mood of things as there is always a sense of tenacious drama with underlying dark humour. I found myself consistently embracing the intense drama presented by the stories and laughing pretty hard as well, meaning that Wild Tales was indeed an extremely powerful as an experience. This is easy to understand from the first moment in the film where Wild Tales unveils one of the most unconventional short stories I've ever seen depicted on screen. That was the first big surprise of the film, and from there on they just kept coming.The only down point for the film would be the third story in the anthology entitled \"The Strongest\" which chronicles two men fighting frantically over a masculine dispute of agression in driving. It's not a bad segment, it's just overly simplistic and lacks the entertaining edge and characters that the rest of them maintain. This is because the segment is bereft of character and is constructed solely out of deadpan slapstick comedy in a heavily western setting and does not have that much of a story, making it a rather slow and long stretch for a story which does not have much to substantiate it. Luckily the film is an anthology film which means it has more stories that come after it instead of following the blank style of this one segment for the entire feature.And also, it gets it out of the way soon into the film proceeds back to better narratives.With the exception of The Strongest, each narrative in Wild Tales contains strong characters who are all scripted to be of extensive levels of depth. Nobody is really an archetype, and every single character is of absolute importance to their respective stories which means that the extensive cast of the film really need to dedicate themselves. There is not a single cast member who falters as all the performances are rock solid and captivating, in particular the efforts of Ricardo Darin whose restrained yet occasionally striking dramatic efforts give a thoroughly sympathetic protagonist to the story \"Little Bomb\" while Erica Rivas' beautiful ability to capture an innocent and beautiful bride driven insane by her husband's infidelity in \"Until Death Do Us Part\" is as explosive as the bomb from Little Bomb. However, in a case where The Strongest is not an exception, every single story in Wild Tales is rich with tone. As well as dramatic strength and dark humour, the narratives in Wild Tales work out a sense of social commentary to make about edgy topics and social situations which are approached in a manner so blunt by director Damian Szifron that there is nothing to hide. The viewer is forced to confront the brutal reality of these situations and question the world around them as a means of establishing their stance on the events that occur. The screenplay in Wild Tales is of absolute brilliance because the stories are so intriguing, the characters are so deep and the language is so insightful. But most importantly, the film is the furthest things from predictable. There is no telling what could come next, and that makes the intense experience of the film exciting because the unpredictability in Wild Tales ensures that it lives up to the promises presented by its title. The stories develop at their own natural pace which means the experience is a slow one, but I treasured every second of the film with the exception of The Strongest which I remain somewhat indifferent to. And yet even though there is so much complicated subtext in the themes of the film, the stories are simple on the surface which means they are easy to understand while the extent that the viewer is willing to think about them proves to be the source of thought provocation. And the entire time, there is always a sense of style in the film. The narratives are largely about how grim our world is in various fashions, and this feeling is ultimately reflected through the style of Wild Tales as the colour scheme is rather monochromatic. It presents a grim feel to the story which matches the intense atmosphere, and the cinematography always matches the drama through either capturing everything up close with claustrophobic intensity or from a distance to show just how empty the cold and dark world around the characters truly is. The style of the film is a subtle element, and yet it captures the manic mood of the story very nicely. Lastly, the film is made more atmospheric by its use of sound. The rare use of diegetic music in Wild Tales adds tension to it, but most of the time the drama is flourishing so much that the intensity develops when there is just silence and occasional subtle sound effects. The sound, or lack thereof in Wild Tales is truly an understated yet powerful dramatic asset to the success of the film, and it just goes to show how well the story develops its drama on its own and doesn't need Hollywood dramatization conventions to levate it any further.So Wild Tales is a brilliantly written collection of stories with tenacious directorial work from Damian Szifron who grips the dark comedy and intense drama of the story all while the cast deliver performances as strong as the characters given to them.",

My personal favorite is the last one set in a lavish wedding. It is difficult to find fault with anything about this movie. My reason for not fully enjoying this unique film is it left me unsatisfied. Each story is so well made, I think I would have enjoyed it more if had been one Wild Tale instead several short ones. At least three of the tales had enough substance to have been developed into a feature length film. But that is not the point Of Szifron's film. He is interested in creating a film that hints at societal/cultural satire, but is fully vested in exploring how \"normal\" people can be pushed to the brink of insanity when realty takes a sharp and unexpected turn. Sometimes those turns are slower -- pressure builds. Other times, it assaults the characters all at once. I get it. I just wanted more.",

    "review": "  Look, this is loads of fun, no time is wasted in the storytelling, and it makes quite a few pointed, satirical points about modern society, corruption, class and gender warfare, etc. plus it displays a free ranging willingness to get back on those who deserve it, particularly those classes who cheat and oppress society. It is good entertainment, but the technique weakens when the characters and stories do. The \"gay\" corpses were a bit trite. The father would have been better off stopping at his second-last negotiating position. The wedding should have ended in violence. Why do these filmmakers, who are so au fait with rage and retribution, look for resolution and even a happy ending? Granted that is what sells films. But this package was better as a dark comedy, so long as the farce continued, and when that was drawn back into a downbeat, it lost its power. Someone said that Tarantino should learn from this film - he knows better how to drive the violence to its destination. But don't let that deter you. Not many films are prepared to go as far as this; and it is far more political than anything he has done. It joins an increasing chorus of people having had it up to here. Plenty of flesh on the bone; plenty of material for discussion over a plate of something piquant.",

    "review": "  This is one of the best anthology films in recent memory. Hell, it might be one of the best anthology films that has ever been made. Part of the problem, particularly in a lot of recent anthology films, is that it's a collaboration between different filmmakers ala ABCs Of Death, the VHS series, among others. And I don't think there's a problem with that at all, but that's where a lot of the inconsistency in quality comes in. You bring in more chefs to the kitchen and the higher the chances are you get an ingredient that just doesn't mix. VHS: Viral proved this. Though, to be fair, the quality of the shorts themselves were considerably lower than both films in that series, though there was one excellent short in there. I think this film's strength lies in the fact that, despite it being various stories of different people from different societal backgrounds, there's only one person handling the creative aspect of it. While they're all very different shorts, ranging from a flight attendant poisoning the pilot and co-pilot of a plane that's carrying all the people who treated him negatively during his life and forcing it to crash, to a very extreme example of road rage, to poisoning the man who forced a waitress' father's suicide, to being fed up with the injustices of the government, extortion and blackmail and, finally, a wedding from hell. All very different types of stories, but all offering up their own little slice of dark and twisted entertainment. You cannot say this about a lot of anthology films, but every segment is, at worst, good. And more than several of them are actually really fucking great. The first segment, with the plane crash is short and to the point, but absolutely excellent. The second short, the one in the diner, is probably the 'weakest' of them all. This isn't a complaint in the least, as this is one also really fucking good, but it just doesn't reach the levels of insanity the other segments reached. The third short, the one about the road rage, is another excellent short. The fourth one, the one about the car being towed away is probably my personal favorite. It just has a great narrative with an incredibly satisfying conclusion. It's probably the one that most people will relate to, since it focuses more on the little bullshit ways the government tries to fuck you over. The fifth one, about the blackmail, is also a really good one. It's probably, out of all of them, the best written and the best acted. Of course, when your cast is as stacked as this film is, any victory in terms of acting quality is won by inches and not by miles, but the penultimate one, still, in my mind, is the best in terms of quality. The wedding from hell, which is the last short, starts off a little slowly but, once again, builds to an excellent conclusion about the ups and downs a new married couple faces during their own wedding. Fuck me sideways, this film is fantastic. It's ridiculously funny, in a dark and twisted way of course. I cannot say enough good about this film. I don't think I can honestly do this film justice. It's something that has to be seen. It's one of the few anthology films that I can say is entertaining from beginning to end, instead of it hitting peaks and valleys. Incredible anthology, incredible film. I absolutely loved this. Highly recommended.",

Still, this is a case where 'questionably ended' underscores the quality of what comes before. The bleak yet undeniably funny tone brings to mind a less whimsical Tim Burton - in a damn good way.",

Wild Tales, is a package of 6 short films which are dark and explosive comedies. All of them has the theme of revenge strikingly common and each one of them is unique and funny in its own way. Each one of them puts forth wild yet realistic situations. The first short story is the shortest of them and is shown pre-credits.Its story of a psych who is not even seen on the screen who makes revenge plan which ends on a bang giving us an overly wild ending. The second film slightly more dark and longer, will make you think before deciding what is right and what is wrong. Third one even longer, is my favorite alongside the fourth. Its violent and brutally hilarious with explosive ending(literally). The fourth one sheds light on realistic situation of a common man troubled by the abusive government system. Another explosion in the climax(again literally)! The fifth slightly less on humor quotient but portrays the human characteristic of greed perfectly. Its darker and has a shocking finale! Th last one, longest and wildest of them all will take you to one of the craziest weddings you have ever seen. Beneath its madness it subtly touches upon the issues of trust and betrayals in human relations.Besides the common notion of revenge and letting oneself lose control in rage, all these tales also focus on how tiniest of our actions can lead to monstrous consequences. The comedy is satirical and dark still its outright hilarious in many scenes. There are many actors (each story has different cast), can't highlight anyone as most of them have done a good job. Director Damian Szifron executes all the ridiculous madness and explosive twists with sheer brilliance leaving dazed at the end of each story. The soundtrack is also quirky and beautiful.The two hours fly away like a breeze. Even if you don't understand the language you will be so invested that after sometime you won't even realize that you are watching a Non- English film. Highly enjoyable!RATING: [4/5]",

    "review": "  Truth is stranger than fiction. Or so they say. \"Wild Tales\" (R, 2:02) is complete fiction, but is strange enough to compete with any truth you may have seen portrayed on film. Still, the word \"strange\" doesn't adequately describe the things that happen in this movie. \"Wild\" really is the best adjective for the film's content. The wildest part of the whole thing is that anything and everything portrayed on the screen could actually happen. In fact, some of it did. The film's opening scenes depict a scenario that is uncomfortably similar to an infamous real-life tragedy that took place in early 2015. \"Too soon,\" is the phrase I heard one woman whisper to her companion after the movie's opening sequence. It may seem that way, but this film was released in Argentina and shown at several film festivals around the world well before the tragedy to which I am referring. This just goes to show the plausibility, if not the truth, behind the stories in this film. Yes, that's \"stories\" - plural.\"Wild Tales\" is an anthology of six stories with no relation to each other, except that they all portray violent revenge. I think it's also worth noting that, on the Rotten Tomatoes website, this film received a positive rating of over 90% of critics AND moviegoers - and lead to Argentina being represented in the 2014-2015 Oscar race for Best Foreign Language Film. (The movie's Spanish language title is \"Relatos salvajes\".) Yes, that means hearing the dialog in Spanish and reading it in English, but these six tales are wild enough that most people probably won't mind the subtitles:A group of seemingly unrelated people gathered together in one place discover that they have something in common. Is it a cosmic-level coincidence or is there something else going on?A waitress in a diner is forced to serve a gangster whose actions basically destroyed the waitress' family and he doesn't even recognize her. Upon hearing her story, the cook suggests putting rat poison in the man's food, but can the waitress bring herself to be that ruthless?Then, a road rage incident near a bridge on a deserted stretch of road escalates to disgusting and dangerous levels and neither driver gets away unscathed. Karma can really be a bitch!An ordinary man (who happens to have an extraordinarily dangerous occupation) has his car towed while picking up his daughter's birthday cake. This frustrating situation sets off a chain of events that ruins the man's life. He falls down so far that he has nothing to lose by taking his revenge on a corrupt and uncaring system.When the son of a rich man is involved in a hit-and-run, the rich man offers to pay his groundskeeper to take the rap. The groundskeeper agrees, but enacting this plan is not nearly as simple as it sounds and this story ends in a way none of the players expected.An attractive young couple are enjoying their wedding reception when the bride makes a discovery that shakes her to her core. She chooses the bridal dance as the time to tell her new husband what she has learned. Without spilling the specifics, I can say that all this leads to a dramatic rooftop scene, tension and tempers rising to a fever pitch, blood on the bride's dress, paramedics treating multiple people with a variety of conditions and a cutting-the-cake scene that you won't soon forget. Suffice it to say that producers Pedro and Agust�n Almod�var and writer/director Dami�n Szifron saved the wildest (and possibly the best) wild tale for last. In \"Wild Tales\", you get a series of revenge fantasies that may make you feel guilty for allowing them to entertain you. But it will probably be a pleasurable guilt. It's the kind of movie that makes you think, \"I can't believe they did that,\" immediately followed by, \"I wonder if I would do that.\" Even with real-world events tinging the first story with an unintended pathos, this film gives us six tales that represent the best in dark comedy. The situations showcased are generally relatable and seem uncomfortably possible. The many movies I've seen over the years have left me with just about every conceivable emotion upon leaving the theater, but this is the first one that left me feeling... naughty. For lack of a better word, I felt naughty for secretly rooting for people doing bad things in this movie - and for enjoying the outcome of each story as much as I did. I've never seen a movie like this before, never felt the way this movie made me feel and never enjoyed dark comedy so much. This is going to make me feel naughty all over again, but I'm giving \"Wild Tales\" an \"A\". I'm sorry. No, I'm not.",

    "review": "  This gleefully amoral black comedy from Argentina is probably the best anthology film ever made. Six short stories - each running about twenty minutes - show characters in contemporary Argentina overcome by revenge and retribution. Some stories work better than others, but there are no lulls or uneven segments, and a few could be short form classics. It's also beneficial to have one filmmaker preside over the material. Writer-director Damian Szifron's raucous humor and exuberant energy mark him as a major international filmmaker. Each episode takes a simple conflict that builds into a comic opera of vengeance. In the prologue, \"Pasternak,\" a model chats with fellow passengers and discovers everyone on the flight wronged her ex-boyfriend, and the cockpit is locked. \"The Rats,\" features a waitress serving a customer whose actions led her father to suicide; she wants revenge but is morally torn, so the cook suggests rat poison. In \"Road to Hell,\" a patrician man and a proletariat man turn road rage into a Road Runner cartoon as if conceived by Rod Serling. \"Bombita\" is about a demolitions expert confronted by government bureaucracy over parking violations that boils over. \"The Deal,\" involves a hit-and-run accident that leads to bribery and extortion among the accused's father, gardener, attorney, and prosecutor that results in an ironic, if predictable, resolution. The final story, \"'Till Death Us Do Part,\" is the best. It begins as a celebratory wedding reception until the bride discovers the groom had an affair with a guest. The bride turns the tables on the groom until the reception becomes a comic orgy of marital turmoil that ends in libidinal bliss. As the bride, Erica Rivas gives an expansive comic performance of hysteria that is peerless. The festival audience I saw this with was rapturous. Pedro Almodovar is one of the producers. With Ricardo Darin, Oscar Martinez, Leonardo Sbaraglia, Rita Cortese, Julieta Zylberberg, Dario Grandinetti. In Spanish with English subtitles.",

This film will have you laughing wildly at the most inappropriate parts. Where bombs are going off, people are attacking each other, among other horrible deeds. It then makes you question why you are laughing? Each story stands by itself. They aren't connected in any way. And I guarantee you will find yourself enjoying this dark comedy in spite of the horror on the screen. Seek this one out and if you have a block on foreign films, this is one worth seeing.

    "review": "  \"Wild Tales\" is a montage of six individual short stories, all set in Argentina, with the common theme of \"revenge\". The first, and shortest, of the tales, takes place in the cabin of a commercial jetliner. It begins benignly enough, but by the time it reaches its \"holy crap\" resolution, the tone is set for the rest of the film.The stories are both violent and darkly funny, starting with believable situations and extending them bit by bit into absurdity. My favorite is about a man who believes his car was unfairly towed. Another features a jealous bride. A third involves a serious case of road rage.The road rage story reminds me of a recurring \"Family Guy\" sketch in which Peter has long, drawn-out death matches with a giant chicken. And like the chicken-fight sketches, though I was somewhat amused by the over-the-top escalation of violence, I was also more than ready for it to end before it actually did. That's part of the beauty of the film's short story format. Just when you start to tire of one bit, it's on to the next. Despite all of the violence, it's interesting to note that none of the characters ever uses a gun. People are stabbed, poisoned, strangled, hit on the head with blunt objects, and flung into mirrors. Fire extinguishers are used to bludgeon, blind, and break glass. There are several big explosions. But not a single bullet is ever fired.Most of the characters in this film are in uncomfortable situations, and watching them made ME feel uncomfortable also. This is entertainment at its squirmiest. And though it's not always easy to watch, I feel like I definitely got my money's worth.",

I can't really give this film a proper review, because it's like having 5 absurd films in one. So I'll give it a smaller review. All of the stories are crazy and hilarious in their own ways. Especially one involving a plane and one involving road rage. The actors are all excellent and surprisingly give fantastic performances. The directing and cinematography are unique and top-notch. The writing is great and often hilarious. Obviously some stories are better than others, but they are all fun and \"wild\". The pace is constantly fast and the movie passes by quickly. The musical score and set design are also all perfect. The only complaint I have with Wild Tales is that there was one specific story that I didn't have as much fun with as the others. It felt out of place and wasn't very funny. Other than that, Wild Tales is the funniest and craziest movie I've seen in a while. It is clever, unique and had me dying of laughter frequently.

    "review": "  Dami�n Szifron's Wild Tales is a six film anthology connected through the underlying insanity of the human race. One its most remarkable achievements is that it feels like one film, even though it isn't. It's darkly funny with superbly crafted dialogue and unpredictable story. A wild ride, and more.It might not be worth going into each individual story. I found it fun not knowing exactly what to expect, but with each, you can expect to be surprised. Each story seems to start with characters pretending to be regular members of society, and this mask tears away as the story develops tension and eventually implodes or explodes on itself; often both. The movie has a damn clever screenplay that deserved more Oscar consideration last year. The dialogue is sharp and witty, with tons of purposeful black comedy. The characters all feel dimensional despite the short running time of the stories. Even when a character doesn't have a ton of personality, they never succumb to stereotypes and are played by the wonderful cast with hidden depth. When there seems to be a villain or hero in a story, Szifron blurs this line. The protagonists and antagonists in each film are brilliantly given equal weight, and we understand both sides. This gets across the idea that everybody in the film is crazy in some way or another. The ensemble cast is excellent here. The actors nail Szifron's sometimes complicated tone, where the characters need to feel realistic, take themselves seriously, and still be funny. There is not a weak link in the cast, just as there is no weak link in the stories. Each short feels perfectly placed and compliments its surrounding shorts, with drama taking over a bit in a welcome way by the fifth story. The shorts have lots of variety in both character and story, and feel connected and progressive in structure and theme. The final short ends as a celebration of all the craziness before it, embracing the inner animal in us all.Szifron's direction is just stylish enough and tonally precise. Some individual shots fit impressively well, like the final shot of the first film, which I won't spoil, but it's incredible.The movie's a whole lot of fun and I think anyone will enjoy it. Fans of Tarantino or Almodovar in particular may find pleasure, but even if you hate those guys, you'll still like Wild Tales because it's a work of its own. It's a romp, for sure, but it's unexpectedly more. Think of the title sequence, which is an African safari slideshow of animals. That's what the movie is. It's a wild safari with humans on display.",

Damian Szifron is the next big thing. How this film didn't win the Oscar for Best Foreign Film is a mystery, when it should have been nominated for Best Picture, period. There is not one dull moment. The greatest star, in my opinion, is the superb soundtrack. Not to be missed on the big screen. Who would have thought that such a great film would come from Argentina. The acting is extraordinary. The stories mind-blowingly effective and powerful. A work of genius, if there ever was one. Bravo to all involved. This should have been a HUGE hit in the US, but for some reason it didn't get the attention it deserves. But who cares. I've never seen anything quite like it. The road rage scene is one of the greatest sequences ever created and put on film. But all five main stories are riveting beyond all expectation.",

It's basically a series of six shorts (some longer than others) - the road rage episode is by far and away this best, and the opening plane crash film feels eerily uncomfortable in the light of the German Wings crash. Personally, I would have enjoyed a bit of plot invention that connected the episodes, either through cross over characters or references, to give the whole thing a bit more cohesion - having said that, it's still perfectly wicked at times.",

There is wonderful variety in these stories. Some grow from tiny beginnings and grow out of all proportion - a driver blocked on the road, a bride jealous of an old flame - while some start with a bang like the young hit and run driver confessing to his parent - but they all follow an inexorable and terrible inner logic which draws you in. This mostly leads to tragedy, but not always, so that the film is satisfyingly free of moralising - it just portrays human emotion at its rawest and most telling.",

    "review": "  This movie lives up to its name. Wild is just one word to describe this film that is sort of a collection of short films and many of the shorts were better than the nominees for Best Short Film this year. To break them down individually, the opening short takes place on a plane and sets the tone for this movie beautifully that it is going to be odd, crazy, and in a sick way funny. The second short is one of the strongest following a waitress that recognizes a mobster and plots his demise with a fry cook. The third is probably the best in my opinion showing the consequences of being an asshole on the road. It's brutal but really jaw dropping in a good way. The fourth short goes on for a little to long about a regular man's frustration with the traffic laws in his town and his whole life crumbling just for sticking it to the man but it is still solid. The fifth one was the problematic one. Not that it was bad or anything it just didn't fit the overall tone of this film. It didn't have any menacing or sick humor to it it was full drama. The final short ends this movie with a great bang (literally actually) following the events of a happy new couple and the gradual decline of a marriage in only minutes. The performances that stood out the most were the fry cook from 2, the man in the suit in 3, and the bride in 6. I see why this movie was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars and I also see why people think it should have won (I do really like Ida but I actually do think this one was the movie that struck out at me the most). This is a great time and I was worried a little at the beginning but once this movie starts showing you its tone, you'll be in for the ride and have the time of your life. Definitely seek this one out.",

That starts off with perhaps the best pre-credits sequence ever that also makes a great case for never getting on another airplane. Unless I'm mistaken, there is not a gun in the entire movie. Instead, there are cars, with three of the segments being centered around them, an Audi, Chevy and BMW respectively. For the record, that's not product placement. Rather, it represents different economic strata of society.On the other hand, maybe the fourth and fifth segments do not work as well as the rest. But the fourth one has the great Ricardo Darin in it, so there's that. And while I just saw the latter scenario play out again on a television series, there are still a couple of twists to keep this version fresh.And then \"Wild Tales\" ends on an up note with a wild and frenzied wedding reception that hinges on a massive dose of jealousy.",

It's very intelligent and there are so many incredible things happening that you cannot keep your eyes off the screen. This is an Argentine movie and I was very concerned it was going to be your typical intellectual, overly talkative psychotic drama going on in Buenos Aires. This is nothing like that. It is certainly a Latin American movie as there's plenty of corruption, absurdity and impunity. Most of what happens in this movie could have happened in Mexico or Brazil. The film is a series of short stories that are based on situations that are completely viable in Argentina. The reactions and the outcomes are not and that is what makes this film great. Wild Tales is a genuinely great movie that everyone that loves cinema should watch.",

    "review": "  DON'T CRY FOR ME, ANTOLOG�A - My Review of WILD TALES (4 Stars)Argentina's Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominee for 2014 is an audacious, edgy, hilarious collection of 6 short films by writer/director Dami�n Szifron called WILD TALES. While none are directly linked to each other, this group of short stories seems to share similar themes of rage and revenge and of people caught during their most stressful moments. Its opening credits alone, a series of wildlife stills indicates we're about to experience behavior of the basest levels. We follow people on a plane, in a diner, on the road, at a towing facility, after an accidental hit & run, and at the world's most insane wedding reception ever and I spent a good half of the time with my hand over my mouth trying to suppress either laughter or an \"Oh no they didn't!\". It's almost impossible to discuss this film without mild spoilers, but I'll do my best not to reveal anything too specifically.The film opens with its shortest tale, a group of passengers on board a plane who quickly discover something diabolical is afoot. It ends with a gasp-inducing freeze frame you won't soon forget. It deftly sets the stage for the sick and twisted stories to follow, all displaying varying degrees of anger at the world and the terrible luck so many suffer. Shot with great muscularity by cinematographer Javier Julia, and infused with a wonderful nihilistic sensibility, each segment has its own style, and I felt like I was experiencing a great Coen Brothers film at every assured turn. In a secluded diner on a rainy night, a server finds her sole customer to be an arch enemy from her past. Goaded on by her increasingly sadistic co-worker (memorably and hilariously played by Rita Cortese), this revenge fantasy simultaneously raises the dramatic stakes while playing off our distaste for awful, entitled customers and slow-moving service people. I loved how quickly one character wanted to murder another simply based on another person's recounting of past events, a perfect encapsulation of our too-quick-to-judge, don't believe everything you read on Facebook culture. From there we're racing along a desert road as a handsome, well-to-do driver (Leonardo Sbaraglia, who first came to my attention in the film BURNT MONEY) gets stuck behind a slow-moving and weaving vehicle. His ill-advised choice to yell at the man leads to a face-off which redefines taking things too far even by Tex Avery standards. Imagine Steven Spielberg's DUEL cranked up to mythical proportions. It's in this segment where every single shot meant something, with the camera put in just the right place, and the editing and writing ratcheting up the tension with perfect, inevitable ease. Clearly final shots mean something to Szifron, and it's in this story where his last moment adds an extra, juicy layer to the storytelling. Next, one of Argentina's most famous actors, Ricardo Dar�n (THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES), expertly mines every moment of his put-upon sad sack who naively takes on the system after getting towed. What makes this segment sing is the fact that his character is set-up as a man addicted to causing drama. I found my loyalties shifting constantly from his p.o.v. to those of the bureaucrats he torments. Again, every moment counts, from the initial set-up at a construction site to its homage to TAXI DRIVER. The film continues with an unfortunate hit-and-run accident perpetrated by the son of a wealthy man (a great slow-burn by Oscar Mart�nez), who keeps making one ill-advised decision after another in an attempt to make the situation go away. This story exposes the never-ending levels of corruption and greed, placing a sad, lower class patsy into the mix (a terrific Germ�n de Silva) to remind us how stuck the 99% often feel in their lives. Knowing full well that no good can come from this situation, Szifron ends this tale with abrupt and off-camera sounds, putting just the right capper on its hopelessness. Finally, a wedding reception from hell ends the film on a funny yet disturbing note as a cheating groom played by Diego Gentile (clearly Argentina's answer to Bradley Cooper) faces off against his distraught bride (Erica Rivas, explosively going past any semblance of sanity). Their performances are electric, and I wasn't surprised to discover that nearly the entire cast received nominations from Argentina's version of the Oscars. The jealously and rage of our newlyweds keeps boiling over, ending (here we are again with Szifron's mastery of final shots) on an image combining sex and messiness. It's a perfect way to summarize the experience of this thoroughly entertaining, not-to-be-missed film.",

Showing an incident of mindless road rage escalating to the horrific brutality of 2 guys killing each other is not my idea of a good time at the movies.

Yo opino que la unica cura para ese dolor es ser un Dalek y exterminar la humanidad. Pero...porque todo tiene un pero...no hace falta exterminar, al contrario, este filme expresa justo lo que quise siempre ver expuesto en una pelicula y me agrado el guion, las actuaciones y hasta la preciosa edicion/continuidad del mismo. La humanidad es la criatura mas increible que existe, se enoja con una facilidad sorprendente, toma todo a pecho y la verdad siempre le duele. Son animales inigualables que todo lo quieren, todo lo desean y al final cuando mueren...todo lo pierden. Me encanta la peli enserio! Brutal! Majestuosa! Me acabo de desahogar por si no lo habian notado! Me siento super mejor ahora. El director Damian es impecable! Jamas habia visto un filme tocandome la fibra y los temas que mas me agradan de esta singular creacion (porque todo lo que el humano crea justo crea eso: discordia, ira y bipolaridad sin fin). Son unos seres extraordinarios. En fin, la recomiendo para que se identifiquen con las INJUSTICIAS creadas por nosotros, las IRAS ABSURDAS que hacemos por idioteces y claro, somos unos animales que aun con educacion, con una simple pizca de absurditis aguda, nos volvemos seres con RELATOS....SALVAJES.

    "review": "  Year by year, I have gradually lost my interest on the Oscars' categories due to their monotone and disappointing predictability, except for one category - Best Film in a Foreign Language. Not that I always agree with the Academy's (collective) decision in this category, far from that - there have been many films that I love dearly but miss out the golden statue to much lesser contestants (\"Le fabuleux destin d'Am�lie Poulain\" in 2001 or \"Farewell My Concubine\" in 1993). But I always respect, and love, this category for pointing out many films that without their nomination in this category, I might have never got chance to watch them, from \"Okuribito\" to \"El secreto de sus ojos\", to this year's \"Relatos salvajes\". Despite its anthology form (in which the film is segmented into six disconnected part with only a common theme - the wildness of humanity in extreme situations), the film has a very coherent style - beautiful cinematography, excellent cast, strange yet utterly attractive stories, and crazy script - exactly like the film's title. In fact, the six parts are not equally strong (I love the first part the most - strong, tight, quick, and full of metaphoric images, the third part is another excellent action-packed piece of cinema) but they are all full of surprises, twist-and-turns, and well-meaning stories about humanity. Well, some of those stories are not really \"well-meaning\" but they are nonetheless powerful and force the audience to think about themselves, think about what would they do if they were in those characters' situation, whether they would be as crazy, as wild, as those characters once being cornered in such emotionally horrible situations. I respect this film even more considering the fact that this comedy is always sincere to its comedic by trying its best to entertain the audience (and give them some slices of wild humanity, when necessary) instead of trying to be something pretentiously \"noble\", \"high-concept\". Rarely a film can be all entertaining, surprising, and thought-provoking at the same time like this one. Thank you , AMPAS, for give me another excellent film from Argentina.",

It's a gnarly Argentine anthology film whose unconnected chapters straddle the line between black comedy and gruesome soap opera; it may appeal to those who found humor in Gone Girl or the Saw movies. Black comedies always run the risk of being too black to be comical, and I'd say director and writer Dami�n Szifron is trying to find humor in things that aren't humorous, but his presence is apathetic and his writing is lazy...so is he even trying? Wild Tales is too focused on wallowing in its own awfulness to crack very many jokes, and when it does, they never register above cheap cynicism.",

This film consists of 6 short live action films, some longer than others coming down to just over the 2 hours mark in total. To give this film the title \"Wild Tales\" is entirely appropriate here as well. This was some crazy a$$ sh!# going on in this somewhat of a fairy tale for grown ups in the Tarantino age and at the same time, all these stories could be very plausible in the real world and could very likely happen if anyone was in the mood to do such mad psycho acts or react in ways these characters do. It has a very strong start with it's first and shortest piece and really ends with a bang. There was certainly a reason this was a favorite at the academy awards and garnered it a \"best foreign language film of the year\" nominee. That being said, this is without a doubt one of my new favorites from last year and it is a must-see for anyone who like any anthology film out there, and this could possibly be the best one of that genre.

    "review": "  Frankly, its really hard to pin down your thoughts about unconventional Argentine-Spanish black comedy-drama film, mainly because the film is compiled of six short stories into one. This short films follow a common theme - the limit of our patience, or like it's tagline says...\"All may lose control\". This is probably the darkest and most hilarious film I have seen in years! NO! Its not a comedy! Just that the segments are so hilarious and over the top, you cant help but smile, but at the same time satirical and somehow realistic, it's almost impossible not to feel identified with one of the characters, with one of their situations, despite the awkward moments they struggle that in some passages make us feel uncomfortable. Talking about each tale in detail will cut the impact and somewhat surprise of each one. Let's just say that the outcomes of each tale are far from being predictable, completely driven by logic not cliches. Based on the shock value & hilarity I would rank the films in this way: 1. \"El m�s fuerte\" (The Strongest): about two men going wild on the road trying to kill each other. 2. \"Hasta que la muerte nos separe\" (Until Death Do Us Part): It's about what is likely the craziest wedding party in movie history.3. \"Bombita\" (Little Bomb): about an engineer who sees his life ruined by bureaucracy regarding his repetitively towed car & how he plans his wicked vengeance masterfully.4. \"Pasternak\": How all the passengers in a plane are related to a common man.5. \"Las ratas\" (The Rats): two waitresses plan to kill a customer with rat poison due to personal reasons.6. \"La propuesta\" (The Proposal): a wealthy business man finds himself at the crossroads when his son runs over and kills a pregnant woman with his car. In each story a modern frustration wells up until the character erupts. All the stories involve a furious revenge, with a broadening range of characters. To convey the tensions in modern life, ordinary sounds are amplified, like the luggage wheels in the opening shot. Ordinary people that find themselves in awkward situations they didn't look for, and that's the beauty of this movie. It works very well like that, lasting close to 120 minutes that go by quickly. It feels very fluid. And the merit of director Dami�n Szifr�n is to tell those stories with an exquisite combination of intrigue, suspense and a remarkable and effective dark humor. The acting, editing, photography and the music of Gustavo Santaolalla are all ingredients that give extra points. On the whole, Divided into six chapters with technically no direct interrelation but with a compelling thematic cohesion, Wild Tales (original Spanish title, Relatos salvajes) is a masterfully crafted dark comedy of incredible shrewdness and wit. It can be hilarious, fascinatingly demented, awesomely violent, and more often than not just plain weird. The segments had in common the themes of revenge and the loss of control, and the inner longing we all have for letting ourselves be carried away by our deepest and most violent impulses but we never let that happen. This leads me to conclude that in many ways, this film might as well be a sort of twisted psychological fantasy as well as a sharp social satire. This film is a perfect example of what we call enthralling piece of cinema. Must Watch!",

With six tales that push the word insanity to a whole new level, it gives you the most tense of moments that you've seen all year. A movie that uses the theme of revenge to show us stories about political corruption, capitalism, the obsession over power and standing for one's principles, all delivered in the most satirical and gut wrenching of ways to construct an overall bad-shit-crazy ride. You can connect to Wild Tales on so many different levels, whether you're angry at your government, questioning your marriage, can't get over your past, or even just can't let go of how stupid other people drive their cars around you, you will re-visit those emotions in some of the tales, to say the least, and you don't have to be from Argentina to feel that.",

    "review": "  4 out of 5 stars. \"Wild Tales\" is the most entertaining of the 5 Foreign Film Oscar nominees this year, even though the haunting \"Ida\" from Poland deservedly won the prize. Satire and humor often misfire when shown in other countries, which is a reason American comedies rarely do as well as action films and big visual FX films as the most successful film exports. So \"Wild Tales,\" with its 6 short films about revenge by people who cross the line from rational to madness, could easily go off the rails and seem overdone. Instead, the sure hand of new world class filmmaker, Damian Szifron, provides first rate and confident control with great visual style. Often omnibus films cobbled together with short films by different directors are very uneven, but in this case, because the six short stories are all written and directed by the same person, there are overall themes and consistent stylistic choices which tie the whole film together and make the collection work. Several of the stories are dark, violent and macabre, while others are laugh out loud farces. All are skillfully acted and written, with social commentary specific to Argentina, but universal enough to be understood worldwide. Definitely a funny and provocative examination of ordinary people pushed to breaking points in the modern world, often with unexpected results. Szifron is a filmmaker to watch and if brought to America with an increased scale and budget, could soon follow Cuaron and Inarritu to even greater success.",

    "review": "  A satirical sexpartite, this Argentinian import is a scalpel-sharp satire about the nature of violence, what stirs the darkest recess of the human soul and encourages it to fester and manifest itself through violence. Running the gamut from the personal to the societal, Wild Tales is a welcome fun and breezy thrill ride as it wastes no time in setting up the characters and situations, and never lets up. While its themes may be dark and it often depicts humans at the brink of insanity, it gleefully brandishes its quirky and wicked humor to lighten things up.",

    "review": "  I used to have a friend (deceased now) who confided in me that she loved revenge. She was serious. She said she loved revenge the way a fat kid loves cake. She was an upstanding Catholic born and raised and if someone did her wrong she'd want to leave it in God's hands... really she would. But the two of us would spend a lot of time talking about how we could \"get\" the person.Welcome to WILD TALES. A series of stories centered around perfect tales of revenge. You all know I don't like spoilers (watch the trailer, for goodness sake), suffice it to say for all of us who have ever been to that dark place where your mind turns for even one second to some rich, chocolaty payback, WILD TALES will satisfy your craving. The opening credits begin by us staring into the eyes of some familiar animal predators, some noble, some not. The point is you will see this look again in all of the characters who decide during the course of the film they've had enough. You will recognize the shocked look of prey in their victims.The stories - divine. Each one wrapped up neatly in it's own little packaging, bite size for those with short attention span. The acting - superb. Everyone is well cast and you see the darkness coming across their eyes forecasting the trouble ahead. The cinematography - sprawling. Each setting is beautifully thought out and sets a different mood for it's dark tale.The score - impactful. From the first note to the last you feel like you're falling into this film. The sound is so beautiful; no 3D glasses are required. You already feel like you're right there.The verdict - Go see this film. Even if you don't like subtitles, go see this film. You know I typically don't ask my husband to go with me to see subtitled films, but I did this time (he loves some revenge too) and there was only one story he took a bit of a nod in. I won't take off for it though, because even that story he was able to repeat back to me after we left (It was the one where the son comes home with the wrecked car - sorry if that was your favorite). Do I still feel the same way about revenge now as I did when I entered the theater? Does it seem as much fun and gratifying - I don't know. But I will leave it at this, one of the most enduring quotes of all time is \"Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves\" (Confucius).100% wakefulnessRemember, films are expensive, take a nap before it starts,Wife of the sleepy husband.",

    "review": "  This anthology of six tales of unbridled revenge delivers huge laughs while providing ample food for thought about injustice and inequality. Five of the six tales are raucously funny, while the sixth is far more serious in tone, creating something of a disconnect with its companion pieces, despite its thematic link to the others. This picture is definitely not for the squeamish or overly sensitive. But those who appreciate the sensations that come from getting screwed and getting even and who understand that karma really is a bitch will no doubt find this offering a cinematic gem.",

    "review": "  The daily lives of any person in this world is filled with failures, success good times, bad times, and crazy times. This could be the easy way to explain the film Dami�n Szifr�n \"Wild Tales\". Following the footsteps of famous directors like Robert Altman with Short Cuts and Paris, je t'aime with the directors: Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen, Walters Salles, Alfonzo Cuar�n, Wes Crave and Alexander Payne.Wild Tales is a collection of 6 short films compiled in a single film. Every stories doesn't have a particular connection from each other, but the relationship of success, failure, death, revenge, love and life, is present and should be the crucial link from each tale that you see on film.With Argentinian all stars such as Ricardo Dar�n (The Secret in Their Eyes and Nine Queens) Dar�o Grandinetti ( The Dark side of the heart) Leonardo Sbaraglia (Cenizas del Paraiso) is just a few of the actors who bring to life the stories: -Pasternak the story of a disappointed human being who finds the revenge by get rid of everyone who hurt him. -The Rats The story of a waitress revenge against the responsible of her family demise. -The Strongest The story of two drivers who clash till the end to see who is the bravest.-Little Bomb the story of a explosive specialist haunting unfairness in the daily life system.-The Proposal: A hit and run will turn into a greedy fight for money.-Until death do us part a wedding turn into a bloody warThere is no much to say about this film, is masterful with a very dark humor and realistic situations that appeal to everyone who wanted to fight the system and find meaning to daily conflicts in daily life.Pedro Almodovar produce this instant classic, Gustavo Santaloalla delivers a beautiful score and Javier Juli� create a wonderful cinematography inspired in the look of several films.",

Honestly, every one of the short films could be explored in a Film Studies course, where it's likely all they'd make are short films. While the order wasn't great (the last two shorts were probably my least favourite), and it ran a bit long (the final short was 30 minutes), and 2 hours is a lot of time to dedicate to unrelated shorts, the director really did pull it off, with some excellent cinematography and performances. While the best foreign films often find themselves remade for American audiences, this film is much too smart and quirky to be replicated. Nevertheless, perhaps because of how good this film is, I wouldn't be surprised to see more anthology films being produced in the United States.",

The six stories contained within (all dealing with the concept of revenge) are all great in their individual ways, and systematically ordered in a way that makes the film feel fluid. Often brutal and monstrous, but never mean-spirited or overdone, and energetic in the most invigorating way, Wild Tales is the type of pulp-fiction that Hollywood just doesn't have the balls to put out anymore. My personal pick for this year's Oscar for best foreign film.",

    "review": "  Argentina's submission for the Best Foreign Language film Oscar race lives up to its title. This wicked and funny farce about revenge and the extremes of human behavior is fierce and ferocious. Writer-director Damian Szifron has not made one single film. Wild Tales is six films, all stitched together under one title. Some audiences may not be able to handle it. Oh well.Take the opening vignette, 'Pasternak', set on a jet in which the passengers all realize they've wronged the same man, named Pasternak, in one way or another. No fair spoiling the surprise, but it's a story as gonzo-crazy as anything ever dreamed up by Pedro Almodovar, who serves as a co-producer.Things get darker in 'The Rats' where a waitress (Julietta Zylberberg) finds herself serving the criminal who drove her father to suicide. In 'Road To Hell', a stuffy driver insults a redneck. And then there's 'Bombita' starring Ricardo Darin, Argentina's biggest star, is a demolition engineer who must contend with a towing service and the DMV. It's a lot more riveting and wild than it sounds.'The Deal' has fewer laughs, a story in which a rich man attempts to pay off a gardener to take the fall for his hit-and-run on his own bratty son. But it's the final story that really ignites. That would be 'Till Death Do Us Part', set at a Jewish wedding where the bride (Erica Rivas, amazing) takes revenge on her cheating groom (Diego Gentile), turning the whole party into a gladiator match. You'll be laughing till it hurts, which is of course the point. Filmmaking is seldom such a breath of fresh air like Wild Tales.",

It was amazing, one of the best movies I've seen on big screen in 2 or 3 years.Plot consists of different stories which all have one thing in common: they are about revenge. Every single story starts rather boring. At the very beginning I was thinking \"What's so wild about it? It is just lame\" and by the end of the intro I was like \"Holy God! No, they did not just twist it like that! OMG!\"And it gets better. A true masterpiece. I am from Russia so for me it was rather interesting and surprising that Latin America is so similiar to Russia.

It takes place in Argentina, but with the exception of a few logistical references and the language, these tales could occur in New York, London, Madrid, nearly anyplace where people are angry at their loss of control. This is an angry film disguised as a comedy, very dark comedy that makes you laugh while squirming at the violence, rudeness, injustice, pride -- well, there you have it, the seven deadly sins. Produced by Pedro Almodovar and his brother, it's easy to see the lineage, especially in Szifron's visual style and use of music, both of which contribute to the joyride rush of these stories.",

Its structure makes for enthralling storytelling and the situations it portrays, filled with dark, droll humor, violence and stellar performances, allows the audience to observe how humans react to any kind of �disturbance� in their environment. It is morally conflicted and critical on a social level, but its above average production values, assured direction and gripping stories make for a memorable experience.",

    "review": "  Con l'aiuto dato dalla produzione di Almodovar, arriva dall'Argentina questo film dal formato inusuale visto che � costituito da sei episodi di lunghezza crescente che, calcando la mano su di un umorismo nerissimo, raccontano la realt� quotidiana e, soprattutto, gli spettri che si nascondono dietro una facciata di rispettabilit�. Per questo, in fondo, gli episodi potrebbero essere ambientati in qualsiasi luogo e non obbligatoriamente nel Paese sudamericano - uno sfondo analogo si pu� trovare anche per gli affascinanti paesaggi che accompagnano 'Il pi� forte' - dato che l'attenzione � posta pi� che altro sulle psicologie dei personaggi che appartengono, per la gran parte, a una borghesia medio-alta. Un elemento comune alle sei storie che si aggiunge all'altro, ancor pi� netto, della vendetta che viene declinata in varie forme, ma sempre con un sorriso sardonico sullo sfondo. A proposito di sorrisi, bench� il film si iscriva senza problemi alla categoria della commedia, le situazioni e il modo di raccontarle non sfociano quasi mai in una risata liberatoria: nello spettatore resta pi� impressa una sensazione di fastidioso malessere accentuata dai colpi bassi in cui sfociano talvolta le vicende . Per quanto riguarda l'ispirazione, i modelli possono essere i pi� vari a partire da quello, inevitabile, dell'ironia acre di Almodovar: in ogni caso, da una parte non pu� mancare la commedia all'italiana nella sua versione pi� cattiva - in 'Bombetta' un ingegnere si vendica in maniera 'esplosiva' della societ� che si occupa di rimozioni forzate diventando un piccolo eroe - e dall'altra si guarda con occhio deferente a Bu�uel - il matrimonio da incubo di 'Finch� morte non ci separi' che vira dalla festa alla tragedia riporta alla memoria echi de 'L'angelo sterminatore' (peccato solo per una conclusione che non trae fino in fondo le conseguenze dalla tensione accumulata in precedenza). Gli episodi ora citati fanno parte del secondo gruppo in cui lo scontro � soprattutto psicologico, come dimostra anche 'La trattativa', un tremendo apologo sulla cupidigia umana in cui si contratta il cartellino del prezzo di chiunque venga a contatto con il problema di un giovane bene che ha investito e uscciso una donna incinta: si tratta per� dei segmenti che, nel complesso, risultano meno riusciti forse anche a causa di un'eccessiva lunghezza. Assai pi� lucidi e stringati sono invece i primi tre, che si evolvono da premesse banali in situazioni in cui ha la meglio una violenza fisica a volte di una brutalit� tarantiniana: il pilota d'aereo che sistema in modo definitivo i conti della sua vita in 'Pasternak' (prima dei titoli di testa, avvio fulminante la cui efficacia purtroppo non � pi� eguagliata), la camerirera de 'I ratti' che reincontra un vecchio nemico di famiglia nello sperduto ristorante in cui lavora e trova nella cuoca un'aiutante fin troppo volonterosa, i due automobilisti che danno vita a una sorta di 'Duel' sanguinoso e demente su una strada sperduta ne 'Il pi� forte' - qui, sullo sfondone finale della polizia, si ride davvero. Alla fine, il succedersi di queste storie - alle quali l'aggettivo 'selvagge' del titolo originale e di quello internazionale meglio si attaglia rispetto a 'pazzesche' - vanno a costituire un film assai godibile che, visto il momento in cui � stato distribuito, pu� anche servire da antidoto contro questo periodo di buonismo natalizio: il lavoro del neppure quarantenne regista Szifr�n non � banale (la scelta di aprire alcune sezioni da un'inquadratura buia, la capacit� di variare il tempo a seconda delle situazioni) e serve con gusto una sua sceneggiatura che, al dil� di alcune battute a vuoto, funziona riuscendo benissimo a tenere agganciato lo spettatore. Certo, qualche scelta poteva essere pi� coraggiosa o definitiva (a partire dalla fotografia ben pettinata di Javier Julia), ma sarebbe stato pretendere troppo da un film che ha anche ambizioni da prodotto medio e che comunque testimonia la valida qualit� del cinema realizzato a Buenos Aires e dintorni: in questo quadro non stupisce che il cast includa una serie di attori di buon nome nel loro Paese, le cui interpretazioni quasi sempre misurate di personaggi quantomento stravaganti - un nome per tutti: Ricardo Dar�n in 'Bombetta' - contribuiscono di certo alla riuscita dell'operazione. L'eccezione a questa misura � 'Finch� morte non ci separi' dove tutto � sopra le righe e anche la recitazione si adegua, come quella di Erica Rivas nella parte della sposina tradita e vendicativa in una festa di nozze in cui gli istinti pi� bestiali vengono allo scoperto: in materia, del resto, sono gi� ben chiari gli indovinati titoli di testa, in cui a ogni nome che compare sullo schermo � associata (con un certo gusto) la foto di un animale.",

I find it hard to review these anthology films at times considering some of the short stories work really well while others don't. In Wild Tales, Szifron manages to structure the film beautifully into six stories with a great sense of pacing and storytelling. The two hours flew by and I never found any of the stories tedious or boring. When making an anthology it is important that you establish an important connection between each story, and Szifron manages to do just that. Each story focuses on characters who in some way seem to lose control and act out on impulse or revenge. It's a film about our reactions and how we can behave as animals at times. Szifron manages to set a dark tone in each of his stories while keeping the audience in suspense during some scenes and exploding in laughter during others. It is a perfect example of a dark comedy that manages to maintain the thrills throughout the narrative. Szifron plays with the genre conventions and balances the different tones of the film very well. It's hard to point out a weak link because each story brings something different to the film, but at the same time they all feel connected. Szifron cleverly satirizes different institutions in each of his six segments including marriage, justice, bureaucracy, and social classes. Wild Tales is a well executed and entertaining film, and one that might turn out to be a contender at next year's Oscars. One major issue with anthology films is that since they are separate short stories we get little time to invest in each of the characters, but somehow Szifron manages to establish each character in each scenario so well that we end up caring for them. The performances are all solid. The only familiar face in the cast is Ricardo Darin who delivers his segment extremely well. He plays a disillusioned character who is tired of the bureaucracy in his country. It doesn't take much to see him explode and we see how one small incident escalates into an overblown reaction. As much as I enjoyed that segment, it wasn't the most memorable one. I was a huge fan of the road rage segment, which in my opinion was the highlight of this film. Juan Pablo Colombo and Walter Donado give terrific performances as they are placed on an everyday scenario in the road which very quickly escalates into cartoonish violence. I could go on mentioning the rest of the segments, but they are all worthwhile. This was a perfectly executed black comedy and one worth checking out.",

Cuando el cine argentino se plantea crear un hit, consigue los aportes y la gente necesaria y lo logra. Jam�s en Chile se ha hecho una comedia tan inteligente como esta... una pena. Media estrella extra por la m�sica de Santaolalla.",

    "review": "  One of the best anthology type films that I have ever seen, Wild Tales presents its audience with around 5 or 6 tales filled with genious dialogue and sutile critique, all wrapped up in beautifully dark comedy that might go too far sometimes, but it shocks the audience in the most classy waypossible, all supported by great directing, an amazing cast, perfectly laid out characters, and some of the best writing, just what Argentina is known for.",

    "review": "  Relatos Salvajes fue una revelaci�n. Consiste de 5 historias cortas que hablan de la naturaleza humana en su forma m�s oscura. Venganza, dolor, enga�o son s�lo un peque�o vistazo a la riqueza emocional de esta pel�cula, que adem�s nos sirve de recordatorio que todas las personas al verse presionadas son capaces de cosas inimaginables. Dos historias resaltaron para mi. La primera fue la de la familia que trata de encubrir a su hijo, que al estar borracho detr�s del volante, asesin� a una mujer embarazada. Sinti�ndose acorralados, logran hacer un trato con el jardinero de la familia para que tome la culpa. Me impact� al ver todas las medidas que tomaron para que la justicia no recayera sobre su hijo, y el �nico momento en el que el padre logr� ver las cosas con claridad fue cuando sinti� que estaba siendo estafado por su abogado. La segunda historia fue la de la boda, que fue la �ltima de la pel�cula. Dos j�venes se casan, y durante la fiesta ella se da cuenta que la amante de su marido fue invitada. Por supuesto que su reacci�n no fue favorable, y decide vengarse. Lo que sigue es una locura, donde realmente no se puede prevenir lo que va a suceder, especialmente la culminaci�n. Esta historia s�lo demuestra que a pesar de que al casarse se supone que conoces totalmente a la persona, realmente s�lo ves una parte de ella, y que te pueden sorprender en cualquier momento.Relatos Salvajes es una pel�cula ingeniosa donde todas las historias se entrelazan y el resultado es emocionante y que te sorprende a cada momento. Cuando piensas que las cosas no se pueden poner peor, o que las personas ya mostraron todas las cartas bajo la manga, te sorprende, y algunas veces te hace perder la fe en la humanidad pero de la manera m�s humor�stica posible.",

    "review": "  A portmanteau film of 6 stories starring some of the most famous names in Argentinian cinema (or so I was told), this is an accomplished and cinematic film that looks particularly good on the big screen. Although narratively unconnected, there is a thematic link in that they are all tales about retaliation and retribution. The Spanish Tales of the Unexpected, if you like. Written with wit and dark humour, they are entertaining and often come with a little sting in the end for extra style and mischief. A fun, frivolous and rather delightful film.",
