    "review": "  It's official, Ghost Protocol has rebooted MI into a smashing action/espionage success with this follow up.RN is everything you need in an action film. Great set pieces, smart plot, clever humor, somewhat relateable/humane characters, a robust competent cast, good direction...I almost feel like it's too similar in quality to GP though. The pacing, action, dialogue, even the way each character moves almost seems surgical now. Don't get me wrong it's a great film and like I said, everything you'd ever NEED but I think we've hit a level of stagnation here.There's no more wow factor, there's nothing iconic that you would recall for years on down the road. Rogue Nation will be remembered by most as a blur of exceptional action film making...I believe the next MI film will need more personal, resonating character moments from the IMF crew if it's going to succeed.",

    "review": "  There's not a lot to think about here, just your typical summer motion picture thrill ride, but it's got the goods insofar as that goes. Cruise supplies the action, Simon Pegg provides the light buddy comedy, but the film really belongs to Rebecca Ferguson who purposefully is given equal footing with the man in this. Hell, she saves the hero in this. Twice. Are you ready for that? And she dances backward. In heels. She's the break out star here, and the reason to watch, (after the action set pieces).

    "review": "  Not as outlandishly crazy as the Fast and the Furious series, not as beholden to tradition as the Bond series, the Mission: Impossible series doesn't get the same notoriety but I'd declare it the most consistent and best action franchise going today. Each new film is a distillation of their director's strengths, keeping things fresh, and the mainstay is Tom Cruise in prime action hero mode and risking his life like a madman. While not as dizzyingly entertaining as 2011's Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation is another fun and action-packed spy thriller with terrific and memorable set pieces. The plot involves Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team on the run, again, as their agency is shut down for its reckless methods. A rival agency known as The Syndicate is plotting political assassinations, so Hunt and his team (Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames) must work along the fringes to save the day. The newest addition is Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson as a mysterious ally and antagonist for Hunt. She's smart, formidable, and not treated as a romantic interest or overly sexualized (progress). After Alicia Vikander's superb performance in Ex Machina, and now Ferguson's steely turn, it's quite a booming year for Swedish imports. The series' star is still Cruise and his cavalier treatment of his 50-year-old body in the pursuit of the daredevil stunts. The opening with Cruise attached to the outside of an ascending cargo plane is a stunning image jolted by the charge of realism. An underwater vault break-in is wonderfully developed. The snazzy car chases, motorcycle chases, and foot chases all benefit from Cruise being front and center. Say what you will about the man but he's a movie star. The biggest problem with Rogue Nation is much like Ghost Protocol in that it peaks in the middle. The last act takes place entirely in London and it just can't compare with what came earlier, which leaves the movie lumbering to a close with its rather substandard villain. Even with a less than stellar conclusion, Rogue Nation is another entertaining, fun, and thrilling action movie that would be the best the summer has to offer if it weren't for the highs of Mad Max. Nate's Grade: B+",

    "review": "  This is actually the first MI movie I have ever seen, but it won't be the last. The trick with action movies is to make the action scenes unique. We've seen car chases and explosions before, and this film has many of those, but it also throws in underwater heists, a man flying on the outside of a plane and some nice humor. Like almost all action flicks, the story itself is not much to marvel at, so in order for an action film to be good it has to make up for it in other ways, which absolutely Rogue Nation does. And despite what people say or think about Tom Cruise, there is no denying that he is a bonafide action star.",

This time, the team is left with nothing as a nation-gone-rogue is after Ethan Hunt. With so many more layers, this film has one of the best stories of the franchise. With a very bond-esque inspiration, this is not one to miss if you are a fan of the series. Tom Cruise is fantastic once again as the charismatic lead in Hunt, and the entire cast (namely Simon Pegg) are all noteworthy here as well. With a very carefully written script, direction that is off the charts, and editing that makes each action piece make your heart pump, this picture has it all. There may be a few pacing issues, but this is definitely one of the best films you will see this summer!",

    "review": "  Another fantastic entry in the rare case of an action franchise that just keeps getting better and better. That's thanks to great direction of excellent action in awesome set pieces, but also thanks to the leading man. People can say about Cruise's private life or religious choices all they want. The man keeps delivering great genre entertainment year after year, while doing as many stunts as he can all by himself. The insane opening sequence is testament to that. Still, one of the best parts of this is how it is an ensemble piece with everyone doing their part. Female newbie Rebecca Ferguson is fantastic, blowing all Bond girls from the last 45 years out of the water. Pegg is likable and funny as always. The pacing is great and especially the two major sequences in the middle of the film in the Vienna opera and Casablanca are absolutely breathtaking. The showdown can't even begin to top that and doesn't try, taking a different approach to a solution instead. Overall a pretty long film for an action thriller but an incredibly entertaining one. With quality as high as this, they can keep making these until kingdom come.",

For over 2 hours, the story drops the action when needed, unleashes the thrills when asked for, reveals the secrets at opportune moments, and even finds the time for a bit of humor in between. The storyline manages to keep it going with moment after moment.The action is well rounded. Shootings, hand to hand combats, and vehicle carnage thrown in for good measure.Tom Cruise knows what he is doing and when surrounded with the likes of Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames, it 's hard to go wrong.

    "review": "  With such a high bar after Ghost Protocol, this plays more like a Mission: Mediocre for me. The high reviews and praise as being the best in the series really baffle me, because the plot overall was very vanilla and straightforward. I thought they played too many of their cards in the trailers, because pretty much any stunt (aside from details of the third act) has already been mostly revealed over the course of the trailers. The plane stunt is amazing, and the driving and motorcycle stuff is amazing, but aside from those scenes, nothing really leaves a lasting imprint for me. I feel like they strung a bunch of spy and stunt scenes together without much setup, whereas in Ghost Protocol there was dialogue and setup to the scenes and they had more substance. Overall, I'd still say it's a decent, be it a little disappointing, entry into the franchise (my 3rd favorite), but I'll need a re-watch of the original and Ghost Protocol to get my enthusiasm for the series back up to the level it was at.",

    "review": "  IN DE PALMA THEIR HANDS - My Review of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: ROGUE NATION (4 Stars)Sometimes, and I mean rarely, a blockbuster well into its franchise just works. Think about how CASINO ROYALE reinvigorated the 007 Series, with Daniel Craig and director Martin Campbell bringing a healthy dose of gravitas to something that had long-before resorted to trashy silliness. But, again, that kind of thing happens as often as Halley's Comet. Imagine my surprise then when writer/director Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise reunited for this fifth installment and went in guns blazing. This is a thrilling action movie, effortlessly jumping from set piece to set piece with deliciously shifting loyalties and some tightly-wound suspense. It's not going to change the world, but it definitely sends a warning shot to all the other Studio Tentpole makers to up their game and at least stay engaged with the swill they're shilling. MISSION picks up a short time after the Kremlin-destroying events of GHOST PROTOCOL, with our hero, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) desperately trying to get to a plane before it takes off. Yes, the filmmakers blow their poster wad within the first five minutes, giving us that indelible and real shot of Cruise dangling from the side of a plane in mid-air. My instant thought was, \"That's pretty ballsy. I hope they have more tricks up their sleeves or else this thing is an early climaxer!\"Turns out, it was just an appetizer, and when we come back from credits, we find the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) in disarray and losing its power, with Hunt having gone dark in the field. A perfect time for the Syndicate, a band of terrorists hellbent on world domination, to set their plot in motion. Of course they have to go through Ethan and his loyal band of spies, and we all know how that tends to work out for the bad guys. Joined again by Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames, Cruise and company find themselves in a race against time to save the world. The story, as usual, is somewhat irrelevant, but the execution of the thrills and chills thoroughly won me over. Without spoiling anything, we're treated to torture, an attempted assassination at an opera, a thrillingly-edited underwater sequence, and a good half dozen more scenes before the film almost literally dumps you out, spent and exhausted. Bringing an ambiguous dose of tension is Rebecca Ferguson, excellent as the femme fatale who may or may not be on Ethan's side. It's this push-pull that gives the film its effervescent kick. I've enjoyed Cruise's performances in recent years because he's become more willing to give us the aging action star who suffers aches, pains, and real fear. He may ultimately prevail, but there's a cost nowadays. Battle fatigue often plays better than superhuman strength, something the world of MARVEL and DC COMICS could stand to learn. Beautifully shot by master cinematographer Robert Elswit, who ruled 2014 with stellar work on NIGHTCRAWLER and INHERENT VICE, and edited with rare patience by Eddie Hamilton, ROGUE NATION seldom resorts to the style of seizure-inducing scenes in most giant CGI nightmares. Instead, much effort has been put into understanding each location and who is doing what to whom. Trust me, that just does not happen much anymore. McQuarrie also gets credit here, using alternate scenarios to get what's normally droning exposition across to the viewers. The preparation for the underwater scenes, for example, made great use of dispensing complicated information by way of showing Simon Pegg suffering the outcome of a mission that could go horribly wrong. This and the stunning opera scene reminded me of vintage Brian De Palma, who in addition to making such suspense classics as DRESSED TO KILL and BLOW OUT, happened to direct the first MISSION installment. De Palma understands screen geography better than most and he's always infused his scenes with a somewhat winking, knowing, dreamlike energy. McQuarrie seems to pull from the same playbook, perhaps to honor his predecessor's work on the series, or maybe it's because he just thinks De Palma has done cheese correctly. Either way, what we have here is very De Palma-esque. For a director like De Palma, who has often been criticized for being too Hitchcock-esque, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: ROGUE NATION seems to give him his long-deserved due...even if he had nothing to do with it.",

    "review": "  Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation is a brilliant action film, perfectly combining the series epic set pieces with a solid storyline to match. This is a film that was never boring and keeps you engaged thanks to director Christopher McQuarries sharp direction. Everything from the opening plane sequence, to the fantastic bike chase, this has all the action and intensity you want from a Mission: Impossible film. The story isn't anything groundbreaking, but its a cool idea thats executed very well. It gives the opportunity for the great characters to develop further and to see them do awesome stuff. It also works very well to give the incredible action scenes a lot more impact. Tom Cruise continues to prove he is one of the best action stars in the business, no matter the age. His performance shows yet again that he was born to play Ethan Hunt, bringing all the charisma and fun to the role that we expect. Ving Rhames is a much welcome return to the franchise, although I had almost wished he had more to do amd more interaction with Ethan. Simon Pegg is great as usual, using a likable personality and humor to make a fun character. Jeremy Renner also continues to prove that he is just awesome. Rebecca Ferguson really came out of nowhere and blew me away, and I hope this leads her into new roles I get to see her in soon. The villain was a solid baddie to take on, as I liked his cold and calculating personality. He at least was better than the majority of other villains in this franchise. Overall, I love the Mission: Impossible franchise and I think the argument could be made that Rogue Nation is the best yet. These films only seem to be getting better. But thanks to brilliant action sequences, a great cast once again proving their brilliant chemistry, a well done script, and a new director who blends all of this together perfectly to create one of the best films of the summer. Whether or not you are a fan of spy films, you definitely should go see this.",

I adored the director's and producer (also starred) Tom Cruise's vision.Tom Cruise knew what he was doing as a producer. Most of the decision was made by him. You can also see one of his extreme decision to perform all of the stunts with his own body. And yes all of the stunts were true. Tom Cruise really flew on a military aircraft!Ferguson's performance was also a highlight of the movie. From half of the movie we really don't know whose side she was on.I also like to note Alec Baldwin's comeback in the acting industry. I think the last time he looked fresh as in the movie was in 'The Hunt For Red October' (1990). Now, he was also a key plot of the film (or SPOILER: the franchise in the future).But from all of its achievement I would like to salute the movie because it was shot on film instead of digital. This type of filmmaking are very rare now. The traditional ways are always the best way to create the best movies.Shooting on film is always my dream.From all of the good things, there was only one thing I hated - the antagonist of the movie. They were not very iconic. Syndicate was the nemesis of IMF in the TV series. So, I was expecting a group of antagonist, which was very very very hard to take down.Just like Benji said to Ethan, \"Nahhh.. it's not so hard.\"The verdict:MI: Rogue Nation achieved many things that I hadn't expected to achieve, it's a great summer blockbuster movie and they keep the franchise fresh.",

So they had to improvise with the help of a old colleague that is in another city to help with there hacking to retrieve the package from inside the aircraft.By doing so the plane is just about to lift off but what happens is that it does and Ethan jumps on to the plane before it does and hangs in the balance of the side door up in the air. Benji now hack in to the plane has to open the door from the side and open it. He gets in and retrieves the package and does what is necessary! afterwards we get a scene where Ethan Hunt is in London and in a vinyl store to get his next mission only to be compromised and to find out there is a rouge agency like the IMF To Be continued.......... when you watch it anyways short little story background.My thoughts fun spectacular and exciting is what I call it was rather surprised that this film was good in story and good in intelligence the stunt work was absolutely amazing I give it that but the film just good with chess pieces going from a to z and it really felt like a good old spy film.

    "review": "  It is kind of amazing that this series has maintained itself as one of the more enjoyable action/adventure film series out there. It just tends to have a good little spy thriller plot with lots of goofy fun action scenes, and it never seems to take itself so seriously that you get annoyed with it. It knows it is ridiculous, and winks a little at you, but it never verges into camp territory...just a perfect tone for these kind of movies. The fact that they also employ lots of real stunts by Cruise is certainly a plus too. I'm not the biggest Cruise fan (as he is always playing Tom Cruise), but this series is really the perfect vehicle for him to play that Tom Cruise character and showcase his wacky stuntwork. This wasn't quite as good as the last film, but it was pretty close. I was glad they brought back most of the supporting cast from the last movie and gave Rhames a better role to play. My only complaint is that they seem to fallback on the \"we're all alone without Government backing for some reason or another\" trope. Just make an action/adventure and not need to be lone wolves having to prove the need for the IMF.",

The plot was kind of all over the place, like they usually are, but I could still follow what was going on. The nefarious \"bad guy\" organization is kind of generic, and not all that scary, but it works ok for the movie. Tom impresses me with how much he still does for these movies. I know he's in his 50's now, but you would never know it. My only real problem with the movie is that there is only one female character. ONE. It's a total guyfest outside of the one female agent. Sure, she's in the movie a lot, but it's still weird. Hopefully, if there's another one, they'll balance the scales a bit more.",

    "review": "  -Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is een 2015 Amerikaans actie spionnen film co-geschreven en geregisseerd door Christopher McQuarrie. Het is de vijfde film in de Mission: Impossible film serie. De film sterren Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris en Alec Baldwin met cruise, Renner,Pegg en Rhames hun rollen hernemend uit de vorige films. Rogue Nation wordt geproduceerd door Cruise, J. J. Abrams, en David Ellison van Skydance Productions. In de film, IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is op de vlucht voor de CIA, na de IMF-ontbinding als hij probeert te bewijzen het bestaan van het syndicaat, een internationale geheimzinnige terroristische consortium.--Kritische reactie:-Bij de herziening aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation heeft een waarde van 93% positieve reviews, gebaseerd op 261 reviews, met een gemiddelde score van 7,5/10. De site's kritische consensus luidt: \"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation blijft de franchise's spannende herleving - en bewijst dat Tom Cruise een ster blijft zonder gelijke.\" Metacritic geeft de film een score van 75 uit 100, gebaseerd op 46 critici, met vermelding \"algemeen gunstige beoordelingen\".Op CinemaScore, publiek heeft de film een soort \"A-\" op een A tot F-schaal.- Vervolg:-Op mei 2015, Paramount was de ontwikkeling van een zesde Mission: Impossible film met cruise, Abrams, Ellison en Goldberg terug te produceren, samen met Don Granger en Matt Grimm executive producering en Elizabeth Raposo toezicht op ontwikkeling. Kort voor de release van Rogue Nation, Cruise kondigde aan dat hij voor een zesde film zou terug keren, verklarend dat de productie in 2016 kan beginnen. Volgend Cruise's statement, Paramout bevestigd ook dat er een zesde film in opkomst is. In december 2015, McQuarrie kondigt aan dat hij zal terugkeren naar de zesde film voor de directie en Ferguson zal haar rol hernemen als Ilsa Faust ook.",

    "review": "  Tom Cruise is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. He's a movie star the way that Cary Grant was a movie star: pure class, pure suave, supercool, attractive. And like old Cary, he's not incredibly versatile. With a few exceptions, if Tom Cruise is in your movie, he'll be playing Tom Cruise, it doesn't matter what his character's name is. But he is always 100% committed to the role and gives it everything he's got. He also, and this point can't be overstated, looks hella cool when he runs, which is good because he runs a lot. Like, in almost every movie he does, he'll end up booking it at some point. It's super hard to run and look cool, believe me. Most people look ridiculous when they're clipping along at full speed. Not my boy Tom. In Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, Tom runs, but he also flies, speeds, fights, shoots, suffocates and dies. And given the fact that he is renowned for doing all his own stunts, he probably actually did die on set. MI:5 is a continuation of the last film, but only insofar as it is the next impossible mission the impossible mission's gang must face. Really, you could walk into MI:5 without having seen any of the previous films and be just fine. Like the TV show 24, each mission movie more or less stands as its own little novella, rather than as a chapter of a complete novel. This time around CIA grumpy pants Alec Baldwin goes before the Senate to have IMF shut down, complaining that the covert operatives are irresponsible and unneeded. The problem is, Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt has just discovered a rogue faction of the British Intelligence that effectively do what IMF does, but for evil rather than good. In order to keep on their trail and stop them before world domination can take place, Hunt goes rogue himself, with the CIA hot on his heels. Over the top action set pieces ensue. MI:5 is a hell of a lot of fun. There's a lot of talky talk, more so than I remember there being in the previous couple films, and as such the movie could have easily been ten minutes shorter and worked a little tighter. But the talking is sandwiched between sequences of such impressive action bravado that by the time you start to feel a little restless, you're hit with a 'wow' moment and forget all about it. Unfortunately that 'wow' factor is diluted a bit by the fact that all those cool set pieces have already been ruined in the trailer. Don't get me wrong, Tommy boy hanging from a cargo plane 5,000 feet above the solid ground is awe inspiring. As is his helmet-less high speed chase on a winding mountain on racing bikes. As is his high speed car chase through a busy city in some far off land. But all that insanity was in the trailer. I understand that the marketing department over at Paramount Pictures want to cause the mouths of millions of action fans to water, but far too often these days I check out a movie that looks awesome from its trailer, only to find that all the good bits were in that trailer (I'm looking at you Minions). Something the makers of these Impossible movies have going for them is that there is nothing they can come up with that is too far. When your whole franchise rests on the idea of each film being more impossible than the last, that pretty much gives you free range to throw that entire kitchen sink right on in there. In Rogue Nation, things certainly become pretty impossible for IMF. Of course, we know they will prevail, if for no other reason than that Tom Cruise had already signed on for a sixth instalment by the time this one hit the screens. But I can't say I felt the same sense of danger that I had with Ghost Protocol or MI:3. The problem is that there isn't as much substance in between the boomshuckaluck. Those talking scenes I mentioned are quite procedural and the love interest angle feels tacked on. As a result, this isn't a film that you will find yourself thinking about by the time your popcorn induced stomach ache has worn off. But, those are subjective quibbles and at the end of the day, if you're looking for a couple hours of high energy and high excitement, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is your ticket.",

Both are really nice, especially with the knowledge that Tom Cruise did them more or less for real.I just want something truly surprising to happen, not just more spy film fare. Like let's kill off the star or something... I don't know, with this franchise there's always just the safety that Tom Cruise is safe and that seems like a crutch.Either way, a pretty fun thrill ride - just not a reinvention of the wheel.",

    "review": "  McQuarrie is - despite his Oscar-winning script for the delightfully twisty THE USUAL SUSPECTS - a no-nonsense writer. Dude gets right to the point (see Valkyrie and Jack Reacher for examples.) Which is something this franchise needed. It's nice to have a fairly straightforward Mission: Impossible outing. However, when you don't have to piece the plot together it leaves ample time for nit-picking other details, namely the director's lack of experience. Yes, the film is filled with action and adventure, but it's a bit uneven, even rushed at times, and overall fails to stand out. Compared to the fun, ever-coiling tension of De Palma's outing, the sheer adrenaline of Abrams', and the masterful packaging of Brad Bird's, there's just nothing special here, aside from the increased use of Simon Pegg. (Though, to be fair, at least it doesn't fall into the trying-too-hard, over-the-top realm of embarrassment that John Woo's outing did.) It's still a solid spy movie, and I had fun watching it, but it fails to distinguish itself from its classmates, namely the Bond franchise. Maybe next time.Also, as much as I hate to say it, Alec Baldwin might be ruined for me. I don't think I'll ever be able to watch him in anything and not see Jack Donaghy. All of his scenes feel like they should be funny, which is a personal failing on my part... but it also pulled me out of the movie.",

    "review": "  Who would've thought the best movie of the Summer was gonna be one of the last and one of the least buzzed about? In this fifth installment in the series the IMF (now disbanded) must hunt down a league of rogue agents known as The Syndicate. As much as I love Mission Impossible III, I may have to give Rogue Nation a nudge to the top spot in the series. First off, the action. It is as intense and impressive as the trailers would suggest. The underwater mission will have you gasping for air yourself and the car chase rivals the creativity of chases we saw in Furious Seven earlier this year. Then there's the cast. Tom Cruise delivers as he always has in this series but it is even more impressive now that he is in his early fifties and still performing many of his own stunts. Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson stand out the most, both having a lot to do given these films are marketed as Cruise's vehicles. The rest of the cast fairs well enough, but those three actors have the most to do and none of them disappoint. From a technical standpoint MIRN is a beauty. Cinematographer Robert Elswit crafted some gorgeous shots in this thing. In fact, shortly into the film I took notice as to how every shot in the film seemed to be lined up meticulously. Eddie Hamilton deserves credit as well for his tight editing. Even at 131 minutes the movie \"cruises\" by. I really couldn't name a scene I would drop, the whole thing just grabs its audience and doesn't let go until the credits roll. Now to our new director-Christopher McQuarrie. After the success of Ghost Protocol, many were expecting Brad Bird to return for the sequel. Bird wanted to make Tomorrowland, and uber-producer J.J. Abrams (director of MI3) was too busy with Star Wars to direct (though he did produce). Cruise suggested his Jack Reacher director Christopher McQuarrie. I knew McQuarrie could handle the suspense and tension of the franchise. As for the action? I was unsure if Jack Reacher and Way of the Gun (his only previous directing efforts), while they contained action, were proof enough that he could take on the grand level of action required by this franchise. But I was glad to see a creative choice and someone I knew Cruise worked well with behind the camera. And boy did he prove he could handle the action. Like I said earlier, the action set pieces on display here are stunning. And what makes them all the better is the lack of noticeable CGI. The filmmakers worked hard to use as many practical effects as they could and it shows, really adding to the realistic feel and making the movie all the more intense. I guess if I had to complain about something it would be score. The majority of the score just feels like rehashes of old MI movies and videogames. While a familiar MI music cue here and there is to be expected, the lack of truly original music is a bit disappointing. Still, minor complaint in a spectacle this enjoyable. Personally, I saw this on an IMAX screen. Now, it serves the big screen well. But what really stands out in the theater is the sound. This is some very impressive sound editing and mixing. So, if you're not going to see it on a large-format screen like IMAX or BigD, just make sure you seek a theater that has exceptional sound quality. I don't care if you're not a fan of the franchise, if you're not a fan of Cruise, if the trailers didn't impress you-stop making excuses. If you like action, if you like spy thrillers, this is the movie for you. 9/10",

    "review": "  It's a slick, fast moving machine that never takes itself too seriously. Tom Cruise is on top form as he seemingly always is, even this far into his career he still performs incredible stunts and conjures up on-screen charisma like its nothing. Newcomer Rebecca Ferguson provides a solid screen presence and gives it her all, never going autopilot and letting Cruise (control) take over. Comedic relief is not given to one particular character, which would have been quite easy with an actor like Simon Pegg at your disposal. Instead, Alec Baldwin and Jeremy Renner get many chances to stretch their comedic muscles, and it doesn't need to be said that in the case of Baldwin this is always a good thing. Ving Rhames makes a brief appearance as Luther Stickell, although I was quite disappointed he wasn't utilised more. He is another actor with impressive comedic talent, as seen in his single-handed saving of Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead, and I think they perhaps could have had more of him instead of just having him there as a callback to the original films and giving him his paycheck and then pulling a disappearing act.The action is inventive, intertwined with comedy, and performed with a kinetic energy that never runs out. Sean Harris as the villain doesn't do much outside of looking sinister, but he does that well enough. The story takes the much used \"the IMF is being disbanded\" plot device but tinkers with it enough to make it new. Its fun, its a 2 hour ride with characters you'll wish you were friends with, its sizzling entertainment at the movies.",

You best believe they pulled out all the stops for this one with great performances from Cruise, Pegg and Ferguson it's hard to go wrong.

That's why I welcome this movie, it refreshing to see a well done action movie that's funny, dramatic, emotional and with good directing.

All the set pieces were great and you could really feel the intensity coming off the screen. The stakes felt very high, because his friends were on the line instead of the world. We always know that the bad guy won't be able to conquer the world, but we don't know if he can take out lovable characters in the process. The villain this time around was actually pretty decent, considering the mission impossible series never really had one. Overall, this movie was one of the best action movies of the year and I hope Tom Cruise keeps doing what he does best.",

A genuine roller-coaster ride, with an engrossing blend of action, humor and suspenseful intrigue. The cast is excellent throughout; Rebecca Ferguson is a particular standout as Ethan Hunt's foil. The plot is twisty and keeps you guessing. Incredible, impossible setups deliver great payoffs throughout. I don't think there was a boring frame in the entire film.Tom Cruise deserves special mention. Think what you want to about his personal life, but there is no other star actor working today who puts this much commitment and dedication into his craft. He plays his character to absolute perfection, and lends great authenticity by performing his own stunts. The airplane scene featured on the poster really happens, and it's really Cruise clinging to the side of that airplane, and it is breathtaking to watch. No visual effects, no CGI, just reality. Amazing.Only Mad Max beats this movie in the action category this year. A must-see for all action movie fans.",

These came in abundance, and whilst it was annoying not being able to decide which side certain characters were on, it did keep me guessing until the very end.

There was absolutely nothing new in terms of story, where the IMF has been compromised and an evil organization is going to take it over.Tom Cruise tries to exhilarate the audience again. While there are a few intense moments, with death-defying stunts, Rogue Nation offers little new to the Mission Impossible Series. It is merely another inconsequential action movie.",

Like Mad Max, this fifth part offers some of the best action sequences that you can see in this year and many of them with little CGI (although Mad Max is still the King of this year) I insist, is excellent, fun, exciting, innovative and addictive, one of the best films of this year, but does not exceed its predecessor: GHOST PROTOCOL.Review en Espa�ol:Rogue Nation no es tan divertida como Ghost Protocol, pero mantiene la esencia pura, cl�sica y �nica que solo Misi�n Imposible puede ofrecer.

    "review": "  Mission Impossible is turning out to be one of those rare franchises that just keeps getting better. I wasn't a huge fan of the first two films, but when J.J. Abrams came on board for the third he set the series in the right direction. The fifth entry, Rogue Nation, takes everything that worked about the previous films and manages to raise the bar even higher. What makes this series stand out from Bourne and similar films in the genre is the sense of fun and humour these later sequels have (bringing Simon Pegg into the mix sure didn't hurt). Rogue Nation delivers in every way possible...an engaging script, beautiful locations, great performances, plenty of twists, jaw-dropping stunts. As impressive as it is seeing 53-year-old Tom Cruise strap himself to a plane as it takes off, it's actually newcomer Rebecca Ferguson who steals every scene she's in. Crazy action, tons of fun, great story...Mission Impossible is becoming that summer blockbuster franchise that knows how to do everything right, and it definitely gets my vote for one of the year's best films.",

    "review": "  The Mission Impossible has come a long way from the days of pointless action and ludicrous plot to a new breed of spy that has its own ground...This new MI dares to go bold, to go do thing where...well some has been done before but we miss it so muchThe new James Bond series with Daniel Craig has been about realism and fewer gadgets. But with MI you see all the amazing and cartoonish gadgets we once loved in James BondThe truth is that MI is basically now a mix of modern spy with the goofiness of the old ones. In fact, it's what SPECTRE wanted to be but couldn't. Although, a little more serious then it would be SPECTREThe new MI is unique to itself the action the dialogues the villain...oh the villain.Truthfully I can't think of any other villain in MI history who has been this calculating, this intimidating and it's a shame that he has so many few scenes. But whenever he is there, he steals the show.And let's not forget Rebecca Ferguson who is a tremendous addition and I love to see her again. True, she doesn't have much chemistry with Tom Cruise but in the movie it's never implied that they love each other or have feelings anyway. They just flirt. And that's fine. Kind of needed. Not every woman is for doing it.The rest of the cast are kind of sidelined and only there as plot devices but nevertheless they do their jobs well. Especially Simon Pegg who is real heart of this series.As for the conflict between CIA and MI, well I wanted that to have more depth and be more complex as the concerns were again raised and actually happened in this movie but well, it didn't and it's a missed opportunity.Of course the main plot and theme is what it has been for five movies so far but, well we kinda expected it didn't we? Mission Impossible Rogue Nation combines imaginary and lunatic action and creates amazing scenes even though there's no way Tom Cruise would survive that backflip in BMW or even walk away with no blood!!! But still, that's what I meant by being a mix of old and newTrue, Mission Impossible IS taking a lot of cues from new James Bond movies and it's obvious. Especially the Villain and...this one I had to say.... BMW that opens to fingerprint and someone else tries and fails??? That handgun in Skyfall? Anyone??While it takes many cues from Skyfall and others I don't mind it that much because it helps them progress and it's fineIf MI series' next movie uses another great villain that has some screen time or the same villain we saw here but in bigger capacity. And uses awesome action like it did with this movie...I think we may have another winner too.Frankly, MI should remain goofy with a lot of action. No deep storytelling because well, never established anything that mysterious and then again...this is Mission Impossible...let's be crazy!Overall, this movie achieves what Ghost Protocol did and created something that on some grounds falls short of Ghost Protocol and some grounds raises the bar.While it raised the bar in Villain, threat, women and of course actionIf failed at keeping the attractive realism, stop rehashing stuff or \"inspirations\" and not using a great villain.But still, the twists, the mystery the action made this Mission Impossible one to remember for a long time...until next one comes out anyway.Great Job and Congrats to all who made this movie. You made a modern James Bond of the Old.Impressed and hope next one will do the same.",

    "review": "  Cruise's Ethan Hunt could so easily have gone down the way of a US version of the pompous James Bond, yet like Cruise himself, there is just something about the MI films that make them so entertaining without even seeming like its trying.Wisely, Rouge Nation sets up what is arguably the films biggest set piece - that insane plane scene you saw in the trailer - right at the beginning of the film. Go big or go home as the saying goes... and Cruise does it well. He continually reminds us throughout Rouge Nation that he is part of that dying breed of cinema actor, one who is willing to commit to the project at all costs.That gusto is part of what makes Rouge Nation so much fun. The movie doesn't stretch the imagination of the espionage narrative too far, so it's the witty banter between the characters, the great action scenes that anchor the enjoyment of the film and the air of effortless tongue-in-cheek acknowledgement of the ridiculousness of the plot throughout Mission Impossible that always makes this hard to resist.",

    "review": "  Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is probably my favorite so far in the series. It is nothing original, but simply the manifestation of perfected formula. It's characters, plot elements and many ideas were handpicked from a bin of action movie cliches, but they are gathered together to create a film with undeniable style. It has very sharp, elegant visuals of high tech heists and high class operas coupled with a thrilling, subtly dark energy. We've seen everything in this movie many times before, but it's so well-done here that it's hard to criticize. It has genuinely awesome, gripping action sequences, such as the shootout at the opera, the replacement of the chip in the underwater vault and the final chase scene that ends with Lane in a glass box, which was brilliant. Part of the reason the film succeeds is also its intelligence. Instead of performing crazy stunts and blowing up everything, the impossible mission here involves making very clever decisions in the face of difficult circumstances. The film makes you think, something few action films do.The acting is good, but generic and there are little dashes of humor here and there along with some seldom hiccups of awkward/corny dialogue. Ethan Hunt is hard to relate to because he is such a mythic, unrealistic character, \"the manifestation of destiny\". He gets away with everything. The narrative is largely derivative because you know at the end everything will tie up into a perfect knot. Another strength of the film is the leading lady because she is the most complex character in the film. She provides an intriguing and emotionally engaging performance, unlike the stock action heroes the film is populated with. We relate to her because she's caught in limbo between two sides and we can't figure out who's side she's on. She's also a talented fighter who's capable of defending herself in a film dominated by men. It's refreshing to see a strong female role in an action film and Rebecca Ferguson brings grace and cool confidence to the movie.",

The formula doesn't feel tired yet, and with plenty of twists, great betrayals and character moments, I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. The movie does have some shortcomings, however. The villain is a caricature, and I frankly didn't find him very threatening. We don't get the sense of scope that previous M:I films have provided, so the stakes don't feel as high. With that said, the script is great, with lots of funny quips, as well as a new character, played by Rebecca Ferguson, who feels right at home in the ensemble. If you haven't already, check this one out for a quick witted action film that is a feast on the eyes, as well as an intelligent take on the well worn spy genre. 4 out of 5 stars.",

He may say and do some crazy stuff off screen, but he proves on screen why he is the best and biggest action movie star ever. He is supported by Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg, who delivers excellent performances as always, with the right mix of seriousness and craziness. Rebecca Ferguson is thrown in to the plot as well, as a motivated MI-6 agent. Tom and the boys needs a lady to look at after all, and if she fight and shoot as well, all the better.

Each review takes one positive aspect, such as the leading actress Rebecca Ferguson doing an astoundingly well done job with the script given, and then proceeds to ignore the rest of the film such as the awkward and clunky dialogue or maybe that the entire antagonist organisation and it's creation makes no sense. The film and it's recognizable actors sole responsibility is to prop up Tom Cruise's ego.

It outdoes the 4th film by all means because it not only provides action and stunts, but also has a bit of sense in it and it's well directed, better than Brad Bird's direction. Tom Cruise, although visibly aged, still is very very impressive in this film. Simon Pegg gets a better opportunity as an actor in this film and Rebecca Ferguson is far far better than 4th film's Paula Patton or 3rd film's Michelle Monaughan. Unlike it's predecessor, it has a villain with some identity and is definitely the best villain since the second film although the same in here cannot match the excellence of Jon Voight in MI or the villain in the 2nd film.",

Christopher McQuarrie takes care of scriptwriting duties too, and that's good...but not great. It's definitely not \"The usual suspects\" he's written, this time around. The film loses in pace in the second half, as there's too much dialogue, and although McQuarrie's been great in the past, he's definitely not Tarantino or David Mamet. As a director he's just competent, not always getting the pace right and using videogame-stylized action...Anyway, with all the talent wisely chosen, Tom Cruise proves he's still the best producer for studio genre in Hollywood nowadays ady lost her battle(Kathleen Kennedy has already lost her battle, before ep.VII is released, just by hiring Michael Arndt for a sci-fi script, and then Rian Johnson and Colin Trevorrow for eps.

The only thing that bothered me about it is the fact that in many scenes somehow, they made Cruise look like an aged lesbian and though its hilarious, it takes me out of the film from time to time. The film itself is pretty dope doh and Rebecca Ferguson is some kinda gorgeous creature.",

    "review": "  Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is the series' most physically robust movie to date, but it's not the best overall Mission. The movie feels always on the precipice of overindulging in the physical and underwhelming in the drama, but even as the Action is easily tops in the franchise, the filmmakers muster just enough supportive content -- thanks in large part to Sean Harris' terrific work -- to build and maintain an equilibrium that keeps the movie, and the franchise, feeling fresh.",

    "review": "  This is the best Mission Impossible yet! Everything in this movie works, from the fantastic, edge of your seat opening, to the incredible finale, this movie is awesome. The action scenes are well filmed and well directed. It doesn't rely on quick cuts and closeups like a lot of action movies rely on. Director Christopher McQuarrie is perfect behind the camera and was a very good choice to helm this movie. The highlight of the movie has to be an incredible car/motorcycle chase in the middle of the movie. It's so well filmed as well as being captivating and thrilling. The movie benefits a lot from starring Tom Cruise. He is one of the most dedicated actors and because he does 95% of his own stunts, the movie is able to use better shots during action scenes instead of having to figure out ways of hiding the stunt double's face.Speaking of Cruise, the performances are excellent. In addition to his expert stunt work, Cruise gives a stellar performance. You can tell he cares a lot about the role and he gives a very strong performance. Simon Pegg is also very good. He doesn't get enough credit as a dramatic actor. He plays a lot of comedies, he's often the comedic relief, but he is also a great dramatic actor. Go back and watch Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, and while those are comedies, during the \"dramatic parts\" you can tell he has some chops. Here he shows it again. He has some acting chops on him. The other one that needs mentioning is Rebecca Ferguson. She is also very good as a conflicted spy and she's very engaging to watch.The only negative is that the villain was not that amazing. He was good, but he could have been slightly better. He was better than the last villain, but not nearly as good as Phillip Seymour Hoffman in MI3. But it works for this movie.Overall, this is a fun, smart, and fantastic adrenaline ride. It's one of the best movies so far this year and I highly recommend it.",

It has a nice plot , gripping moments , some spectacular action sequences and strong performances from the leads. This is one of the few movies where the visual effects are invisible , it blends perfectly. One of the eye catching moment is the opening scene - short but really an eye-pleaser. Tom Cruise really bent his back for the movie . The cinematography is extremely well fitted for the movie with rich colors and nice establishing shots . Although some might argue that the script slagged in the second act with a slightly long and ultimately pointless action sequence , it is never the less fun to watch . It's overall a well paced story which will keep many on the edge of their seats. \"The best spy movie of the year\"- in my opinion",

    "review": "  \"Desperate Times. Desperate Measures.\"En la quinta entrega, Misi�n Imposible logra mantenerse m�s vigente que nunca. Rogue Nation toma todos los aspectos exitosos de las anteriores y nos entrega una pel�cula con confianza en todos los aspectos. Ethan (Tom Cruise) junto a Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), se embarcan en esta aventura imposible para destapar la existencia de la c�lula terrorista llamada \"El Sindicato\" y �ltimamente derrotarla.Rogue Nation te mantiene al filo de tu asiento de principio a fin. Todas las escenas de acci�n tienen el balance prfecto de ingenio y aventura , y como siempre es admirable el compromiso de Tom Cruise hacia su actuaci�n y especialmente las escenas de acci�n, las cuales realiza en su totalidad. Una vez mas demuestra su calidad de estrella y encuentra su complemento perfecto en Natascha Ferguson, quien lidera la pel�cula al mismo nivel de Cruise y es sin duda de los mejores personajes femeninos que ha tenido estas pel�culas. Tiene el balance perfecto entre femineidad y badass, y la qu�mica entre ella y Cruise es explosiva. Simon Pegg como Benji le da el balance perfecto de humor a la pel�cula, pero sabe hasta que punto llevarlo de modo que no es excesivo, y es tambi�n un componente importante de el �xito de la misi�n.La direcci�n de Christopher McQuarrie es impecable. Todas las secuencias son notables, pero se destaca la escena en la �pera. La coreograf�a de toda la escena es impresionante y es donde Ilsa demuestra de lo que es capaz. Otras notables son la escena bajo el agua y la pelea de cuchillos donde Ilsa muestra unos movimientos impresionantes, con Londres de noche como trasfondo, con un aire misterioso y peligroso.Rogue Nation se destaca porque por primera vez muestra a Ethan como un personaje vulnerable. De hecho, en distintas instancias temes por su vida y es salvado numerosas veces por las personas alrededor de �l, y eso le brinda a la pel�cula una dimensi�n realista, dentro de todas estas escenas imposibles. Rogue Nation es el ejemplo perfecto de como hacer una secuela exitosa. Se trata de reinventarla, tal como lo logro R�pido y Furioso, donde son conscientes de el tipo de pel�cula que son y explotan sus fortalezas. Definitivamente de mis pel�culas faovritas este a�o, que ha sido notable para los blockbusters.",

Anyways the movie is great Tom Cruise is amazing in here; Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson were the surprises of the film; Jeremy Renner :/ the spy thing don't suit him and he should know that after Bourne...It is a good movie, I had a good time and I'll give it an 8/10.",

Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation I've saw so many people bash this film, I don't believe the ones bashing it have even watched it; this is the best out of the entire batch of Mission Impossible Films. Now I must point out the fact that the Stars listed for this movie are a bit off as if it werent for Rebecca Ferguson, Jeremy Renner,Simon Pegg, and Sean Harris; this film would be as bad as the others.Mission Impossible films have sort of continued to go down hill, I mean they were down hill long before resurrecting them with Tom Cruise; but come on, Tom Cruise isn't the top gun anymore. The top billing cast in this Mission Impossible were Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Jeremy Renner, and Sean Harris; without these guys the film wouldve flopped.Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation has an actual story-line more than the others, the script was so much more together than rushed to give Mr Cruise all the lines, and the action is nonstop. Best one yet by far.",

    "review": "  Good, tight plot, solid action sequences (although I think it does not quite match up, overall, to \"Ghost Protocol\") and the usual charming performance by Cruise and Co. makes it a worthwhile ride.With that said, its lofty promises are somewhat unfulfilled. The titular \"Rogue Nation\" is more of a rogue special-ops team. Which is fine, it is just a retread of ideas that have been done, and I expect will be done similarly in the upcoming 007 \"Spectre\" film. You've got well-funded, highly trained and very secret organization run by a fanatic. It's not the same as an actual nation-state going 'rogue' and ultimately, the handful of agents have inconsequential effect on the outcome... and thus the overall threat seems illusory in the end. Especially compared to, you know, actual nuclear damnation. And of course Ethan Hunt and the MI team have been disavowed, split up, and are themselves going rogue. Wait isn't that how it goes in like, *every* movie? Ghost protocol had the advantage of not delving much into the villain's motives and letting his threat speak for itself, whereas this one seems to *want* to explain the villain's motives, and it attempts to do so, and it focus on the villain quite a bit, but he never really becomes a full character. Right. So perhaps this is just what you'd expect, and what is interesting is that this time the consequences become much more personal, as instead of a plot threatening the world or, at least, very important people, the consequences are very personal.",

The action scenes are fantastic, especially the chasing scenes, one of the best chasing scenes in an action film. This is how you make an action film w/o those shaky cams and shitty camera angles. I love the story telling, I love the script ( accurate for a PG film ). And we know MI films is an action espionage with those fancy gadgets and all and this one just nailed every bit of it. The opera scene reminds me of God Father III scene with an attitude. And the motorcycle chasing scene is one of the best fast paced high octane action scene I've seen in a very long time. Tom Cruise is love! His charisma really shines in this film. Rebecca Ferguson is a badass hottie. McQuarrie nailed this one and I can't wait for the sequel! MOre more!",

The plot is convoluted and blithering in the same way that drags down so many politics-minded actioners/thrillers these days, from Nolan's stuff to Skyfall to Sherlock to other things that don't come to mind. It dresses up a weakly-realized cartoon supervillain (who literally shoots one of his own henchman for no reason cuz he's mad I guess. he does that thing. that thing. in 2015) in grown-up political thriller clothes, and overloads the story with stuffy airs, at the expense of efficiency, tautness, and, ironically, believability. The exposition gets really, really fucking dumb at times, with Hunt at one point rambling like a 16 year old Baby's First Conspiracy theorist (he says \"it's all connected\"). It's overlong by 40 minutes, and has literally like 2 action set pieces, both of which were in the trailer and both of which underwhelm hard imo. The opera house sequence was pretty good, and the knife fight toward the end was fine, but daymn is this movie just boring most of the time. The thriller machinations feel completely stale throughout. I thought Rebecca Ferguson was really great in it though, she was defo the highlight 4 me. Ghost Protocol is still great.",

I think Ghost Protocol is still the best one to me, but Rogue Nation is still a great follow up to perhaps the best movie in the series. Rogue Nation at least mostly keeps pace with Ghost Protocol. Although it feels like the same story as all of them (they always seem to have to go off the books - or \"rogue\" if you will - even in their own secret secret organization). The underwater sequence was probably the highlight, it felt different enough to stand out from all the other great sequences in the movies. Llsa Faust was a solid character, and the actress was very good, although I mistook her for Ruth Wilson. This was probably the most humorous installment as well, which is not surprising since the movie has the most of Simon Pegg that we've gotten, but actually it's Tom Cruise's reactions I found the funniest. It's nice he got to have a little more fun than he usually did in having to be the straight man in having to play it more serious. Look forward to the next one, and I always have faith in Cruise as a producer/choosing his projects.",

So yes, this one fell a little short for me.� I became a big fan of MI when they rebooted the unfortunately short-lived TV series in the late 80's.� I'm a sucker for ensemble pieces, and MI is the pinnacle of that concept:� a group of people, each with a particular skill-set, joining together to overcome ridiculous odds and achieve a common goal (this is also why I loved The Avengers, Ocean's Eleven, even The Goonies).� IMF was a team, and they were all badass.� Hence, I was disappointed when they started making the MI films because, with the exception of the first 15 minutes of the first film,�there is never a team - it's just the superhuman Ethan Hunt running around and doing everything himself.� Then came \"Ghost Protocol\", and I was so happy... the team was back!� And they were badass!� I was hoping for more of the same with this film, and sadly, it did not deliver.� The same team is there (with the exception of Paula Patton, who is inexplicably absent and is never even mentioned in the movie... but there is another chick in this one, and these movies have a strict one-chick limit), but they aren't given the opportunity to do anything cool.� They just hang around and let Ethan do all the cool stuff.� For this reason, I was disappointed.� That being said, it's still a really fun action movie.� It's exactly the same formula as all the other films, but somehow it still works.� It's like a Bond film: the situations are ridiculous and most of it doesn't make a lick of sense, but you can still sit back and enjoy it for the fun ride that it is.� Tom Cruise may be a nutcase, but he's one hell of an action star.� The supporting cast is great too, particularly Simon Pegg, who gives the film both its heart and its humor.� It's a fun summer action flick and worth a trip to theater, but \"Ghost Protocol\" will continue to be the only film from this franchise to have a place on my shelf.",

    "review": "  A somewhat less action-packed sequel, but that totally is a great and critical movie-flick.Mission Impossible is back, with Tom Cruise still hanging around with his great performance to action and acting. Rouge Nation starts pretty fast with a stunning opening-sequence and a beautiful first act that's touching, artistic and beautiful. Simon Pegg co-stars as the somewhat newcomer to the spy-genre and contributes in his own funny & entertaining way. The plot progresses in a less action-packed version, and it place more energy to dialogs and chemistry between characters rather than on action. It's one thing that might be boring for some, and awesome to others. For me was it a somewhat boring ride with all the dry dialogs and more talking than doing. But the dialogs are of course still very good even though that there are some classic \"obvious reaction dialogs\" and that I expected more action. The action that is present is on the other hand very intense and somewhat unique. Some of them stands out as a brand and original concept, meanwhile others are the same that we've already seen. Rouge Nation is a very stunning and, on my behalf, a critically acclaimed movie that got many things from strong actors to a well written story. The villain however, got no depth, and some of the minor characters are so non-existing due to lack of plot-details around them. Some of them are just there for a specific reason to enlighten the power of the film. Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation is still a great movie, even though I was deeply disappointed due to lack of action and a less interesting plot that made the dialogs a bit dry. The plot is still slightly unique, even though I expected more due to the trailers, but the humor is still what I was hoping for! So random and hilarious!It's obviously a disappointment from my point of view because the movie isn't that much more intense than the trailers, and it's not that rememberable neither. I expected a lot more, even though it really is a stunning and critically great action-flick with exquisite acting, a well written script and well visualized characters.Personal rating: 70/10Critical rating: 80/10",

For his age, Cruise is a revelation in the industry. He constantly impresses the viewer by participating in intricate stunt set pieces. On the whole, Rogue Nation is a great summer movie.",

As you expect, like in this kind movie, the world must be saved from a rogue super secret organization (the Syndicate) and it's time for Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his pals with \"a particular set of skills\" (and gadgets of course) to save him.. but now with a twist.. the own IMF is in danger. Your mission in this film (if you wish to accepted it) is to see 2 hours of mind blowing set action pieces and have some fun in between.. like always in each exotic place we have a action scene (the longest and coolest is in Morocco). Althought the plot sometimes get a little dumb.. and super very predictable in the final half hour - at least for me, it's never boring and the actors (except Ving Rhames, he's out of the place) all do their best to keep up the momentum. In the year when all the action movies live in the shadow of the gargantuan Mad Max, it's nice to see a good action movie taking 2 hours of your life..The Good: Tom Cruise is da best!!! That man is so ridiculous in shape that it gets so rydiculous by it self. The good and ironic humour..The Bad: at some point the plot is somewhat predictable.... looks like the franchise is loosing the steam, althought it's allready confirmed another one.The Ugly: JUST WAIT!

I mean, Benji is cute and likable, but for an \"Impossible Mission Force\" it seems like they've got some seriously lightweight, B-movie characters. Anyway, it's yet another absolutely impossible situation that somehow a perfect-in-every-way character manages to resolve.

Most top-flight film franchises flame out by the third rendezvous (Hello, Godfather). If Live Free or Die Hard was a passable two-plus hours of blow-up-stuff escapism, the fifth lap for detective John McLane was deplorably brutal. Dearest Bruce, it's time to retire the NYPD badge. Mission Impossible's fifth installment, though, bucks the trend and nails every frame the way Ghost Protocol did. At no point does Cruise as mind and ass-kicking IMF agent Ethan Hunt veer into washed up action star territory. He remains THE man. Even when the plot curve balls become calculable, they are just as hard to hit and just as mesmerizing when they unfold. Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin and especially Simon Pegg are outstanding as supporting cast members. Still, it's Cruise who captains perhaps the most reliable ship in Hollywood. In a cinematic world overrun by second-rate sequels that offer nothing more than batting practice, Rogue Nation is, against all logic, a bleeping no hitter.",

    "review": "  Mission Impossible: Keep Building Up a Franchise While Adding An Artistic ToneIt's hard to make a good spy movie nowadays. It feels as though everything has practically been done already. With a franchise like Mission Impossible, which tries to top itself with every successive film, the audience's expectation bar is set even higher. However, what defines a regular moviemaker from an artist is that an artist always strives to go beyond. In that sense Christopher McQuarrie might have taken the first step to be considered an \"auteuristic\" director; of course we can't really define a director based on only one film, but his most recent outing: Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation certainly projects high hopes for his future. Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation tries to raise the stakes like no other M.I. film has done before. That's why the film starts with the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) being not only hunted down by a terrorist nation known as 'The Syndicate,\" but also being shut-down by its own government after the many protests of the handling of missions from the CIA chief Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). The IMF's top agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) goes rogue after IMF is shutdown because of the CIA's unwillingness to believe the existence of \"The Syndicate.\" Ethan Hunt must go solo with the help of a few of disavowed IMF members including Benji (Simon Pegg), Brandt (Jeremy Renner), and Luther (Ving Rhames) to show the world the threat they keep denying.  But people go to M.I. movies in order to see extreme missions that are well.... impossible. The last outing had Ethan Hunt climb the tallest tower in the world. To top that (pun intended) there are two stunning scenes in Rogue Nation; one near the beginning of the film has Hunt clinging to a plane's wing as it takes off (a stunt that Tom Cruise pulled off on his own); and the other has Hunt hold his breath under water for three whole minutes to change a memory stick in an enormous cooling cylinder with an incredibly strong current. So this film does its job and tops the other great M.I. stunts seen in M.I. 3 and M.I. Ghost Protocol. But that's not what surprised me. What really surprised me was the incredible balance that director McQuarrie was able to achieve. He held off the action sequences long enough so that they didn't burn out quickly, something that other action films pour in excess and make us lose interest and admiration in the stunts and choreography. The comedy also was toned down a bit from the last film. Simon Pegg's comic relief is more accurate due to less quantity and more quality. I certainly was fearing that the franchise and their comedic take might have taken a wrong turn and move towards the cheesy Fast and Furious style, but McQuarrie was able to stabilize that. The director also was able to make the film smart. What I mean by that is that the decisions taken by the agents aren't the predictable sort you get in your typical movies; the characters actually looked as though they were highly trained and their quick thinking and innovation catch the audience off-guard and it certainly surprises us and reminds us of why we enjoy spy movies in the first place. Finally there was a round of hommages that McQuarrie features throughout his film. Ranging from a thrilling opera sequence similar to that of Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, to a play with names and character arcs paying tribute to Casablanca in very subtle ways. As for acting Tom Cruise more than holds his own. His intense performance shows us that he is truly an eternal movie star who still has it in him to keep up with us. Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner are both solid as well, but the real revelation here was Rebecca Ferguson. Rebecca Ferguson plays Ilsa Faust whose allegiance the characters and audience are always doubting (is she a double agent? Triple agent?) It's hard to act your character acting under pressure, and Ferguson makes it look so easy! Not only that, but she manages to keep you guessing where her loyalties truly lie until McQuarrie finally deems it opportune to let you know. Such an actor is any director's dream. I also enjoyed how she wasn't at all used as a romantic interest at any point; she was equally as important and significant as Ethan or Benji's characters, something that is sadly not common with female roles. So in the end not only are there various auteur brush-strokes throughout this movie, but you also see McQuarrie raise a franchise's already high level and we enjoy a set of incredibly great performances. Indeed it is an extremely enjoyable film. It's just a bit sad (or not) that you stop believing that any impossible missions exist.",

    "review": "  Rogue Nation continued on the fast paced and action packed world of the Mission Impossible franchise. Tom Cruise is his usual stunt loving self, and knowing that he actually hooked himself onto the side of the plane as it took off was a great thing to watch. Other actors would have shied away from such a daunting task but he seems to thrive on the danger. Simon Pegg brings his usual comical character back into the game and puts it alongside the returning characters of Ving Rhames, and Jeremy Renner to get some wonderful scenes. Of course a Mission Impossible film would not be the same without a couple of tense and worried moments thrown in, and this does not disappoint. There is one scene specifically which will have you holding your breath hoping for it all to pan out well. I think that they keep managing to pull a very good film out of the bag, despite the initial worries I have when they announce that they are making another one. If they keep making them like this then I say long may they continue.",

    "review": "  Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation is the fifth instalment in the long running Mission: Impossible franchise and just when you thought they couldn't get any better Tom Cruise returns to prove that he is still one of the best action stars and that this franchise is still one of best in the action genre. But he couldn't do it alone, with the aid of an incredibly strong and entertaining supporting cast, very likeable characters and an entertaining plot, this is definitely a must see in the spy thriller genre. When it comes to high octane action set pieces, no-one does it better than Mission Impossible. The absolutely extreme stunts and high speed chases return in full force and take the franchise to new 'heights' and 'depths' (literally) and with Ethan Hunt at the helm, the IMF have a new covert operation on their hands. The stunts and action set pieces in this film are awesome to watch you have your fair share of fast paced shootouts and chases and also your more low-key dangerous stunts, all of which were gripping, intense and had you on the edge of your seat. The fact that realism is mostly out of the question when dealing with these stunts really helps to up the stakes and gives the writers and director more creative freedom to wow us in as many ways as possible. The team from Ghost Protocol has returned in this film and i think it was a great thing to keep Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, and Ving Rhames together in this film because their chemistry comes through so well in the film and you really get behind these guys. Their characters are always funny when they need to be and badass when required making for some fun, humorous moments that keep the mood very light amidst all of the intense action scenes. The villain of the film i thought was very strong also, 'they' weren't a moustache twirling evil mastermind, they actually had some interesting and mysterious qualities that kept me more engaged in the film. The performances were all incredible and convincing, even from newcomer Rebecca Ferguson as Isla Faust who adds a lot to the film in terms of stunts and especially in terms of plot. Speaking of the plot, i thought it definitely was a very well thought out plot with a lot of pieces and hints throughout that all come together in the finale. It seems to have been very intricately planned out and isn't just one of your throwaway stop the bad guy plots. There are a few organisations and characters that you have to keep track of in order to completely follow where the story is going. And i have to admit, the strength and focus on having this very well thought out story caught me off guard a few times especially towards the beginning and later on towards the end. I went in half expecting to see some mindless action and fun with some form of easy to follow story that tied the whole film together, but i realised fairly early on that it was going to need some concentration. Once i managed to understand what was going on and who exactly the multiple parties going at each other were it all began to make sense and was pretty interesting and entertaining. I am not saying you can't go into this film and watch it just for the fun and action but just be warned that during the story centred scenes and the resolution at the end you will be very lost and maybe even bored. But it's tough to knock this down too much for anything story related as it accomplishes everything a Mission: Impossible film sets out to do; great action and stunts, characters you know and love and a plot to tie it all together. If you are a fan of the franchise, no doubt you have already seen it, but incase you had any doubts, this is definitely a good, fun time at the theatres. - 8/10P.S, I have to say i am incredibly impressed with the action spy thriller genre this year, we have had 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E', now this and 'Spectre' later in the year, all very different and all very great (Spectre excluded).",

    "review": "  Believe it or not, until now I have never seen a Mission Impossible film. While I love action films, the premise just never appealed to me, but when I heard Christopher McQuarrie would be Directing this latest one, I had to see it. McQuarrie, the brains behind Persons Unknown, always tells imaginative stories, that while aren't that believable, are still extremely entertaining. In the fifth installment of Mission Impossible, the franchise is anything but stale as it is every bit as fast paced and extreme as I thought. I was expecting the action and for Tom Cruise to play his usually arrogant self, but what I wasn't expect was just how intense and in depth the story was. There is also the villain to consider, who was so much better than I hoped he'd be. I had always thought of Mission Impossible as sort of a mix between Get Smart and James Bond, and was presently surprised to learn that I was way off base. Rogue Nation is actually a very clever story, that isn't is as comical or as over the top with espionage as I thought it would be. In fact, the only thing that really was what I expected was Tom Cruise. While he's not my favorite actor, he's not a bad one either, I just never liked the fact that every character he plays is just so full of themselves. No matter the situation, Ethan Hunt was always so sure he had all the answers and knew exactly what to do, and even when he was wrong it didn't deter him from getting right back into it. Rogue Nation taught me a lesson I never seem to get, in that you really can't judge a book by it's cover. Certain stories may appear to be one thing, but you can never know for sure unless you sit down and watch them.",

And, the fact he has somehow kept life in an actual action sequel. They should meld this action series with the present super hero genre. Would love to see the Avengers partner up with the IMF.",

    "review": "  After nearly two decades of globetrotting and thwarting the malignant plans of terrorist organizations as a member of the IMF, Tom Cruise reprises his role as special agent Ethan Hunt in 'Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation.' In his fifth case, Hunt and his rag-tag teammates (including Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) are thrown a curveball when the IMF is disbanded, making their task of hunting down the infamous Syndicate rogue nation of terrorists that much harder. Along their travels, which take them to exotic locales from Austria to Morocco, Hunt and co cross paths with Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), a beautiful MI6 agent who is doubling as a member of the Syndicate. As you might imagine, there are all sorts of action-packed sequences, witty dialogue and comic relief (mostly at the expense of Pegg) and a killer soundtrack that help propel 'Rogue Nation' along.At the center of 'Rogue Nation' is a plot that has many different layers, with each one being peeled back to unearth another as the core team delves deeper into the plans of the Syndicate. There is a combination of cutting-edge technology, high-speed chases through narrow streets and crazy stunts - particularly the opening scene with the takeoff and the daredevil dive into the waterlogged security safe. In this sense, there are few aspects of the film that disappoint.It may not be the most groundbreaking spy-driven action drama, but 'Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation' delivers exactly what is expected of it - nothing more, nothing less.",

    "review": "  I did enjoy this film, but not as much as I hoped I would. The opening and last 20 odd minutes are the most entertaining. It's got some good laugh, some good performances and a few memorable scenes, but mostly it's a very complicated, very clich�d and very unbelievable series of events and encounters. The film makes the same mistake that the latest Fast & Furious film makes, and forgets that if our lead characters are undamageable/unkillable, then there's no reason to feel any tension when they're put in life-threatening situations. We need our heroes to be under threat, but when they're drowned, beaten up or in horrific car accidents and come out with barely a scratch on them, it feels as though the filmmakers don't really care about their mortality. And if they don't care, why should the audience? The actions scenes themselves are pretty exciting, and showcase some fairly impressive stunts, but when a car shoots into the air and rolls backwards at insane speed and the characters can emerge unscathed and continue their chase largely unhindered, it just feels like the movie is on a desperate quest to get onto the next scene as fast as possible without properly concluding the one its currently in. Another issue is the editing of the fights scenes. It's very awkward and choppy, but despite this it's glaringly obvious where the humans stop and the computer effects begin, making the hand to hand combat appear very disjointed and unnatural. The main objective, which should have earth-shattering consequences, is wrapped up with little fanfare, the characters are forced into scenes of overlong exposition in order to explain the storyline, and it's just very lacking in suspense. We've seen this kind of film enough times to predict what's going to happen to the characters and the plot. It's not terrible, just very underwhelming, and not one I'll be seeking out when it's released on DVD.",

    "review": "  Yeah, it should be called Mission Possible! This is the fifth time they are telling that something is \"impossible\" and then proceed to do exactly that. Has by any chance the meaning of \"impossible\" changed in the meantime. Some of you may still be scratching your heads now as to what I am talking about! It is about the fifth installment of the hugely popular Mission Impossible series. Banking on the super stardom of Tom Cruise, the series has always been a cash cow, while providing some high-octane action, and an American James Bond in Ethan Hunt.The fifth installment, titled Rogue Nation, takes off from where the previous one ended, and follows Ethan Hunt as he, along with his IMF (Impossible Missions Force) attempt to bring down The Syndicate, a mysterious international criminal organisation. Unfortunately, IMF has officially been dismantled and Hunt is an American fugitive..The movie, offers nothing new, and has the typical ingredients of a spy thriller - a female double agent, a cold villain, and some supporting characters thrown here and there. The story line is vague and inconsistent, and an inherent weakness in scripting is apparent. At times, the scenes are monotonous and reminiscent of previous movies of the franchise. Director Chrisopher McQuarrie (of The Tourist fame) steers clear of any experimentation and sticks to the basics. And that is not essentially a bad thing. The crisp editing and excellent cinematography make up for the writing flaws and give us some brilliant action sequences and moments of thrill.The performances are decent, with the exception of Rebecca Ferguson, as the MI6 double agent, Elsa Faust, who shines through with a compelling performance. She is beautiful, and puts in some spice to the movie. But who am I kidding here :P ! Mission Impossible, was, is and always will be a Tom Cruise film. He is 52, and it shows on his face. But he has lost none of his charm or star power. In fact, that is what powers this film through its discrepancies!Overall, MI: Rogue Nation, is all that it is supposed to be, a perfect summer blockbuster. It thoroughly entertains you and is far better than some other sequels released this year (read: Jurassic World and Terminator: Genisys). Watch this movie if you want to have some brainless fun and entertainment.",

    "review": "  The best Mission Impossible to date. This movie is full of pure movie adrenaline and energy. The action is perfect, great acting, and a really good story. The villain is not great but he's functional and there are some little plot holes that I think needed some more explanation. But overall, this is THE BEST MISSION IMPOSSIBLE YET. There could've been more suspense and tension like the first movie but this movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen and offers enough suspense to keep you engage for the entire movie. It's an almost perfect movie but what this movie does best is allow you to have an amazing time at the cinemas. I give it an A. There are some tiny plot holes like I've said and needed some villain development but those are just little nicky picks I had and Tom Cruise is just AWESOME.",

    "review": "  If you went in and saw this movie without seeing any previous ones in the franchise, it was a decent movie. Some action scenes, including fist/knife fights and exciting car/motorbike chase, some witty conversations, it wasn't bad really. But as a 5th installment of MI franchise, it was a disappointment. The missions no longer seemed \"impossible\" -- they were short and not very elaborate, transitions were a little choppy, and frankly, whatever action scenes were there, were uninspiring for the most part. I left the movie feeling insatiable. I was yearning for the \"wow\" that I felt every time I watched MI movies. Perhaps the director didn't care for actions as much, as evident from his previous movies. But dangit, this is an action movie! Where are the crazy stunts and fights? Where are the scenes that left the audiences in awe or shocked? Time to go to netflix and reminisce the time when MI movies are exciting to watch.",

    "review": "  Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation is another solid example that some franchises have the amazing ability to remain relevant to different audiences and to get better with every new installment. While the fifth delivery of the Mission Impossible series does not quite match the level of Ghost Protocol from 2011 it still remains a top 2015 summer blockbuster entertainment. Slick, action-packed, with the typical dose of impossible stunts and spiced up with additional level of good humor, Rogue Nation is a summer thrill ride that also offers a storyline and content which would please the more pretentious spy/mystery movie fans.When the IMF team is disbanded and Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is declared wanted, it all seems that the world would be taken by a secret organization known as The Syndicate. Left with nothing, chased by everyone, Ethan and his ex-team have limited time to prove that the IMF should not have been disbanded and that The Syndicate exists. Christopher MacQuarrie exploits almost the same concept which made Ghost Protocol the best Mission Impossible delivery. Fast-paced story that is actually pretty well built with not obvious plot holes (if you try to delve deeper, you would actually find some), a refreshing amount of good humor provided by Simon Pegg in duet with Tom Cruise, slick and thrilling action sequences and above all the impressively effective Tom Cruise. It is true that Rogue Nation falls just short from being as thrilling and breath-taking as Ghost Protocol, but probably this is also due to the settings chosen for some of the action sequences. As many are probably expecting the biggest asset of Mission Impossible is Tom Cruise. It is amazing how at 52 he still seems pretty credible as Special Agent Ethan Hunt. Cruise's action charisma is working flawlessly to a level that he has become one of the very few Hollywood actors around whom a whole franchise is built. What is more amazing is that this franchise spans over a huge period of 19 years in which Cruise has never lost its shape. In conclusion, Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation is another most welcome addition to the very successful spy franchise which may not reach the outstanding level of its predecessor Ghost Protocol but still it provides formidable summer entertainment and leaves the fans expecting the next delivery from the franchise. A recommended 132-minute entertainment!",

    "review": "  There is no way in the world that I could ever begin to explain the plot of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation and not make it sound like the last ten spy movies that you saw. That's probably because the plot of this movie doesn't really matter anyway, it's beside the point. Believe it or not, that's kind of a compliment. I have come to realize that this is the method that makes this series work. Take a bland spy plot about All-Star International Team of Professional Bad Guys armed the latest technological whozee-whatzit trying to bring down nations with a bullet and a keystroke, then plug in some highly entertaining well-planned, well thought-out action sequences that hold our attention. It's a formula that seems to work.Rogue Nation is the fourth sequel in a series that I have come to have a lot of affection for. It is a product that offers a certain seal of approval, especially when it's being produced by Hollywood's current whiz-kid J.J. Abrams. A few years ago, Abrams climbed on board this flawed, clunky series with the supremely underrated Mission: Impossible III and did something amazing - he made it fun. While James Bond and Jason Bourne steered toward grungy, real-world stuff, The Mission: Impossible pictures swim comfortably in the kinds of fun, inoffensive waters that the Roger Moore-era Bond pictures did.The plot - let's just get it out of the way - involves Ethan (Tom Cruise) and the IMF team hunting down evidence of the All-Star International Team of Professional Bad Guys who are called The Syndicate (I think my name is better) who want to infiltrate the top governments of the world and bring them down by assassinating their key leaders. Meanwhile the CIA (led by Alec Balwin, playing the stuff-shirt role for all its worth) wants to disband the IMF due to its repeated instances of collateral damage and for its inability to uncover proof of The Syndicate. Got all that? Good. Let's move on.The Syndicate is pretty indistinguishable from Hydra or S.P.E.C.T.R.E. or The Galactic Empire, only you can't easily spot them and their uniforms aren't as interesting. Their chief assassin is a quiet, creepy little man called Solomon (Sean Harris) whose odd face and silent demeanor gets under your skin. He's really an effective bad guy.What is special about this series, and this movie in particular is Tom Cruise. While his drama films repeatedly fall flat, he's made himself a really effective action star. As Ethan Hunt, he spends nearly the entire film performing stunts that should either put him in traction or in a cemetery. In that way he's a little like Indiana Jones. He gets hurt, a lot. When he crashes through a window or gets punched in the ribs by a Russian the size of a gorilla, you feel the crunch. At one point is he captured by Syndicate agents and beaten by a Russian called \"The Bone Doctor.\" Later he jumps into a centrifuge full of water with no air tank. Then he gets into a long car/motorcycle chase down the busy streets of Morocco, and gets into an accident that by all laws of physics should have gotten him killed. Plus, you care about him. There are moments when he genuinely looks scared. How many action heroes do that?But the single best action scene in the movie takes place in The Vienna Opera House where Ethan must deal with two assassins at once, climbing around on the catwalks during a performance of Puccini's \"Turandot,\" and battling a six-foot German killing machine. The scene works because of the way it is orchestrated with the music, and the way that the action is relatively quiet, as if the combatants are being respectful to the performers on stage. Having been inundated with so many bad action movies, I figured that it would end with a body falling on stage but, you know what, it didn't. This is a movie full of nice surprises.Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who is most famous for his Oscar Winning (and in my opinion overrated) screenplay to The Usual Suspects some 20 years ago. Here he shows a sure hand, letting the action scenes move on just a little longer then we might expect. They're so good that we want them to go on. The music plays such an integral part in this film. There is a beautifully directed moment when Cruise and his female counterpart are at gunpoint in an outdoor cafe in Vienna; the music drop out as the camera pushes in on their faces. They eye each other, silently working out a plan without words. Then Puccini's opera swells on the soundtrack as the action kicks into gear. To my knowledge, I haven't seen this kind of approach in an American action film; that's the kind of thing I usually see in Italian or Japanese pictures. If the filmmakers must steal, at least they're stealing from good sources.That's what you notice, the technique, not the plotting. The plot is small enough that it gets out of the actor's way. We care about the characters, especially Ben Dunn, played wonderfully by Simon Pegg. He has such a substantial role in this movie that it almost becomes a buddy movie. He could have been just a comic foil, but his connection with Hunt is so tight that we feel that they genuinely care for one another. The same goes for Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson as the wonderfully named Ilsa Faust, a Syndicate operative whose loyalties are always in question. She has an unpredictable relationship with Hunt that moves back and forth.On the whole, this movie is just plain fun. Is it preposterous? Yes. Is it too long? Yes. But you don't mind because the movie gets the job done. It's a step above the usual fare of this type. You remember the action. You remember the characters. But you don't care anything about the plot. It's a fun ride, better than the average, but it accomplishes it's mission. That's all we ask.",

Non dico che manchino gli spunti originali, ma non c'� quella marcia che avrebbe reso Rogue Nation in qualche modo migliore degli altri Mission Impossible.Rimane comunque un piacere vedere Tom Cruise molto in forma impegnato in prima persona in parecchi stunt e anche l'uso degli effetti speciali digitali non � mai troppo invasivo (cosa che oggigiorno non � poi cos� scontata). Insomma alla fine della fiera il pacchetto � ben confezionato: gli attori li conosciamo quasi tutti e sono una certezza, e si muovono all'interno di una trama carina che non ha nessuna particolare caduta di stile.Magari si sarebbe potuto evitare il solito clich� del cattivone che ingenuamente si lascia sfuggire un paio di occasioni ghiotte per uccidere il nostro Ethan Hunt, ma che ci volete fare, Mission Impossible � intrinsecamente un po' cos�, e di certo non mi tirer� indietro in caso di nuove uscite del brand.",

In Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation, you're treated to some really great practical stunts. The motorcycle scene will have you on the edge of your seat especially if you were fortunate enough to have seen it on the big IMAX screen. The leading lady in this movie, played by Rebecca Ferguson was excellent. Probably one of the strongest female characters put into an action movie and the director didn't even need to boast all over social media about getting some big named feminist to give her stamp of approval *cough*Mad Max*cough*.

    "review": "  Although I've never seen a single episode of the 1960s television show and didn't much care for the first film, I've grown to be a big fan of the Mission Impossible franchise. The stories are interesting, the characters are likable, the villains are easy to hate, and it has some the most entertaining action sequences in any film series. And yes, Tom Cruise still runs like no one else in the business.We're now five films in and this franchise is still alive and kicking. Although \"Ghost Protocol\" may still be the best installment, \"Rouge Nation\" is a strong second. This time Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and friends of the IMF are out to track down and prove the existence of an international criminal/terrorist organization known as the Syndicate. And in typical spy movie fashion, the CIA doesn't approve of the IMF's tactics, there's a double agent whose true motives are unclear, there could be a traitor in the group, and there's tension filled bomb countdowns. That all may sound painfully clich�d, they're all done in ways that feel stylish, creative and fresh.I'm an unapologetic Tom Cruise fan. He's one of the last remaining action stars left and I really appreciate all the effort he puts into these movies. The returning supporting cast are also as good as ever. Simon Pegg is still one of the best comic relief actors working today, Jeremy Renner is his usual stellar self, and Ving Rhames is Ving Rhames and that's all he needs to be. The stand-out new addition is Rebecca Ferguson. I didn't expect much from her going in, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see her in a superhero franchise down the road. She's what Black Widow should have been in the Avengers films.M.I.5 is another solid entry in the series and I highly recommend it. It may never reach the masterpiece levels of action and ferocity as a \"Mad Max: Fury Road\", but it'll be one of the more flat-out fun times you'll have this year.",

The few sequences showcase not only physical attributes of the actors/ress, it also demonstrates the bravura of the director. We have seen car chases a thousand times. This one is not the usual boring one. All in all, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is one tremendous motion picture experience. It is as good as it can get.",

    "review": "  If you came for a fun, entertaining film, you're in luck. If you came for an offbeat deconstruction of the modern action film, you're out of luck.Mission: Impossible has a formula. Tom Cruise gets captured, finds out his mission, assembles his team, intrigue, explosions, running, yadda yadda. You've seen it before. It is not the surprises that make the movie, it's the comfort. There's suspense, impossible feats of derring-do, timely comic relief, and plenty of high-energy action.The plot does keep you interested, although it runs a tad long. I think there was one location too many; I felt like the film had an extra act. The actors are all present, although I had a bit of a mix-up between two of the auxillary cast. The main players all did their part, especially newcomer Alec Baldwin, who really has terrific energy. And, of course, nobody runs like Tom Cruise.It's a fun romp that will entertain you. Nothing more and nothing less.",

    "review": "  Back in 2005, and with his franchise in creative hiatus, Tom Cruise made the very wise decision to recruit J.J. Abrams to revitalize his ailing Mission: Impossible films and the series hasn't looked back since. With 2006s Mission: Impossible 3, 2011s Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol and now with 2015s Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation, Cruise can stand toe-to-toe with the closest franchise that features exotic locales, espionage, gadgets, villainy and an over-the-top super agent. While that certain series has gone to the gritty side of things, the Mission: Impossible films have stayed true to the Cold War intrigue, fun and adventure that the spy genre cut its teeth in. Balancing this right amount of fun, suspense, mystery and action, writer/director (and first timer to the franchise) Christopher McQuarrie had quite the shoes to fill. Instead of putting his own fingerprints on the franchise too aggressively, McQuarrie has instead created a film that is, at times, one big homage to the ones before (even including shout outs to that other franchise). There are traces of the paranoid head games from Brian De Palma, the over-the-top action from John Woo, that kinetic energy from Abrams and then the fun and honest sense of adventure from Brad Bird. It all adds up to a spy film that is well balanced, with some fine set pieces and a great awareness for character. Ten years on from when the franchise was at it's lowest, 2015s Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation proves that this is a series worth keeping an eye out for-should you choose to accept it.",

    "review": "  Dud Dud Dud...Dud Dud DudMission Impossible Rogue Nation was a fun movie, it provided a great amount of comedy that didn't take away from the film and actually had some good twists and turns. But.....it lacked the direction needed to make it a true classic.This movie gave me a headache trying to keep up with its stories. Instead of having a fun spy movie MIRN gave me too many undeaded plots to keep up with. Just as I adjusted to one story it would switch to a totally unneeded other story that made it near impossible to follow and even harder for me to get into.The story at first seems innocent and makes sense, but when you look back at it you really start to see the holes in the story. So much of the plot was manipulated in multiple ways just to show action. The bike chase in Morocco is a perfect example, Benji had an extra copy of the drive the whole time so why did Ethan have to risk his life in a high speed chase to collect something they already had. Another example of this was the final battle between Ethan and William. Sure Ethan just killed multiple of your men but he and he alone also holds the 50 million dollars needed to put your plan in motion. So why would you attempt to kill him? The plot just doesn't add up to create a realistic movie.In the end Mission Impossible Rouge Nation is a fun action filled adventure that is worth checking out. But misses the simple elements to get higher in my opinion than a 3/5",

    "review": "  Normally when you get to the 5th film of a franchise, there's a massive drop in the quality. Not for this franchise. This just keeps on getting better and better. I didn't think it would get better than Ghost Protocol, but Rogue Nation might be my favorite Mission Impossible film till date.Tom Cruise is one of the biggest movie star we've ever had. And at the age of 53, he still is a legit action star. Some of the stunts he does in this film will leave you in awe. The plane scene is the first 5 minutes, and it isn't even the most exciting one. There's an underwater scene, an Opera house sequence, a bike chase scene, and each one ups the tempo from the previous one. Tom Cruise loves playing Ethan Hunt, and people may not like to agree but Hunt is right there with Bond and Bourne.Simon Pegg, you don't realize how good of an actor he is unless you see him acting. He can bring the laughter to a movie like this without making it cheesy or slapstick. He is fantastic in this film.Jeremy Renner gets to do a bit more this time, and he does a great job in the supporting role. He has some great moments with Alec Baldwin who surprisingly is really good in this film. Ving Rhames also shows up for few scenes and he just takes over the scene when he's on.We expect Tom Cruise to be badass and Simon Pegg to be funny, but the real surprise package here is Rebecca Ferguson. She's a total revelation. Her character Ilsa Faust is right up there with Imperator Furiosa as a badass female character. She brought an extra layer to this film and managed to create that suspense element throughout. We should be seeing a lot of her in the future films.Sean Harris as the villain in this film is one of the best part of the film. He may not match Hunt's strength, but he's always one step ahead of him. Very Riddler-ish, he was fantastic. Though I would've liked to know more about the Syndicate. I don't have any negatives about this film. Mad Max still has the best action sequences, but this is by far the best action film of the year.Credits to Christopher McQuarrie who had a huge task to follow up Brad Bird and he did it brilliantly.",

In Mission: Impossible 5 the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) is deemed unnecessary by the U.S. government and is disbanded and some of the agents are moved into the CIA. Meanwhile, the Syndicate, a sort of evil version of the IMF announces it's presence to Ethan Hunt (Cruise). Hunt must now hunt down and stop the Syndicate without the resources of the IMF and as a fugitive from the U.S. government.Things I Liked:The Cast. The entire cast of this film is strong, but highest props go to Rebecca Ferguson who comes in and holds her own as a badass. She takes the stage and steals the scenes and does it in a way that is never about being a badass female, she is just a badass and he gender never for a moment defines that fact. But the entire cast delivers. Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Ving Rahmes, Alec Baldwin, and Sean Harris as the villain, all have their moment and each one stands out at one time or another.The Action. This is an action film. And oh man does it deliver. The stunt work is great, the fights are interesting and exciting, the chase scenes are edge of your seat excitement, there are explosions, gun shots, and moments that remind you that Tom Cruise is truly a one of a kind action star. The film is exciting and it manages to do things that push the boundries where you think the stunt is almost impossible but you still believe that Hunt can do it. Awesome!The plot. This film has a better and more interesting plot than the previous few Mission: Impossible films. The film does a lot more espionage and that was what I really enjoyed about the first one was the spy work, the double crosses, the figuring out of the puzzle. This movie does that but also has moments where the actions is high. It's a really intriguing mental battle between Hunt and the Syndicate and both trying to be a step ahead of the other.Things I Didn't Like:Too Many Twists. The movie is an act too long, there are one too many obstacles for the character to navigate. The movies is just a little long and you feel like moments where they have to run through problems are a bit unnecessary. This is a seriously nitpicky thing because there wasn't a lot I didn't like with this film.Overall. Overall this film is awesome. The cast is strong, the action is high, the plot is interesting. Everything works really well and there are moments where the movie feels a bit like there are too many obstacles but by the end you are just excited about what you saw. This has a been a summer for exciting action films and this one is right up there with the best of them.",

    "review": "  Saying this movie was a masterpiece will be an understatement. From the trailer, I really thought Ethan trying to break into a plane that's already in the air will be the height of this movie but I'm so glad I was wrong. The movie was fast-paced yet slowed down to allow the audience to take in every scene in the movie and give a general classic mission impossible experience. I have to say this is the best movie of the franchise and I hope they keep upping their game even if I can't imagine how they could do better.",

    "review": "  Ethan Hunt is back to his old spying antics, delivering everything that fans of the franchise have come to expect. As a rogue agent disowned by his own government, he must confront the looming threat of 'The Syndicate', an elusive but powerful 'rogue nation' of ex-intelligence agents. Along the way, Hunt must attempt to distinguish friend from foe in a maze of shifting allegiances.Sound familiar? It probably is. While 'agent goes rogue' and 'mysterious global organisation' are well-trodden tropes of the spy genre (most Bond films for a start!), the director and co-writer Christopher McQuarrie manages to do it in a way that still feels fresh and exciting.Rogue Nation has all the things that a franchise in its fifth outing needs: self-awareness, original characters and a fresh story. Most impressive about this picture are the action set-pieces, of which the Opera sequence is surely the most lauded, and rightly so. A close second comes in the first five minutes. The film opens 'in medias res' (in the midst of the action) to what is surely the most talked about scene in the run up to the film's release - Tom Cruise hanging off the side of a plane (for reals!).I would have liked the obligatory 'heist' section to have been fleshed out a little. As Simon Pegg's character ironically points out - 'Mission: Impossible' is more like 'Mission: Very Difficult', and not even. After ten minutes of action they had retrieved the MacGuffin and it was on to the next obstacle.While many have praised the film for giving its only female character an equal footing to the series' protagonist, there were too many leering camera shots and inexplicably revealing, non-functional, outfits in order for me to be completely satisfied with the film's gender politics.If you go into this film expecting your disposable action fare, you may be pleasantly surprised. But while this entry into the franchise certainly delivers on thrills, don't go expecting any real world relevance or lasting message; just sit back and have fun.",

Cruise brings charm and likability to a character that, by this deep into a series, could be easily worn-out and tiresome. Everyone else fills their roles exactly how you would want them to, with more attention being put on Simon Pegg's Benji this time around, although the true breakout star was Rebecca Ferguson, proving that not all damsels are in distress (for the most part). The movie delivers with brilliantly crafted action sequences, locations and sets that make you feel like you're really part of an adventure, and a solid enough story to keep you interested throughout with an occasional laugh on the way. If you choose to accept it... Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is the best in the series so far.",

Rebecca Ferguson is awesome as the female lead in the movie. I did think the movie was a little too long but I was never bored with it. The plot was a little hard to follow at times (guys your a Mission Impossible movie, stop being so serious!!), and the bad guy was kind of laughable because he sounded just like Eddie Redmayne in Jupiter Ascending.

    "review": "  The beginning starts off real good and the pace was well done. The only gripe I had with the whole movie is that the lack on the development of the characters. Sure it's a continuation of Ethan Hunt's spy agent career and we've seen enough of the characters that's been there since a couple of the previous films but I was hoping to see more action from Jeremy Renner's character and Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg teaming up doing awesome stuff on advanced tech gadgets. Yes, they did on that part but I wanted to see more. But it's okay, I guess they had enough of their spotlight and so they gave it to Ethan Hunt and this hot chick named Ilsa.This film focus entirely on stopping the Syndicate but it lack on seeing anymore agents in the organization that I could only remembered a few. I guess supposedly they were really K.I.A. or M.I.A. The Syndicate is an organization built on disrupting and dismantling the IMF (Impossible Missions Force) but of course Ethan Hunt doesn't want that to happen. The action is pretty good, top notch as always. Acting is good as usual and the humor is good as well. You get a lot of it from Simon Pegg. Overall, if you include this movie with the rest of the Mission: Impossible movies, the whole thing is just pretty damn good series of action films to boot. I got no hate on them and I would watch them on occasion. Yes, even though I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, the Mission: Impossible film series is not that bad. Rebecca Ferguson, though I don't think I'm familiar with her, she kicked so much ass in this movie. I kinda hope to see more of her if there will be any more Mission: Impossible movies in the future. Rogue Nation is another good film to watch if you like action movies in general.",

Ethan Hunt and his crew are fun to watch, they are hilarious and the action scenes are top notch. While the plot is fairly basic, it does have some nice twists but that plays second fiddle to the over the top action sequences that cover everything from underwater thrills to insane motorcycle chases. Tom Cruise is the ultimate action hero and I can only hope that they keep making more Mission Impossible films because they are incredibly entertaining. Go and see this one now, if you are looking for some laughs, thrills and most of all, the best action scenes you will probably see this year.",

    "review": "  Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation (2015) - After dwindling successive entries, it seemed as if the only thing keeping this spy franchise alive was the sheer will of Tom Cruise alone... You know, Scientology powers. Now that sheer will is converted into quality film-making with the likes of Brad Bird (The Incredibles) injecting life into the otherwise stale franchise in the fourth instalment \"Ghost Protocol\". In this new, fifth instalment, that streak of success continues in stride with Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher) at the helm. This movie is solid from start to finish thanks in large part to an understanding of what made the last movie work so well. Boasting a strong, well rounded cast of characters with supporting roles that rival the lead in charisma; the highlight being Simon Pegg, who acts as the brains and comedic relief throughout. Then there's the inclusion of these huge over the top, action set pieces, perfected by practical sets and stunt work, adding a visceral edge to these movies that most modern action fair is missing. This is thanks in large part to a committed performance from Cruise, who earns his place as a veteran in this genre. Most of \"Rogue Nation's\" strengths are the same as its predecessor and shockingly it even manages to improve in some areas by adding a genuinely interesting villain into the mix which \"Ghost Protocol\" sorely lacked. Unfortunately, \"Rogue Nation\" also shares some of the last film's weaknesses too, most notably a bloated running-time. These movies would really benefit from a lean 110 minutes as opposed to the 140 this is sitting at. Odd pacing issues and too many convoluted sub-plots became a bit overwhelming, by the time the third act rolls around it's hard to tell where the climax is, as the film feels like a series of highs from the half way point forward. With all of that said, I really enjoyed this film and embraced it's flaws. These new \"Mission Impossible\" movies are great in their intelligence while also never taking themselves too seriously. There's a back-handed cheekiness that I really appreciate, so as long as Mr.Cruise is willing to keep this ball rolling, I'm on board. If action is what you crave this summer, look no further than this \"Mission\", should you choose to accept it.GRADE: A-",

    "review": "  The franchise is getting better and better and it has improved a lot since 1996. Rogue Nation is another great mission impossible movie and it delivers what have we waiting for: it has a great plot, a clever story, powerful performances, a worthy villain and impressive action scenes. Rogue Nation is slightly better than Ghost protocol because it has a better villain, more cold and evil and he is the leader of Anti IMF organisation not just a crazy scientist who wants to destroy the world. Rogue Nation also has even better plot and more impressive action scenes, it's better than the rest movies except MI3 who has the best villain by far and has the most serious tone yet. Rogue Nation also has one of the best opening scenes in movie history and the best opening scene of the franchise, this movie wastes no time and goes straight into action with Tom Cruise hanging on a plane, i thought that the scene of Ghost protocol in Dubai's tallest building will never be topped and yet the plane scene surpass it and prove me wrong. Tom Cruise remains a great lead star and he is getting better and better as the franchise it self, the newcomer Rebbeca Ferguson totally steal the show and her strong performance really stands out, Tom and Rebbeca have great chemistry and Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Jeremy Renner are great as always. I'm very happy for this franchise because it improves upon the previous movies and it doesn't run out of good ideas. This franchise has a future ahead of it and i'm very confident it will continue to surprise us !!!!",

I don't necessarily mean this as a bad thing though, the whole movie really plays out like a highlight reel of all the scenes I love in spy movies. The motorcycle chase scene, the underwater scene, the fight happening backstage of a theater scene; these are all things I love seeing in movies so I didn't mind seeing theme again. Nothing about it revolutionizes the spy film genre, and its story is pretty straightforward and ultimately forgettable, but I still had fun with the movie. Other than the stunts which can be jaw-dropping and have an admirable use of practical effects, nothing about the film really wowed me. It's a very efficient movie, it knows what you want and it gives you exactly that. I saw the scenes I wanted to see with a cast I like spending time with. It's not a groundbreaking spy film, but it is a very enjoyable one.",

    "review": "  There is a chance that Mission: Impossible might be my favorite film franchise, because I believe they have maintained a consistency of quality that is unmatched by any other. Needless to say, I was quite excited to head to the theater for the fifth chapter in the series. I like that they made some references back to the previous film in order to maintain continuity, but they didn't really have a storyline that carried over. This allows both loyal fans and newcomers to enjoy the ride. And that's what these films have become, a wild ride of action and excitement. In Rogue Nation we find the IMF coming under fire, and Ethan Hunt is (once again) forced to work without the full support of his government to try and bring down the Syndicate, which is your typical evil spy agency. Tom Cruise remains a solid lead in this movie and continues to impress with stunts that are absolutely amazing. Simon Pegg is the perfect comic relief, but he also has added some depth to the character of Benji which makes him someone we can laugh at and respect at the same time. Jeremy Renner doesn't get much action, which is unfortunate, but his interactions with Alec Baldwin are a treat. The real find in this movie is the lovely Rebecca Ferguson. Her portrayal of Ilsa is excellent because she has some emotional moments that make her more than just a typical \"Bond girl.\"The story felt a little messy at times, and didn't work quite as well as a couple of the other films in the franchise. I got annoyed by the fluctuating loyalty of a certain character, which almost became as messy as the Mac debacle in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I also must admit that there is a twist in one scene that I saw coming early on, which I think was supposed to fool me, but knowing the truth didn't hurt the moment. But let's be real here, the Mission: Impossible movies aren't even supposed to be about the plot any more, are they? It seems that the action is what is bringing in the audience more than the story. So, rest assured these action sequences are amazing. The famous scene of Tom Cruise hanging on an airplane is actually in a pre-credit sequence that doesn't really tie into the main plot, but things don't really go down from there. The set piece that I found most impressive was the motorcycle chase which was high-octane and really kept my heart thumping. There was also an extended underwater stunt which had me holding my breath as if I was right there with Ethan Hunt. Without question, this is a great action film, and one that I will gladly add to my Mission: Impossible collection. However, it didn't have quite as much of the magic in its plot construction (with mystery and intrigue) that have been the highlight of the series for me. But if you're looking for a summer action movie where you can just sit down, have fun, and gobble down some popcorn, then Rogue Nation is perfect for you.",

    "review": "  'Rogue Nation', the fifth entry in the indubitably successful series is a rousing affair replete with sleek production values, one-liner-a-minute gags, gravity-defying practical stunts and a cool ooze of sex appeal that allows for maximum suspension of disbelief. Action stalwart and franchise front man Tom Cruise has no plans of slowing down with moves that would make most millennial age men truly envious. This film makes evident that he, along with returning cast members Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Jeremy Renner are still having a blast with a re-invigorated inspiration that runs through this movie's veins ever since the JJ Abrams directed MI3. Some stellar sequences abound including a taut, acrobatic and wonderfully mounted backstage shootout at an opera in Vienna as well as the riveting plane takeoff opener. Longtime fans expecting something truly new and game changing or even life affirming won't come away with much but for those who can manage their expectations well and know what this franchise is when its functioning at optimum levels should undoubtedly see this in all its big screen glory. Also, newcomer Rebecca Ferguson as a very compromised ex-MI6 British agent is a welcome addition and the scenes featuring her and Cruise are definite standouts in a movie bursting with style and visual panache.

    "review": "  I think the fifth Mission Impossible cut many fans short of the megahit that was expected. The movie succeeds in selling itself by promoting the fact that Tom Cruise does all his own stunts, but I feel that they had to do this because the film has no more than three quality action sequences and only one of them I would call original. It starts off a mess, with Tom Cruise making a unintelligible Hollywood entry and then the opening credits roll right before a major action scene finishes - cutting it off at the climax and never concluding it. This is probably because a very similar airplane scene was already done in FAST 7. The motorcycle chase scene also has been done more than enough times before. The only thing I can honestly remember from MI2 is lots of motorcycles. With the of exception the great underwater identification data swap scene, (which even felt familiar in its style of execution) the rest of the film's adrenaline comes from shootouts and hand-to-hand combat sequences mixed with intelligent spy twists. I was shocked at how anti-climactic the ending was. It's something that one would expect to see happen at the end of an OCEANS 11 movie. I've always found Simon Pegg to be the perfect comic relief for these movies, but even he didn't seem to be as funny this time around. MI 4, 3 & 1 are ranked amongst my top favorite action movies of all time. This one lands itself in the unfortunate spot right above MI2, which places it second from last in the series.",

    "review": "  Going Rogue works exceedingly well for this nearly 20-year-old franchise, which makes it its Mission to entertain audiences with a worthy, bombastic, stunt-filled and action-packed follow-up to series high point Ghost Protocol. Just don't think about the spycraft too much or you might self-destruct. Please understand that the story only exists to set in motion an incendiary succession of set pieces, more bombastic and faint making than the last. Granted, the flick fails to include as much cheeky humor and top-notch plot points as the Impossible-to-beat 4th go-round. Though Rogue Nation never reaches its predecessor's nearly-perfectly rounded heights, however, the human and vehicular pyrotechnics make it a hugely enjoyable piece of popcorn. In this PG-13-rated actioner, Ethan (Cruise) and team (Renner, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames) battle CIA bureaucracy and take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF. Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher) might possess the skill set for staging breakneck action of Ghost Protocol director Brad Bird (Tomorrowland), but the screenwriter of The Usual Suspects and Edge of Tomorrow knows just not to get in the way. Plus, his textured back-and-forths give us some engrossing one-on-one moments between some key characters - something we don't usually see from the IMF. Brilliantly leading the charge as always is Tom Cruise, a man so ridiculously great at his job that he makes the Impossible seem like child's play. He's been selling through weapons-grade fisticuffs and espionage for almost two decades now and makes it look more effortless with every passing flick. Someway somehow, he almost gets bested by an upstart. Rebecca Ferguson comes in out of nowhere and becomes a full-fledged star by the time the end credits roll. Simon Pegg adds some much-needed levity to the goings-on while Alec Baldwin provides a fascinating dynamic as a hard-nosed CIA suit who puts the always-spot-on Jeremy Renner through the paces.Bottom line: It Takes an Ovation of Millions",

    "review": "  Straight off the bat Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation is humorous and action-packed, which leaves the audience wanting more. This film is full of amazing stunts straight from the very first scene, which are certainly very cool. The plot itself was very intricate and it keeps the audience on their toes, but also on the edge of their seats. There are always questions to be asked about what will happen next, and more importantly: who can be trusted? This can be a good thing, however at times I found myself a little too confused. The plot thickens as the film progresses, so pay attention or you may miss something. Tom Cruise's performance is very convincing as he plays a secret agent who is a member of the IMF. Simon Pegg's role was extremely funny and added humour to a very suspenseful film. Sean Harris, who plays the villain in this film was very creepy, which let the audience know he could not be trusted, and that the other characters should be very careful. Rebecca Ferguson's performance was very good, as it manipulated the audience many times as to whether she was a friend or an enemy. Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation's action scenes were very thrilling, and constantly tense, almost as if the audience were really there. For example, the motorbike chase and the underwater scenes were extremely fascinating. Also, during the final scenes in particular I found myself holding my breath, because of the fact that they were laced tension. What I didn't like about Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation was the fact that there were many cheesy lines and moments that left me cringing in my seat, although I suppose they could have been worse, and I kind of did expect them from an action film. Overall, I did enjoy this film, however it felt like there was something missing but I cannot put my finger on it. This film is enjoyable for all ages, but maybe a bit harder for younger children to follow.",

No stunning hardware or technology was introduced.3. Almost every movie character is warship Ethan Hunt (one man show).4. Ethan Hunt got dizzy almost all over the movie.5. Ethan Hunt has too much luck in the mission.6. Some of the new characters' personalities are shallow.7. The Syndicate is too fragile and didn't match it's super reputation.8. A motorcycle & car hot pursuits are not that amazing for IMF anymore.9. It appears that there is no IMF agents other than Ethan Hunt.10. Visited countries' scenes didn't take us there.11.

And, of course, there were the mandatory holy-butts-how-is-Tom-Cruise-still-alive stunts that are almost required in a Tom Cruise movie, and they are glorious. Tom Cruise is like fifty and he's still the most hardcore American actor in the business.This movie's great. Watch it now.",

On the contrariety, Mission Impossible Rogue Nation has a very involved story line keeps the audience so involved in trying to determine if the CIA was really intent on shutting down the IMF or was it just a clearly intertwined plot to draw out the Syndicate? I can neither confirm or deny which is true, but I can confirm Mission Impossible Rogue Nation may just be one of the best Mission Impossible movies since the first one!

    "review": "  Mission Impossible- Rogue Nation is not necessarily the smartest film of the bunch (I would hand that to the first two of the series), nor is it the most over the top crazy (Ghost...). It just may be the most complete and well constructed film of the bunch though.The film takes a decidedly introspective turn as it exposes its age (the premise revolves around a legal case to dissolve the IMF and bring its members to justice after all these years of reckless tendencies; the film 'reassembles' an old team that has been unofficially retired; and lastly, the film glorifies some well placed shots of Cruises grey hair without shame). It also examines the tendency (and perhaps accusation) that this film is simply a showboat and ego trip for Cruise to showcase himself (or in the film, for Ethan to wallow in his desperate attempts to defeat a single enemy at the possible expense of his team and of fuelling a larger war that could endanger a much wider population). There are two answers. The first one is an absolute yes, this series is completely about cruise. MI is Cruise as much as Cruise is MI. This is where he belongs.Throughout the series there has been a very fine line between who Cruise is in the real world and what he brings to the screen as the embodiment of Ethan. The opening scene in Rogue is the infamous plane scene, which is less a necessary part of the plot and more a statement on who Cruise is. There is something about his willingness to throw himself in to his own stunts and make them feel, seem, appear impossible that is endearing in a sort of reckless charisma kind of way, no matter your feelings on Cruise himself.The other answer to the question (of whether this project is all about Cruise) is a large no (or in the words of Ethan, \"Do you really think that's what I'm about? Do you REALLY think that's what this is about !!?\"). The main point of the film is about the concept of team (who all bring their own bit to the film). And even more so, the film brings in Rebecca Ferguson (as Ilsa Faust), who I hope we see more of in future films. She brings a wonderful flair to the sort of mysterious and enigmatic counter part to Cruises own roque tendencies, and is absolutely watchable on screen as she is talented at fight and flight sequences in her own right.In many ways this latest instalment is all about the idea of going rogue and the repercussions of becoming too one sided (or self focused). This is where the film starts, and the film slows down enough to allow some key moments to resonate in this regard. It comes out in the relationship between Ethan and Benji, and gets further questioned in the exchange between William and Luther. The film examines that difficult personal journey in dealing with our demons and exacting our own sense of justice in the face of those demons while also weighing the affects that our choices and decision can have (and do have) on others. This comes out in a poetic way in three choices that come out in an important exchange between Ethan and Ilsa, and it is also embodied in a poetic finish in which the nagging Cruise question comes full circle and is dealt with in a wonderfully incomplete fashion.Rogue is not unique in what is already a crowded series. How you feel about that might affect how much you allow yourself to enjoy this latest instalment. There are certainly a few points in which the familiar mission solving and riddled solutions that happen in the mind of Ethan and slowly get brought to light for the audience are slightly predictable. But there is a maturity and a refreshing familiarity to Rogue that sets itself apart, even aside from the fact that is pure entertainment and simply fun to watch on screen. There is something impressive about the fact that they allow Rogue to feel fresh and alive in its own right even without pushing it over the top (there are some cringe worthy moments and jaw dropping action sequences, but they are well tempered and well paced). A worthwhile entry in to what has become an impressively enduring series.",

    "review": "  It's no secret that I'm not nearly the fan of the Mission Impossible series that everyone else is these days. Perennially overrated, I have found the series enjoyable generally but also fairly predictable and with a lead who has, in recent years, become increasingly unlikable. Nevertheless, Rogue Nation was one of the better additions to the series. Pairing the stunt happy Cruise with newcomer Rebecca Ferguson was a brilliant move, producing one of the better action sequences of the year so far in the well crafted opera house scene. The rest of the film is also quite exciting and despite successfully predicting every plot twist, the appeal of the Mission Impossible series remains the likable team and slick production value. Perhaps my biggest complaint was the repeated use of old Bourne and Bond tricks throughout the movie but in retrospect, there are worse films to copy. I'm genuinely looking forward to seeing this whole thing wrap up with the next film.",

Bear in mind that its largest weakness comes post-climax. Amazingly, \"sequelitis\" for a film franchise on the cusp of being twenty years old isn't a dismal expected factor here.Mostly unimpressed with Christopher McQuarrie's previous Hollywood contribution, directing and penning 2012's Jack Reacher (an adaptation of Lee Child's 2005 novel One Shot), I was going to pass on Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation. Although noticing that McQuarrie had compared Rogue Nation to Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight (citing it as an influence for the antagonist), piqued my curiosity. On the contrary it simultaneously deadened my interest too. Frankly, Rogue Nation gave me what The Dark Knight had promised in a stronger less absurd package. Yes, without hesitation I prefer and will set Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation on a higher shelf always than The Dark Knight. In other words, check out Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation ASAP.",

The film features terrific action sequences, made all the better by Tom Cruise's devotion to doing his own stunts. In particular the motorcycle chase is my favorite single action sequence of this year. The film takes some liberties, and has a few inventions that don't seem technologically possible, but at the st seems as though Mission Impossible has become the Fast and Furious of spy films, where it may not be the most realistic, but it remains aware, and constantly tries to up itself. As well the film has a few too many clich�s, and has a somewhat weak villain, but due to it's engrossing plot, great action, sense of humor, and it's nearly non-stop pacing these flaws are in general forgivable.",

I agree with my brother, its about damn time you see an action sequence without losing your lunch because the camera can't fking stay on the subject. MI5 is fun. Its about on the level of the fourth film. The stunts are great, but the best part is the lack of CGI (for some of it). While I was underwhelmed by the plane sequence we all saw, the car chases were good except un-survivable. Oh well. What is it with Mission Impossible movies and stu bad guys? I mean you had \"I'm going to fart on her, then I'm going to fart on you, then I'm going to kill you, then I'm going...\" to a fuzzy guy, to a guy you could barely hear. All of that is made up for in this film by oates, Rebecca Ferguson. If there was a drinking game every time she faced the camera, you'd be plastered by the end of the movie, and wishing you could say oates.While some of it was over the top that's what we expect from Mission Impossible. Good action sequences make the movie entertaining. I liked it.",

I was very wrong and i admit that this blew my mind off, from very developed plot, to inspired Tom Cruise and Rebeca Ferguson who show a great on-screen chemistry to thrilling action sequences and twists i was strapped to my seat and really enjoyed each frame of this movie... Fun for every fan and even non - fan of Mission Impossible franchise... With just enough humor and drama, I'd say it's the blockbuster of the summer ( still i won't tell it's the movie of the year taking into account Mad Max Fury Road and other movies that are still to come out this year) but it's really really good and i recommend it to everyone who likes action/spy movies. Tom Cruise delivers yet again. Cheers!",

    "review": "  There is something to be said about Tom Cruise. Why he has the best track record with blockbuster films, why he's as good now as he was 20 years ago, or why we want to keep seeing him in movies. To be honest, he doesn't have the likability of a Will Smith, or the brooding persona of a Harrison Ford, and it makes no sense, but we can't take our eyes off of the screen when he's there. He doesn't beg for our attention, but he gets it. Maybe it isn't that certain zeal or infectious energy. Maybe it's that ability NOT to monopolize the screen. This allows others around him to shine. He doesn't ask for our approval, so we're more willing to give it to him. He's seldom your favorite character in a given movie, but at the same time he carries every film that he's in. And he's been doing it for over three decades now.Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation is no different. The supporting cast is great in this film, but without Cruise, it would just waste away.As the CIA has disintegrated the IMF (Impossible Missions Force), Ethan (Cruise) and his team attempt to eradicate the Syndicate--an international organization lead by Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) whose agenda is to acquire enough money to colonize their own rogue nation.There aren't any real callbacks to the previous films--something that they may be doing in attempts to be more Bond-esque, but for fans hoping to get more of what they love in the previous 2 films, they're in for a treat. The action and fight sequences are jaw dropping, and the premise is so well-conceived that you won't ever know what's coming next. It can get a little heavy in the details, but you just accept everything and follow along, and it all makes sense in the end. Jeremy Renner (Williams Brandt) and Simon Pegg (Benji Dunn) return, and so does Ving Rhames (Luther) after his absence from the last film (not including a brief cameo). Rebecca Ferguson (Ilsa Faust) is a great addition to the franchise, and I hope that her mysterious character is developed more in future installments.It may not reinvent the wheel, but its non-stop action never makes you realize that it's nearly two and a half hours long. Christopher McQuarrie acts as both director and screenwriter for this film--a feat that I feel does wonders for a project. And he now has a great addition for his CV.Twizard Rating: 97",

Rogue Nation is a decent story with some drag in between the action. At well over two-hours, Rogue Nation does have a lot of drag. Its cast kept me watching during the seemingly long bits. I'm a huge fan of quite a few people in this film. Cruise, Pegg, and Renner are among my favorites. They are all leads in their own movies, but they work well together as a couple of them take more supporting roles. There's not a lot of depth to the story, not many plot twists, but it is enough to keep the action sequences going. The next MI has been green lit and I'm already excited for it. In the meantime, rest assured you will have Rogue Nation to enjoy while they start writing the next. Definitely worth seeing.",

However, I've never missed one of the movie M.I.flicks (I think we are up to #5) all starring the entertaining Tom Cruise. He just killsthe \"Ethan Hunt\" lead role and I just don't know who could carry this series like him.I know lots of folks don't like T.C., but he virtually always works for me on the big screen and I've seen a ton of his films.You know what you are getting in M.I. films: tons of action; extrication from impossiblesituations; cool gadgets; international intrigue; a pretty girl; a warped adversary...you get the picture. Add up the repetitive (but really works) trademark Mission Impossible lead song at the head of most critical action sequences (5-10 this flick), and we have the quintessentialsummer blockbuster (if such a thing exists any more).Outside of being 20 minutes too long, \"Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation simply worksas movie fun.",

    "review": "  Well this film, was actually quite good. I had seen the previous Mission Impossible films and found them to be quite confusing plot wise and the technical aspects of it. However with this particular franchise, I found it quite easy to understand. The action was top notch, no question. I enjoyed it immensely especially with Plane scene at the beginning. Me with a fear of flying, I actually felt I was actually on the plane. So real it was. hahaah. My fav scene thou was with the Prime Minister(Hollander) and Atley(McBurney) when Atley's face was 3D Printed ontop Ethan Hunt's(Cruise) face. I thought that was class. When Prime Minster claims that Brandt's(Renner) hand is \"So warm\". We all got a great laugh. Brandt looks over at Atley/Hunt and hunter shows the face as much as to say deal with it. I thought it was class.So now onto the plot. The plot as I says above quite simple. Ethan Hunt(Cruise) stumbles upon a group known as the Syndicate who has been described as: \"An Anti-IMF\",who's job is to take down the IMF and all that goes with it. It all starts off as I said above the plane scene. You'd wanna have a head for heights, no question. Anyways, Ethan gets onto the plane with the help of Ethan's buddy Benji(Pegg). Then afterwards a LOVELY score. It really was like a TV Series type as I actually learned of this lately. Hunley(Baldwin) wants to disband IMF competly and appears in a US Senate Committee. Classic line from Brandt is \"I can neither confirm nor deny any details without the permission of the Secretary\".He continuously states this when asked by the Committee. So a series of events occur. The Vienna Opera scene was a classic scene too. The Chancellor of Vienna is assassinated. I don't get the connection to it. They did explain the Istanbul and all the majors terrorist attacks. But that's about all I understood.2D - Sound spectacular.Pls note there are no extra scenes BEFORE the credits or AFTER",

Great set pieces, smart plot, clever humor, somewhat relateable/humane characters, a robust competent cast, good direction...I almost feel like it's too similar in quality to GP though. The pacing, action, dialogue, even the way each character moves almost seems surgical now. Don't get me wrong it's a great film and like I said, everything you'd ever NEED but I think we've hit a level of stagnation here.There's no more wow factor, there's nothing iconic that you would recall for years on down the road. Rogue Nation will be remembered by most as a blur of exceptional action film making...I believe the next MI film will need more personal, resonating character moments from the IMF crew if it's going to succeed.",

    "review": "  The longest running international spy of 18 years is now a fugitive who is sought by the CIA for inevidently saving the world. Ethan Hunt's impossible mission, whether or not he chooses to accept it, will be to survive and of course, save the world from a rogue organization that had its inception within the IMF. With some commendable dedication to not just the stunts and action but also to the production of this franchise, Tom Cruise returns to the role that he is most comfortable with and is most appreciated for. Christopher McQuarrie ('Jack Reacher') takes the reigns of directing this time and brings back the intricacies and guile in Brian De Palma's 'Mission: Impossible'. With some exemplary action sequences, smart protagonists, an intricate plot of deceiving espionage and some desirable futuristic high tech, Ethan Hunt is here on a mission to entertain and as usual, he does it in style. Hunt and his team have just intercepted a terrorist cell flying out with a stash of nerve gas missiles on an A-400 cargo plane. The seemingly death-defying stunt is what makes Tom Cruise among the most watchable action stars and soon afterward, his suspicion about a discreet terrorism funding organization called the Syndicate becomes real when he is kidnapped by one of their members, the bone doctor. His escape is aided by an undercover operative named Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) who might have more to reveal about the Syndicate. Meanwhile, owing to their previous interceptions including the recent one at Kremlin that caused massive collateral damage, a committee of Senators agree with CIA director Alan Hunley's (Alec Baldwin) testament to disband the IMF to make it a part of CIA. Hunt is now on a run from the CIA, without his team and with limited resources.There are several mysteries that he needs to uncover including the identity of the man he encountered at one of their hideouts and his link to the Syndicate, Ilsa's true intentions and allegiance, the retrieval of the encrypted drive and its disruptive contents. Each sub-plot gets further entangled in the other, with the rogue Syndicate threatening to unleash terror forces all over. It will take more than just Ethan's will to succeed in this mission that's shrouded in mystery like the London fog in the climax. Impossible, but doable.  The storyline, although convoluted at times, strives to be opaque like in Brian De Palma's version, which is a good thing because the mystery adds an enduring value. Every sub-plot and every character unify to a sensible conclusion with the occasional humor and sarcasm to ease through the twists. Some of the action sequences are frenetic and some just gravity defying. Cruise still chooses to perform most of the stunts by himself and that is quite commendable. Apart from the aircraft hanging scene, the film's highlight is definitely in Morocco. After the gripping sequence in the underwater server station, the action moves to the streets of Casablanca with Hunt and Benji in a thrilling car chase with superbikes in hot pursuit. The sheer adrenaline can be felt throughout the sequence as the BMW roars through every sharp corner and straight. This is followed by a superlative bike chase through the mountains which makes up for all the money's worth by itself. Then, to add to the eeriness of the sub-plots, the climax in London's foggy streets takes us back in time to some Hitchcock style thrills as Ilsa has a knife fight with the bone doctor. The other Hitchcock inspired sequence, the assassination attempt at the Opera in Vienna, is among the film's most adroitly executed ones.  At age 53, Tom Cruise still has the ability to be all over the screen. His commendable efforts go beyond just the stunts that he chooses to carry out on his own. He has immersed himself deep into the role of Ethan Hunt, embodying the charming spy who almost gets himself killed every half hour. Cruise's dedication to this franchise is necessary for both its running as well as his own career. No matter who or what he is off screen, he is a remarkable entertainer as agent Ethan Hunt, whose impossible missions keep us hooked in awe. Simon Pegg as the techie side-kick is geeky yet funny enough for us to care about his survival. Jeremy Renner's Brandt is always in a spot between the CIA and his commitment to Ethan's crew and he balances things pretty well. Alec Baldwin has some cheeky lines and adds the right amount of gravitas to his character as a CIA director. The surprise act of the film however is Rebecca Fergusson as Ilsa Faust. She is vibrant, kicks ass in action sequences and is just an equal match for Ethan without being an unnecessary interest of another kind.  Fingerprint verification on car windows, encrypted flash drives that require the Prime Minister's authentication, high tech gadgets and of course, those crazy masks to change identities, make this a thoroughly exciting espionage film. The plot is thick enough to keep you engaged yet not contrived to just fill in gaps between action sequences. Rogue Nation is what Bond films used to be like. It's a complete entertainer by all means and among the most satisfying action films of the year that also enables Tom Cruise to keep this franchise alive. Light the fuse people...........9.113 on a scale of 1-10.",

This installment to me, felt like going back to the first Mission Impossible that I enjoyed, mind game between the characters, great chase sequence, great fight sequences and overall enjoyable spy action thriller despite some unbelievable scenes and plots.To those who enjoy big set action sequences of previous films might be disappointed in this movie someway but to those who enjoy watching cat&mouse game of hero and villain, I think this movie will entertain you. Lastly, two thumbs up and shout out to actress Rebecca Ferguson, who played agent Ilsa Faust, for her performance in the movie and one of the most badass spy I haven't seen in a while on the movie. I really hope her character comes back for the next installment of Mission Impossible.",

    "review": "  Each Mission: Impossible film pushes more than the previous mission. The first \"Mission: Impossible\" was the update of the 60s' TV series that introduced the characters and their methods. Four years later, \"Mission: Impossible 2\" focused more on the action and was the first mission to push things up a bit, and it was also the first of the series becoming just Tom Cruise's extreme, action-packed vehicle. Six years later, \"Mission: Impossible III\" done a farther push with more thrills and a little more action whilst balanced. Five years later, \"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol\" strengthen the push further. Now four years later, the latest mission \"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation\" push it all the way to the point of challenging and twisting the traditional elements with unpredictable outcomes.The position \"Rogue Nation\" put itself among the films is being the best when challenging what's been known and displaying the best of its ways of being entertaining. Before describing what kind of play it'd played, it's worth pointing out that this installment is a throwback to the second installment with similarities. The second installment was the least received of the series, but provided action sequences that were one of the respective genre's best. So as the latter was balanced with the action and small attention to the substance, the latest mission improves it with more excitement and thrills through the twists to the known style, otherwise inadvertently erasing it.The way it was pushed was done with complex writing that was well-handled to make things such as the twists and quick action work, as well blending in some comic without losing concentration. With the concentration unbothered, thrills were resulted. But there's another source that fills those description that made this a great movie is the great cast, with the returning Cruise, Rhames, Renner and Pegg with the additions of Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin. The obvious standout is the driver himself, Tom Cruise. His performance and stunts should get him at least be recognized for a nomination for Best Actor as he felt the real adrenaline that channels him whilst performing. Also, give an Oscar contender to director Christopher McQuarrie as his direction helped the pushing as well.\"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation\" is the best Mission yet by pushing the style of the action and intelligent complexity writing to crack the limits to generate the thrills, excitement and occasional humor, and the cast performed well to stay at that level. Now, it's your mission, should you choose to accept it, to see this before it gets minimized for available viewings on smaller screens since the kind of scale this Mission has is a big-screen ride.

CIA wants to capture Ethan DoA. Ethan saves the day, and all the cast of doubt fades off. What we are left with is Mission Impossible Part X presented in a different fashion with the same flavor. Courtesy to Tom Cruise and Co. Though the movie sparks with a spectacular chases, thrills, Cruise pulling off the plane stunt et cetra, what really perforates me as a viewer and a FAN of MI series in particular is the clich� of movie making which is being employed in all the MI films. I was expecting for more but it didnt happen. Overall, the movie fares well, thanks to Tom Cruise, Rebecca Louis Ferguson and the rest of the cast. The Villain of the movie was pretty lame and sad throughout the film seeking attention for his screen presence, but merely makes a mark in any of them.",

    "review": "  One for the popcorn lovers. So the IMF agency has been disgraced and terminated by the CIA. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is still in the field. With no cavalry coming, it's up to him to take down the shadowy group of people known as the Syndicate, a band of criminals that to this day, has not even been proved to have even existed. Speaking from a personal standpoint, I am only familiar with the most recent movies in this series. I missed 3, and I watched 1 and 2 at some point long ago, but I really can't recall anything as far as specific details go from either of them, except the theme music. Now you would think that that my lack of familiarity may cause me to view these movies more distantly, but it's quite the opposite, really. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Ghost Protocol, the fourth film, is one of the best action films of the last 5 years, and I stand by that statement. So how does Rogue Nation stack up against it? It's good, but not as great. This is still fun, don't get me wrong. This is a series that is all about the set piece, and when Rogue Nation is being a straight action movie, that's when it shines the brightest, keeping you entirely in the moment. The action is all well thought out and makes sense (for the most part, but I'll get to that in a bit), but where this installment runs into issues is in the story department. Rogue Nation pulls of the difficult feat in that it is simple and convoluted at the same time. They make this so much more complicated than it needs to be, and I would be lying if I said that it didn't drag the film down as a whole quite a bit. When it slows down and stops being action-y, you can't help but notice the number of flaws in the storytelling. The fifth Mission: Impossible movie is much less about the team and much more about Tom Cruise, which is unfortunate, because they had just fixed that in Ghost Protocol. They give Jeremy Renner much less to do, which is also a shame, because the series was primed to have the reigns handed over to him. The villain is kind of bland, and there are a couple of instances where the suspension of your disbelief is pushed past the limit. For example, there's a car crash where all parties should have died, and even if you can blur your eyes and get past that, it is followed by a high speed motorcycle wipe-out where there is barely a scratch on Ethan Hunt. I know that it seems like I'm being harder on this than I actually ended up feeling about it, but these are things that I couldn't in my right mind go without mentioning. If you can overlook all these flaws, there's enough good featured here to have a fun time, and my rating reflects that.",

There is no actor in Hollywood more dedicated to movies and entertainment that Tom Cruise, he was really on a plane. Ghost protocol may be the best in the series but this is sure to be the most entertaining of the series. Mission Impossible Rouge Nation gets a 4/5.",

They finally got the flow of the movie correct. The one thing that bugged me (and that's cause of my anal-retentive personality :)) was the theme song. In this movie, they got it close to the TV series. The action was superb, especially the opening action sequence. And many of the people who have stated the actress who played the disavowed British agent Ilsa Faust did do a great job. You can think of her as the female version of Tom Cruise. I loved it so much that I will be watching it again.Oh, and see it in IMAX for the action sequences, You will be blown away.",

    "review": "  In an age of CGI robots, apes, and (digitally enhanced) superheroes, it's nice to know that Tom Cruise is still the best special effect money can buy. In Hong Kong cinema, this may be a staple, but rarely on this side of the world do we have an actor willing to throwing caution to the wind (literally) to entertain an audience. Christopher McQuarrie (VALKYRIE, EDGE OF TOMORROW) is a solid writer (and I am an admitted fan of both WAY OF THE GUN and JACK REACHER), but one can't help but feel at times that he was overwhelmed as a director. A good ole-fashioned Spy Flick was the aim, but McQuarrie, Cruise, and company fall a bit short - especially in comparison to the solid MI:III and MI:GHOST PROTOCOL. That being said, one should appreciate, and hope for more, creative hyper-realistic-in-camera action spectacles that this film and the phenomenal MAD MAX: FURY ROAD provide over the bloated cartoons that audiences have grown accustomed to.",

    "review": "  I do agree that Tom Cruise is now 54 and that doing those death defying stunts in that age and looking still in peak form at this stage is extremely commendable. But to overlook all that is not there in this film and the things it lacks only to cloud it up with the fact that \"Oh Tom Cruise can do that even now!\" is for audience that craves for popcorn flicks. Rogue Nation is entertaining but it is surely not the best in the franchise. Infact I feel Mission Impossible 3 with its mind games and an excellent act by Seymour Hoffman was better. Ghost Protocol certainly was. Rogue Nation opens with a brilliant sequence but just not as brilliant as the ones we have come to expect from the series. The \"impossible\" stunt of the underwater dive is good too but then again it pales in comparison to the thrills the Burj Khalifa act in Ghost Protocol gave. The film also suffers from a very un-intimidating villain and a not so threatening impending sense of doom.Jeremy Renner and Rhames are reduced to sidekicks though Simon Pegg gets some moments of comic timing though even that doesn't compare with the previous films. The surprise however is Rebecca Ferguson who plays the cold hearted yet vulnerable MI6 agent to the hilt. Finally it is Cruise who almost single handedly sees the film through and though it maybe peppered with ordinary bike chases, stunts and weakening humor it is still a pretty good film to enjoy. Ghost Protocol still rules the roost.",

    "review": "  Mission Impossible Rogue Nation is the fifth MI film to date. I'm sure there'll be more down the line. If you liked the last four MI films, particularly Ghost Protocol, you will get a kick out of this as it's more of the same. All the characters from Ghost Protocol reprise their roles here with the exception for one and they added another woman to replace her. The story is very simple. Ethan Hunt returns once more played by Tom Cruise along with his team from the last film save one. This time around he is hunting for a rogue organization called the Syndicate. The Syndicate is an organization that consists of former intelligence operatives who had been reported missing or dead which commits heinous acts all across the world in secret. Before Hunt can track them he is captured and IMF is shut down. However, a mysterious woman saves which leaves Hunt with her as his only lead to find the Syndicate.  All the actors like Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, etc. all do fine work as usual. Tom Cruise is at top form which is impressive considering he's in his late fifties now. He still does his own stunts which is crazy. Alec Baldwin is also in the movie as the head of the CIA and he does fine for what he had. The new girl they got for this, Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), also did a good job and kicked some ass. As usual all the characters are likable and have great chemistry. I also like the villain this time around. Usual the villains in these movies aren't the best. While this villain doesn't have any depth per say (they go into him a bit but not much) but he's very charismatic, smart, and poses quite the challenge for Hunt and his team. The villain here might be the strongest of the franchise so far.The action and effects were blood-pumping as usual. You also have your complex impossible break-in operation you see in each of these movies which are always fun to watch and this is no exception. The final action scene I thought was lacking a bit though compared to some of the other films.Though, there are a couple minor things for me. For one I'm getting a bit sick of the whole \"going rogue\" thing where Ethan and his team are on the run from IMF or, in this case, the CIA. In practically all of these films you have Ethan going rogue and is one the run from his own government while trying to stop the main villain. Even many of the recent James Bond movies have done this to death. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of the whole lone hero or heroes versus the world trope. However, even awesome clich�s become stale when abused too much.Also I wish these films would go more into Hunt as a character. Even the recent Bond films have begun diving into his past including the latest one coming out Spectre. That might be a nitpick for a film like this but some character moments definitely wouldn't hurt. Overall if you are a fan of this franchise than you will enjoy this film. It does everything the other films have done and did them well. If you liked the fourth film especially you should like this if not love it.",

The film is intense sequence after intense sequence, and it kept me on the edge of my seat! The stunts, action, thrills, and intensity will please anybody who love action/adventure films, and I highly recommend it!",

    "review": "  When I saw the trailer for this movie, I wasn't on board. I thought it looked boring and I wasn't planning to go to the movie. The only reason I saw it is because everyone else wanted to see it and I just went with them. A lot of people must have agreed with my friends because at two in the afternoon on a Wednesday, the showing I went to sold out! I was amazed! Once I got out of the movie, I felt as disappointed as I did when I saw the trailer. The first thing I realized is that everything that was in the trailer was shown within the first twenty minutes of the movie. The sequences of action where very boring and dragged on forever. The movie was also varied predictable. I could tell what the hell was going to happen next. They seemed to focus on the foreshadowing a lot in this movie. I didn't enjoy the acting that much either. I never liked tom cruise and I still don't like him. The CGI in this movie was so obvious. It's like they special effects people didn't even try for this movie. For me overall, I didn't like this movie that much. I would give it a 33/100 and does not recommend this movie to anyone unless you want to see a dull, boring action movie. Still better then Jurassic World, though!",

    "review": "  IN DE PALMA THEIR HANDS - My Review of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: ROGUE NATION (4 Stars)Sometimes, and I mean rarely, a blockbuster well into its franchise just works. Think about how CASINO ROYALE reinvigorated the 007 Series, with Daniel Craig and director Martin Campbell bringing a healthy dose of gravitas to something that had long-before resorted to trashy silliness. But, again, that kind of thing happens as often as Halley's Comet. Imagine my surprise then when writer/director Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise reunited for this fifth installment and went in guns blazing. This is a thrilling action movie, effortlessly jumping from set piece to set piece with deliciously shifting loyalties and some tightly-wound suspense. It's not going to change the world, but it definitely sends a warning shot to all the other Studio Tentpole makers to up their game and at least stay engaged with the swill they're shilling. MISSION picks up a short time after the Kremlin-destroying events of GHOST PROTOCOL, with our hero, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) desperately trying to get to a plane before it takes off. Yes, the filmmakers blow their poster wad within the first five minutes, giving us that indelible and real shot of Cruise dangling from the side of a plane in mid-air. My instant thought was, \"That's pretty ballsy. I hope they have more tricks up their sleeves or else this thing is an early climaxer!\"Turns out, it was just an appetizer, and when we come back from credits, we find the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) in disarray and losing its power, with Hunt having gone dark in the field. A perfect time for the Syndicate, a band of terrorists hellbent on world domination, to set their plot in motion. Of course they have to go through Ethan and his loyal band of spies, and we all know how that tends to work out for the bad guys. Joined again by Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames, Cruise and company find themselves in a race against time to save the world. The story, as usual, is somewhat irrelevant, but the execution of the thrills and chills thoroughly won me over. Without spoiling anything, we're treated to torture, an attempted assassination at an opera, a thrillingly-edited underwater sequence, and a good half dozen more scenes before the film almost literally dumps you out, spent and exhausted. Bringing an ambiguous dose of tension is Rebecca Ferguson, excellent as the femme fatale who may or may not be on Ethan's side. It's this push-pull that gives the film its effervescent kick. I've enjoyed Cruise's performances in recent years because he's become more willing to give us the aging action star who suffers aches, pains, and real fear. He may ultimately prevail, but there's a cost nowadays. Battle fatigue often plays better than superhuman strength, something the world of MARVEL and DC COMICS could stand to learn. Beautifully shot by master cinematographer Robert Elswit, who ruled 2014 with stellar work on NIGHTCRAWLER and INHERENT VICE, and edited with rare patience by Eddie Hamilton, ROGUE NATION seldom resorts to the style of seizure-inducing scenes in most giant CGI nightmares. Instead, much effort has been put into understanding each location and who is doing what to whom. Trust me, that just does not happen much anymore. McQuarrie also gets credit here, using alternate scenarios to get what's normally droning exposition across to the viewers. The preparation for the underwater scenes, for example, made great use of dispensing complicated information by way of showing Simon Pegg suffering the outcome of a mission that could go horribly wrong. This and the stunning opera scene reminded me of vintage Brian De Palma, who in addition to making such suspense classics as DRESSED TO KILL and BLOW OUT, happened to direct the first MISSION installment. De Palma understands screen geography better than most and he's always infused his scenes with a somewhat winking, knowing, dreamlike energy. McQuarrie seems to pull from the same playbook, perhaps to honor his predecessor's work on the series, or maybe it's because he just thinks De Palma has done cheese correctly. Either way, what we have here is very De Palma-esque. For a director like De Palma, who has often been criticized for being too Hitchcock-esque, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: ROGUE NATION seems to give him his long-deserved due...even if he had nothing to do with it.",

    "review": "  Unless you're just obsessed with watching cars all the time (The Fast and the Furious films), the Mission: Impossible movies have become the best action franchise out there. You get something different in each film. Although the one constant is Tom Cruise pretty much breaking his body to impress the audience. He's now 53 years old and still doing his own insanely risky stunts that other actors won't do. People raved about the last Mission: Impossible reinvigorating the series, but that one really just had two big elaborate scenes and a completely unmemorable villain. The newest entry in the series surpasses that one in my opinion.Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, like the others before it, has what sounds like a convoluted plot but winds up being easier to follow as it goes along. And as always, the unique action scenes distract you from any concerns you may have about the plot anyway. This time around, the IMF agency that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team work for has been disbanded and now absorbed into the CIA. This is due to the IMF's extreme and sometimes unacceptable methods of operating, as well as Ethan Hunt's insistent belief in an international criminal organization known as the Syndicate which leads him to being cutoff by the CIA.So know Hunt is perceived to be on his own as he's missing in action from their last operation. With the CIA after him, he now has to worry about his own country which he once worked for as well as a new adversary named Solomon Lane who heads that very Syndicate which he has been trying to eradicate. Solomon is a chilling, malevolent antagonist to Hunt as he captures him early in the film. Luckily, Ethan Hunt's fellow agents agree to help him out regardless of the IMF's disbanding. That's part of what has made the last three Mission: Impossible films in particular really work: they're not all about Ethan Hunt, but rather about how his team works so cohesively to help him complete his missions. But don't get me wrong, it's always Tom Cruise at the forefront. Other actors get their moment such as Simon Pegg who adds humor to all the crazy action. Yet it's Cruise who dazzles everyone with his game stunt work and dedication to the role. Whether it's holding his breath underwater for minutes at a time or literally hanging off the side of an actual airplane in flight, he always pushes the envelope and wows us. Regardless of your personal opinion of the man, he shuts his naysayers up when it comes to entertaining his audience with these films. You can expect more Mission: Impossible movies in the future as this is one of the only film franchises that continues to get better and better as it goes along.",

    "review": "  In the last 10 years, I have sit through 4 of the Mission Impossible films and I loved them. Growing up Tom Cruise was The MI guy for me, that's how I knew him before anything else. So when MI:5 was announced I was very excited and I wanted to go back to all of them starting from MI: Ghost Protocol but doing that I realized that these movies were not memorable. I mean, I remembered how they made me feel but I hardly remembered any specifics about the movies. The other crazy thing was that some of them - MI:2 & MI:1 - didn't really hold up, that's when I started to get a bit worried about Rogue Nation.The storyline did little to subside my worries but I was mostly in, and what a surprise it was. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, is mindblowing, action packed, and gripping to the end. It managed to make me reevaluating the situation the whole way through. Nothing was exactly as they seemed or as I predicted, no matter how small it was there was always some details that I didn't see coming. I sometime watch movies with a clear ideas of what's coming and that doesn't stop me from enjoying these films - if the execution and the acting is solid - but in this case I only roughly guessed how things would play out. So there was room for surprises and I liked that.Speaking about surprises, Sean Harris was pretty good in the movie, I'm not saying that I'm shocked, but I was surprised to see him in a role like this and I'm glad he pulled it off. It's almost the same thing with Alec Baldwin, they managed to make his role a little bit more interesting than the stereotypical type these characters usually are. But the biggest surprise is Rebecca Ferguson, I still can't believe that it's the same woman from the mini-series The White Queen. She's fascinating and mysterious in the movie, not that the latest MI films have a bad track record with female leads but this one is probably the best out of all of them. MI: Rogue nation was a fun, entertaining movie going experience.@wornoutspines",

    "review": "  Love him or hate him, you cannot deny that Tom Cruise is Box Office gold. Here we have the fifth movie in the franchise that started with a gamble on a live-action film version of a '60s TV show which, by all accounts have been continuing with each iteration to outdo the last. Where the 'Bond' movies seem to get worse and laughable as they continue, the 'M:I' movies seem to hit the mark each and every time as individual hits. This franchise is different in the fact that each movie can stand on its own with little backstory needed to get viewers up to date. Cruise, even in his early 50's, is as good if not better than most action stars half his age. As part of the writing team and the Director of this, his third movie, Christopher McQuarrie knows how to get the audience glued to the screen. With thrills, comedy and edge-of-your-seat action to boot McQuarrie completes the holy grail. This franchise has gone from strength to strength and is all the better for it. Each director has put their own original spin on the franchise. I remember when 'Ghost Protocol' came out, it hit all the right notes and became my favourite movie of the year. MI:5 has accomplished the same thing this year too. Everyone in this film is perfectly cast and kudos to the casting director for casting the actors in believable roles. Special shoutout to Sean Harris who is a perfect villain reminiscent of classic 'Bond'. Each scene is constructed to perfection and even in scenes where Hunt is close to death, I found myself in the theatre, tense and stressed over whether he would make it through or not. This movie is style defined entertainment at its best and Cruise never misses a beat. If this movie does anything, it solidifies the franchise as one of the greatest of them all deserving all the praise it gets. I for one will be front and centre for the premiere of MI:6.",

When I heard that Rogue Nation was in the works, I hoped that this movie would not be a waste of time. And thankfully, it wasn't. This movie is a fun joyride with amazing action and acting, and also includes an amazing cast of characters that bring this movie to life. This movie focuses on the IMF being shut down due to previous actions, and Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) is sent into hiding after being accused of being a terrorist. But the real terrorist is the evil group known as the Syndicate, who are wanting to create a new world order by executing a series of terrorist attacks. Ethan must gather his friends, Luther Strickell (played by Ving Rhames), William Brandt (played by Jeremy Renner), and Benji (played by Simon Pegg). They are also helped by former Syndicate worker Ilsa Faust (played by Rebecca Ferguson), and IMF agent Alan Hunley (played by Alec Baldwin). With this team, they attempt to stop Solomon Lane (played by Sean Harris) and his Syndicate group before they can commence these terrorist attacks. If you love the Mission Impossible movies, this is a must see, for it is one of the best of the franchise. It blends action and comedy together perfectly, and proves that Tom Cruise is still one of the best action stars ever. It also had some tense moments. I had a blast watching this, which is why I am giving it 4 1/2 stars.",

So, when we found out that \"Ant-Man\" had temporarily been removed from the nearest theater due to technical problems, I immediately insisted that we watch this movie.Best decision I'd made for the past months really.It was action-packed, fast-paced, hella hilarious, and just totally awesome. The stunts were amazing, the cinematography was an absolute delight, and the cast's charisma and chemistry were perfect. This film made my month. I'll be downloading it once the torrent's out because I seriously have to watch it over and over again.I'm thankful that we didn't end up watching \"Ant-Man\" (though I still want to see it).",

The action is amazing with a story that grips you and a bit of humour primarily from Benji (Simon Pegg).

The movie is a rehashed series of stunts and scenes that take you from point to point without ever driving you out of the parking lot. The movie shines brightest when it creates intriguing plot points but inevitably fails to deliver on any of them in a big way. Like most of the Mission Impossible stories, it starts out with larger ambitions and becomes increasingly isolated as we simply focus on Tom Cruise chasing someone.",

I thought this film lost a real opportunity by not using Jeremy Renner in more of an action role - but perhaps Cruise didn't want to be shown up.

Rogue Nation may not obviously be the best M:I film and perhaps no M:I sequel can ever surpass the first movie, but this sequel is as strong, fun, and exciting as M:I:3 and M:I:4, and of course way better than M:I:2. Granted, that doesn't say much, but it still says something, and that thing is very positive. There is still life in this franchise and it seems like it's far from over, at least I hope. We go to the theater to see films like this because we want to have a good time while enjoying a good (well-made) movie, and not many films deliver. In fact, they often fail, and sometimes embarrassingly so. Thankfully, this franchise aims to please and pleasantly surprise with each sequel. Here's to the seventh film, cheers! :D I give Mission: Impossible: Rogue Nation an B+.",

    "review": "  Tom Cruise hit on one hell of an idea when he decided to turn classic tv CBS series Mission: Impossible into a feature film that has spawned one of the more interesting and enduring film franchises ever. Cruise is producer as well as star and puts a new director in charge of each film. Since 1996, we've seen Mission: Impossible movies from Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird (his Ghost Protocol remains the high point of the series). Cruise, now 53, can play IMF (Impossible Mission Force) undercover agent Ethan Hunt until he drops dead and I'm totally fine with that. Cruise is still a star incapable of slowing down, still running, jumping, climbing and fighting like a dude who has never stopped feeling the need for speed.Cruise returns for the fifth time and is no worse for wear in Mission: Impossible--Rogue Nation. The director this time is Christopher McQuarrie, who teamed with Cruise on the moody and intense Jack Reacher. McQuarrie has never dealt with material on this huge a scale, and the strain to amp up the action shows. The film starts with Ethan hanging off of the side of an Airbus A400M cargo plane during takeoff. Why? Who cares why in a rip-roaring franchise that has no place for logic.Yet McQuarrie, who won an Oscar for his amazing screenplay for 1995's The Usual Suspects, has plenty of aces up his sleeve. He brings a palpable indie sensibility to the big FX proceedings, but never skimps on t he wow factor, particularly in a motorcycle chase in Morocco and an underwater sequence that sees Ethan get help form his teammates Benji (a priceless Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames). The plot, whatever plot there is, involves Ethan and Agent Brandt (Jeremy Renner) trying to save IMF from destruction by the CIA, led by a wonderful Alec Baldwin that is to bogged down by exposition-spouting dialog. Ethan knows a mysterious Syndicate is looking at taking over the world but no one else believes him.McQuarrie borrows philosophical elements from his own Usual Suspects when Ethan and Brit double-agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, a real show stealer) takes on uber-creepy Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), a villain that could be a dead ringer for Keyser Soze. Harris, best known for his role on The Borgias, is no Kevin Spacey, and Rogue Nation is no Usual Suspects, but it has its best moments when McQuarrie lets loose his inner film geek and whips up an amazing shootout at the Vienna opera that is Hitchcock worthy. It's a knockout sequence like that, in which Cruise gives it his all as an actor and an athlete, that proves Mission: Impossible has plenty of juice left in it.",

    "review": "  This has to be the most overrated film I've ever seen. 92%? That's just crazy. It's 90 minutes of exposition with almost as much live opera as action, no I'm not kidding. Truly and literally this film ends with a whimper. In the end it runs with watered down trending tropes from other highly successful franchises, particularly the various Sherlock Holmes movies (Moriarty anyone?). But it does way too much explaining and not nearly enough doing. At the bottom, the characters are motiveless. Only Simon Pegg shows up as a person who might be an actual human with an actual life.",

    "review": "  Tom Cruise's movies have always been good. This blasts you off in an adventure with one almost impossible mission after another. It was weird that the plane scene is at the way beginning of the film, I thought it would be in the middle somewhere. Ethan Hunt does a lot of crazy stuff in this movie that I thought was mind blowing. From riding at top speed to holding your breath underwater, it is insane. The final scene I thought could have been more epic like in MI2 but i guess the rest of the movie makes up for that. The only thing I hated is that they showed clips of the movie during the pre-credit sequence; what kind of stupid thing is that! Close your eyes during that part. I didn't really relate to anything in this so that's why it doesn't get a higher grade. But yes a really good movie, go see it.",

Tom Cruise's thrilling stunts are packed with energy, and the action was perfectly executed. This may be because I haven't seen the other films, but the characters weren't really dynamic (as in character change through movie). However, this is a summer blockbuster, so the big focal point always has to be the non-stop action, in which Mission Impossible Rogue Nation knew how to show it. 4/5",

One great scene aside, no matter how thrilling and visually accomplished it is, cannot hide the fact that the franchise feels its age this 5th time round. The best and most original thing is Rebecca Ferguson's enigmatic Isla Faust who could be either friend or foe and that ambiguity fuels the thrills and pushes the narrative on but otherwise, most of the plot beats are fairly predictable. Don't get me wrong, the film is still immensely entertaining and fun to watch and its box-office all but guarantees MI:6 but it doesn't deliver any surprises anymore. The real mission impossible, should they choose to take it, is that they need to reinvigorate the over-familiar and formularic narrative the next time round.",

I've always loved Mission Impossible but in all honesty and bit of shame, I have not been expecting such a ride. This movie crossed my expectations by long run. The movie is very intensive, there is not one moment when you would say to yourself \"what now\" or took a look at your wrist with or without watches. Rogue nation is packed with action from first to almost the last frame. What I must point out and what really was exceptional was sound editing. It was done with such precision that any careful viewer would notice. It was spot on in every moment, well done. I have also loved the addiction to the cast, since I am a big fan of Sean Harriss. Rebecca Ferguson was stunning. What was also amazing was the knowledge that crazy Cruis indeed did all his stunts himself, once again. And certain moments in film are deepened by this information. In overall, money well spent.",

    "review": "  While the opening of the film featured a very cool stunt involving Tom Cruise actually hanging on the side of an airplane (with a huge strap digitally removed, of course) it was very abrupt and felt like any average action sequence from the series so far, so after that I wasn't very excited and had to wonder what this film had in store for the rest of it.Ethan Hunt faces one of his toughest challenges yet: instead of being called upon for a mission by IMF, his mission briefing at the beginning is actually a challenge by an organization known as the Syndicate, which is basically a \"nation\" of rogue agents who have joined forces, hence the title. While you think this would be a great premise for action and tension it doesn't really pay off until the third act, which I will get to later.The writers of this film really seemed to not know what they wanted from the leading lady. In the scene which introduces her, we understand she wants to help IMF though she is posing as a member of the Syndicate. She explains to Hunt that for him to continue his effort against the Syndicate she needs the Syndicate to trust her. After this, there are moments where it is clear she is on the side of the IMF team, though the writers through curveballs left and right for us to question her loyalty, which isn't confusing, just really annoying. It is even confusing when people from London come into play with her and they basically screw her over, ridding her of the Macguffin of the film, which they know she needs to earn the Syndicate's trust. Do they just want her dead? Did they plan that so the villain wouldn't get what he needs? So not only is it a question of who she is loyal to, but who really trusts her as well.The third act of the film is great, as one of the scenes is particularly tense - perhaps the most tense scene from the entire series, and the way the conflict of the film gets resolved is dark, clever, and fitting in that it parallels a scene at the very beginning of the film. I'm trying to avoid spoilers as much as I can, but you'll know what I'm talking about if you see the movie.Maybe I just have to rewatch this in order to appreciate it as a whole, but the third act of this film is probably one of the best third acts I've seen from an action film period. It is probably in my top 2 of the Mission Impossible series, though that isn't saying it's necessarily great, but pretty good.",

    "review": "  \"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation\" is the latest (and arguably greatest) chapter in the 50-year-old Mission: Impossible franchise. While many franchises grow stale with time, this one has stayed fresh by shifting its focus from psychological mystery to non-stop action thrills. I do love the tone of the original 1996 film, but this shifted focus has allowed the Mission: Impossible series to evolve and stay relevant throughout several generations. This film builds on the momentum created by \"Ghost Protocol\" as the story travels to new exotic locations, introduces new gadgets, and continues to incorporate the classic mind games that define this brand of spy film. I worried that another Ethan-Hunt-must-take-down-the-bad-guys-to-prove-his-innocence concept would fall flat due to its similarity to other films in the series, but the real focus of this story is the changing perspective of whether Ilsa, a mysterious British agent, is a hero or a villain. The character is very well-written and Rebecca Ferguson embraces the depth of her conflicting motivations. Another interesting twist is that, rather than battle a terrorist, Ethan must take down an entire crime organization headed by the mastermind Solomon Lane. Lane is played by Sean Harris, who uses a quiet approach that somehow exudes an intimidating sense of power. Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner reprise their roles to create continuity with \"Ghost Protocol.\" One of my biggest issues with these films is that each one feels like a new world without connection to previous films, but this one truly felt like a continuation of the previous story. Once you add in Ving Rhames (whose presence was really missing in the last film) and carefully cast insignificant roles with actors who leave a strong impression (like Hermione Corfield as the record shop girl), it helps to make the far-fetched plot more believable. One of my biggest complaints is that, like other films in the series, the characters endure far too much physical damage to still be on their feet. I suppose this is just something that you have to accept with an action film. \"Rogue Nation\" will probably be most remembered for its high-speed motorcycle chase. I don't think I blinked or took a single breath until it was over. I was a bit disappointed that the highly-advertised stunt in which Tom Cruise actually hangs off of the wing of a plane as it takes off occurred in the first 3 minutes of the film; however, all was redeemed with the opera sequence in Vienna. It was genius to craft the scene around a gunshot to be fired during the high A in Turandot's \"Nessun Dorma,\" one of the most famous notes in all of opera. I adored the stylistic shot in which they showed the note circled in the libretto, a clue that allows the musicians in the audience to anticipate the climax of the scene. If that wasn't enough to thrill me, composer Joe Kraemer brings the story full-circle by blending \"Nessun Dorma\" with the main theme during one of the film's most dramatic moments toward the end. These details will make it easy to rewatch the film, even once you know its twists. Just when you thought that it couldn't get any better, \"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation\" shows that there is a lot left to be told in the story of Ethan Hunt. I can't wait to see where they go next.",

    "review": "  Here's a little secret that a lot of screenplay writers don't know: ALL movies-no matter the genre, no matter the topic, no matter the setting-are action oriented. I'm not talking about gun battles and car chases and buildings imploding or scenes full of physical violence from the moment the credits roll, I'm talking about those smaller scenes where people . . . just talk. Yeah, that's what I said: there is (or should be) a ton of action, verbal action in scenes where people sit in chairs, stare at each other and just talk. I know! Revolutionary idea, right, that the \"dialogue scenes\" in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation are just as action filled as that beautifully insane Moroccan motorcycle chase in MI5? Well, it's not really a \"new\" idea to make dialogue scenes \"active.\" The ancient Greeks knew that the actor's voice with the right words to say could create in the audience's mind a wonderful sense of movement and activity. And the GREAT acting coach, Constantin Stanislavski, made this a major point in his teachings: Acting = ActionWriter (and director) Christopher McQuarrie delivers a script that is \"nonstop\" action. No, Seriously. Every scene is geared towards action. The characters are actively trying to accomplish something in an extremely active manner in EVERY scene. And whether it's the very intimate scenes when Ethan and the mysterious Ilsa try to figure out if the other is an ally or a deadly enemy, or the bigger than life scene where Benji pleads with Ethan to let him go into the field it's all an exciting/edge of your chair time for the audience. But as grand a script as this is, it also takes an extremely skilled group of actors to make it work. And this ensemble of Thespians (Okay, I just had to use the old high school term for theatre geeks at least once in a review) are working together like a well-oiled acting machine. There are no real stars here, and much to his credit Tom Cruise works extremely well fitting in with this group. But I have to single out one actor cause the character he created for this movie, Solomon Lane (which is real close to sounding like Robert E. Howard's character, Solomon Kane), is one scary frigging psychopathic villain. Listen, I'm an ex-Marine and Vietnam veteran (Okay, okay, I was a cook . . . Semper Fi; stir and fry . . . but still a vet.) and this character scared the crap out of me. It was a brilliant performance by English actor, Sean Harris.However, as wonderful as the movie is, there are a few glitches.1. Too many damn close ups! Don't you filmmakers get it? Close ups kill tension in a scene. It's that simple. And you shot most of this film in one of the most beautiful, intriguing places in the world, Morocco, and all you want to show me are close ups of the inside of Tom Cruise's nose? Okay, it is pretty nice the septum . . . but I'd rather see Morocco! So back that damn camera up!2. Extremely uninteresting hand-to-hand combat scenes. It's got to stop these uninteresting, chopped-up, unwatchable fight scenes. They really slow down the action. If the actor can't do the stunts, then hire someone who can. Or if the problem is you just don't know HOW to shoot a fight scene, go watch-John Wick (2015), Kingsman: the Secret Service (2015)-to see how it's done!3. Stop jump cutting intimate dialogue between characters. It's extremely annoying to try and follow intimate dialogue scenes when you keep jump cutting back and forth to each character when he/she speaks! There's a scene in a caf� when the MI Team sits around a table to discuss their strategy to take out the ever evil Syndicate and the camera keeps jumping back and forth, back and forth to whomever is talking. They do it ALL THE TIME! Again, it's annoying and totally uninteresting to watch from an audience member's point of view. Back the camera up, make it a static shot if you like, and just shoot the damn scene. Everybody doesn't have to be seen face-full just because they're talking. Although the above gripes are artistic ideals I'm passionate about . . . I really liked the script and the work of the actors in this movie. And it's saying something about the power of a good script and damn good acting when I can forgive technique faults.",

The Mission Impossible movies have gotten better and better since Woo's cringefest, and it may have reached its highest point yet. This movie is filled with nonstop tension, extreme action, and fast pace. The acting is the best we've seen, and the characters are the best of the series yet. The stunts and action is the best of the franchise, having multiple scenes that may even beat out the Burj Khalifa scene from Ghost Protocol. It was intense, fast-paced, and one of the most fun movies of the year. 9.5/10",

Rogue Nation has all the elements of an entertaining movie: Great stunts, locations, and a story which executes characters into great action sequences. The Cruse\\Hunt character looks vulnerable fighting a new nemesis/counter organization which creates a new entertaining dynamic. Of course Rouge Nation uses deception, adaptation, and manipulation to create a dramatic conclusion. The ending with Baldwin and Renner had me laughing. 3 and half stars. Okay film.",

Pourtant, le film reste un peu trop long, avec quelques sc�nes d'action qui semblent rajout�es pour le quota spectaculaire. Si Rebecca Ferguson est plut�t quelconque, le quatuor Cruise - Pegg - Renner - Rhames marche franchement bien, tout comme le nouvel arrivant, Alec Baldwin. Si tout ceci n'a rien de nouveau (en tout cas, beaucoup moins que le 3 ou le 4), force est de constater qu'on se prend encore une fois au jeu et qu'un sixi�me �pisode sera plus que bienvenu.

After the IMF is disbanded secret agent Ethan Hunt goes rogue in order to complete one last mission to expose a criminal syndicate of former spies turned mercenaries. Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, and Simon Pegg return, and are joined by Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin. And their performances are pretty good; particularly Ferguson, whose stunt work and fight scenes are especially well-done. Director Christopher McQuarrie also does an impressive job, and brings a lot of suspense and tension to the action sequences. Thoroughly entertaining, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is an explosive spy thriller.",

    "review": "  Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation proves that there's still a lot mileage in the franchise yet. The MI movies with the exception of MI2 which was pants, are everything that you'd want from a summer blockbuster. The visuals are amazing, the stunts spectacular and it's got a good dose of humour to go with the espionage stuff. Even though there were a couple of Fast and the Furious moments (you know those moments in a film where you'd say to yourself, \"yeah, they'd definitely die from that\"), there's not too many so you can still suspend your disbelief which in compared to the Fast and the Furious movies your disbelief is suspended and sprang back in your face.Although over the course of the 19 years of this franchise there hasn't been much in the way of character development, Tom Cruise is still a bad-ass who seems to be looking for more and more extreme stunts to pull off with the passing of each installment. In this case he's hanging from a plane by his finger tips and involved in a high-speed motorcycle chase around Morocco wearing one of your Dad's Hawaiian shirts and a pair of shades. God knows what he's going to do next, he's not tried to French-kiss a killer shark yet, maybe he'll try that.As we know Cruise can now play Ethan Hunt in his sleep so the most surprising performances come from two of the fringe characters: Rebecca Ferguson and Simon Pegg. Rebecca plays a double age, or possible a treble agent depending on your definition and in this she is pretty much Ethan's equal when it comes to the action stakes. And Simon who has mostly been known as just the 'comic relief' in these movies delivers a much more rounded and likeable performance as the tech guy Benji (why he's named after a dog I'll never know).Speaking of dogs, does anyone else think that the Mission Impossible films are pretty much the equivalent to the modern day Indiana Jones (if you remember Indy was named after the family dog)?The only quibble about this movie and a couple of the other MI movies is the casting of the villain. In this movie I was never convinced by Sean Harris as Solomon Lane, the man in charge of the Syndicate. He looked more like an accountant then someone who could actually beat Hunt.",

    "review": "  There have been only a handful of franchises(5 films or more) who have been able to both constantly reinvent themselves and also continue to find audience favour for their efforts. Fast and Furious, Bond Series and now Mission Impossible come to mind which have been to able achieve it and hence get Studios to greenlight future installments, sometimes even before the release of the latest one.Tom Cruise with his Scientology baggage, Oprah couch jumping, Katie Divorce et al has seen his Hollywood A lister stock plummet in the past decade and not so great domestic box office of his recent films like Edge of Tomorrow, Oblivion and Jack Reacher didn't help his case too.This janor of films always reach out to the arch nemesis to lift them beyond Zone Ordinary and to take example of Bond Films, Blofeld in the past or Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva, the villain in Skyfall or the menacing look of Christoph Waltz in the upcoming Spectre have achieved both for themselves and their films long lasting cult status.Sean Harris who had proved his acting chomps in Prometheus mesmerizes us all with his performance and trust me he does that with his voice modulation alone which leave an eerie after taste as you leave the theatre after this sumptuous feast. Thandie Newton's female lead in MI:2 which was both vulnerable yet strong, was my favorite in the series, but not any longer because Rebecca Ferguson plays her part with slither, charm and bravado and I hope Paramount can overlook past tradition and repeat the female lead in MI:6 as she brings such a layered performance to the table that all of us would love to peel more in the future instalments. Benji has the wittiest lines, Luther still packs the brawny charm while William plays the apprentice who shall likely take over when Tom Cruise is too old to hang off planes and buildings. Coming to planes, the Airbus A400 scene supposedly shot eight times without stunt double just to get it right doesn't awe and shock you like the Burj Khalifa cliff hanger in Part 5, though the customary \"Steal the Impossible\" set-piece did make you lose your breath as Tom held his own for beyond 3 minutes. In the era of Bourne and Craig led Bond, its a tribute that this franchise has held its own and shall challenge MI:4 for the worldwide Box Office crown.Tom Cruise has begun to look his age, but his face is the only place this film has wrinkles on and inspite of being 133 minutes long you don't find places, which may be trimmed.The action sequences score 8 and more out of 10 in the Thrillometer readings consistently from start to finish and Moroccan government should be paying lots of tax subsidies for the spurt in tourism they shall witness this year. As shooting begins next summer on the sixth part, we look forward to both Tom Cruise and the others (Rebecca :I am holding my breath for you!!) to present another cliffhanger to add shine to one of the most loved film franchises around.PS: Take home message for me is to scourge for earlier films of Rebecca and keep an alert for future appearances too.",

    "review": "  When I was a kid I saw my first spy movie. It was amazing. It was complex, it had action and my dad had to watch it with me and carefully explain each characters motivation as I watched the lead man sift through supposed allies till he found true friends and that those he should have been able to trust the most had betrayed him completely for worldly reward. It's twist and turns left me dazed and I've never forgotten how it made me feel to watch this creature. It was so different than the classic stories I had been told and read and watched so far in my life. It was like a bee that had stung me, It strangely hurt to see how many times the hero was tricked into thinking himself safe then watching him escape the deathtraps they immediately dumped him into. But you never do forget how that bee sting felt. This bee sting was called mission impossible and after watching the fifth one tonight I can say that this franchises claim as one of the lead spy movies is dead. That bee is gone. It has squished itself into a new mold and spread itself thin to fit the shape of a new bug that has taken over the movie screen, the butterfly. We have all the new components of this new mold in their entirety however. The lead action man, tom cruise, on the verge of being too old for anything but the sort of stories where he defies his age to prove everyone wrong, especially the hot new spy recruit that will one day take his place (p.s. I am almost certain that this will be the premise for the last mission impossible movie sometime in the future.) The villain, with the almost incomprehensible accent and way of speaking that is meant to distract from the fact that he is not threatening to look at in the least. There are scary Russians, perfectly chiseled Germans and a seductive mystery woman in a flowy dress who the lead will almost seem to chase more than the main villain (p.s. is Ethan still married or was the revelation at the end of the last movie supposed to show how they weren't together anymore? I personally need a little more clarity on the matter and not just the comforting thought that there was only an oddly plutonic hug at the end of this film). There is even Jeremy Renner, the old man that almost looked young enough to take over the action film genre but couldn't quite convince everyone. This film even had a wonderfully funny British man to scream every time the lead man does something reckless (p.s. I actually really liked him, I think Simon peg was one of the best things to happen to this franchise as they almost seemed to be heading down a DC comics \"no jokes allowed\" route) However, as much as mission impossible has attempted to spread itself into the butterfly/marvel mold, this movie was like watching the drifting embers of a once powerful fire. It is beautiful in its own way but it is only a beautiful something that was once something else and has lost all of its former heat. The moral dilemma is gone, the betrayal is gone, and even a lot of exposition seems to be gone. Seriously though, It was like one long tricky chase scene where someone says, \"we have to do this\" someone else says \"why?\" then the first one answers \"it's the only way\" and he's off and people die. The classic, frantic thought at the end that there is no way out and the last minute split decision by the lead that saves everyone is gone now and simply replaced by an end where the good guys just find the most clever way possible of the tricking the villain. So go on, go watch a movie where Ethan hunt forgets how to slide across the hood of a car then remembers how to go on a high speed motorcycle chase. It was actually really good. just no longer a spy movie.",

    "review": "  Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation was fun, if a little dumb and convoluted. The movie doesn't exactly break new ground, but it has good laughs, good action scenes, and dynamic, charismatic characters. Yeah, even Tom Cruise. Admittedly, I'm a little disappointed that the main cast is such a sausage fest, but at least they worked off of each other well. A lot of scenarios got resolved in manners far too implausible to be credible (and anyone bringing up the title as a counter-argument will be punched) and the extent to which coincidence played into the success of their plans got a little tiring. But hey, it's Mission Impossible, so it's got enough action, intrigue, and rubber masks to keep me entertained. By my own admission, I haven't seen Mission Impossible III or Ghost Protocol, but this movie was good enough that it got me interested in seeing them. If you're down for a decent dick flick, I say check it out if you've got spare time.",

    "review": "  \"I've heard stories about you, but they can't all be true.\" It's understandable for someone within the \"Mission: Impossible\" universe to say this, skeptical of the many adventures of Ethan Hunt. In what may be the most consistently exciting franchise ever, he has been thrown onto a moving train, leapt between two skyscrapers, and scaled the tallest building the world, and that's only a few of his escapades. With Rogue Nation, the high-octane stunts-extravaganza is continued with operatic skill and thrill. What should be just another generic spy film is made cheer-worthy through crowd-pleasing action and loads of slick fun.Much of the success rests on Cruise's shoulders. He is easily one of the most committed stars in Hollywood, continuing the wonderful 2015 trend of practical effects, doing many of his own stunts. Our hearts pound because we sense the very real danger these people are in. Though Rogue Natiion may not have the single greatest combat scene in the franchise, it gives you the most bang-for-your-buck, rarely letting up long enough to let you catch your breath. When it does slow down, the tension is often cut beautifully by the cast, whose comedic beats between the excitement bring a nice respite.Otherwise, when the movie quiets down, the specifics of the plot and the not-intended-as-comedy dialogue drag a bit. Some mild cutting of superfluous scenes, specifically when focused on the weak villain and when unnecessarily objectifying the one woman, would've helped with the over-length. Mostly, though, the visuals, humor, stunts, and brilliantly iconic music kept me smiling throughout. Your mission, if you choose to accept it: see Rogue Nation.",

    "review": "  Given the critical and commercial success that Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol enjoyed a few years ago, it was inevitable that Cruise would be back for another instalment of the franchise. And so once again it's up to Ethan Hunt to save the world from international terrorists. And this time he'll be doing it as Washington's most wanted man. Hardly has the movie even begun before Impossible Missions Force is disbanded and absorbed by the CIA, which promptly declares Hunt a rogue agent and orders him brought in. So with the CIA's best men on his trail, and precious little intel to help him, he has to track down and dismantle the shadowing international terrorist group known only as the Syndicate. A group that knows far more about him than he does about it. These are long odds even for Hunt, but then doing the impossible is his business.His best hope lies with Ilsa Faust, a former British agent with connections to the Syndicate and a seeming attraction to him. Played by the beautiful Rebecca Ferguson, she is a very interesting character. She's smart, seductive, and very good in a fight, but you never can tell who's side she's on, if anyone's. It's clear that she has her own agenda and it's hard to tell if anything she's saying is the truth. But she's the closest thing Ethan has to an ally, and he can't seem to resist the allure of a dangerous woman in need of help. The plot is surprisingly smart for a summer popcorn flick, with sudden twists and reversals worthy of a recent Bond or Batman movie. Of course both the good guys' and bad guys' plans are excessively complicated and their success relies on a degree of timing and luck that would be impossible in real life, but who really cares? The action and plot twists are so tautly paced and slickly executed that suspension of disbelief is never a problem. It is a bit tedious how quickly the movie resorts to the clich�d plot device of the incompetent/corrupt CIA, but thankfully that ends up going in an entirely different direction than expected, with major narrative and comedic payoff.The action is of course excellent, with well-staged shootouts and car chases aplenty, and an opening sequence that would do a Bond movie proud. It also goes without saying that there is plenty of the high suspense the series is known for, especially in the obligatory high tech infiltration scene. And lest things get too serious, the tension is balanced by a great deal of very effective comic relief. Simon Pegg is hilarious as always as Benjie, Hunt's high strung and not entirely field capable tech specialist; his reactions shots during the Moroccan car chase are absolutely priceless. Nor is the movie afraid to score laughs at its star's expense, even poking subtle fun at Cruise's limited stature. With its ever present sense of humor and occasionally self-deprecating tone, the MI franchise is well on its way to establishing itself as the lighter alternative to the current Bond series. All in all, Rogue Nation is stylish, smart, and self aware, with just the right blend of adrenaline, suspense, and humor. Between this film and Ghost Protocol, I'd say that Cruise, director Christopher McQuarrie, and Paramount have perfected their formula for wildly entertaining spy thrillers. Here's looking forward to the next installment.",

    "review": "  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION is an fun, old school meets new school, spy action thrill ride that isn't just the best of the M:I pictures so far, it's one of the best films I've seen this year. ROGUE NATION begins some time after the fourth installment GHOST PROTOCOL and features Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) hunting down an underground criminal empire known as \"The Syndicate.\" Hunt's seemingly reckless actions however incur the wrath of CIA director Hunley (Alec Baldwin) who has the entire IMF (Impossible Missions Force) shut down. Hunt, now considered a \"rogue agent\" must track down the leader of the Syndicate, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) and with the help of Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), and a mysterious agent named Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), prove the Syndicate's existence and take them down once and for all. The standout elements of the film for me by far is the action and Rebecca Ferguson's performance and Ilsa Faust. Rogue Nation features three of the most original action setpieces I've seen in recent years, and that's not including the thrilling opening sequence where Tom Cruise really did hang from the wing of an A400 (no CGI was used, Cruise not only strapped himself to the wing of the aircraft...he did it 8 times to get the perfect take.) The action is filmed very crisply and in an old school way, I didn't notice a lot of excessive cross cutting and quick flash editing, you got to see a lot of the action fluidly, whether they were motorcycle or fight scenes, many of these action scenes were choreographed like ballets, every movement precise. The action wasn't just action for action's sake, the action served the plot well and served to build tension between key events in the plot. I find that today, too many action films just have minutes upon minutes of mindless action that don't serve a purpose, Rogue Nation does not commit this offense I feel. Rebecca Ferguson stands out in a pretty solid cast. Tom Cruise is good as always as Ethan Hunt, who, in following the old school action movie feel writer-director Christopher McQuarrie gave this film, Hunt is shown as an old school action protagonist in that he is human, he gets hurt, you have actual doubts whether he can make it out of these situations alive (even though in the back of your mind you're convinced he's in no danger). More Indiana Jones and less superhero is how a like my action protagonists, to build effective tension in these movies, you have to have no doubt in your mind that your protagonist is mortal and capable of being beaten. Simon Pegg is excellent as Dunn, providing comic relief and a little bit of dramatic weight to the film. But it is Ferguson as Faust, an agent whose loyalities seem to switch on a dime, that stands out. She gives an intense performance and her character isn't just eye candy or someone for Hunt to chase, she's a character with a bit more dramatic depth than is usually found in this sort of character in a spy film, certainly she has greater depth of character than most \"Bond girls.\" She's every bit Cruise's equal, she kicks much much ass, and she's beautiful, mysterious and intriguing to boot. Faust is the most interesting character in the film. If there's a weak link in the cast, it's Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, his character is pretty one note. Also, Ving Rhames and Luther Stickell needed more screen time, but a minor nitpick at most. What gives Rogue Nation an edge over most all other M:I films is the villain. While not memorable, Sean Harris plays an effectively creepy villain whose schemes are sure to make the audience hate him by the end. All of his actions seem to carry weight and that's what you want from a villain, you want to see that his actions can greatly affect the heroes. If I had two nitpicks with the film, it's in the pacing and elements of the story. The action is pacing so perfectly in the first two acts and the tension is palpable and built so well that after the big second act action finale, the movie suffers into a small lull for 10-15 minutes that's full of over exposition and over plotting. Up until then I felt the film did a good job allowing the audience to breathe between action sequences but I think this \"catch your breath\" part of the movie ran for too long. Also, Rogue Nation's story and setup borrow quite a bit from recent spy films, in particular elements of the recent Bonds (SKYFALL in particular) and CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER that it makes parts of the film seem a tad too familiar. Other than those, ROGUE NATION is a great action film that doesn't get too dark, but is effectively intense and gives you everything you could want from an old school action film but with modern new school settings and sensibilities. You need have to seen the other M:I films or the classic TV series to enjoy ROGUE NATION although there are plenty of winks and callbacks to those previous properties for fans to get a smile out of. I give MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION a score of 4.75/5 stars (A).",
