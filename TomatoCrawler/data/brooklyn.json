    "review": "  \"Brooklyn\" showcases the brilliant talent of Saoirse Ronan as her character Ellis immigrates from America to Brooklyn. After finding many Irish people in that town, she feels at home. Coming across the love of her life, the romance complexities of the story ensues. At times this film can be heart-wrenching, because you know people go through the same emotions as her in real life. This heartbreaking, yet beautiful story is not one to miss. This film is very low on the radar and is only picking up traction for awards season, but the film is so much more than that. Yes, it takes a lot for a period piece to impress me, but this one sure pulled it off. Although my one issue with the film heavily defines itself in it's third act, turning me off a bit (which I won't spoil), this film is still definitely one of the best films I have seen in 2015. The performances and direction are magnificent!",

    "review": "  If you're looking for an Oscar movie this award season that will be perfect for grandparents, I direct you to the perfectly pleasurable Brooklyn. Beyond the throwback to the 1950 setting, it's a movie that can appeal to multiple generations of audiences. There's an admirable classical sense of filmmaking with Brooklyn, a delightful and charming movie with a healthy dose of nostalgia and heartfelt sincerity that should find a wide range of appeal to all ages. Eilis (Saoirse Ronan) is an Irish immigrant who leaves her sister and mother to start a new life in Brooklyn. Thanks to a kindly Irish priest (Jim Broadbent) who had settled from her village, Eilis finds housing and a job. New York takes some getting used to, especially the density. Eilis is attending night classes to become a bookkeeper, but by day she works at a department store counter. It's at one of the socials in her new Irish neighborhood where she meets Tony (Emory Cohen), a smitten yet confident Italian boy. She agrees to go on a date, actually two upfront, and it's no time before Tony is walking her home from her night classes and talking about all his dreams. Eilis must return to Ireland for a family emergency. While she's there, a bookkeeping job opens that needs her help, and a nice boy named Jim Farrell (Domhall Gleeson) grows closer to her with affections that aren't exactly unwarranted. Eilis must decide which place to call her home and which life she wants to seek. While the story is set in the early 1950s, this movie could have been made in any decade of the film industry. It would not be out of place with the films of the 40s and 50s, hopeful and romantic odes about women finding new lives in the land of opportunity. There's a classical sense to its storytelling that is rather universal about the struggles of self and independence. While this movie is awash in the period details of 50s New York City, it really could be told anywhere. The personal struggles of Eilis are completely relatable, which makes her an instantly engaging heroine. She's a kind-hearted woman who's trying to step out and discover who she wants to be, and this promising reality is a pleasure to watch. We're watching the maturation of a person, watching her find her footing and gain confidence small victory after small victory. There aren't any large or arch plot events to navigate. It's the small moments in life, from starting a job, to becoming more sure of one's self, to knowing whom to open up and trust. The movie is kept at a pleasantly low simmer of intensity, which works just fine. The gentle tone does not imply a lack of urgency but more so the beguiling and romantic spell. Thanks to writer Nick Hornby, who is becoming an ace screenwriter, the movie tells such a heartfelt and emotionally rich and resonate story in 100 carefully paced minutes. There's a general joyous sensation that washes over you, elongating smiles naturally. The dialogue is often clever without being glib and the characters come across as realistic and humane. There's only one character that is thinly drawn to approach being stock (well two counting the precocious \"tells it like it is\" kid). The others are hopeful, yearning, and fundamentally decent people. There's something quite nourishing about watching decent people try and navigate their desires while maintaining their decency.I think that's what makes the love triangle work as well as it can, the fact that both options, not just the gentlemen at the center, are appealing. New York and Ireland both present options that afford Eilis opportunities in a career she wishes to pursue, both have compassionate men who have expressed an interest in her and are supportive of her education and goals, and both locations have a support system of friends. It may sound boring that Eilis can't really go wrong with where and whom she chooses but I think that makes the ultimate decision that much more engaging. If these options weren't so appealing then it wouldn't be so interesting to watch. The mistake is that because the choices are good that there is less at stake when the opposite is true. She could rightfully be happy with either choice but which representation of Eilis will she decide? One life represents the old, the other he new. As I stated above, the characters in Brooklyn have an commendable decency to them, which makes the love triangle more difficult. Tony loves her completely but fears she may not come back, and yet he knows he has to let her go and she has to decide on her own where to call home. Jim is thoughtful and even though he obviously has feelings for her Jim knows that now is not the right time to ask, and so he too waits and hops he presents enough worth staying over. It's a love triangle where you like all three participants, which happens so rarely in movies. Another strength of the film is that Ronan (The Grand Budapest Hotel) delivers a wonderfully felt performance. Much is placed upon her shoulders as our entry point into this world, and Hornby doesn't resort to his characters explaining everything they're thinking and feeling. Eilis is a woman who doesn't speak in paragraphs but in short succinct sentences. She's guarded but observant, and Ronan's face is our great tapestry for understanding Eilis and her changing demeanor. We can watch her process the intimidating and invigorating world and read her thinking. It's the most realistic Ronan has come across on screen as she has a habit of coming across slightly robotic, whether it's as a pint-sized killer (Hanna), slain teenager (The Lovely Bones), or whatever the hell they were going for with the atrocious Violet & Daisy. With Ronan's care, Eilis comes across like a resourceful young woman who is growing her sense of self. She's a deserving lead for our simply story told with excellent care.The only problem with a simple story told well is that it can also be predictable, which is a minor fault that doesn't negate the impact of Brooklyn's conclusion but does make it easy to anticipate. I'll dance around spoilers but in a way I feel like even discussing the topic is going to be sufficient for you, dear reader, to accurately infer what direction the movie takes and which choice Eilis makes in the end. In short, Eilis makes a decision before leaving back to Ireland that somewhat stacks the deck in the favor of one of the two locations. This kept me from feeling like the choices were evenly considered. In the end, it's a decision for Eilis about embracing her home and native culture and sense of community or branching out on her own and building something new and exciting. It's possibility and independence versus comfort and family. It's what can be versus what she's known. It's a decision that is universally relatable. Few of us have had romantic suitors and prosperous situations to vie over but many people have to make the normal decision of what path to embark, whether it's the risk of something different or the reassurance of what is familiar and what has been earned. These aren't the life-and-death stakes we see typically in the movies but they're the decisions that often dictate fates. Brooklyn is an easy movie to be carried away with. It's full of honest and earned emotions that resonate from its reletability, tender heart, and gentle observations of watching a woman navigate the choices of her life. It's an immigrant story and a coming-of-age tale, a romantic triangle with some fish-out-of-water elements. It's a lot more than the sum of its parts, but with actors this good and with a script this tailored to deliver emotional uplift and satisfaction, those are some mighty impressive parts. If you're on the hunt for a feel-good movie that won't make you roll your eyes or overdose on sap, then I advise you and your family take a trip to Brooklyn and enjoy the sights. Nate's Grade: A-",

    "review": "  LUCKY CHARMED - My Review of BROOKLYN (4 1/2 Stars)I'm not familiar with director John Crowley's previous work, but if the stellar, emotionally overpowering BROOKLYN is any indication, then he's definitely worth investigating. It doesn't hurt that Nick Hornby wrote the screenplay based on a book by Colm T�ib�n, as Hornby is no stranger to connecting with audiences via ABOUT A BOY, AN EDUCATION, and WILD. It's also a huge bonus to have, without a doubt, one of the best young actresses of her (or any) generation in Saoirse Ronan (ATONEMENT, THE LOVELY BONES), who at 21 years old can not only carry a movie, but sweep you away with such quiet skill and subtlety. If anyone working today reminds me of a young Meryl Streep in looks and talent, it's her. Mix all of that together to present an equal parts immigration and love story, and you get BROOKLYN, a simple, no-nonsense, old school tale that had me not just weeping, but straight up bawling for most of its running time. It may not be the best movie of the year, but it's hands down one of the best romances I've ever seen. Ronan plays Eilis, a young woman in a small Irish town who lives with her mother and sister. Wanting a better life than that of a whipping girl to the town Ogre's shop owner, Miss Kelly (a memorable Brid Brennan), Eilis gets a sponsored trip to America to start anew. Leaving her family behind presents the aching dramatic tension of this story, as well as her arduous trip across the ocean. On board, her bunkmate, a veteran of such crossings, teaches her how to properly assimilate into 1952 America.Upon arrival, her sponsor, Father Flood (Jim Broadbent) finds her an upscale department store job and a boarding house run by Mrs. Kehoe (Julie Walters, who has a table pounding great time with her many quotable lines). MAD MEN's Jessica Par�, in the snooty Parker Posey role as Eilis' new boss, manages to bring empathy to a somewhat bitchy role. Short on true Brooklyn atmosphere, the film, however, gets the emotions just right of a stranger in a strange land. Crowley knows how to use silence, glances, and breathing room in scenes to bring real feelings to the surface. Ellis is a strong yet observant character who can only contain her emotions for so long before they erupt, and I erupted right along with her. Cinematographer Yves B�langer, who kept his camera much more alive in WILD and DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, tends towards visceral, sweeping grandeur here, and appropriately so. Whether it's the musty views of a dark Irish street at night or the technicolor splendor of a crowded Coney Island beach, this is dreamy perfection. Also of note is the spot-on costume design by Odile Dicks-Mireaux and the just-right production design by Fran�ois S�guin. The pneumatic tubes in the department store are just one great detail we get to savor.More joy comes in the form of Tony (a star making performance from Emory Cohen), an Italian plumber who meets Eilis when he crashes an Irish mixer. Their love story is what makes this movie soar beyond all expectations. I can't recall the last time I witnessed a film where the puppy love and unbridled adoration just oozes off the screen. Cohen's sparkling eyes tell the whole story of what falling in love looks like. To say this pair has chemistry is an understatement in all its whooshy, gooey, innocent splendor. These two characters simply love being together, and the considerate, present, gentle tone of Cohen's performance redefines \"winning\". When is the last time you saw a film where the male protagonist rushes to wait outside a girl's school just so he can escort her home? Or when his declaration of love is done with such delicacy? I don't know if I cried because I was alone and dateless when I saw this film, or if I knew I was witnessing something so rare and pure, but the courtship scenes hit me in the gut.Of course complications get in the way of the relationship when unexpected events dictate Eilis' temporary (possibly permanent) return to Ireland. Here, we're treated to one heartbreaking scene after another, a pile-on many may find insufferable, but I found to be truthful. Virtually unable to escape her tribe whether in Ireland or her U.S. boarding house, Eilis finds herself at a crossroads. More than a love story, BROOKLYN is about figuring out your identity in life. Through Ronan's perfectly calibrated performance, we see Eilis change bit by bit. Introducing her Irish friends to her new culture, she meets another kind, young man, Jim (Domhnall Gleeson) who may impact the tough decisions that lie ahead. Ronan, Cohen, and Gleeson know what movie they're making, all of whom are unafraid of the gentle vulnerability in the script and direction. A special mention must be made for James DiGiacomo, who plays Tony's little brother Frankie. Stealing every moment with hilarious Italian hand gestures and direct, succinct comic timing, DiGiacomo feels like the kind of performer who will grow up to snag Don Rickles' career. Late in the film, there's a beautiful bookend to an earlier sequence that speaks to the generous loving heart of this movie. By paying kindness forward, by passing along knowledge and experience, BROOKLYN reveals a true American spirit. It's one we don't see very often anymore, particularly during a time where we don't always welcome newcomers with open arms. We may never again see an era as guileless as the kind depicted in this strong, lovely film, so go as a reminder of what true decency looks like. Go for Ronan's Oscar-worthy performance. That almost final shot of her standing, waiting, and posed with an iconic confidence gives you a visual, final gut bunch, guaranteed to melt even the coldest of hearts.",

    "review": "  Dancing you between moments of heart-tugging and heart-wrenching beauty, this brilliantly shot and acted New York story perfectly epitomizes the agony and ecstasy of love. Period pieces often miss the mark so far as authenticity, betraying a chink in the armor of an otherwise spotlessly told tale. It spoils your connection to the materials, no matter how well written or performed. No moment of Brooklyn feels forced, put-on, or broad. Everything - from the brilliant reconstruction of early '50s life in the city borough to the impeccable performance at its center - feels like a beautiful moment taken directly from your past life-something felt, seen, heard, smelled, and tasted.In this PG-13-rated drama, an Irish immigrant (Ronan) must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within after she lands in 1950s Brooklyn and quickly falls into a new romance, only for her past to catch up with her. Thanks to director John Crowley, the moments and characters feel utterly tangible. Saoirse Ronan proves a revelation here. On many radars since her unforgettable turn in Atonement, she grounds this satisfying immigrant song at every beat. Bottom line: New York State of Grace",

He captures the trepidation and excitement of Ellis Lacey's life-changing move to Brooklyn, New York from small town Ireland perfectly; his impressive script given all the gravitas required with an enchanting performance from Saoirse Ronan. It's a delicate, wise-beyond-her-years portrayal of a caring, considerate young woman who is torn between her new life and her old one. Ronan is nothing short of a revelation here in a weighty leading role that fully embraces her incredible acting abilities.The story may feel twee at times, but Hornby's script details incredible restraint. Ronan too reins in the need to wallow in melodrama with her nuanced performance. Director John Crowley's attention to detail in authenticity of the period is incredible; giving this small story the right injection of scale to give it weight without overburdening the story.The film rarely falters with its impeccable combination of production design, great storytelling and amazing performances. But more than anything, Brooklyn is a great reminder that old-fashioned storytelling is a dying art, and when it's this good it needs to be embraced.",

There is not a false note through the entire movie -- the girls and the boarding house mistress are not the evil stepsisters another movie would have made them, but a funny and protective group guiding the girl as she adjusts to life in the New World. That you are so invested in the young girl getting over homesickness, falling in love, and having to decide between Ireland and New York is a testament to Saoirse Ronan's performance. She is simply excellent in this role. The chemistry between her and the Italian American boy she meets in New York could not have been better. I also enjoyed the film's score and costume design -- the pastel colors of the dresses Ms. Ronan's characher wears throughout the film are appeasing to the eye. \"Brooklyn\" is funny, sweet, sad, and most importantly real.",

    "review": "  Its been a while I checked out a romantic film, & probably I would not have seen this one too provided it had not received all the Oscar buzz, despite the fact the film stars one of the most likable leading actresses of the younger generation. And boy was I glad I decided to watch this one. Trust me, this film is a remedy for anyone who is losing faith in good film making. It is a splendid reminder that you can tell a great story without resorting to excessive twists and effects. It's a simple tale, made complex by conflicting emotions and a welter of detail. It's funny and sad and bursting with life. Crafted with care, told with elegance & resonating a deep sense of warmth throughout its run time, this film is the story of an immigrant that beautifully illustrates the struggles faced when trying to adjust in a new environment with people you don't know & places you aren't familiar with, and not only does it work as a wonderful coming-of-age drama but also succeeds as a pleasant love story. The film also talks about being homesick. We have all felt it (I know I have), and continue to experience it when we venture off for a while. Not many of us have sailed across the ocean to a new country (obviously), torn apart from family and friends to begin a new life. Sometimes, a new romance can cure homesickness. They allow one to feel secure, like they made the right decision and loved, just like home. This film also walks us through that daring experience. Based on the novel of the same name, the film takes place during the early 1950s and follows Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan), a young Irish Catholic girl who has left Ireland to seek a better life in America. Leaving her elderly mother (Jane Brennan) and adored sister Rose (Fiona Glascott) in the small Irish town of Enniscorthy in Ireland, Ellis arrives in New York bewildered but hopeful after a journey marred by sea sickness. It is only after she begins a job as a salesperson in a ritzy department store in Brooklyn where her leering supervisor Miss Fortini (Jessica Par�) trains her to deal with their upscale customers that homesickness begins to set in and she longs for her mother and sister. The job, a room in a boarding house with other Irish immigrants, and night classes in accounting at Brooklyn College are all provided by Father Flood (Jim Broadbent), a reminder of the contribution that caring priests with integrity can provide, one that most immigrants do not have. At an Irish dance, she meets Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen), a young somewhat stereotypical Italian man who goes to these dances because he is attracted to Irish girls. Their relationship grows when Tony invites Ellis to his home to meet his family, a scene stolen by Tony's brash and funny eight-year-old brother Frankie (James DiGiacomo) who lets everyone know right away that \"the Italians hate the Irish.\" Their relationship is put on temporary hold, however, when unforeseen circumstances force Ellis to return to Ireland. Happy to see her mother again and to be back in familiar surroundings, she is also reminded of the small-town mindset as personified by the gossipy mean-spirited Miss Kelly (Brid Brennan), Eilis's one-time employer. Her stay extended to attend a friend's wedding, Ellis is offered work at an accounting office and is courted by an old friend Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson), a circumstance that confronts her with choices that will affect the rest of her life. The details of Eilis' story are fictional and may not match those of a majority of immigrants to the U.S., but her basic struggles and her heart match most of those immigrants. And they represent us. Writer Nick Hornby and director John Crowley also show a considerable amount of restrain in terms of evoking comedic circumstances in the film. Consider the scene when Eilis sits down to meet Tony's full-blooded Italian family over a spaghetti dinner, a scene ripe for stale comedic possibilities about the passive-aggressiveness Italians had towards Irish people and vice-versa. Instead, writer Nick Hornby conducts the scene in a manner that's thoroughly pleasant and even wryly comedic at times, thanks to great timing and strong respect for logic and narrative seriousness. This is a relate-able and utterly charming film which should not be missed. It's a simple tale that's wonderfully told with the help of great costumes, beautiful cinematography and story-telling that's old-fashioned, but doesn't feel outdated within the early 1950s setting. Eilis' particular set of circumstances are well-researched and not uncommon for this particular time and place. While the film has its fair share of emotionally manipulative sequences, mainly because the film's score is frequently overbearing and excessive, its nuances and insights into young love and how one person can almost entirely make one's fears and uncertainties about an area and their situation simply evaporate are considerably powerful. The scenes between Eilis and Tony are undeniably romantic and not overblown or incredulously depicted, as they are in your run-of-the-mill Nicholas Sparks novel. The two exude a very natural chemistry that is buoyed by their innocence and their clearly authentic smiles and affection for one another; to put it simply, if you're single and seeing this film alone, as I did, you'll be wishing you are walking out with someone special by your side at the end of it. Often movies have a magical quality as you're viewing them. Some will demand your undivided attention, others will hypnotize your senses, leaving them to simply wash over you with their exuberance and classic film making procedures. In the case of director John Crowley's film, the latter is certainly the case. There comes a moment in the film when you are taken in by the film's classic style film making, and tenderly thought-provoking performances from its cast. Director Crowley, in partnership with Oscar-nominated scribe Nick Hornby, create a beautiful and sensitive love story that is everything a Nicholas Sparks film adaptation wishes it could be. The main contributor to the film is the lead actress, Saoirse Ronan, who plays her role meticulously while also constantly owning the tone of the film. Her delicate and sincere portrayal makes all Eilis's issues, however selfish or insignificant they may seem at first, materialize in your mind, and makes you hope that her pain will somehow ease. Already a one-time Oscar nominee, Ronan reaffirms her acting strength with this exceptional performance. Of all emerging young adult lead actresses, she is likely the most charismatic one in 5 years since Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone. Emory Cohen shows his sensitive and charming side of his range, resulting in an equally measured and tantalizing performance to his co-star. Domhnall Gleeson's career has blown up, and rightfully so. He shows his brilliant talent, even in a small role. You can see the ache and pain in his movements, desperate for love and an overwhelming feeling of being lost. In a few scenes, Julie Walters as Mrs. Kehoe sustains as a surprisingly comic relief in a very serious drama. Her passive demeanor is such a treat to watch in her scenes of interaction with the girls of the boarding house in which Ellis is staying. Jim Broadbent is likable in a small role. On the whole, 'Brooklyn' is is a damn fine movie! Filled with universal themes, the film doubles well as heartfelt love story & a compelling coming of age drama. It's a joyful and heart aching film that stands as one of last year's best, and a sure-fire contender for several Academy Awards.",

First I thought he had the freshness and welcoming, transparent charm of Paul Newman, then he had the physical smoldering of Marlon Brando, finally he had that edgy self-will of Sinatra. But those comparisons do him no justice. He may have all those characteristics, but he ain't any of those actors. He is who he is, open and charming, smoldering, a bit driven. He could be one of our greatest actors if his roles and lifestyle cooperate. We should be watching this guy.",

    "review": "  With a setting as authentic as the performances themselves, Brooklyn is a genuinely touching and honest movie. Rather than simply recycling the typical romance clich�s that have long-saturated the genre and led it to becoming something of a punchline, it instead sets out to tell a very real story with very real emotions. Much like The Spectacular Now it isn't afraid to show a love story beginning and developing through its characters most basic of interactions, not through contrived occurrences or profundities. Saoirse Ronan is truly fantastic in the lead role, and her emotional development and maturity is the movie's centrepiece. From shy small-town girl to big-city woman, the character is moulded by her environment and the people in it. When she switches between her new home and her old it is easy to see how differently she acts in each of them, before and after her life-altering relocation. The film's use of lighting and colour help to set the mood, and while the score can be overbearing at times, it really helps to push the emotional moments. The pacing, which is admittedly a little to pedestrian, may weigh the movie down in places, but with likeable, relatable characters, beautiful historic detail, a witty, down to earth script and truly marvellous performances, Brooklyn more than succeeds as a human drama, emphasis on the word human.",

It has some parts that are overly dramatic and some that drag on at parts, but overall it is a great movie for anyone over the age of 18. The acting is brilliant and the film work is even more amaing. The characters in the film are perfectly dramatic but with some humor, but not too much to over play the story. I think the story is written in a way that tells a beautiful tale while not being too much. I think Saoirse Ronan does a brilliant job in this film and should win at least one award for such an amazing job at acting the part.",

What makes this film memorable are the great performances and the surprising humour. This film could have easily been pretentious and kinda boring to watch. For a brief moment, it dives into that territory but it quickly jumps back into entertainment grounds. Overall, this film is a wonderful choice for people looking for a date night movie in the theatres.

    "review": "  A really good movie. Brooklyn is a film about a young Irish girl named Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) who leaves her older sister and mother behind in Ireland to move to Brooklyn, NY. In Ireland Eilis has no opportunities, so she moves out to the USA to get a job and study for book keeping. America isn't quite what Eilis expected. She's home sick and has no real life outside of the boarding house she lives in. It all changes one night when she attends a dance and meets a young Italian guy named Tony (Emory Cohen) who she eventually falls in love with. Eilis visits Ireland after a tragedy strikes and has to decide what she really wants. The comfort of a familiar home and people or a life with Tony and new opportunities. Saoirse Ronan is extremely likeable and that helps out a lot here because throughout the film I was rooting for her character. She has to make some tough choices throughout the film and you really see her character develop from the beginning of the film. There are some great sweet moments in this film and I recommend giving it a look if you have a chance!",

    "review": "  Quaint and formal like your best shoes for Church - Brooklyn is a nicely formed and well rounded coming of age film. This well paced and pleasant best picture nominee is a great showcase of Saoirse Ronan's talent who is marvellous in her central performance and who fully deserves her academy nomination. However, Brooklyn never fears to give its supporting characters the limelight in particular Julie Walters who as always steals every scene she is in. I enjoyed the parallels and symmetry in the storytelling as the narrative progressed, however, for me Brooklyn doesn't do anything considerably daring or eye catching that'd warrant a second viewing. To me the film feels very polite and nice in ways that goes to mimic our lead character - and that's not as to say the film is boring - but the film did lack a sense of real conflict. Having said that, Ronan's character IS a divided soul showcasing deep and resounding inner conflict; I would have just liked a little more conflict within her external world. Perfectly enjoyable fare if a bit forgettable.",

    "review": "  First and foremost, Ronan is very solid in her Oscar-nominated lead performance. However, the film as a whole felt underwhelming for me. It starts with the promising premise of this girl struggling to accept love, and dealing with the hardships of being homesick and the overall struggle for immigrants in the '50's. However, heading into the second and third acts, the film falls into a very routine, \"I love him but I'm almost tempted by another lover\" plot device and without anything new to add to that kind of story. The film also begins with a wonderful light and quirky tone, only again to be sucked into the cliches of this romance plot, but without giving you any stakes into caring if it'll all work out. Overall Brooklyn isn't a bad, but not an overwhelmingly special movie.",

I was glued to the screen and smiling with enjoyment the entire time. Saoirse Ronan is nominated for an academy award. She deserves to win. You won't see this in theaters.

That said, Brooklyn surpasses Carol in almost every respect. It's charming, funny, beautifully shot and never gets bogged down in its own perceived self-importance. It's not a runaway success as Eilis' character development occurs suddenly and as the result of getting her hand caught in the cookie jar so to speak. For the most part though, it tells a small, relateable coming-of-age story about finding one's place in the world well. 7.7/10",

I'm not sure it is Best Picture nomination good for sure, but it is better then most romantic flicks. I do have a soft spot for movies set in Ireland (as I've actually been there). Saoirse Ronan is very good but again I'm not sure she is Best Actress nomination worthy as she seems pretty down and sad most of the time. Maybe she is nominated because she has four out of five vowels in her first name? What I think this movie is best at showing is the chance that immigrants took to come to America for a new life and opportunity. Also it shows the challenges for them and in particular for women, as it is based in the 1950's. Guys if you want to please your significant others and go see a chick flick, this is about as good of one as you will find.",

It presents a picture of such different problems than one's I'll ever have, but it resonates so strongly even with me, I can't imagine how strongly it would resonate with a pretty girl who ever had to choose between two really amazing gentlemen to spend their life with, or anyone who ever knew someone could be the love of their life, but that person was unavailable, or they had an obligation to live a different life instead. It also prompts one to better understand the types of more general troubles that people in the modern first world are simply unlikely to ever face. This movie was really just amazing, and also so frustrating and stressful and rich and sad.

If viewed entirely as being about a romance or a love triangle, the two males are weirdly perfect creatures who, while charming, don't feel like real people. That it works at all is a testament to how fantastic Saoirse Ronan is at playing a competent, but flawed and most importantly growing, character, and at how damn charming Emory Cohen really is. But what elevates Brooklyn to something approaching greatness is how well it builds it world of boarding houses and department stores in New York, and grocers and stone homes in Ireland. The love triangle is less important on its own than as a stand-in for the classic decision young people have to make about staying home and growing old with the known or striking out to make your own world, and having such a lived-in and tactile world on the screen brings that point home. It also helps that it avoids stoicism, with fantastically entertaining supporting characters (particularly Julie Walter's boarding house matron). Fans of romance films will clearly eat this up, and while it plays into the trappings of the genre, it does so earnestly and with style, which maybe is even better than subversion.",

A wishy-washy romance that would make men grumble and the ladies swoon and cry. To be honest, it is that sort of film. Yet Brooklyn achieves something within the layers underneath all of that; a muted sense of longing that after a while stirs something in the viewer.This sneak attack on the senses is lead by Saoirse Ronan's subtle and captivating turn as the young Irish immigrant torn between two places she deems home. It's a tender and deftly vulnerable performance that beguiles from the very beginning. If the film as a whole has to take it's time to really grab you, Saoirse Ronan's performance doesn't hang about!She's helped immensely by the beautiful sets and costumes of 1950's America, enhancing that true sense of romance that the film inspires. It's a world you'll want to step into. Julie Walters is fantastic in her supporting role, as is the ever excellent Domhnall Gleeson, and the cast come together to execute a thoroughly satisfying journey that will have you laughing as much as wistfully daydreaming.

    "review": "  'Brooklyn' Review: Touching, Heart-Warming Romance with an Impeccable Saoirse Ronan PerformanceHomesick. We have all felt it, and continue to experience it when we venture off for a while. Not many of us have sailed across the ocean to a new country, torn apart from family and friends to begin a new life. Sometimes, a new romance can cure homesickness. They allow one to feel secure, like they made the right decision and loved, just like home. \"Brooklyn\" walks us through that daring experience.The film is set in the 1950s through the eyes of a young Irish immigrant, Ellis (Saoirse Ronan), who decided to move to New York City for a better life and more opportunities, with the inspiration from her sister. Ellis is an aspiring accountant, just like her sister.Ellis moves to Brooklyn from the advice of a fellow Irish woman, because that's where most of the Irish immigrants move - so it would feel more like home. After being seasick, Ellis settles in her new boarding house with other Irish women and begins her new job. She shows signs of sadness and can't keep her composure at work from being homesick.A young Italian man, Tony (Emory Cohen), approaches her at a dance and asks her for a future date. Ellis finds comfort within Tony. He makes her happy again and fills the void from the absence of her family and friends back in Ireland. News at home sends Ellis back to Ireland for a while, but she promises to return to Brooklyn to be with Tony. Jim (Domhnall Gleeson) makes his case for Ellis back home. She gets tangled between the love for Tony and her family and must decide.Saoirse Ronan gives a marvelous, caring performance in her role as Ellis. She makes us all feel a little homesick by her expressions and emotion. The way she speaks to Tony is a bit avant-garde compared to the norm we see in other romance movies, which is also a real credit to the writing. Ronan gives the epitome of performances. She cannot be praised enough, and has a real chance of winning the Best Actress Oscar.Domhnall Gleeson's career has blown up, and rightfully so. He shows his brilliant talent, even in a small role, like Jim in this film. Emory Cohen is very authentic in depicting, and looking, the part of a regular 1950s Italian man.\"Brooklyn\" is absolutely one of the best of 2015 and definitely deserving of its Best Picture Oscar nomination. It's a beautiful romance movie. Everyone will be trying their best Irish accent afterwards.",

The character of Tony the Italian Plumber is so on the nose, he plays like a joke. So does his loud-mouthed little brother.Audiences eat this up because ultimately they're starved for films that depict a simple, positive story. That doesn't make this film good though. More a reflection of our deprived culture than anything else.",

    "review": "  Brooklyn is new classic. A beautiful love story, and a warm tribute to all whom have traveled far and wide, to come to Ellis island and chase the American dream. Though thoroughly Irish, Brooklyn represents the birth of immigration in the United States. The beginning of the \"melting pot\" that we all know today. It's also a very compelling coming-of-age story. A young Irish girl, who is unfortunate to stick out in her home country, for being deemed too homely to find a nice Irish man (even though she is absolutely stunning by our standards). She comes to America and finds a nice Italian man to fall in love with, and secretly marry, only to come home to attend the wake of a loved one, and inexplicably gets set up with the strapping Irish man that she wouldn't have gotten with before. The place that rejected her all her life is now trying to reel her back in, but too bad Ireland wasn't there for her the whole time. She finds true love in America. The pacing of this story works. The acting is sublime. Saoirse Ronan's performance is stoic, and flat-out terrific. She's a true actress. Though she's been around for quite a while, I can say with this movie, it's is her breakout role.",

But wait! Nevermind! Ireland sucks! So Boring goes back to Brooklyn to be with the husband she ignored for a month like nothing happened, and he's basically like, \"Omg, I have no questions about any of this.

    "review": "  Brooklyn features few changes to the typical coming-to-America story, but the performances and production are so rich that it is impossible not to get wrapped in the lives of the characters. What could be a serious topic considering the challenges that immigrants faced back in the 1950's is dealt with lightly, mostly focusing on the romance at the heart of the story. Saoirse Ronan easily carries the film, but strong work from the men opposite from her, and a cast of memorable side characters raises the film above your average period piece. This isn't a groundbreaking film, so if you are trying to see all of the award nominees this season, this one shouldn't be at the top of your list, but Brooklyn is an entertaining watch and worth your time if you enjoy a good romance. 4 out of 5 stars.",

I loved the characters who unselfishly made Eilis journey possible. Eilies' sister Rose, who knew she was sick, arranged for Eilis to leave before it would be too hard emotionally to get out. The priest in New York was so kind and helped Eilis every time that she required a boost. Although, Tony ultimately wanted Eilis love, he wanted to provide a new, safe home for her, he had the most pure intentions. Tony did a terrific job in providing a safe haven for Eilis. Even the boy in Ireland, ( Jim) cared deeply about Eilis' grieving process and spoke softly and sweetly to her about deep emotional issues. Eilis boss at the department store cared deeply for her and was very patient in training her to be a New York sales girl. I was routing for Eilis every step of her journey. I wish there would be a sequel called Long Island.",

    "review": "  It's been referenced as a coming of age drama, the story of the young Ellis Lacey (played by the wonderful Saoirse Ronan) finding her way as an Irish immigrant towards a new life in Brooklyn. The film itself, which effortlessly draws the viewer in to its wonderful and charming world, tells a simple story in three stages. The first part is set in Ireland, the second in Brooklyn, and the final act returns us to the shores of Ireland. Each act explores a dynamic of Lacey's inward journey, while each transition visually follows the outward journey. The true beauty of the film is found in how all of this comes together, not least in the complex and endearing performance of Ronan, to echo our common story of transition. It is at once a film about the idea of home and where we find it and how we make it, but it is also about what it is that we leave behind when we begin to remake it on our journey towards independence. It is a story about immigration, but it translates to any circumstance in which we find ourselves facing change and transition in our own lives. A part of the charm of the film is also in its deft use of lighting and direction. We move from the grey melancholy of the Irish landscape that Lacey leaves behind towards the uncertain hopes of the colourful 1950's Brooklyn. But the director deftly avoids the typical romanticized look of New York that we find elsewhere in pop culture reference, and underneath the choice of lighting is a complexity that echo's the human journey that Lacey embodies. While the romance itself is absolutely enchanting (the chemistry between Cohen, who plays the Italian Brooklynite, and Ronan absolutely jumps off the screen), it is far from a fairy tale image. There is pain and heartbreak behind the fun and fluid sequences that pushes us towards a certain bittersweet finish. This symbol is likely no more powerful than the third act, in which we return to an Ireland in which the grey has now fused with a subtle colouring of the sky and oceans. Here we are reminded that life's transitions rarely happen as a case of black and white choices, nor is it about donning rose coloured glasses to forget about the challenges of our past and present. It is about learning to embrace the complicated that comes with change, and learning to define what it is that we leave behind and what it is that we bring with us as we navigate this change as a whole person. The film is more about simply us an individual though, and the idea of home is anchored in how we navigate this life with others. The heart of the middle part of this film is about the growing and developing romance that Lacey finds on the streets of Brooklyn. This is a bit of a premature statement, but I think this film just might be one of the great romantic films of our day. Although the film is emotionally complex, there is a simple and joyous (and perhaps infectious) tone to watching Lacey begin to create (or re-create) the dynamics of home in a foreign land as an independent woman establishing a new community. We are never far from the burdens and the weight that she carries forward from a land, which from her own admission had little to nothing for her when she left it behind, but it is thrilling to watch her shed some of this as she falls forward in to the new found freedom of being able to figure out not just who she is, but where she belongs. Equally so, the scenes that find her taking her increasingly familiar place around the Brooklyn dinner table (a chair in which she becomes more and more comfortable as the film goes on) are wonderfully funny. But this table stands as a transition towards Cohen in which she begins to find an ultimate sense of community and belonging. There is an old fashioned sweetness that permeates the relationship that she finds in Cohen that is less about a day and age gone by, and more about the heart of a romance that is perhaps missing in our modern age. It is refreshing to watch for a story that is set nearly 70 years in the past. Along with this is the poetic nature of a film that is not afraid to carry us through the rawness of the human experience. The masterful part of Ronan's performance is in how she balances the heartbreak and the struggle with a persisting hopefulness and resiliency. So many moments in the film hinge on the simple power of a subtle expression in her eyes and face as she responds to circumstance and discovery. When she leaves Ireland for Brooklyn, her character is ripe with emotional baggage, namely that of living in to her role as the sister, friend and daughter that she is now leaving behind. There is a pain and guilt that she must bear, and wrestling with the responsibility she feels she is neglecting as she moves forward towards a privileged place of new opportunity she otherwise would not have had is sometimes heartbreaking to watch. When she returns to Ireland, she does so with the weight of this responsibility still firmly in hand, and yet it is also with new experiences and a new perspective in tow. Her hometown is no longer the same, but neither is she. This is where we find the poetic undertones coming to the surface. The final scene (not to give anything away) is breathtakingly honest and powerful as a simple nod to the stories poetic nature as a statement about how we navigate transition with this baggage and responsibility forever in tow. It is never easy, but out story and our experience allows us to have something to offer and to give to the world around us, even as much as it continues to shape us (both inward and outward). It is worth noting again, finally, that the film does an amazing job of avoiding any notion of ideals or idealism. The freedom and opportunity that she finds in Brooklyn does not turn in to a commentary about the perils of Ireland that she leaves behind. The scene in her return in which she stands looking out over the empty shoreside of the ocean is poignant in the fact that she recognizes there is something incredibly valuable in what she left behind. The colour that permeates her outlook in the romanticism of Brooklyn is far less romantic when she has to actually live through the struggles of that transition, but there she has grown to embrace it as a part of her new life and new home moving forward. When she returns to Ireland she carries with her the public spectacle (which translates in to a form of jealousy) and the romanticism of the New World image that stands out in her humble and quiet home town, but a part of her journey is coming to grips with the reality that none of it is about the grass being greener on the other side of her hometown struggles. Rather it is about learning to value the things that truly make up a home, no matter where we find ourselves.",

After finding many Irish people in that town, she feels at home. Coming across the love of her life, the romance complexities of the story ensues. At times this film can be heart-wrenching, because you know people go through the same emotions as her in real life. This heartbreaking, yet beautiful story is not one to miss. This film is very low on the radar and is only picking up traction for awards season, but the film is so much more than that. Yes, it takes a lot for a period piece to impress me, but this one sure pulled it off. Although my one issue with the film heavily defines itself in it's third act, turning me off a bit (which I won't spoil), this film is still definitely one of the best films I have seen in 2015.

A movie like this - one so heavily focused around a single character - lives or dies by its lead, and in Saoirse Ronan, BROOKLYN has a fantastic anchor. You'd be hard-pressed to find a young performer who's as consistently excellent as Ronan, and her performance here is absolutely wonderful; she places not a foot wrong, and is deeply in touch with her character's inner emotional life. Nothing she does is \"actor-y\" or inauthentic, and It is one of the finest performances of 2015. Emory Cohen and Domhnall Gleeson match up well against Ronan, each bringing a hugely different presence to the table; Cohen seems to be effortlessly channeling the likes of James Dean or Marlon Brando, although he's much more upbeat and affable than either, while Gleeson quietly conveys incredible warmth. The era is beautifully and convincingly brought to life, and all of the technical and craft categories help to reinforce the detailed period. For much of the running time, this is a simple story, without gigantic stakes or dire conflict, but with compelling human relationships carrying the day. The movie does, however, stumble a bit into the second half, where Ronan's character is forced to behave in ways that are kind of unbelievable and which feel manufactured to add a bit of drama; the result is forced, and comes across as phony. This is unfortunate, as everything up until that point had been thoroughly delightful. Still, it's not enough to sink the movie overall, and in the final analysis, BROOKLYN is entirely enjoyable, and features one absolutely smashing central performance.",

    "review": "  Evoking nostalgic remnants of a past we may have never had, Brooklyn tells of a young Catholic Irish woman emigrating from small town Ireland to the United States in the 1950's. Eilis arrives in Brooklyn under the tutelage of the Catholic church clergy who has secured her a sales position in a retail department store and boarding in a strict Catholic women's boarding house. We travel and experience with Alish the agony and loneliness of being in a foreign land, the longing for home, and the choices that evolve as life sweeps her up in various directions. The film is eloquently and sensitively filmed, calling forth dreams of hope and belonging, and we realize that as in all things, there are choices that carve our futures. The cinematography effortlessly conveys the mood of the era and invokes a sense of journey and wondering if we have in fact found home. Coney Island never looked better.",

    "review": "  Brooklyn is a character driven film that portrays a young Irish girl's journey toward independence and womanhood. It is rare and precious. It is visually sparkling and crafted with great art. In the 1950's, America was still the land of opportunity and inspiration. Rarely do we have the opportunity to observe the experiences of a woman's story in seeking out her destiny here. Even less frequently do we experience such a well nuanced film full of subtlety and tenderness that both portrays a common woman's delicious weaknesses, her blissful strengths, and her attempts to imagine and articulate her dreams. What does Eilis want? Does she-- should she want what her family wants for her? In her willingness to fulfill her sister's dream of traveling to America for a better life, she comes under the influence of other women who have begun to take the reigns of power over their lives into their own hands rather than placing them into the hands of men. The film realistically portrays Eilis's reaching out through her love for two men, two countries, and two ways of life. Taking power is about making choices. Travel puts one in a position to make choices all the time. Eilis's first choice on her own on her journey is to eat a good dinner her first night on board the ship from Ireland to New York. It is a disaster because rough seas soon bring on seasickness that will set in motion the first physical power struggle of her life, when she cannot access the shared bathroom in her fifth class cabin because those on the other side of the room have locked her out. It's a fitting metaphor for what the social class system in Ireland has been doing since her birth. Rather than confront her opponents, Eilis chooses to find a bucket that she can use to relieve herself, but rather than be humiliated by having to do so in the corridor, it is her inner strength that shines through in this pragmatic act.Eilis's cabin mate on the ship is an experienced Irish woman who has already been to America and who helps her to prepare for how to succeed there. \"Always look like you have somewhere to go and that you know how to get there,\" she tells her, explaining how to maneuver through immigration. \"And for God's sake don't cough!\" She is referring to the life or death power of immigration agents to refuse new immigrants entrance if they have a health issue in the days when tuberculosis was the epidemic of the day. But she was also imploring Eilis to take charge, to struggle with her physical urges, to overcome her fears and insecurities and to forge her own future, to choose her own direction, before someone else chooses it for her, forcing her to knuckle under to the will of others all of her life. Eilis considers her roommate's advice. Saoirse Ronan's Eilis is patient and reflective and her broad, porcelain-skinned brow and reflecting-pool beautiful blue eyes drink in the world and its events slowly and deeply. She learns to overcome the loneliness of the single working woman by socializing with others like herself whether they are kind and wise or not. She listens to her supervisor, her boarding house mates, even her landlady, and they teach her how to wear makeup, clothes, and even how to eat spaghetti without splashing her potential mother-in-law with marinara. She vacillates between being able to say she is studying to be an accountant and feeling that the profession is too grand for her-- she just wants to be a bookkeeper and to work in an office.When a well-intentioned, polite, and romantic Italian plumber begins to court her, she slowly allows herself to be admired and continues to improve herself and her life by excelling in classes at the city college. But when she is summoned back to Ireland because of a tragedy, the results of her newfound confidence and success turn into the ultimate test of her ability to stick to the choices and commitments she has made over the sudden temptation of a kinder, gentler and more desirable homeland. Will she choose her new life or her old life?",

Accompanied by an overly religious group of boarding house tenants, a priest, a demanding, yet fashionable, store manager, and other helpful characters, Eilis manages to acclimate to her new life in Brooklyn and even falls for a charming Italian young man named Tony. With beautiful cinematography and succinct dialogue, this period drama is something to see for a taste of the nostalgia that comes from young love and the comfort in home.While Saoirse plays Eilis perfectly well in this film, it might have been Emory Cohen, who looks similar to a young Marlon Brando, that shone the brightest.",

For the first hour I was in love with it, but when she returns to Ireland she totally went out of character, which lost me and just made me decide to get up and leave. I think I may've missed something. I thought she'd married her boyfriend before she went back to Ireland. I know I saw them in the waiting room at the courthouse, and the clerk came out and paged them, but I don't actually remember them getting married. Did I miss something and she actually backed out at the last minute? I know that she seemed to be 'all in' on the relationship, so backing out doesn't make sense. Alas no instant replay at the movies, and I'm not quite willing to buy another ticket to find out. In any event I thought she was already married by the time she went back to Ireland, in which case her behavior there seemed to be totally incongruous with the first hour of the movie. Assuming she was married, the fact that she didn't mention it to friends and family sort of turned the movie into an episode of Three's Company for me; rather mindless and stupid. I was so dazed and confused by the behavior, I decided I needed to get up and stretch my legs, which led to me just going ahead and leaving the theatre.I will give the film all its kudos for great cast and filming. And the first hour was a very interesting exploration of the nicer side of humanity. The old bat that runs the irish store where Eilis is working when the film opens reminded me of my own Irish grandmother who was just as bigoted, opinionated and nasty. That bell rang true.",

The praise for this film has been incredible, and I'm glad it is, because Brooklyn is a damn good film!Saoirse Ronan gives one hell of a great performance. This was hands-down the best performance she's ever given, and I expect that she will get nominated for Best Actress. The amount of sheer emotion she displays floored me. Emory Cohen was incredibly likeable as one of Eilis's love-interests. He is charming and often very funny. The rest of the supporting cast including Domhnall Gleeson were very impressive.The story of Brooklyn, though fairly common and clich�d, was well handled. The whole love-triangle plot has been done hundreds of times, but Brooklyn is a very refreshing take on it! The characters were fantastic and very realistic, which made the story even more enthralling. The cinematography, direction, editing and musical score are all fantastic and polished. The writing is also great, blending dramatic and comedic dialogue very nicely.Overall, Brooklyn is a polished love story with excellent acting, beautiful cinematography and superb direction. See it!RATING: 8.75/10",

    "review": "  Brooklyn is a story about a young irish immigrant girl named Eilis who moves to Broklyn in the 1950's. It is a coming of age story, a love story, and a period piece. We even get a little bit of a love triangle which is groan worthy in most modern movies but is handled with care in this film. There is a real choice here for Eilis and Saoirse Ronan as Eilis is spectacular. She gives one of my favorite performances of the year. It does have some slow moments and if you are not into the drama romance genre then you will probably not like this movie. For me it's definitely one of my favorite drama's of the year. My only gripe is with the ending and with the choice she ultimately makes. It seems a little rushed and mis-handled. Still worth a watch for sure.",

    "review": "  It's 1952. Eilis lives in in a small town in Ireland with her older sister Rose and her widowed mother. Before I go on, let me just say that \"Eilis\" is not pronounced at all like it looks, but rather like it would sound if it were spelled \"Aylish\". In fact, from now on I'm just going to type \"Aylish\" because that's how it was spelled in my head before I saw it in writing. Aylish is played by Saoirse Ronan, which I have no idea how to pronounce. Swire-see maybe?Ha, not even close. According to my friend Google, \"Saoirse\" is pronounced \"Sear-sha\". I'm trying to crack the code here but all I can figure is that the \"sh\" sound appears when you least expect it. Anyway.Aylish is maybe about 18 or so and she's out of school and she doesn't have a boyfriend and the only job she can find is helping out some mean, gossipy lady part-time in her shop. So since there's not a lot going on for her in her home town, Rose arranges to send her to Brooklyn with the help of their parish priest who's friends with another priest in Brooklyn who's set her up with a job and a place to live once she arrives. Coincidentally, the movie playing in the other theater was \"Spotlight\", the one about the priest scandal, but back in 1952, priests were still considered to be good guys who you could count on to help you out in a strange country without worrying about getting molested. It was also a time when ships full of immigrants were welcomed with open arms instead of people having to risk their lives sneaking in.Upon her arrival in Brooklyn, Aylish moves into an all-girls boarding house run by a no-nonsense, unintentionally-funny woman named Mrs. Kehoe. The nightly dinner-table conversations with Mrs. K and the girls are one of the film's highlights. The priest has arranged for Aylish to work behind the counter at a snooty Brooklyn department store where she's exhorted to smile and make polite chit-chat with the customers, but she's too homesick to do so convincingly even though pretty much every other person she meets is also a recent Irish immigrant.All of this changes when she meets Tony (Emory Cohen), an Italian boy around her age who lives with his parents and three brothers and works as a plumber. I was about to write that the father was played by Stanley Tucci and why the hell did they hire such an expensive actor when he only has like one line, and then I looked at the cast list on IMDB and he's actually played by someone who only LOOKS like Stanley Tucci. Which is to say, a bald Italian-looking guy. Could've fooled me. In fact, DID fool me.So just when everything is starting to come together for Aylish with the job and the boyfriend and even night classes to learn bookkeeping, and she's feeling really happy and settled in Brooklyn, she travels back home to Ireland and muddies the emotional waters about where she feels she really belongs in her heart of hearts.I know this sounds a little hokey, but as one who hates even a hint of emotional manipulation, I can attest that it's handled with a minimum of hokiness. That said, for the last third of the movie the theater was filled with the unmistakable sounds of people sniffling up tear-induced snot. Nothing more alienating than happily enjoying a movie and then realizing that all of the people around you are CRYING. It's not like I'm a Vulcan or something. I cried at both \"My Dog Skip\" AND \"E.T.\" and at least a few others, but this movie doesn't have any dying dogs or aliens! Not a one!The only part of this film that felt a bit forced was the character of Tony's 8-year old brother Frankie, a wise-beyond-his-years smart-ass who seems to have gone to the Vito Corleone school of acting. I could have handled a small dose of Frankie, but then he has to go and reappear in a big dramatic scene, courtesy of his kick-ass third-grade writing skills. (\"Please Frankie, ya gotta help me! You're the best writer in the family!\") Even just typing this has me shaking my head in disgust. When the credits started rolling, people clapped, but I knew they were going to, so I had already started cringing in advance. This need people seem to have to express their approval to each other -- to say \"now THIS is a quality film!\" and to have that opinion echoed in the applause of strangers -- is something I've always found unnerving. \"And wasn't that little boy just adorable?\" they seemed to be saying. \"Yes, SO funny! And I just LOVED how he came through for his big brother!\" I realize that this review makes me sound a tad misanthropic, but in the words of Charles Bukowski,\" I don't hate people, I just feel better when they aren't around.\" And there's no place this is truer than at the movies.",

    "review": "  The story of Eilis sailing to American, overcoming her homesickness, finding love, and being called back to Ireland by a tragic death in her family is a good story, one that I felt drawn to as a Greek-American. We found good things in the movie, mainly in the actors and their ability to translate the slight plot into bits of suspense, and to generate interesting questions: will Eilis overcome her homesickness? Why did she agree to leave home in the first place? Does she really love Tony the Italian-American plumber? Why doesn't she tell her mother on returning to Ireland that she has married Tony? Why does she lead on that fellow Jim, who courts her in Ireland? The movie stays with me, and I keep thinking of Eilis and the others.But mixed in are a lot of frustrating bits, and the frustration centers on the characters and their actions being formulaic and sanitized. No doubt there were kindly, knowledgeable Irish priests who miraculously knew what an immigrant girl needed. No doubt there were irascible, stern Irish women who owned boarding houses for girls who had motherly hearts of gold. No doubt there were church dances as chaste and staid as the ones depicted here. No doubt there were Italian American families who ate dinner (the adults with the requisite juice glass of red wine) that were as polite as this one and had as clever a smartaleck younger brother as this one had (as if the actors got their cues from Leave it to Beaver). No doubt there were moments in Brooklyn where the streets were as quiet and suburban looking as those in this Brooklyn. And perhaps on the beach on Coney Island, there were instances where scattered black families sat on the sand mixed in among white families in 1952 (in my memory, beaches were often the scenes of racial conflict). I could go on.To put all these formulaic characters in one film, without exploring the dark hard-edged realities of life, is risking overt sentimentality, and undercuts the story. The film often has the feel of being made for television (with the slow, thoughtful pace of Masterpiece Theater). The people are well scrubbed, coiffed, and clean shaven, even at the end of the day. The dresses and pants and shirts are perfectly wrinkle-free and clean and stylishly placed. Always. Just as in television.I did find some scenes that were endearing and moving. I liked Eilis and Jim Farrell (played by Domnhall Gleeson), the young Irishman who courts her. Eilis comes across as a very practical girl who's trying to figure out what she wants. We found ourselves questioning her actions and motives -- and that's great. Except that what we often questioned was the logic of the story and its depictions. I found myself wondering if Toibin's novel had the same formulaic elements.",

She is heartbroken and homesick at first but quickly finds solace in a new Italian boyfriend and night classes to become an accountant. While I thought the script and acting were solid, I also found the film a bit whimsical and fluffy. There is not nearly enough conflict in the movie and you would expect an Irish immigrant to face more adversity than she faced. I can honestly see why this film is not an Oscar front runner. It was a good film but it just didn't have the backbone and grit I was looking for. It was too forgettable ------------------------------------------- B",

I like his genteel style in such work. The performances here are fine, or better than fine; it looks lovely: the colour palette, the costumes, the scenes and scenery all make for a fine backdrop. Where it fails, and it is a major failing, is that it says nothing of any real worth about the migrant experience. Eilis (Saoirise Ronan) is shipped off to NYC through the assistance of her thoughtful sister and a kindly priest. (In a good performance by Jim Broadbent as Father Flood.) Up until an easily predicted plot development the difficulties faced by our heroine are a bout of seasickness, the need for 30 seconds training in her new job as a shop assistant, and a touch of homesickness. While I'm happy to see women succeed, there would have been far more dirt under the fingernails of all of these women. Apart from the minor matter of losing her virginity, Eilis could indeed be the sainted mother of God. It all suffers from Nick Hornby blandness. Everything he touches turns to bland. My advice: stay away from his cooking and, more importantly, his \"creative\" projects. This is not meant to be an art house atmospheric enigma, nor is it, but it fails to involve solely because of a threadbare plot that avoids detailing the threadbare aspects of lives led by women who were, in reality, the working poor.",

He captures the trepidation and excitement of Ellis Lacey's life-changing move to Brooklyn, New York from small town Ireland perfectly; his impressive script given all the gravitas required with an enchanting performance from Saoirse Ronan. It's a delicate, wise-beyond-her-years portrayal of a caring, considerate young woman who is torn between her new life and her old one. Ronan is nothing short of a revelation here in a weighty leading role that fully embraces her incredible acting abilities.The story may feel twee at times, but Hornby's script details incredible restraint. Ronan too reins in the need to wallow in melodrama with her nuanced performance. Director John Crowley's attention to detail in authenticity of the period is incredible; giving this small story the right injection of scale to give it weight without overburdening the story.The film rarely falters with its impeccable combination of production design, great storytelling and amazing performances. But more than anything, Brooklyn is a great reminder that old-fashioned storytelling is a dying art, and when it's this good it needs to be embraced.",

Her talent shines in a role that requires many facets. Expect to see some well-deserved accolades come awards season.\"Brooklyn\" is a life affirming, coming of age romance.

While it manages to mostly avoid romance cliches, the scenes that should be gut-punching remain fairly unaffecting. It does have its charm, and it is basically impossible to dislike, but it's fairly mundane and ordinary.",

Setting off to America in search of a better life. Overly romanticised? Maybe, but I gladly bought into it.There's little conflict in this, except for when our protagonist is faced with the tough decision of having to choose between her new life and the familiarity of home - but the strong performances make sure that even that slight drama hits all the right notes.Well worth a watch",

This film is terribly predictable, characters and plots were terribly under-developed, and the message is terribly simple and naive (in short, the equally terrible trailer of this film already spoiled the WHOLE film, not a single surprise left). Even the much-praised role by Saoirse Ronan felt terribly short (in comparison with her sublime presence in \"Atonement\" almost ten years ago), nothing surprising, nothing breakthrough from the role. Of course, the film's optimism is much appreciated, especially in the context of a new USA where immigrants are no longer \"liked\" or a new Europe where immigrants are no longer \"welcome\". Thus, I absolutely do not hate this film. Its simplicity only wasted my time (yes, that is simplicity, not cinematic minimalism or any similar euphemism).",

The temptation to please others is very strong for women, and I imagine during this time period that it was even more alluring. But the courage and confidence that grows in this strong female lead is inspiring to watch. This film offers so much more than what is shown on the screen. It is a welcome plunge of depth for viewers that can identify with \"home sickness\", grief, and the wonderful experience of finding pure and true love. At Christmas time - the season I viewed this movie, Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. This movie was to me a metaphor of His love and how easy it is to forget about Him and the reality of his existence when we get too busy being good and doing the right thing. Perfect Christmas movie.",

    "review": "  The details of Eilis' story are fictional and may not match those of a majority of immigrants to the U.S., but her basic struggles and her heart match most of those immigrants. And they represent us. This is a relatable and utterly charming film which should not be missed. It's a simple tale that's wonderfully told with the help of great costumes, beautiful cinematography and story-telling that's old-fashioned, but doesn't feel outdated within the early 1950s setting. Eilis' particular set of circumstances are well-researched and not uncommon for this particular time and place. Nick Hornby's adaptation of Colm T�ib�n's award-winning 2009 novel (set partly in the Irish author's actual hometown) stays very close to the original story. Both the book and screenplay take one ordinary immigrant's tale and infuses it with just the right amount of drama and a surprising amount of emotion. The film's effectiveness also owes much to the layered performance of Ronan who seems to mature right before our eyes. All things considered, going to \"Brooklyn\" is a trip well worth taking. \"A\"!",

After an initial bout of homesickness, she is unexpectedly swept up with opportunities at school and a new love which develops fast, and things seem to be well until an unexpected tragedy happen at home. Very solid performances all around particuarly by Ronan who to my knowledge hasnt had much of a chance to shine really since Hanna, and is really wonderful in the 50's restraint style of acting with the stiff upper lip and also showcasing all the wonderful technicolor costumes. Domhall Gleeson is also reliable as a potential suitor in his other xmas release that is not Star Wars. Another acting contender and craftman contender as well. A fest gem.",

I thought I was going to give it at least four stars, but sadly it only really lands on three stars for me. I loved the book that this movie is based on and I got emotional just by reading the movie's reviews, which made me think that I would be just as attached with the movie as I was with the book. Sadly I don't feel as optimistic towards this movie as everyone else seems to be feeling. I felt that the movie never really began and there were a lot of things that were left out in the beginning that needed to be there to fully comprehend the movie if you haven't already read the book. I have always said that I think Saoirse Ronan is the best actress of her generation and I don't think I'll ever change my mind on that one, this movie will probably result in Saoirse Ronan receiving her second Academy Award nomination, but I was still not as blown away by her performance as I was expecting. For me this movie was a bit too slow, it was difficult to get into it and there was never really anything that glued me to the screen. There were a few scenes that were missing that needed to be there and there were other scenes that were in the movie that didn't feel quite as important. Sometimes it felt like the scenes were jumping from scene to scene and I didn't always feel like it was telling a coherent story. All in all it wasn't a bad movie, it just could have been a lot better, and like most movies starring Saoirse Ronan she really did lift the movie to a higher level than what it would have been otherwise.",

    "review": "  This charming film is admirably scripted, shot and acted. It's also an interesting psychological study and morally more complex than it may seem at first.Initially we see Eilis ('Aylish') Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) overcoming her youthful gaucherie and gaining in confidence. I found that her diffidence and repressed emotion generated quite uncomfortable feelings at times. The effect is heightened by some strikingly searching close-ups, which Saoirse Ronan withstand very well.The story's date, 1952, is established quite subtly by a reference to the film 'The Quiet Man' and a brief shot of a poster for 'Singing in the Rain'. There is also an air of drabness, especially in the Irish scenes which portray an oppressively inward-looking small community. However, Eilis's life in Brooklyn isn't very different socially from Enniscorthy, County Wexford - at least not until she meets Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen), whose family is Italian. The characters' backgrounds are obviously representative of the crucial role of immigration in the USA. The sudden death of Eilis's sister, Rose (Fiona Glascott), might smack of emotional manipulation. It's explained away as due to a long-concealed illness. Yet it serves an underlying dramatic purpose: Eilis is ultimately ready to leave her bereaved mother, Mary (Jane Brennan) all alone and doesn't even offer to bring Tony to meet her. This doesn't reflect well on her, morally speaking.Her mother comes to appear a rather tragic figure. After visiting her, Eilis's return to Brooklyn is convincingly precipitated when the mean-spirited shopkeeper Miss Kelly (Brid Brennan) reveals that she has heard about her wedding to Tony. This forces Eilis to tell her mother. Miss Kelly is rather stereotyped and might be called a 'dea ex machina' (deus ex machina: a device in Greek tragedy for saving a character in a seemingly hopeless situation). In both respects she could seem to be a weakness in the film. However, she has a surprising function, which is neatly conveyed, inadvertently resolving a potential dilemma for Eilis, who has to confess (by implication) in a letter to her Irish suitor Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson) that she can't settle down with him. She was clearly, and disturbingly, tempted to do so.Miss Kelly brings Eilis down to earth as well: it seemed as though all the young woman's Christmases had come at once and she had appeared pretty self-centred. Whether by accident or design, this story has moral ambiguity at its heart.The film doesn't, however, lack humour. I think the scene in which Eilis impresses Tony's Italian family with her dexterity in eating spaghetti is hilarious. She reveals that another young woman at her boarding house has taught her to avoid splashing sauce over the walls - and over other diners.",

The story was told and all the heart wrenching drama of a young woman with 2 homes was complete. It is a telling reminder of the immigrant experience. It also reminds one of the times which held a more stringent sense of propriety. I am always amazed at how different people look in a different context, which leads to my geek out moment, when it occurred to me that one our supporting players is Emily Bett Rickards (Felicity from the WB TV series Arrow).",

    "review": "  While the notion that Brooklyn is a favorite for major awards consideration is absolutely baffling, it's still a very sweet, well-made film with good performances. Saoirse Ronan cries well, Emory Cohen is extremely charming, and its commitment to being unapologetically earnest is admirable and adds to its appeal, but this is a very light piece of entertainment. It's too long, and the ultimate plot contrivance that keeps the two apart is obvious and dull to sit through. It's a cute movie, this is not something that people will look back on as one of the best of 2015 unless they're reading the list of Best Picture nominees.Sidenote: There needs to be a strict moratorium on the last-shot freeze-frame. It seems ridiculous in this day and age.",

    "review": "  Dancing you between moments of heart-tugging and heart-wrenching beauty, this brilliantly shot and acted New York story perfectly epitomizes the agony and ecstasy of love. Period pieces often miss the mark so far as authenticity, betraying a chink in the armor of an otherwise spotlessly told tale. It spoils your connection to the materials, no matter how well written or performed. No moment of Brooklyn feels forced, put-on, or broad. Everything - from the brilliant reconstruction of early '50s life in the city borough to the impeccable performance at its center - feels like a beautiful moment taken directly from your past life-something felt, seen, heard, smelled, and tasted.In this PG-13-rated drama, an Irish immigrant (Ronan) must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within after she lands in 1950s Brooklyn and quickly falls into a new romance, only for her past to catch up with her. Thanks to director John Crowley, the moments and characters feel utterly tangible. Saoirse Ronan proves a revelation here. On many radars since her unforgettable turn in Atonement, she grounds this satisfying immigrant song at every beat. Bottom line: New York State of Grace",

    "review": "  Ronan is an Irish immigrant to 50's Brooklyn, torn between lovers in both countries. We've seen many immigrant stories in the movies before, but usually covering the period between the \"great\" Euro migration of the early 20th century. This is different, because mores and habits in America are changing, while Ireland still feels borderline feudal. She came for job and opportunity, and grew to love both the country and a man. When she returns to the homeland for her ailing sister, she gets caught up in that world again, but this time as a worldly woman who jumps a notch in social standing. It's a conflict that doesn't entirely convince -- without spoilers, it's difficult to explain why. But there is much beauty in this film and in the gentle performances of a largely loving set of characters (the exceptions are played for comedy).",

    "review": "  If you're looking for an Oscar movie this award season that will be perfect for grandparents, I direct you to the perfectly pleasurable Brooklyn. Beyond the throwback to the 1950 setting, it's a movie that can appeal to multiple generations of audiences. There's an admirable classical sense of filmmaking with Brooklyn, a delightful and charming movie with a healthy dose of nostalgia and heartfelt sincerity that should find a wide range of appeal to all ages. Eilis (Saoirse Ronan) is an Irish immigrant who leaves her sister and mother to start a new life in Brooklyn. Thanks to a kindly Irish priest (Jim Broadbent) who had settled from her village, Eilis finds housing and a job. New York takes some getting used to, especially the density. Eilis is attending night classes to become a bookkeeper, but by day she works at a department store counter. It's at one of the socials in her new Irish neighborhood where she meets Tony (Emory Cohen), a smitten yet confident Italian boy. She agrees to go on a date, actually two upfront, and it's no time before Tony is walking her home from her night classes and talking about all his dreams. Eilis must return to Ireland for a family emergency. While she's there, a bookkeeping job opens that needs her help, and a nice boy named Jim Farrell (Domhall Gleeson) grows closer to her with affections that aren't exactly unwarranted. Eilis must decide which place to call her home and which life she wants to seek. While the story is set in the early 1950s, this movie could have been made in any decade of the film industry. It would not be out of place with the films of the 40s and 50s, hopeful and romantic odes about women finding new lives in the land of opportunity. There's a classical sense to its storytelling that is rather universal about the struggles of self and independence. While this movie is awash in the period details of 50s New York City, it really could be told anywhere. The personal struggles of Eilis are completely relatable, which makes her an instantly engaging heroine. She's a kind-hearted woman who's trying to step out and discover who she wants to be, and this promising reality is a pleasure to watch. We're watching the maturation of a person, watching her find her footing and gain confidence small victory after small victory. There aren't any large or arch plot events to navigate. It's the small moments in life, from starting a job, to becoming more sure of one's self, to knowing whom to open up and trust. The movie is kept at a pleasantly low simmer of intensity, which works just fine. The gentle tone does not imply a lack of urgency but more so the beguiling and romantic spell. Thanks to writer Nick Hornby, who is becoming an ace screenwriter, the movie tells such a heartfelt and emotionally rich and resonate story in 100 carefully paced minutes. There's a general joyous sensation that washes over you, elongating smiles naturally. The dialogue is often clever without being glib and the characters come across as realistic and humane. There's only one character that is thinly drawn to approach being stock (well two counting the precocious \"tells it like it is\" kid). The others are hopeful, yearning, and fundamentally decent people. There's something quite nourishing about watching decent people try and navigate their desires while maintaining their decency.I think that's what makes the love triangle work as well as it can, the fact that both options, not just the gentlemen at the center, are appealing. New York and Ireland both present options that afford Eilis opportunities in a career she wishes to pursue, both have compassionate men who have expressed an interest in her and are supportive of her education and goals, and both locations have a support system of friends. It may sound boring that Eilis can't really go wrong with where and whom she chooses but I think that makes the ultimate decision that much more engaging. If these options weren't so appealing then it wouldn't be so interesting to watch. The mistake is that because the choices are good that there is less at stake when the opposite is true. She could rightfully be happy with either choice but which representation of Eilis will she decide? One life represents the old, the other he new. As I stated above, the characters in Brooklyn have an commendable decency to them, which makes the love triangle more difficult. Tony loves her completely but fears she may not come back, and yet he knows he has to let her go and she has to decide on her own where to call home. Jim is thoughtful and even though he obviously has feelings for her Jim knows that now is not the right time to ask, and so he too waits and hops he presents enough worth staying over. It's a love triangle where you like all three participants, which happens so rarely in movies. Another strength of the film is that Ronan (The Grand Budapest Hotel) delivers a wonderfully felt performance. Much is placed upon her shoulders as our entry point into this world, and Hornby doesn't resort to his characters explaining everything they're thinking and feeling. Eilis is a woman who doesn't speak in paragraphs but in short succinct sentences. She's guarded but observant, and Ronan's face is our great tapestry for understanding Eilis and her changing demeanor. We can watch her process the intimidating and invigorating world and read her thinking. It's the most realistic Ronan has come across on screen as she has a habit of coming across slightly robotic, whether it's as a pint-sized killer (Hanna), slain teenager (The Lovely Bones), or whatever the hell they were going for with the atrocious Violet & Daisy. With Ronan's care, Eilis comes across like a resourceful young woman who is growing her sense of self. She's a deserving lead for our simply story told with excellent care.The only problem with a simple story told well is that it can also be predictable, which is a minor fault that doesn't negate the impact of Brooklyn's conclusion but does make it easy to anticipate. I'll dance around spoilers but in a way I feel like even discussing the topic is going to be sufficient for you, dear reader, to accurately infer what direction the movie takes and which choice Eilis makes in the end. In short, Eilis makes a decision before leaving back to Ireland that somewhat stacks the deck in the favor of one of the two locations. This kept me from feeling like the choices were evenly considered. In the end, it's a decision for Eilis about embracing her home and native culture and sense of community or branching out on her own and building something new and exciting. It's possibility and independence versus comfort and family. It's what can be versus what she's known. It's a decision that is universally relatable. Few of us have had romantic suitors and prosperous situations to vie over but many people have to make the normal decision of what path to embark, whether it's the risk of something different or the reassurance of what is familiar and what has been earned. These aren't the life-and-death stakes we see typically in the movies but they're the decisions that often dictate fates. Brooklyn is an easy movie to be carried away with. It's full of honest and earned emotions that resonate from its reletability, tender heart, and gentle observations of watching a woman navigate the choices of her life. It's an immigrant story and a coming-of-age tale, a romantic triangle with some fish-out-of-water elements. It's a lot more than the sum of its parts, but with actors this good and with a script this tailored to deliver emotional uplift and satisfaction, those are some mighty impressive parts. If you're on the hunt for a feel-good movie that won't make you roll your eyes or overdose on sap, then I advise you and your family take a trip to Brooklyn and enjoy the sights. Nate's Grade: A-",

    "review": "  The immigrant experience is practically synonymous with America, but how much do we really know or understand about that experience? When asked, most Americans can quickly identify an ethnicity (or several) to which they can trace their origins. Whether it was your parents, your grandparents (as in my case), or someone further back, someone in your family history had to be \"the first\", the one (or one of several members of one family) who, for any number of reasons, crossed an ocean... or a river or a land mass... and began your family's history in America. These were people who left behind everything they had known and started a new life in a new place full of unknowns. That first American in your family might have even made the trip alone, without a familiar face in sight. That's \"Brooklyn\" (PG-13, 1:51).The film tells an immigration story that includes many of the factors described above, but also differs from what most of us would consider \"a typical immigration story\" in some important ways. This particular Irish immigrant (1) came to the U.S. alone, (2) happens to be female and (3) arrived in the early 50s - not the 1750s or 1850s, but the 1950s. This unusual, but not unheard-of combination of factors makes the story of this one young woman all the more interesting. Second-generation Irish actress Saoirse Ronan plays Eilis (pronounced: AYE-lish) Lacey, who is one sick character. In the first half of the film, Eilis goes from being sick of home, to sea sick, to home sick, to love sick - and then her sister gets sick. Wordplay aside, Eilis has experiences that transform her, even as they transfix the audience.Eilis has a clever mind, a strong spirit and a pretty face, but finds little to keep her in tiny Enniscorthy, Ireland. She lives there with her older sister, Rose (Fiona Glascott), and mother, Mary (Jane Brennan), but with no interest in any of her village's male population, only working a day or two per week for the nasty shopkeeper Miss Kelly (Br�d Brennan) and nothing better on the horizon, Eilis decides to look beyond that horizon. Rose makes arrangements with Father Flood (Jim Broadbent), an Irish-born priest living in Brooklyn, New York, to help Eilis relocate there. She'll have a place to live - in a Brooklyn boarding house with other unmarried young women from Ireland - and a job as a sales girl at a neighborhood department store. \"All\" young Eilis has to do is get on that boat and sail 3,000 miles east. Eilis finds it difficult to leave home - and then finds her new situation even more challenging. After a rough crossing that makes her physically ill, Eilis lands at Ellis Island (see what the writer did there?),has to try making it through immigration screening without being put in quarantine for looking sickly, and then find her way to her new home to start her new life. Eilis is quiet and shy to the point of being socially awkward and even seeming rude, making it tough for her to make friends or even satisfy her supervisor that she can even do an adequate job of serving customers. Eilis is also driven to distraction by how badly she misses her family and her home back in Ireland. Father Flood shows up to offer some comfort - and an opportunity to better herself by attending night school to learn bookkeeping. The tough, but compassionate Mrs. Kehoe (Julie Walters), and some of the other girls' in her boarding house, help Eilis adjust and start to come out of her shell. But what makes the biggest difference for Eilis is the attention of a sweet and charming Italian-American boy named Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen).Just after things get serious between Eilis and Tony, bad news from Ireland compels Eilis to go back home to visit for about a month. Tony is afraid she won't come back to Brooklyn - and he has reason to worry. Eilis' visit to her hometown starts to look like one big conspiracy to get her to stay. Her mother is complaining about her loneliness with Eilis living in America - and has committed Eilis to attend the wedding of her best friend, Nancy (Eileen O'Higgins), scheduled for the week after Eilis was supposed to get back on the ship to America. Nancy tricks Eilis into a blind date with a very eligible local bachelor named Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson). Then, a shipping firm where Rose used to work - before she set sail on the Titanic (kidding, sorry, couldn't resist), begs Eilis to help them fix their books - a favor that turns into a temporary part-time job, with hints of a more permanent position becoming available. Meanwhile, Eilis has received several letters from Tony which she has placed in a drawer... unopened. It seems that Eilis has a major decision to make. What she does next is... a spoiler and I don't do spoilers. The details of Eilis' story are fictional and may not match those of a majority of immigrants to the U.S., but her basic struggles and her heart match most of those immigrants. And they represent us. This is a relatable and utterly charming film which should not be missed. It's a simple tale that's wonderfully told with the help of great costumes, beautiful cinematography and story-telling that's old-fashioned, but doesn't feel outdated within the early 1950s setting. Eilis' particular set of circumstances are well-researched and not uncommon for this particular time and place. Nick Hornby's adaptation of Colm T�ib�n's award-winning 2009 novel (set partly in the Irish author's actual hometown) stays very close to the original story. Both the book and screenplay take one ordinary immigrant's tale and infuses it with just the right amount of drama and a surprising amount of emotion. The film's effectiveness also owes much to the layered performance of Ronan who seems to mature right before our eyes. All things considered, going to \"Brooklyn\" is a trip well worth taking. \"A\"",

    "review": "  This film had so much potential but, ultimately, I found it disappointing. The cast was excellent, the leading lady a great and charming actor, the cinematography gorgeous (if a bit dewy eyed and sentimental). But the plot was this film's downfall. I thought it was great until it became a melodramatic love triangle. A Hollywood film with beautiful young people and a love triangle; who would have thunk it? At that point it became predictable, not in the sense of knowing what choice the heroine would make but rather in the sense that I didn't care. Perhaps it's because we live in narcissistic times that none of the critics seemed to notice, let alone care, that this woman who was portrayed as so lovely, so sweet, so kind behaved in ways that belied that impression. She was not truthful with two men who were falling over themselves for her, leaving one to wonder if she would ever return and not thinking to tell the other she was married and then breaking it off the courageous way, by dropping a letter through the door. (I think the second guy was the lucky one.) She mistreated her mother when she left without even 24 hours notice. She mistreated a house-mate by finding a way to ditch her. Everything was all about her wants, her needs, her love of Ireland, her distaste for the narrow mindedness of small-town life. One might think no one else existed, really. Lesser characters were mere plot devices in a film that was all about just one character. I'm still giving it three stars because of the film's strengths. But it was nowhere near as good as it might have been with a more thoughtful, less cliched, script.",

    "review": "  3 out of 5 stars. Excellent performance by Saoirse Ronan, who has been impressive since 13 years old in \"Atonement.\" A lot of great technical work in cinematography, costume and production design, make it a beautiful film to watch and enjoy.But, there are some problems. The casting is very uneven with some almost amateur acting in smaller roles. The music is heavy handed, underlining and cueing every emotion. The script seems very simple A to B to C with everything overly convenient in the plot. Nick Hornby is an excellent writer, so the adaptation of his novel may have simplified the book to the point of obvious progression. Whoever did the casting may have had political pressure because some of the actors are just bad, even though they look perfect, thanks to accurate hair, makeup & costuming.Ronan is assured a Best Actress nomination for her subtle and interesting work, which keeps you engaged the whole way. As a whole, the film is more entertaining than \"Carol,\" which is set one year later in 1953, but feels hermetically sealed with overly careful tiptoeing around the lesbian romance. \"Brooklyn\" is also carefully made with getting the period details right, but feels much more alive and rousing than the somber \"Carol.\" The lead actor, Emory Cohen, seems to have studied The Bowery Boys and doesn't seem authentic Italian Brooklyn, but his scenes with Ronan make you want the romance to win.From the overwhelming positive reviews (98% on RT), was expecting a better, not such mixed bag.",

    "review": "  A resplendent, exquisite coming-of-age romantic drama, based on a book by Colm Toibin, about a young Irish girl's experiences as an immigrant in early 1950s America. Twenty-one-year-old Irish-American actress Saoirse Ronan (pronounced Seersha) is extraordinarily vivid and emotionally unadorned as Eilis Lacey, an intelligent, temperate young woman from rural Ireland who has arranged to obtain boarding and employment among Irish immigrants in Brooklyn. After a brief bout of homesickness, she attracts a suitor, an Italian plumber (Emory Cohen), before returning to Ireland due to a family death where she is pursued by a local heir (Domhnall Gleeson) and is conflicted by her choices. Ronan effortlessly appears both plain and beautiful with expressive blue-grey eyes and a flawless Irish accent. She draws us in to her character's isolation, confusion, and maturation without affectation. In dramatic terms, there are no major surprises and the conflict is slightly contrived, but it never veers into melodrama, sentimentality or nostalgia. Director John Crowley has made a small-scale drama with the poignancy and humor of Jim Sheridan's \"In America.\" Among the excellent supporting performances: Julie Walters is startlingly funny as the prudish boardinghouse landlady and Jim Broadbent is marvelous as an Irish priest. Nick Hornby did the adaptation. Cinematography by Yves Belanger; production design is by Francois Seguin; music is by Michael Brook.",

It is a simple story of a new girl in the big city experiencing the struggle of finding herself, falling in love for the first time, and feeling homesick through it all... but it is done very well on every level. Extremely moving and relatable for anyone that has left home on their own to pursue their dreams, but is torn on the question as to where their place of belonging truly exists. Saoirse Ronan is one to watch for the Best Actress nomination come awards season. Emory Cohen, as the love interest, gives a star-making performance. The chemistry oozes off of the screen with these two as the film perfectly captures the awkwardness of puppy love turning into much more when least expected. There is a innocent playfulness in Cohen's performances that just made me smile and recognize those small moments of what it takes to fall in love. I don't have one bad thing to say about this film. After a year of so many letdowns, I can say that BROOKLYN currently finds itself at the top of my list. For such a simple story, it has a huge heart!",

It portrays a curiously incongruous 1950 's exodus of Irish lasses to New York via Ellis Island, and a stodgy Ireland where everyone has a social pecking order. She must choose between two apparent goods--she can't have one foot planted in County Wexford, and the other in Brooklyn, New York. Both lands have their good points. She can't realistically have both. There is sentimentality throughout--the music score is 99% violas, cellos and violins and play on our heartstrings among wistful longing, which abounds. The movie is slow paced and the insurmountable challenge comes near the end of he film, like a concert that is sedate and builds in the last movement. Seeing a movie where the scenes unfold slowly rather than thrown at you with a strobe light is a pleasant surprise.",

    "review": "  When I was suggested to see Brooklyn a few weeks ago, my expectations were very low. Not because all the artistic values, but because I felt that this movie wasn't for me, the plot lean towards a female story just for women. I was pleasantly surprise and also wrong about my assumption.Brooklyn tells the story of Ellis (Saoirse Ronan) a young woman living in a small town of Ireland. She lives with her sister, Ellis works in a small shop where the owner Mrs Kelly bully most of her employees. When you discover this character Ellis you noticed a very quiet and humble person, but also naive and innocent. Ellis sister Rose arrange to send Ellis to America where she can find better opportunities. The moment of revelation comes when she is onboard and stumble a female traveler who is just returning back to the USA after visiting her family in Ireland. This woman traveler is experienced which help Ellis thru her difficult journey to America. From how to behave on board, what to wear and how to react when you meet immigration officers in the USAEllis arrive to the US and everything is new and interesting, she start living in a Irish boarding house, she get a job in a department store. All her support come from Father Flood (Jim Broadbent) which quickly realized that Elllis is home sick and heavily depressed. Ellis also express her sadness in letters sent to Rose, Father Flood is informed and make sure to do something about it. Ellis is enrolled in bookkeeping classes where the audience noticed how her life improves and also is able to meet her new love Antonio Fiorello (Emory Cohen) Ellis story continues with ups and downs throughout the movie...John Crowley directs Brooklyn a film that touch most of everyone's heart. For an immigrant like me, I was able to connect with Ellis and understand what is like to be away from home in a new land, finding a way to fit, but also experience the sadness of loosing a love one and have to make my journey home without the option to say a proper goodbye. A phone call is that sudden message and you need the strength to go back and face that reality.Brooklyn also represents a beautiful way of been an immigrant loving someone throughout the seasons, you start a relationship in the winter and develops thru spring and summer, but then becomes dramatic again in the fall and winter. The film is so colorful with the masterful art direction by Fran�ois S�guin, Irene O Brien, Suzanne Cloutier and Robert Parle. The costume design by Odlie Dicks-Mireaux and cinematography by Yves B�langer. The story of Brooklyn is simple and very engaging, but also can be a little bit flat for easy and quick conclusion. Saoirse Ronan is a great and talented actress, Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters are the most noticeable performance besides Ronan. The films grow and shows Saoirse Ronan evolution in a cyclical story where she departs vulnerable and returns home stronger than ever.",

    "review": "  I guess from looking at all the reviews (critics and audience members alike) it doesn't take much to entertain most people. This is understandable as the crop of movies this year has basically been duds and because of that people are hungry for better-than-average entertainment which Brooklyn does provide. Though very good, Brooklyn could have been great if not for the major plot holes. Didn't anyone notice, or if so, just don't care? For instance, why did Eilis' older sister die at such a young age with no signs of sickness, no cough, nothing? She had to be no more than 25. I thought that was strange. Even more troublesome, the movie was marred by the unbelievable coincidence of someone from Eilis' town in Ireland being actually present at the locale of her wedding in Brooklyn and quickly reporting that event to that horribly mean shopkeeper. Of all the millions of people on both sides of the Atlantic (no small world even then!) what are the chances of Eilis being found out that she was married?!",

This film completely blew me away and I can see it being received well with the Academy! It's a simple coming-of-age tale. Brooklyn is Saoirse Ronan's film; she's in every scene. She gives her best performance to date and it will garner her many awards including Oscar. Emory Cohen is mini Marlon Brando and Julie Walters is superb.

Its basically just about a young Irish woman who is torn between two worlds, but its the understated performances and little doses of humour that make it very memorable. The universal themes of finding your own path, or moving away from home, or falling in love for the first time are very accessible, so its a grand drama that never gets too saccharine or sappy.

    "review": "  In a world where the romantic film seems like such a hard thing to get right, Brooklyn is a great example that it can be done. The romantic film today has become a cliched mess, much like the horror genre, so much so that when one comes along that is genuinely great it's worth pointing out. Brooklyn is well acted, often funny, and boasts a great story. This film may be best remembered in future years as being Saoirse Ronan's breakout role as a leading actress. Lead and anchored by Ronan's performance, the film fell on her shoulders and she carried the weight gracefully. Ronan's performance helped make her character, Eilis, feel like a real person, who is scared and alone. As well as making her character feel real, Ronan also had great chemistry with her co-star, and love interest Emory Cohen. Their chemistry shines most though when the characters play off of each other. The way the two characters play off each other helps give the film a really good sense of humor. Especially the scene when Ronan meets Cohen's family. All of this aside the plot may be the best part of the film. We as humans need conflict, and recently romantic films have struggled capturing a realistic sense of conflict. Most recent romantic films try to manufacture conflict through an estranged person, getting in the way of the main character, what this film does well is that it makes life get in the way of the main character. By this I mean that the conflict in this movie is derived from situations all people either have found themselves in, or can relate to making it more realistic. This approach combined with Ronan's very visual acting style helps sell the conflict, and thus make the film all the more entertaining. Really what Brooklyn does so well is it strips down the romantic genre to a group of core elements and then built a story around it, making the film's conflict more natural. By giving the film a simple, yet deep story with a natural conflict that most audience members can relate to Brooklyn succeeds as an original romance film. Lead by the brilliant acting of Saoirse Ronan the film is able to create realistic characters, and eve generate a few laughs. Brooklyn does a great job combining great acting, with realistic characters, in a natural story, that is funny but not sappy, to make a great overall film.",

    "review": "  The first movie of the year to truly \"tug on my heart strings\", BROOKLYN is a success in virtually all elements of its production. Writer Nick Hornby, a novelist, manages to avoid the potential problem of making the screenplay overly proseic. Not only that, but he masterfully blends simple - albeit effective - dialogue with moments that allow the actors to shine with their nonverbals. The whole ensemble is excellent. Emory Cohen provides a subtle, affecting performance while Domhnall Gleeson offers a painfully sincere presentation as the competition for Cohen's character. Both men play characters who earnestly contend for the affections Saoirse Ronan's Eilis. Ronan proves again that she is one of the most talent (and no doubt underappreciated) actors working today. Her work as Eilis is never showy or one-up-ish; she always uses an energy and intensity appropriate to context and works well with the rest of the ensemble. Even so, her performance stands out as having a complexity that is above and beyond what the other actors are able to bring to the table. I doubt that many currently working performances would have handled the role with such grace, sincerity, and likability. Throughout the whole picture, director John Crowley carefully captures each moment in such a way as to let the cast and crew do their work through simplicity. The cinematography is beautiful without being distracting. The acting is powerful and appropriate without elevating moments for certain characters over others. The editing does not involve fancy transitions, but it also does the job of dealing with time transitions while maintaining the suspension of disbelief. Best of all, Crowley's pacing is impeccable. Every beat seems to run through all the steps of Freytag's dramatic structure. It has been some time since I have seen such careful attention to every beat of a film. So many screenplays use the \"practical\" approach of using pseudo-beats that reveal some piece of information about the story and move on without so much as attempting to be a complete scene. BROOKLYN is wonderfully different. While a description of the story is typical for these reviews, I would be hard pressed to easily pin down what BROOKLYN is \"about\" because so much of the movie relies on empathy and sympathy and things are not always easily communicated in words. On the surface, BROOKLYN is about a young Irish girl who immigrates to the United States in the 1950s. She has no home and must learn to navigate the uncertain terrain of \"belonging\". BROOKLYN does an excellent job of reminding us that \"belonging\" often has to do with relationships and how people choose (or do not choose) to be with one another. The movie is about growing up, fitting in, the nature of love, and a variety of other things. Most of all, the movie is about contentment and being able to be satisfied with one's circumstances, even if still working toward something better. \"Better\" is good for motivation, but less good for present happiness. The movie is certainly not without flaws here and there (perhaps overly simple editing, too much story time dedicated to the Cohen character plotline...), but it is also emotionally impacting and very powerful in its humble presentation.",

    "review": "  LUCKY CHARMED - My Review of BROOKLYN (4 1/2 Stars)I'm not familiar with director John Crowley's previous work, but if the stellar, emotionally overpowering BROOKLYN is any indication, then he's definitely worth investigating. It doesn't hurt that Nick Hornby wrote the screenplay based on a book by Colm T�ib�n, as Hornby is no stranger to connecting with audiences via ABOUT A BOY, AN EDUCATION, and WILD. It's also a huge bonus to have, without a doubt, one of the best young actresses of her (or any) generation in Saoirse Ronan (ATONEMENT, THE LOVELY BONES), who at 21 years old can not only carry a movie, but sweep you away with such quiet skill and subtlety. If anyone working today reminds me of a young Meryl Streep in looks and talent, it's her. Mix all of that together to present an equal parts immigration and love story, and you get BROOKLYN, a simple, no-nonsense, old school tale that had me not just weeping, but straight up bawling for most of its running time. It may not be the best movie of the year, but it's hands down one of the best romances I've ever seen. Ronan plays Eilis, a young woman in a small Irish town who lives with her mother and sister. Wanting a better life than that of a whipping girl to the town Ogre's shop owner, Miss Kelly (a memorable Brid Brennan), Eilis gets a sponsored trip to America to start anew. Leaving her family behind presents the aching dramatic tension of this story, as well as her arduous trip across the ocean. On board, her bunkmate, a veteran of such crossings, teaches her how to properly assimilate into 1952 America.Upon arrival, her sponsor, Father Flood (Jim Broadbent) finds her an upscale department store job and a boarding house run by Mrs. Kehoe (Julie Walters, who has a table pounding great time with her many quotable lines). MAD MEN's Jessica Par�, in the snooty Parker Posey role as Eilis' new boss, manages to bring empathy to a somewhat bitchy role. Short on true Brooklyn atmosphere, the film, however, gets the emotions just right of a stranger in a strange land. Crowley knows how to use silence, glances, and breathing room in scenes to bring real feelings to the surface. Ellis is a strong yet observant character who can only contain her emotions for so long before they erupt, and I erupted right along with her. Cinematographer Yves B�langer, who kept his camera much more alive in WILD and DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, tends towards visceral, sweeping grandeur here, and appropriately so. Whether it's the musty views of a dark Irish street at night or the technicolor splendor of a crowded Coney Island beach, this is dreamy perfection. Also of note is the spot-on costume design by Odile Dicks-Mireaux and the just-right production design by Fran�ois S�guin. The pneumatic tubes in the department store are just one great detail we get to savor.More joy comes in the form of Tony (a star making performance from Emory Cohen), an Italian plumber who meets Eilis when he crashes an Irish mixer. Their love story is what makes this movie soar beyond all expectations. I can't recall the last time I witnessed a film where the puppy love and unbridled adoration just oozes off the screen. Cohen's sparkling eyes tell the whole story of what falling in love looks like. To say this pair has chemistry is an understatement in all its whooshy, gooey, innocent splendor. These two characters simply love being together, and the considerate, present, gentle tone of Cohen's performance redefines \"winning\". When is the last time you saw a film where the male protagonist rushes to wait outside a girl's school just so he can escort her home? Or when his declaration of love is done with such delicacy? I don't know if I cried because I was alone and dateless when I saw this film, or if I knew I was witnessing something so rare and pure, but the courtship scenes hit me in the gut.Of course complications get in the way of the relationship when unexpected events dictate Eilis' temporary (possibly permanent) return to Ireland. Here, we're treated to one heartbreaking scene after another, a pile-on many may find insufferable, but I found to be truthful. Virtually unable to escape her tribe whether in Ireland or her U.S. boarding house, Eilis finds herself at a crossroads. More than a love story, BROOKLYN is about figuring out your identity in life. Through Ronan's perfectly calibrated performance, we see Eilis change bit by bit. Introducing her Irish friends to her new culture, she meets another kind, young man, Jim (Domhnall Gleeson) who may impact the tough decisions that lie ahead. Ronan, Cohen, and Gleeson know what movie they're making, all of whom are unafraid of the gentle vulnerability in the script and direction. A special mention must be made for James DiGiacomo, who plays Tony's little brother Frankie. Stealing every moment with hilarious Italian hand gestures and direct, succinct comic timing, DiGiacomo feels like the kind of performer who will grow up to snag Don Rickles' career. Late in the film, there's a beautiful bookend to an earlier sequence that speaks to the generous loving heart of this movie. By paying kindness forward, by passing along knowledge and experience, BROOKLYN reveals a true American spirit. It's one we don't see very often anymore, particularly during a time where we don't always welcome newcomers with open arms. We may never again see an era as guileless as the kind depicted in this strong, lovely film, so go as a reminder of what true decency looks like. Go for Ronan's Oscar-worthy performance. That almost final shot of her standing, waiting, and posed with an iconic confidence gives you a visual, final gut bunch, guaranteed to melt even the coldest of hearts.",

She handles every moment perfectly and runs a true gambit of emotion. You feel her joy when she's with her new American boyfriend. You feel her sadness when she's suffering from homesickness. It's a truly fantastic performance from Ronan.Every emotion in this movie is pure honesty. It truly sucks you in and makes you feel everything the characters are going through without beating you over the head about it. If the film has any flaws, it's during the scenes where Ronan returns to Ireland and all the people in her hometown seem to all behave like she's returned to stay in Ireland. In fact, her romance with Domhnall Gleeson does feel a tad forced. This is probably the only cultural aspect of the film that gets lost in translation.Luckily, the positives far outweigh the negatives on this one. It's worth checking out.",

She is sponsored by her church who arranges the boat fare, a rooming house to stay and a job as a salesclerk in a department store.It is a simple story about a young girl coming to a new country, adjusting to a new life, falling in love with an Italian boy (Emory Cohen) who goes to Irish community dances because he likes Irish girls. When she is called back to Ireland due to a death she is pursued by 'the most eligible man in town' (Domhnall Gleeson) and eventually she has to decide between the two men and the country she is froma nd the country she has adopted as home.Along the way we meet the landlady (Julie Walters) of the boarding house, the other girl borders who try to teach her the ways of her new life and the priest (Jim Broadbent) who consoles her when she becomes homesick. We meet Tony's parents and family when he invites her to dinner--and she is taught by the ladies at the boarding house how to twirl spaghetti--where Tony's baby brother (James DiGiacomo) steals the scenes he is in. We meet her sophisticated supervisor (Jessica Pare) at work who follows Lacey's arc from being a shy girl, almost afraid of her shadow, or at least the shadow Brooklyn casts over a new comer, to a confident young lady who takes night school courses to become an accountant.\"Brooklyn\" is a sweet love story between people and countries, that takes its timeand has only one contrived spot that doesn't ring true. The comparison of Coney Island with bodies all over the crowded beach to the beach along the Irish countryside which only has 4 people on it is as telling as the opening shot of the Irish girl to the lady we see at the end advising a Irish country girl immigrating to Brooklyn.Saoirse Ronan, an American born 21 year old woman of Irish parents, goes fromdrab to beautiful with the ease she becomes the confident woman in \"Brooklyn\". As her lover Emory Cohen is a delightful combination of young boy and a man who knows what he wants.John Crowley directs the film placed in the 1950s and, along with the screenwriterNick Hornby, based on the book by Colm Toibin, lovingly shows the Ireland Americans dream of and the New York (Brooklyn) that immigrants picture in their heads. The casting in all the roles are perfect and though the love story doesn't overwhelm you individual scenes do.\"Brooklyn\" is one of the few quiet, impressive films of the holiday season.",

The film follows her struggles to adapt and deal with homesickness. When Eilis meets a young man, things are looking up, however news from home throws a spanner in the works!An old fashioned drama, this is a slow moving but beautifully drawn tale anchored by a subtle leading turn by Ronan, one of the best young actors around. There is no melodrama or histrionics to her acting and it is probably not a showy enough role to win her the big awards but she is the heart and soul of the film. Very entertaining support from Julie Walters in another of her turns as an old Irish woman and I enjoyed seeing Felicity from Arrow (minus her glasses) pop up as one of the girls at the boarding house. A tad slow moving but a touching story and beautifully made. Ronan is wonderful!",

    "review": "  This is one of those love stories that I would've loved a lot more if I wasn't such a cynic. As a film, I think it's very well-made and Saoirse Ronan gives a beautifully nuanced performance as Eilis, and although the focus of the film is the romance between the two main characters, the film often goes to deeper and sadder places that feel very true-to-life. I loved how it didn't shy away from the hardships of life, as well as the pain and heartbreaks that come with it. Even when the heroine was in some love triangle thing (which, to me, felt a little too contrived), it is done with grace and honesty that you can overlook its flaws. Life is difficult and complicated, there is no simple answer to it and this film does a great job of posing these questions. However, as a love story, I thought it was heavily sugar-coated. The cynical part of me couldn't stop thinking, \"well, I don't think falling in love is such an easy thing. Besides, if it's such an easy thing, why hasn't it happened to me yet!?!? Ugh!\". As much as I loved the sweet and adorable moments between Eilis and Tony, I didn't find it plausible or realistic. I guess that's a very personal complaint. I think it would be an interesting double-feature if this was paired with James Gray's The Immigrant. Brooklyn is a gentle and charming period drama, an uplifting and life-affirming tale for (hopeless) romantics around the world.",

We follow Eilis Lacey, a young Irishwoman looking for new opportunities in America. Once there, Lacey finds that she can't quite escape Ireland as it seems to come back as a reminder to her around every corner. Saoirse Ronan's performance as Lacey is spectacular. She portrays all of the young woman's fears, hopes, aspirations, misgivings and quirks in the most lovable, caring and compelling manners. She joined by a terrific supporting cast including Jim Broadbent as a good Irish priest and Emory Cohen as her Italian other half who creates a perfect chemistry with Ronan. The decision to go back to Ireland for some time proves trying on her soul, as she is now uncertain whether to actually stay in her old life which may offer new opportunities or return to the new one which she's strived to build and adjust to. It is a beautifully shot and edited film, a powerful example of the immigrant's story and funny and heart-warming. When the stars align in just the right manner, Brooklyn is what is created.",

Internationally based, the story is wrapped around the maturation of young Eilis Lacey (Oscar Nominated Saoirse Ronan). Her journey leaving her homeland of Ireland (which offered her little?set in the 50's) for America where, thru the good graces of her loving older sister, arrangements were pre-made for good housing and a good job.Watch her transition from a timid, socially awkward young lady to a self assured,happy, successful immigrant discovering and embracing the magic of America. Inour very hard times in the world these days, this film grabbed a desperateaudience who thoroughly enjoyed the ride back to simpler, kinder days. Add in thesame time exploring the cross cultural relationships that make the melting potof the USA a wonderful place to liveAnd the audience wide rooting for Eilish to make the right decisions, findthe right love, the right social relationships and maturation may sound boring yetit was exquisite and engaging. The entire film was supported by a elegant andwarm soundtrack.No doubt this film played beautifully to an older audience (50's and up) whoadored this film. The simpleness and warmness of the film easily took us awayfrom the endless, bad news dominating our world. Watching her deal with herlove for herself, her family, her church, young suitors, her work and evolvewith maturity to deal with all was most enjoyable.You can't not root for her American love who is 100% Italian and from alarge, tight family. His blue collar roots, love of basement, gentle natureand hilarious youngest brother was a heck of a casting, writing job as this little nuance makes the film work.I think this movie will get an excellent word of mouth. Will be fascinatingto see if \"younger folk\" (under 50) can carve out time from their plugged and harried lives to downshift and absorb simplicity and values. This movieworked exceptionally well.",

    "review": "  This is a really delightful movie that has a few issues trying to pin point what it really wanted to be story and genre wise but isn't that how life works? The story starts off a bit slow but once we are in America things start to pick up. The movie shines when Emory Cohen is introduced. Ronan is great and she has really changed my feelings on her as an actress after not being a fan of her performance in Atonement 8 years ago but between this and Grand Budapest Hotel, she has won me over. It isn't a showy performance it is a very naturalistic and calm performance that works perfectly against Cohen's charming and giddy performance. Anytime Cohen was on screen my smile mirrored his which was huge throughout, but when he left I found myself really desperately wanting him back on screen. Julie Walters provided another scene stealing hilarious performance and Jim Broadbent is as great as ever. Domhnall Gleeson is perfectly fine as well though his part is fairly small. My issues with this movie is the story structure. It starts off wanting to be this movie about discovery and starting fresh in a new country then it becomes a wonderful love story that could have made a fantastic short film but then sinks into a by the numbers sob story involving a love triangle and this movie was aiming to be better than clich�s for a while. It is understandable why they went that way without spoiling anything but it just felt so lazy. I found myself itching for more Ronan/Cohen scenes all throughout that last part and you really don't get it until the last shot of the movie. I don't know why this trend keeps popping up in movies like this and Suffragette but are tripods really that hard to put in your budget? There are so many dinner table scenes done on handheld that look like the camera man only had one leg because it was wobbling so much. It really takes you out of a great movie. The costumes are beautiful, the hair and make up is swell, the score is lovely, and the writing despite the last part is really great. This is the perfect movie for Donald Trump and other heartless presidential candidates that demonizes immigrants to be reminded what the true American dream is, the pursuit of happiness. I bet if they watched this they could gain a heart that has been lost somewhere in their bodies. This is actually a great movie for all ages (minus a very brief and not graphic love scene and a very Irish pronunciation of the f word) and I have no doubts you'll be delighted in some way by the movie.",

    "review": "  BROOKLYNJohn Crowley / Saoirse Ronan, Domhnall Gleeson, Emory Cohen, Jim Broadbent, Julie Walters / Dramedy / 2015 / 112 minsThere is nothing more satisfying than a dash of realism, particularly when it comes to romance. Young Irish immigrant Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) is lured to New York with boundless prospects awaiting her. She leaves behind her sister, her mother and an awful job, and, of course, the painful lack of men (life was all 'bout gettin' dat husband in the '50s). The New World brings promise, and a heavy wave of homesickness, but Eilis adjusts because of... have a guess, go on... LOVE. Young Italian-American Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen) has a crush on her, they start dating - it's all cute etc. then *collective gasp* a twist! Eilis's sister Rose dies and she must return to Ireland, but will she return back to Brooklyn? That's for you to find out. The messages the film gives are progressive. Tony says he loves Eilis, yet she refuses to reciprocate - along the lines of \"It's too early\", but knows he is the one for her. He gets it - doesn't get angry - and they continue. That's true romance: where honesty flourishes. The killer bit that I loved though was that they don't kiss onscreen for a good while. It's clear they're relationship is beyond that, but we don't need to see it - we all know how relationships work, so why continuously bombard us? \"LOOK, THEY'RE IN LOVE\" / \"MATE, SERIOUSLY, I GET IT.\" Script aside, the other thing that holds this entire film together is the cast. The best actor? It's Julie Walters, BY FAR. She was exceptional, delivered her character with a wholesome Irishness that makes you question her own heritage, and was just so damn funny. There's some hype surrounding Ronan's Eilis and to be honest I don't quite understand why. She's Irish anyway, so it's not as if she had to transform herself for the role - she's going to be naturally suited to it. A nomination is reasonable, but winning it? No - though the potential is indisputably there. Another lead standout was Cohen. Somehow, he's not overbearing as an Italian-American, which is a miracle. The other Fiorello's, although typecast, are funny too - the general trend here is that at times this can be a hilarious movie. I found the basic plot to be simple, and it's been done before. However, it's an adaptation of Colm T�ib�n's novel, so it has to stay true to the text (unless artistic license gets the better of you, but not in director John Crowley's case), and, for what is essentially a period film, the costumes and sets are outstanding - the '50s are brought to life. Nothing special in terms of how it operates as a film, Brooklyn rests heavily on the acting talent and the script. Thankfully, it pays off.Funny, sad and an all-round good take on a romance that seems genuine.(*)(*)(*)(*)",

During her travels on the Atlantic towards New York, Eilis meets an Irish-American woman on her voyage back to Brooklyn. This brash but kindly woman nurses Eilis back to health after a bout with seasickness, but soon after her arrival, Eilis finds seasickness to be the least of her worries, instead overpowered by her homesickness, a sickness that takes more than some medicine to cure. Soon enough, Eilis finds herself back on her feet and into the arms of her new boyfriend, Tony. She spends the next few weeks adapting to the relationship and with its comfort she liberates herself from the confines in which her sadness had previously contained her. Not long passes until Ellis again finds herself weeping, this time on the occasion of her sister's untimely death. Returning to Ireland, Eilis finds herself troubled once again after her sister's funeral, this time by the question of whether or not to return to America, whether or not to return to Tony. Symbolizing this question, Director John Crowley introduces another male character that embodies the spirit of Ireland and all the poignant reminders that she would be leaving behind to be with Tony. After struggling to a decision, Eilis leaves for America, and steps in as the Irish-American woman heading back to Brooklyn to give advice to a hopeful young girl immigrating to New York, a girl just like herself.Saoirse Ronan's performance is powerful and moving, handling each nuance with ease, and creating a captivating and passionate on-screen persona. Ronan's acting is masterful, pulling the audience deeper into the story through her realistic emotions and responses. Whether crying over her sister's death or smiling in Coney Island's sun, Ronan's acting is mesmerising and surely deserving of an Oscar.Set in 1953 Brooklyn, Yves Belanger's cinematography is truly amazing, able to capture the life of the city in each frame. In one particularly beautiful shot, a facade of a brownstone pans up to light filtering through the branches of a tree. However, Belanger's amazing work is not only elegant, but expressive, reflecting Ellis's mood as her attitude swings up and down over the course of the movie. Belanger's cinematography is both masterful and eloquent, not detracting from the meaning of his shots to add beauty. A captivating historical drama, Brooklyn is a sure favorite and an instant classic.",

Based upon Colm Toibin's best seller by the same name as the film, viewers are quickly immersed into this beautifully shot journey of a young girl from Ireland setting her sights on New York City in the 1950s.Irish actress Saoirse Ronan plays Eilis Lacey, who decides to leave her mother and sister behind in Ireland for a shot at the shining beacon called America. The 21-year old actress, who received an Academy Award nomination for 2007's \"Atonement\", delivers her best performance to date in \"Brooklyn\"--showcasing Eilis' vast character growth and spirit.In the film's beginning we find a meek, soft-spoken and unpolished young Eilis having homesickness and difficulty adjusting to her new job in New York City. A precise script from Oscar nominated Nick Hornby (for last year's \"Wild\") carefully matures the courageous and determined Eilis from mere adventurer into an independent thinker and strong woman.A moving film that's spectacularly shot, \"Brooklyn\" brings us a hopeful story about a girl who bets against long odds and wins. This charming plot tosses in complicated new surroundings, friends and admirers for Eilis, while tastefully adding love into the mix--along with heavy doses of resolve. When people doubt Eilis's abilities, she grows stronger and more successful. When people object to her decisions, Eilis only gets smarter and more attuned to her feelings.Always finding help and advice from others, the quick-learning Eilis must weigh love interests from men on different continents. Wisely, though, director John Crowley never makes \"Brooklyn\" solely about romance or the cultural differences between Ireland and the U.S.A. Instead, Crowley and \"Brooklyn\" focus only on Eilis and her life's experiences during her most trying and difficult times; the enchanting premise of a girl willing to leave her comfort zone of family, friends, society for the potential of a better future.Romantically, \"Brooklyn\" is the land-based film version of \"Titanic\". Two young people, from widely different backgrounds, brought together by adventure and happenstance. Their unlikely match marked by tragedy, heartbreak and love.Enjoyable for its quick wits, top-notch performances and fascinating look at an Era long pasted, \"Brooklyn\" shines bright. Very bright. An authentic and exceptional cast combines with a splendid screenplay for a timeless-yet somewhat predictable--underdog bout. Saoirse Ronan's stellar portrayal of the head-strong fighter, Eilis, deserves to be included in any 2015 Best Actress talk. Likewise, look for Nick Hornsby's script to be nominated in the Best Adapted Screenplay category.Grade: A",

    "review": "  Sunday night art movies are sometimes painful to watch because they can be pretty sombre and sad. Brooklyn is neither but it's certainly uncomfortable at times and there is plenty of drama.Set in the 1950's, the movie deals with the story of a young Irish woman that moves to NYC in search of a better life. We witness how she learns to cope with the distance and homesickness. She matures, falls in love and eventually goes back to Ireland and her will is tested. Without giving away too much, this is the first time in my life where i have been tempted to leave the theater based on a decision from one of the characters. I was ready to bail. Brooklyn is really good and probably no one will see it. What a shame.",

    "review": "  This is frustrating, because the first two thirds of this film is actually quite good. A fairly touching, genuinely funny at times story of a young girl finding her own place in the world. Then she goes back to Ireland after a death in her family, and the movie lost me HARD by turning into a liar-revealed story and in doing so I lost any sympathy I had for the lead character. All that she had to say was ONE THING to ANY ONE of her friends and none of what follows happens. It honestly made me think she's a rather horrible person, either for even considering staying and abandoning what she had in Brooklyn, or for continuing to let people believe staying and all that implies was even possible. Yet through the framing I'm supposed to feel sympathetic to her? No, I don't: the old shopkeeper may be a miserable person, but I'm sorry she's in the right here. Ugh. Still, I cannot deny the first two thirds is actually very good, the cinematography is excellent, and the acting is good all around (although personally I think Ronan has gorgeous eyes but is a bit stiff at times - she needed to be more natural). As such, I don't hate this like I did \"Boyhood\" as its not boring like that was, but oh boy did this ever drop the ball with me.",

    "review": "  Brooklyn is in many ways the romantic film Nicholas Sparks wishes he wrote. It deals with pretty much every aspect his films/books usually have, romance, tragedy, love triangles, all of it. But Brooklyn is told with care. Everything that happens makes sense thematically. There isn't some crazy twist or a MacGuffin thrown in at the end, it's simply a well thought out story about a young woman trying to find where she belongs. To me, that was really refreshing to see.Saoirse Ronan stars as Ellis, a young Irish woman whom doesn't seem to fit within the current formulaic lifestyle of that of her Irish family and friends. So she decides to take a trip to New York and find herself with a hopeful career in bookkeeping and accounting. In Brooklyn she meets a young Italian man which blossoms into a relationship. Ronan is fantastic as Ellis and is sure to be up there for best lead actress come Oscar season. Her performance is one of perfect comedic and emotional timing. I think that's probably the best part about the film. It knows when to hit you with laughs and it finds just the right time for tears.Ellis has to deal with a tragedy back home so she goes back to Ireland around the midway point of the film. This is where the film could go into the clich�d and cheesy territory as a second love interest arises back home. Except, this is once again handled with care. As Ellis is torn, so are we. It's an age old tale about the right choice not necessarily being the best choice. I really thought Ronan balanced that extremely well in her performance. It's also a strong female role. Her choices in the film aren't solely based on men. She does what she does to further her cause as well and has her own dreams and aspirations. Brooklyn is truly a hidden gem of 2015 and will definitely be talked about come Oscar season.+Roman is so strong+Powerful love story not solely predicated on love+Comedic and emotional timing+Performances across the board9.2/10",

    "review": "  Brooklyn is probably the most accurate portrayal of the plight of an immigrant leaving there motherland, there country I have seen in a film. One is said to believe through many movies, books etc, that the reason people leave there motherland to come to America and Canada etc is because its the land of opportunity, that is true, but for the most part the sorrow one feels for leaving there own people, and the hardships one has to face while adjusting to a new country is what is always left out in popular culture. Its not all fun and games, and all happiness you see in most films for foreigners. Based in the 1950's Brooklyn is a coming of age romantic drama that highlights the issues mentioned above through a tale of a very endearing girl and how she matures into a women.Brooklyn brings that nastolgic feeling of the good ole days, of classic cinema of film made in the 50s-70s. Brooklyn is a heartwarming tale that is meant to make the viewers teary eyed, its a women centric film, and most of the time I am put off by such films, but Brooklyn is an exception. The 1950's setting looked very authentic, the costumes, the locations were authentic, but above all the story screenplay/story though bit of a old fashioned it was still highly engaging, and the film never dragged. Its a story that would work across any language, and one that everyone will be able to connect to, and thats why Brooklyn is a winner.Story wise an Irish immigrant in 1950s New York falls for a tough Italian plumber , but faces temptation from another man when she returns to her homeland for a visit.Acting wise Saoirse Ronan is completely breathtaking as Lacy, she was perfectly casted for the lead role. Watch out for the climax scene were she is telling the new girl how to behave in America.Emory Cohen played the typical Italian immigrant well. Jane Brennan is good as the mother.Fiona Glascott's characters sorrow comes out perfectly on the screen.Brid is extremely witty, and comical.Brooklyn for me did not have many blemishes, the film was a bit of too melodramatic at times, or a little too old fashioned but for a film set in the 1950s, these blemishes actually worked in favour of the story because the film is sort of a homage to the films of yore. Brooklyn successfully takes its viewers back to 1950's everything for the sets, clothing etc is perfect and fits the right time frame. The production values are flawless. The film at runtime of 1hr and 50 min succeeds in keeping the viewer fully engaged. Brooklyn's highlight is in the the way the film has been written, the emotions, of the film are beautifully portrayed. This is thanks to the lead actress and the story/screenplay. The story is just so heartwarming, and endearing that even the strongest viewer will shed a tear.Overall Brooklyn might not be a film that every audience demographic will enjoy its more of a female centric coming of the age romantic drama, that genre will keep a lot of viewers away. But the film is a fresh, and great film in my opinion, it was nice to watch a film thats so different then the usual cliched weekly released flicks. I recommend that you should give Brooklyn a watch and I guarantee you will not be left disappointed,4/5* or 8/10",

Julie Walters excels as the woman who runs a boarding house for immigrant girls, Jim Broadbent excels as the priest. Saoirse Ronan outdoes herself in the lead role bringing an every-woman appeal to her performance. But this excellence runs through the movie and every character. Domhnall Gleeson gives a very subtle and understated performance, and even the slightly mad Cavan girl who is in a few scenes is a total hoot. Rarely I think do you see a movie full of so many rich characters.The story is the story of everyone who leaves their roots to take up life in a new country, which may not seem that extraordinary though this contains elements that I experienced when I immigrated, and so resonated hugely with me.I would be surprised if it does not get some form of Oscar recognition. That's how good it is.",

    "review": "  Even in the times when�\"Brooklyn\" -�a new film by Irish director John Crowley (\"Closed Circuit\"), based on the 2009 best-selling novel of the same name, by Irish author�Colm T�ib�n - doesn't quite work, it still firmly holds our attention, thanks to the mesmerizing central performance by lead (also Irish - Erin go bragh!) actress�Saoirse Ronan (\"Atonement\"). And those times are few and far between, since this lovely period piece about a young woman's migration from the Emerald Isle to the Big Apple in the early 1950s tackles big, universal issues about the human condition in small, concrete ways that make the tale accessible to all. Who hasn't left home to find their way in the world, only to wonder at one's place in it? Beautifully photographed and (mostly) brilliantly acted, the movie is a gentle coming-of-age story that showcases a young star on the rise.I have not read�T�ib�n's book,�so I do not know how faithful is this adaptation - written by novelist-turned-screenwriter Nick Hornby (\"Wild\") - but I can say that the script moves along briskly,�starting first in Ireland, where twenty-something Eilis (Ronan) lives with her widowed mother and older sister. That sister, Rose, has arranged for Eilis (pronounced \"Aye-lish\") to emigrate to America (New York, specifically). There's nothing for her at home, and Rose insists on a better life for Eilis than what she has for herself. We move quickly past the tearful goodbyes, on to the boat, and then before we know it we're on Ellis Island, and then in Brooklyn, where Eilis finds herself in an Irish-run boarding house, homesick beyond belief. By day, she works in a department store, doing her best not to cry in front of customers. The kindly Irish ex-pat priest (Jim Broadbent, \"Le Week-End\")�who organized her travel realizes that Eilis needs a calling, and sets her up in night classes at Brooklyn College, where she studies to become an accountant. Slowly, Eilis acclimates to her new life. And then one day, she meets a young man, Tony (Emory Cohen, \"Smash\") - not Irish,�but Italian�-�and things improve even more. Perhaps Brooklyn will offer Eilis the opportunities of which her sister dreamed.But this is a far more complex tale than that, and soon a tragedy at home calls Eilis back to her native land, where she is�forced to confront big questions of what constitutes \"home.\" Thanks to Ronan's beautifully nuanced rendering of Eilis' central conflict - should I stay or should I go? - we are completely drawn to her struggle. Director Crowley shoots the Ireland of these later scenes in warm,�orange hues�that are�in sharp contrast to the washed-out grays and blues of the opening, further complicating the push and pull of old vs. new. With the arrival of an unexpected - Irish - suitor (Domhnall Gleeson, \"Ex Machina\"), Eilis' situation is made even trickier. Is the life she has made for herself in Brooklyn - with Tony - enough to overcome the nostalgic allures of her birthplace? Well, if I told you, there'd be no reason to see the movie ...The film features an impressive ensemble cast, especially in scenes in the boarding house, where an array of new Irish immigrants is overseen by the delightfully prickly Mrs. Kehoe (Julie Walters, Mrs. Weasley in the�\"Harry Potter\" films). While everyone in the film - Irish and Italian, alike - is somewhat of an ethnic caricature, these portrayals make sense as evocations of how foreign�ethnicities might be seen through the eyes of other new immigrants. Unfortunately, the one performance of which I am (slightly) less of a fan is Cohen's. While his Tony is sweet and loving, and perhaps just what Eilis needs to soothe her loneliness, I never for one moment buy him as an adult male about to make his way in the world. Plus, his adoption of \"Eye-tal-ian\" mannerisms - in contrast to the more subtle behaviors of the actors playing the other members of his family - is a bit much. And though I am usually no fan of Gleeson's, his restrained lovesick (and manly) rival to Tony, back in Ireland, creates an imbalance in favor of a return to Eire, which is not, I believe, the filmmakers' intent. That issue, aside, however, the film is superbly done, and a powerful portrait of a strong female protagonist�coming into her own.",

    "review": "  Wow, Just wow. What a film. I was most impressed by the performances by all involved especially Saoirse Ronan's who played Eilis. She has been tipped for Oscar 2016. Such powerful performances. Great well done. My number one pet peeve other than Music, which am delighted was wonderful and fantastic, BUT the plot, which I will outline in a mo. I was most impressed with the way they portrayed the 1950s. Highly recommended. When in particular the way they used to use the Boat from Cobh, Co. Cork. The film is set in Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford. So Eilis prob got the train over to Cobh or something. But the number one thing that got to me was the emotions. She showed true character as per Colm Tobin's novel. THe plot as I said above was most appreciative very simple. Eilis is currently living with her Mother and Rose(Glascott). She gets a hankering to move to Brooklyn, New York City whom she was helped by Fr. Flood(Broadbent) in terms of a Visa AND a Job. She got a job as a sales person in Balloci a jewellery or something. Says I to meself, my god you could just literally sale into a job, but these days, totally different. So she meets a sexy young Italian buck Tony(Cohen). It is with great sadness, of which I won't bother getting into it, forces Eilis to return back to Ireland. So while back, her friend or neighbor Nancy(O' Higgins) sets her up with a guy, with a very cute mmmmm guy Jim Farrell(Gleeson). Before Eilish returns to IReland, TOny marries Eilis so that EIlis \"promises\" to return back to him. Whilst in Ireland, she gets feelings for Ireland again AND my precious Jim. So M Kelly(Brennan) being the villain I take it, makes up her mind for EVERYTHING by revealing \"how small this world is\", when she reveals that a \"young girl from Enniscorthy\", married TOny an \"Italian\". So on that note, I will leave you all to guess the rest. ahahah.",

    "review": "  A coming of age film that has Saoirse Ronan giving one of her best performances of her young career. If you ever seen a Nicholas Sparks adapted movie, BROOKLYN is what those films should be. This is a drama with romance, but none of the sappiness. At the core, it is about a young woman who leaves Ireland to have a better life in America. The love story is secondary, but just as important because Eillis, (Ronan) faces a decision that will decide the rest of her life and affect her family and friends. The movie is about finding your home and following your heart.Grade: A",

    "review": "  A charming film about an Irish girl's journey from County Wexford to the titular New York borough, mirroring her own maturing into womanhood, it is competently made and beautifully acted, in particular, Julie Waters' Mrs. Kehoe who brings the laughs, filtered through with a huge dose of Irish witticism and humour and Brid Brennan's Miss Kelly who aptly represents the small town mentality the main character is trying to escape from with her two bookending scenes. But this is Saoirse Ronan's film, whose nuanced performance brilliantly captures the introspective nature of the conflicts and the responsibilities she has to face as she blossoms into adulthood. Brooklyn is a very nice film but it leaves a somewhat syrupy and sentimental aftertaste - and while there is nothing wrong with that, it somewhat zaps the overall dramatic effect.",

    "review": "  Brooklyn acts as a compelling romance and a thoughtful drama about change and transition. The relationships in the film sparkle and feel very genuine thanks to the actors and Nick Hornby's screenplay which knows exactly when to let the film speak through dialogue and when to let the moment simmer. Hornby allows the emotions to breathe on their own by avoiding clich�s with ease. The broad appeal of the emotions and themes allows for the audience to relate the process of change in Eilis's life to any transitional period in their own, which I found myself doing during and after the film. Saoirse Ronan carries this film on her shoulders in every scene, conveying all of the emotion of her emotional journey often without having to say anything. She really tells her characters story through her eyes and face, and it's hard to imagine the film working so well without her. She deserves all the Oscar consideration she can get. There are some solid supporting performances as well, notably from Emory Cohen and Julie Walters. It's a nice looking and nice feeling film that has subtle but great period aesthetics and visuals that enhance the emotion. A thoroughly enjoyable watch on a surface level that anyone can enjoy because Saoirse Ronan and director John Crowley make it easy to identify with the central character and to relate to her experience. There was an important point in the film where I didn't quite get the reason a character made a decision because it arose too quickly and was motivated by something that felt too external. It distanced me from the film a little and diminished the overall impact a bit for me. Nonetheless, I certainly felt like I came away from the film with a lot and really enjoyed my viewing experience. Would highly recommend. Hard not to like. Saoirse Ronan was great.",

    "review": "  Brooklyn is written by Nick Hornby and directed by John Crowley. It stars Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen, and Domhanall Gleeson.An Irish immigrant lands in 1950's Brooklyn, where she quickly falls into a new romance. When her past catches up with her, however, she must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within.This movie feels an awful lot like a Merchant Ivory movie, before they went downhill. This is probably the best period piece of the year simply because Brooklyn embraces the type of movie it is, whole heatedly.Brooklyn, in my humble opinion, is a wrought melodrama that is equal parts quaint as it is provocatively made. This movie was made to be perfect and that might very well be its largest flaw. Though that thought is paradoxical, it is well founded. Aside from my minor griping, I did appreciate this movie in its entirety.My personal favorite part of the movie, which I noticed from the very beginning, was the immaculate cinematography, done by Yves B�langer. Though to the common movie goers eye it seems rather ordinary, but to me it was what made the movie so engaging. The gentile blend of light and dark colors inside and outside make the movie well worth seeing on the big screen in its own right, but what really got me was the deft mixing of colors at the dining scenes where the beauty of Saoirse Ronan was brought out through her, emphasized, kind smile and innocent eyes.Speaking of the lead actress, Saoirse Ronan was impeccably cast in this movie. She plays her role magically and brings a lot to the metaphorical and literal table. She pulls off a role that people 3 times her age would have a hard time doing; given the fact that someone 3 times as old as her wouldn't be cast to play a 19 year old accountant. Ronan plays a sympathetic and quirky lead so well that she bring Ellis Lacey to life.The same goes for Emory Cohen in his portrayal as Tony, Ellis' new Italian boyfriend in the States. The two make a remarkable pair, with phenomenal chemistry and finesse. Cohen plays a large part in this movie and understands that he needed to strike a perfect blend of desperation, love and believability.The same can be said about Brooklyn's script and tender direction. The art of creating a drama is like walking a tight rope, filled with sharp and jagged edges known to all as clich�s. This movie, for the most part, avoids these dreaded obstacles, by opting to slowly but surely build up its heady themes. Though this may be true, this, said, slow pace and structure can, at times, make the film feel uneventful, which may turn off some viewers. The lucky ones who do stick around are rewarded with a deeply emotionally resonant conclusion, much like the Merchant Ivory classics. Though most clich�s are avoided, some were unfortunately injected into the plot, when writer, Nick Hornby, decided to occasionally over dramatize events in the movie. This at times feels desperate and at others feel just redundant, but nevertheless gets the message across to some degree.Brooklyn is an old fashioned period piece that offers fine acting, beautiful cinematography, charming writing grounded in reality, and thought provoking direction. Brooklyn gets a B+ or 7/10.",

    "review": "  For me it's the best movie of 2015. Everything about 'BROOKLYN' is both acted and visually stunning. Saoirse Ronan deserves all the awards for her portrayal as Eilish Lacey in this coming-of-age tale about finding your way in life. Emory Cohen and Domhnall Gleeson are amazing too. Julie Walters and the other ladies in the boarding house are hilarious. We'll definitely be seeing both Saoirse and 'Brooklyn' at the Oscars! A must see!!",

'Brooklyn' resonates with those who have left home, moved abroad or are just simply finding their way in life. I highly recommend.",

The casting is just right, every performance is wonderfully authentic, and Saoirse Ronan is incandescent as a young Irish girl in the 1950's. It has been a long time since I saw a film whose love story really mattered or made me care, and the way \"Brooklyn\" depicts family dynamics will break your heart.",

    "review": "  Beautifully shot and achingly heartfelt, \"Brooklyn\" may not have much in common with say \"The Lords of Flatbush,\" but the beloved borough becomes as vital a character in this film about a young Irish lass sent to the land of opportunity in the early 1950s where immigrants from all over planted roots. The melting pot of Brooklyn becomes a vivid backdrop as Eilis Lacey struggles with homesickness while hoping to fulfill her family's hope of a better future in America. What I found most resonant about the film is its depiction of that rite of passage where we leave home, and then our subsequent return as visitor. Those conflicting emotions of security in where we come from and possibility in where we may go are explored with elegance, grace, and humor here. There is incredible richness in the direction by John Crowley and the screenplay by Nick Hornby, filled with exquisite details and sharp insights. What makes \"Brooklyn\" most distinguishable from many films is how it presents real people, mostly kind and sweet, just struggling with ordinary issues. Nothing is bloated to fit the melodramatic grandeur audiences come to expect. That said, within this intimate story there are memorable scenes of gorgeous cinematography, powerful imagery, and heartbreaking emotion. All the performances are brilliant, full of honesty and detail, but Saoirse Ronan as Eilis carries the film, in nearly every single scene, and she is compelling. With her expressive face and depth of feeling, the portrait she paints not only captivates but lives with you well beyond the final credits roll. Easily one of the year's best, do make a journey to \"Brooklyn.\"",
