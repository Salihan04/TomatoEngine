    "review": "  After a series of middling disappointments, Pixar returns to glory with the animative \"Inside Out\". Loaded with imagination, color and crackling with emotion, \"Inside Out\" is quite magical.The story of the going-ons inside a young girl's head prove to be an amazing device on how to convey that all emotions are important in achieving true fulfillment in life. While at the surface it looks like a children's tale, \"Inside Out\" strikes that perfect Pixar balance of fun for both adults and kids.The voice performances are superb with Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith as standouts. Colorful and delightful - one of Pixar's best offerings in years.",

    "review": "  Pixar returns to form with the delightful 'Inside Out'. Following 11 year old Riley and her emotions (Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness) this film explores the psychology of a child in a unique and gratifying way, with simple yet effective messages that will warm the heart of any child or adult. For me the message was quite beautiful that a memory doesn't have one emotion attached to it- it has a plethora of emotions, showcasing how unique and complex we are as individuals. It also tells us that we are allowed to feel joyful or sad etc, and that we shouldn't feel bad for feeling anything that we do because it is human to feel. Without spoiling anything there are a few scenes in the movie that may leave you with a tear in your eye. Pixar effectively gives emotions feelings in this brilliant animated movie.4.5/5",

    "review": "  When I first saw the pics for this movie I thought it was about little living emojis/emoticons, it does look like that doesn't it? Nope, instead its actually about little living creatures inside your head that represent emotions. When I say living creatures I'm not so sure that's even correct, they are more like representations of the mind or emotions, each one a little physical embodiment of each emotion. Its not an overly original concept lets be totally honest, I know I've seen this type of thing before in cartoons many times, and in pretty similar fashion, but again lets be honest, there's only a few ways you can do this.So the plot revolves around a little girl as she is born, and at the same time her little emotions are born within her head (I assume). We follow little Riley as she grows up with her parents and experiences all of life's wonder and beauty, but of course, all of the little negative bits too. At the same time we see everything from inside little Riley's head from the perspective of her emotions and how they each deal with individual situations. Naturally each emotion deals with different things such as sadness, anger, joy etc...they each specialise in their emotion of course. Alas, many years later aged 11, one day goes tits up when Riley attends her first day at school and loses control, she begins to cry because she is home sick, this causes a permanent negative memory which Joy (the happy emotion) tries to get rid of. In a series of bizarre accidents Joy and Sadness get ejected from the control room (the brain) and end up lose within Riley's head. Without Joy in Riley's mind (and life) keeping control, the duo now have to get back into Riley's brain/mind before she becomes depressed forever, seemingly.Right so the emotions, a generic bunch truth be told, Anger, Joy, Sadness, Disgust and Fear. Anger is a little red fellow that isn't a million miles away from a satanic looking creation, he also emits fire when in a rage. He is probably the second best emotion going for obvious reason really, one of the funniest emotions. Joy is the main protagonist and is a happy-go-lucky shiny female character that is rather vomit inducing. Sadness is probably the best emotion if you ask me, he looks kinda plain yet random in design, but his permanent, nervous, hyper paranoid persona is clearly the main laugh out loud machine. Disgust is easily the weakest of the bunch with not much to do or say frankly. She is modelled on young teenage valley girls which is a good notion, but highly annoying (check her glittery appearance). Lastly we have Sadness who is a stereotypically short, plump, glasses wearing female character that kinda reminds you of the nerdy high school girl, the librarians assistant type. She mopes around being all glum and useless, again, kinda annoying and makes you wonder why no one ever kills her.Overall the emotions are a reasonably fun little group but nothing overly hilarious, personally I found the other background characters much more interesting. The best of these has to be Bing Bong who was Riley's old childhood imaginary friend, but long forgotten. This guy is a combination of Riley's favourite things from that young age, his body is made of candy floss and various animal parts...plus he cries candy. His sidekick is an old child's tow wagon with rocket boosters that fire a rainbow coloured discharge, this was Riley's old toy back in the day which she would play and imagine could fly like a space rocket. This guy gives us some of the best laughs throughout the main adventure through Riley's mind, but he also gives us some of the most emotional. I don't think I can deny that I almost cried when he meets his end. Hands up who's with me here...yeah, I thought so. The various other colourful, bizarre, weird and wonderful little mind creatures we meet along the way are all really well designed and voiced acted, like I said, overall I think the majority were actually more engaging than the main characters. I really didn't like the designs for the main emotions, they just seemed way too simplistic and generic.I also have to say I didn't like or understand the other emotional representatives in other peoples minds, they didn't really make sense. Hear me out, Riley's mind emotions don't look anything like her, they are just visual representations of the emotion. Now when we go to Riley's dad (who has a tash), his mind emotions also have little moustaches, Riley's mum has emotions that look like her with the glasses and hair. Then in the end credits we see more mind emotions for other people, all of them look like the people they inhabit. One guy who works as a clown even has mind emotions that look like clowns, eh?? why would his mind emotions look like clowns when that's just his day job? So I guess the question is, why does Riley have random looking emotions when everyone else has emotions that look like them? Yeah I know this is a kids flick and I'm [b]really[/b] looking too far into this, but things like that kinda bug me cause it doesn't really add up. The animal ones really seemed far fetched as the emotions just run wild inside the animals head, so I guess that would work? who knows.The visuals are of course stunning, really slick, but did you expect anything less? really? I'm not trying to take anything away from the visuals but these days its really no big deal anymore is it, if a movie looks less than stunning then its something to talk about. I did like the imagination on display though, some really great ideas fleshed out, not all great, I would have done some things differently, but still good. I really liked the abyss of lost memories or memory dump, nice touch. The individual floating personality islands were neat, like family island or friendship island, that house memories of those certain aspects in Riley's life. I liked how they fell apart when affected by Riley's emotional state being rocked badly. I also liked the train of thought which was of course...a train. Overall the ideas and some visuals reminded me of an old animated movie called 'The Phantom Tollbooth', which also delved into such things as individual human traits being fleshed out, alongside things like words and numbers.Its a strong emotional ride that's for sure, no puns intended. The kids will love the visuals and the wacky characters, whilst the adults will enjoy the trip down memory lane for the...errmm, the childhood memory aspect of it all. I'm sure many people will be able to relate to what's going on, first day of school and crying, snow days, moving etc...its all there, the full gamut of human anguish and joy. The way they have thought out how things like memories, long term memories, forgotten memories, special memories etc...all work is very clever, typically adults make everything into a bureaucratic headache, but it works well. But like I said already I didn't really feel the main emotions, which was a problem, they weren't overly funny but slightly annoying. I mean come on, Sadness creates all the problems, everything is her fault! and she kept on touching everything and fucking it up!! arrgghhh!! Still I can't deny this was an excellent little rollercoaster that had me on the edge of my seat wondering how they would ever save the day.",

    "review": "  So freakin' lovely, as expected from a Disney Pixar joint. We see how children naturally evolve from their compartmentalized basic emotions to composite secondary and tertiary emotions. Even I didn't understand Joy's fanatic tenacity for much of the movie, but the overarching message about how putting a happy face on all the time can take its toll is quite kathartic and accurate. There are some random, goofy tangents throughout the journey, but Bing Bong's sacrifice is so sad and moving.*Mild spoiler: So does that mean children's comprehension of Sadness becomes Reason later on in life?",

The adventure on top is just icing on the cake. I'm just somewhat underwhelmed by the lack of exploration with the other three core \"emotion\" members (anger, fear and disgust) Like Sadness I think they're a lot more interesting as perceptively \"negative\" emotions. Instead Joy gets an unprecedented amount of focus that I just don't care for.Inside Out is a great \"journey\" adventure, but a missed opportunity to simplify and explore the complexities of its own cast.",

Pixar really targets the adults in this picture, but includes some funny moments for children and some really clever moments for everyone. Some parts of this movie are complex, probably too much so for its own good because it does get out of hand at some points, but that is better than being too simple. This film may be overshadowed and under appreciated since it came out on the heels of Frozen and The Lego Movie, and while I consider those 2 to be better films, that is not to take away from how enjoyable this one is.",

Hardly worthy of a film, you might think, but in the capable hands of Pixar, worthy insight into that indefinable nuance, that which makes us tick. One cool decision is that Fear and Anger, while present, are given diminutive roles compared to Sadness and even Disgust.

    "review": "  It feels immeasurably satisfying to finally have the Pixar we all fell in love with back and running. There's been a sharp decline in the company's quality since 2010's Toy Story 3. Did we really need a sequel to Cars and a prequel to Monster's Inc.? It started to look like Pixar was steering away from the kind of bold and brilliant storytelling that had earned its audience trust. With Inside Out, Pixar tackles the intricacies not of the secret world of toys, bugs, monsters, or sea life, but of the human brain itself and our embattled emotions, finding new ways to wow us once again and remind us just how magical the right combination of story and storyteller can be. Inside Out is a luminescent piece of filmmaking, brimming with intelligence, imagination, and powerfully moving while also being deeply relatable and entertaining. In looking inward, Pixar has found the path out of their recent rut, and Inside Out is a shining example of their ingenuity. Inside 11-year-old Riley is a complex world. Five primary emotions help oversee her day-to-day functions; they're the caretakers of Riley. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) is the effervescent leader of the bunch, along with Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), and Anger (Lewis Black). These five are entrusted with Riley's well being and her memories. Riley's core memories, the moments that make up who she is, help to form personality islands: honesty, hockey, goofball, and family. Riley and her family have recently moved from Minnesota to San Francisco, and Riley's having a hard time adjusting. Her parents don't know what's happened to the daughter they knew. Sadness seems to be \"tainting\" Riley's memories, and Joy tries her best to keep Riley happy at all times. Joy and Sadness get accidentally sucked away wrestling over Riley's core memories. They're sent to the outer reaches where the aisles of long-term memories are vast. The two emotions have to work together to get back to headquarters before the remaining emotions convince Riley to run away from home. Even just reading that again, it's easy to see how complicated this movie can be with its world building and internal logic, and yet under the guidance of director Pete Doctor (Up) and his writers, the movie is at no point confusing. Pixar once again does an amazing job of guiding you through a new world and its various parts, all while expanding and complicating this environment while staying true to its internal logic and keeping an audience properly oriented. I can't imagine many screenwriters would be able to tell this story while still being as clearly understood. The simplicity of the story, the ease to follow along, the natural development and connection of the storylines and characters coming together, is the greatest credit one can offer. It's ostensibly a buddy adventure film like many Pixar tales, as the unlikely team of Joy and Sadness having to find their way back to headquarters and learning important life lessons along the way. It's also a smart way to explore the various other elements at work in Riley's brain. It's not just an interesting descent but each new station further opens up Riley as a character. Her subconscious (and fear of clowns), her dream theater projections, her working abstract concepts, all tie back together in satisfying ways. Though the greatest side character is unquestionably Riley's former imaginary friend, Bing Bong (voiced by Richard Kind). He's wandering around her memories, and at first you have your suspicions, but then you realize, like the other characters, that he just wants what's best for Riley. Coming to terms with the fact that Riley has moved on, and his time, while cherished, is now left behind, is a complete character arc, and that's for a comic side character. Oh, and if you're like me, Bing Bong's conclusion just wrecked your tear ducts. You know you've watched an impactful film when even thinking back on moments starts the process of tears welling in your eyes. It's somewhat strange to think about characters as ephemeral as emotions and imaginary friends and the like, but they really work on two levels: the emotions themselves are exaggerated figures with distinct points of view but they also better inform the whole of Riley. There's a depth there that gets even more impressive the more you analyze the creative process. What's also impressive is the vial message of the movie, which is that growing up is hard and that being sad is okay. Seriously, the journey of Joy is to accept that being sad isn't necessarily an emotion to minimize but a vital part of being human and an essential process. Much of the conflict that drives Riley is her avoidance of being sad, her postponement of accepting her real feelings and accepting that San Francisco is not going to be like her old home. It's also a realization that to be a fully functioning person, you have to own the sadness in life. When Riley eventually unburdens herself of all her troubles and fears, and the tears flow, that's when the healing can begin, and that's when her parents swarm in for the group hug, and even now my eyes are starting to water. Damn you, Pixar. Don't be mistaken by my words thus far, Inside Out is also a wonderfully funny and inventive comedy. The sense of discovery with the movie is alive and well, and each new revelation of Riley's inner mind adds to the fun. The jokes are consistently paced. The vocal cast is expertly chosen and each emotion gets some good jokes. There's a terrific running gag about a catchy jingle that the memory workers just enjoy kicking back and forth for their own impish amusement. The film dives into other minds other than Riley's, including both parents trying to communicate during a family dinner meant to soothe their daughter. It doesn't lean too heavily on tired gender stereotypes when it comes to the differing thought processes of men and women, which is a relief. During the end credits, we zoom into the mind of a schoolteacher, a bus driver, and a dog and a cat, and it's an enjoyable way to leave the theater and gather yourself emotionally. The greatest comic asset is Joy, particularly as voiced by Poehler. As fans of TV's Parks and Recreation can attest, Poehler can make insufferable optimism endearing, tap toeing around what should be annoying and instead finding stronger comic rhythms. If you're looking for the closest thing to an antagonist, it's Joy who got the whole mess started and yet we don't ever really side against her. Part of that is because she's not doing what she does as some weird power play but because she wants what, she thinks, is best for Riley. The other part is because Poehler is such a skilled vocal performer. If I had to find some point to quibble, the world isn't as beautifully realized in a visual sense as other Pixar classics. I think this was a deliberate decision to ground what is such an unusual environment into something a little more familiar and less flashy. I also don't think that Disgust seems as well articulated as a necessary emotion. She's well played by Kaling but her application seems lacking in comparison to the other four main emotions. It's remarkable that the summer is still young and already we have two instant classics in theaters; first Mad Max: Fury Road and now Pixar's Inside Out. I'm still riding high from my screening, but I'd feel safe to call this a top-three Pixar film. I wouldn't even begrudge those who cite it as their best. Far more than a big screen version of the 90s comedy Herman's Head (anybody remember this one?), this is an exceptional animated film that will appeal to all ages but, I suspect, hit adults even harder than their little ones. It's a wonderfully poignant film about the struggles of growing up, of holding onto your past definitions of yourself, of accepting the full barrage of emotions, including the necessity of sadness. It's relatable in many aspects and this further compounds its power. It's dazzling with its creativity, it left me cackling with laughter (a superb Chinatown reference almost had me fall out of my chair), and it left me weeping at various points. Inside Out is a return to form. This is the Pixar we remember.Nate's Grade: A",

    "review": "  While the trailers didn't manage (or maybe didn't even try, because they left me entirely indifferent) to grasp the entire concept of the latest Pixar adventure, the movie needs mere seconds to sell the audience on its premise: Emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust) are working hard in their headquarters inside our heads. Dreams are made in a film studio nearby. Imagination is a wild amusement park. Our character traits and interests are like islands that have to be maintained. The train of thought runs through it all. Our memories are marbles in the color of the emotion we connect with them.This concept is as simple as it is brilliant and beautifully solved here. The design of this entire world is absolutely gorgeous and makes perfect sense in the film's own logic. It wouldn't be Pixar if they didn't manage to create an exciting and deeply moving adventure around this concept.A smart, heart-warming and funny film that may be a little too weird and abstract for the youngest kids. But adults may even get even more from this in exchange. Lovely!",

I grew up with Andy in Toy Story (literally we graduated the same year) and there have been some fantastic movies in the interim, but none quite like Inside Out. On an emotional level this movie hits a home run. Whether you are a kid or an adult this movie really hits home on the human experience, namely our emotions and what we are actually feeling and what makes us ourselves. Not that it's an hour and a half of constant crying or anything; it is also a funny movie, really funny. I think this is impart to the wonderful voice casting. As far as the story line goes it is pretty classic problem, climax, solution, but it's classic because it works. It's well written and keeps moving without rushing. On a different note, I wish I had some background in psychology because I'm very curious to know exactly how accurate their anthropology is. Don't get me wrong, it seems accurate...but I would have to say that it wasn't clear what the role of free will and intellect played along with the emotions. That being said the main character is only an 11 year old so the emotions will be a much bigger player than an adult (we hope). Nonetheless, it's not a documentary, but an incredibly fun, entertaining, and tear jerking movie. For me it goes down as a classic!",

The sad scenes were very sad and at times overpowered the films lighter scenes. The scenes that weren't sad were lots of fun. I loved seeing the emotions controlling Riley, and the scenes that showed Joy and Sadness traveling through different places in her brain. After viewing it in theaters, I was in awe.",

    "review": "  Inside Out feels like the culmination of Pixar's now 20 year feature animation career. It illustrates quite literally the value of embracing all of one's emotions, especially sadness, to live a fulfilling life. From what I have observed, that seems to be a central message in most of Lasseter and Co.'s stories. I really can't say enough about this film. The casting, acting, art direction, character design, dialogue, pacing, score, EVERYTHING is just dynamite. The final gag sequence is enough to make it a classic alone.",

Inside Out has so much originality and heart to it, that is almost impossible for me to believe that this movie did not get a Best Picture nomination. The animation is gorgeous, the characters are terrific, it's hilarious, and it will make you cry for sure. Arguably the best animated movie of the decade so far.",

I began to lose hope.BUT THEN IT FINALLY CAME OUT!This is the best animation movie of the year. I'm sure it will win an Oscar - if not, two Oscars. The concept of the story and the world-building were very good. So good, you just have to love it only from seeing the trailer. Especially the cast, the entire cast are comedians. They are so great - because comedians make the best from their mouth. The tear-jerking moment was not cheap. When you hear the scoring, oh - how relaxing it was.Pixar gave me an adversary for my expectation mind. They really feed its hunger. The hunger for good movies.The verdict:My only complaint is the time for this movie to come out in Indonesia, other than that, I could tell you, you wouldn't waste your money on something THIS good.",

However, when her family move from the mid-west to San Fransisco Riley suddenly finds her life thrown into disarray, with Joy and Sadness (through a set of circumstances that I'm not going to go into here) find themselves out of 'Headquarters' (the control room from which everything is run) and have to (somehow) find their way back.

    "review": "  Disney Pixar's latest classic \"Inside Out\" stars Joy and Sadness as your main emotions you'll be feeling when watching the film, alongside with Fear in a form of worry in a minor role of your emotions throughout this wonderful, inventive experience.Twenty years ago, Pixar made themselves well-known by creating the first ever computer animated film in the animated genre of film, \"Toy Story\". From then on, Pixar has shared various wonderful stories in different areas and sizes, but their grandness was constant throughout. Their best originality belongs to \"Brave\" while their best film belongs to \"Toy Story 3\". Now it didn't seem that \"Toy Story 3\" would be dethroned when it has that much heart on growth, while \"Brave\" however shows a possibility that it might get dethroned sometime eventually, even if it consists a heartwarming side while being a great fantasy flick. But now, those two films have gotten dethroned by Pixar's latest fun masterpiece \"Inside Out\".\"Inside Out\" explores an imaginative/creative, thought-provoking concept of our emotions inside of our heads that takes care of us on how we express ourselves and think. The film centers on an 11-year-old girl named Riley, who's going through what any kid would go through: leaving your hometown and old friends behind because one of your parents got a better job at a faraway city. To Riley's parents, she's a happy girl who's a bundle of joy to them. As she adjusts to her new life at a new place while trying to make new friends, as it's a usual routine for a kid to experience, her emotions are there to take care of her.According to the film, there are five basic emotions: joy, sadness, fear, anger and disgust. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) makes sure that Riley's happy, positive, spirited and having fun, and optimistic if possible. Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith) brings the tears and sadness out of Riley's eyes, but she hasn't discover her purpose like the other emotions have their purposes in Riley's life. Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) keeps Riley safe from anything that'll cause harm or would hurt her, physically or mentally (i.e. nightmares). Anger (voiced by Lewis Black) makes sure that Riley's life is fair in a way that she'll be in modes of disapproving and being argumentive or just simply negative without positivity. And finally Disgust (voiced by Mindy Kaling) keeps Riley from anything that'll \"poisoned\" her physically or mentally, or simply just providing judgement and common sense.The way things work is that the five physical forms of Riley's emotions controls her mind (Joy's the captain in Riley), and whatever actions they make, it becomes a memory orb (and Joy's done most of the memories). Furthermore, whatever memory that builds Riley's personality, it becomes a core memory and creates an island that holds that personality from the memory. That's where the complicating action comes in when Sadness touched one of them, and the Joy-ful memory becomes a sad one. As Joy's trying to fix whiny Sadness's mistake, it leads to a mishap of the core memories on the loose and were sucked to where long-term memories are located, with both Joy and Sadness sucked along as well. While Joy and Sadness are on the reflective, explorative journey back to their headquarters, it was now up to Fear, Anger and Disgust to help Riley, which led into not-so-good consequences sense Joy isn't around to put a smile on Riley's face.It's not really a near-tearjerker sad like the ending of \"Toy Story 3\" and the duration of Ghibli's latest \"When Marnie was There\", but it's truly sad. It would genuinely garner tears from different viewers who'll watch this and would shed some tears or one. The emotional level from the perspective Riley's life is like a coming-of-age at a young age adjusting her new life in the city. Also, speaking of coming-of-age, you'll feeling worry for Riley as what she's going through, outside of her and inside of her, during Joy's absence (which is why Fear has the minor role of the \"Inside Out\" viewing experience).But besides those two emotions, the obvious reason why Joy is the main star of both the film and the experience is enjoying what the film has to offer: fun comic and a great, typical, cute heartwarming emotion. Joy's spirit seen in the film was both made perfectly by Amy Poehler's performance, while expressed with gorgeous animation that covers the whole film as Pixar's best job well done since \"Toy Story 3\". The film also builds up to a powerful meaning after some reflections and explorations through more creative ideas under the concept.There's no doubt that this film would win Best Animated Feature, despite the upcoming releases of \"The Peanuts Movie\", which ought to be great as well, and Pixar's second treat \"The Good Dinosaur\", which was postponed from last year. It's also the top contender of Best Original Screenplay since out of all the films that were and not yet released this year, I really don't see any of them, or their stories, that would top the five emotions' adventure within a little girl. It could also be nominated for Best Original Score since it'd signified the older magic of Pixar seen in the older classics.\"Inside Out\" is a definite must-see as it provides something thought-provoking that'll keep you thinking about it even though it was imaginative with high creativity that stayed faithful to both the emotions and the mind's process topic of psychology. Director Pete Doctor, who've done \"Monsters, Inc.\" and another emotional tale \"Up\", done a thorough research to make the concept logically work without a missing gap, which makes this his best work by the look of the end result. The end result of this most recent instant animated classic is great like this year's combo of \"Big Hero 6\" and \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\", and it's one of the rarest of all films to be flawless.There's no reason to not like this - or miss this when it's irresistible and lovable - like there's no reason to not have Joy in your life.

Pixar never ceases to amaze me with regards to how they can constantly step up the research and writing game. The reason their movies are so damned good and that all ages can appreciate them is simply - the multi-dimensional writing. This movie broke down the complexities of emotional development - especially around adolescence. For me, this could not have come at a more perfect time given the ages of my daughters. if you have young daughters, it will prepare you - if you have older daughters, it will help explain some things.",

The voice casting is superb, and the animation is golden as always, but its premise sets it apart. I can't think of a film that has examined the human mind in such a unique yet strangely accurate way.

    "review": "  I don't think I've ever been this excited to see an animated film. Maybe since it's a Pixar film and that it was in the hands of Pete Docter, who did Up and Monsters, Inc. which I thought were absolutely wonderful. I love films that take on a subject matter about growing up and how it focuses on the mental development of a child. And for Pixar to take on that subject matter, I got even more excited. Words cannot describe how much I adore Inside Out. There are so many things to talk about this film it's hard where to even start. Probably why I love the film so much is that it covers virtually everything I wanted to be done with this concept. I wanted to see how Riley lived her life as a child, how her emotions control the situations in her life, how she interacts with her friends and family, and see how she lets out her emotions. The film covers all of those things and it is executed perfectly.I know that the idea of people controlling the inside of your head has been done many times before. But taking that idea and putting it in a whole new interesting direction by incorporating it in a story about a young girl growing up is what makes this film original, which is what we love to see from Pixar. The amount of creativity and imagination the film has is unbelievable and how they utilize it with the story is absolutely ingenious. It also makes for some really funny jokes. The thing about the film is that, comparing it to other Pixar films, they aren't throwing that many jokes at you. But when they do, it is some of Pixar's funniest. The jokes are so incredibly clever, so well put together, a lot are actually very subtle, and they made me laugh so hard. There's too much creativity involved in the film for me to go into. Michael Giacchino's score has become one of my favorites from him. His soundtrack is very reminiscent of the mind, there's a lot of variety, and it carries the whole film. The film is also incredibly colorful. It has a really vibrant color scheme that makes the film's atmosphere feel very lush. I don't think I've seen a film have this much color. I really love the contrast of the amount of color between the mind and the real world, making it easier to differentiate between them. I also love how the colors in the real world became more bland when they move to San Francisco to be used as a metaphor of how the color has been sucked out of Riley's life. The characters are all so adorable and very relatable. It could've been so easy to make the emotion characters one-dimensional since they're supposedly meant to express only one emotion. But they give them more fleshed out personalities and interesting arcs that helps us connect with them more while also making them more identifiable. Some people may find it weird that they can somehow express more than one emotion, but it's never said that they're unable to do so. The emotion characters portray their particular emotion so well, and they had me very entertained the whole time. Credit must be given to the perfect, and I mean PERFECT, cast! Let alone Lewis Black as the voice of Anger! You couldn't have picked better actors to play these roles. The animation on the emotions is extremely well done. It adds even more character to them and also makes their personalities as well as the setting of the mind even more identifiable. The character arc on Joy makes her especially relatable. She starts out selfish, takes control of everything, and thinks that being happy all the time will straighten everything out, which we can easily think the same thing. But she eventually becomes aware that Sadness is very important, and that acknowledging sad moments will make you feel and appreciate the joyful moments even more, like how we will find that awareness later in life. But my favorite character in the film is actually Riley. I think she is one of the best kid characters of all time. They really made her feel like a real person. She's just your normal everyday girl who's growing up. She goes through the same hardships that everyone else goes through in that period of adolescence, so we can easily relate to her based on what she does and how she feels.Since it is a film about emotions, the most important aspect of the film is that it should have a lot of emotional depth. They really accomplished that aspect. This film has some of the most emotional moments in any Pixar film, or maybe in any film! Maybe I'm exaggerating a little, but there were some scenes that really got me. (SPOILER ALERT) There's the scene where Joy learns the importance of Sadness. We see Joy remembering all the forgotten happy memories and she shows how much she loves Riley and her being happy. When she says \"I just wanted Riley to be happy\" and then just breaks down crying, you understand why Joy had a somewhat harsh attitude towards Sadness because Joy really cares about Riley like she was her own daughter and she never wanted her to feel sad. The way they utilize the moral about the importance of Sadness is absolutely brilliant! And it's mostly done with just a visual representation. It is such a meaningful message for children nowadays because they need that acknowledgement in order to survive. Being happy all the time isn't always the solution to the hardships of growing up and that it's okay to be sad sometimes. I have to admit, that scene managed to get me a little teary-eyed. But believe me, I usually never cry in movies. Then there's the scene that pretty much everyone cried at was the selfless sacrifice of Riley's imaginary friend, Bing Bong. The disappearance of Bing Bong is a perfect metaphor of having to let go of something that was a big part of your childhood, which is necessary for us to keep us mentally healthy. I wasn't quite as devastated as everyone else was, but I was still genuinely moved. And then there's the scene where Riley tearfully admits to her parents how much she misses her old home. Again, I have to admit, this scene legitimately made me cry. Throughout the course of the film, we have related to Riley and we've grown to really care about her. She hasn't been showing how she really feels about her new life and the stress of the situation is effecting her mental stability. When she eventually had to confess she couldn't help but let her feelings out, which makes us relate to her and feel for her even more. The tears streaming down her face, her sniffling, and her breaking voice as she remembers her old life makes for an extremely affecting scene. I felt for Riley so much at this point that I just wanted to give her a hug. Her parents acknowledge that this a really sad moment for Riley and they needed to console her, and she cries into her parents arms. Then Sadness and Joy take control of Riley together, and we see Riley smiling again through her tears creating a new amalgamated and bittersweet core memory. Such a sweet, touching, and meaningful scene. They executed that scene so incredibly well.Honestly, the only nitpick I have with the film is that I wanted to see even more of how the mind works. There are so many opportunities you can do with this concept that I think it could've been explored a little more. But that's a really small nitpick, they can't cover everything. It's still very impressive how much they've covered. I really want to see Pixar make a franchise with this because there are just so many more ideas and opportunities. Like in the Toy Story franchise where we see Andy growing up, I can see them make an Inside Out franchise where we see Riley growing up. The ending kind of indicates a potential sequel, and if they do make one I'm all for it. I want to see more! I wanted to review this film in depth because I want to explain why this film means so much to me. Watching it, I feel like I'm bettered as a person. It came out at a perfect time for me. I was under a lot of stress at the time, and the film taught me that this is a normal part of life and it's best to just deal with it. You're allowed to let your emotions out when you need to. Inside Out has become not only my favorite film of the year, not only my favorite Pixar film, I've considered it as being one of my top ten favorite films of all time! With the exception of Fantasia, it has become my all time favorite animated film. That's how much I love it. That's how much it affected me. This movie will always hold a place in my heart.",

    "review": "  Spoilers Ahead. Don't Read until you see the film. Celebrating 20 incredible years of CGI motion pictures, PIXAR has blown us away. Inside Out is a hilariously inventive, intelligent, emotionally moving masterpiece, a profound, masterfully crafted landmark that's perfect in every level. Directed by mastermind Pete Doctor, director of Monsters.Inc and Up, Inside Out exceeds his previous films, and probably cooking up the most bizarre, yet most gorgeous Pixar film yet. This new classic will certainly attract moviegoers of old and young, and the glorious amount of pure brilliance and attention to detail is all but too much to discover in just one viewing, because it's a rare film that will age brilliantly with time, as the whole experience improves the more viewings you give.Premise/Setting: The premise is no less of absolute genius, even from PIXAR. The world of Inside Out takes place in the mind of a young girl, where she is powered by 5 emotions who must guide her to the discoveries of life.  If told by other studios, they would just settle to just her emotions. But PIXAR takes the premise and goes an almighty step beyond, and instead creates an entire world inside her mind. Every day, the girl's head receives orbs, each orb is her memories, where they will go to long-term memory. However, the most important memories go straight to the core memories, and each core memory would power an island, each island that would power the girl's personality. The girl's mind would feature various locations, that would power and create her dreams, thoughts, and imaginations. World-building in this film is absolutely brilliant, taking a step beyond from other ideas. 10/10Story/Script: In the vibrant life in Minnesota, Riley, 11 years old, is enjoying a wonderful life, with wonderful parents, great friends, and a winning hockey team. Riley is power by 5 emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. However, Riley and her parents are moving to San Francisco, shocking the emotions, who must do their best to guide her to her new life the best way they can. However, one day, her core memories were removed, and Joy and Sadness get sucked out of headquarters, and now the two must get back to headquarters and fix Riley, before it's too late, all without a villain or antagonist. From the the minds of the glorious Monsters.Inc, and Up, PIXAR proudly presents a story that every other studio would dare, leaving its rivals in the dust.  In a world, full of unnecessary sequels, adaptations, and remakes, we finally get an original story that is completely void of clich�s, villains, and explosions, and instead relying on sharp wit, vibrant characters, and most importantly heart. The film is genuinely and unbelievably creative, taking the simple but effective story, to their advantage. PIXAR goes one step beyond, delivering a hilariously moving experience, but one that is emotionally driven, gorgeously animated, and masterfully written. If it were done by a different studios, instead of going for their gut, would go for the easy route, and underwhelm the gorgeous idea, with a cheap story, forced cruelty, lame jokes, dated trendy slangs, and pop music that so many non-PIXAR films strive for. Instead, PIXAR gives it all, taking risks and inspiring people to strive for excellence, and is treated like an adult film, with dark tones, sharp wit, dry humor, and sophisticated writing. Inside Out builds upon what tools it has, and wows us like all their other films. The most impressive element of the film is the world building. We have headquarters, were our emotions live and work. We don't just remain entirely on headquarters, but outside is entirely different new world. We have a labyrinth where all long-term memories travel. Train of Thought, were all of Riley's thoughts are transferred to headquarters. Imagination Land were all of Riley's imaginations are created. Dream Productions, a Hollywood-like locations where dreams are created. And the Abyss, a dark pit where all unwanted memories crumble, die off, and are forgotten. These world's are so gorgeous and imaginative, it makes you want to go inside someone's head and explore. The film always remember the audience and on what they want. One of the film's strengths is it's comedy. Like other PIXAR films, they have written comedy of many kinds, they will strike the minds of anyone. You'll be laughing your ass off, by what they have made, and it's just as impressive as the story itself. However, what truly moved me most is it's human touch. PIXAR has once again takes us to the next level, making us cry buckets, and change the way we think of our mind.  PIXAR films since the early years have always been constructed with a great story, ones that are fun and enjoyable. But PIXAR goes one step beyond. If you look at every PIXAR film to the core story, they are not simple: their stories are universally adult topics. If you put them all together, PIXAR films are a continuing series of books; each and every PIXAR film representing a topic of all but one universal theme: The Human Condition. In this film, there are numerous topics such as learning to let go of what you left behind and moving on, but most importantly: learning how to embrace Sadness. So often, people try to avoid being sad, but have so often forget that sadness at one point, will be one of, if not the most important emotion of their life. It's a message so profound, so deep, but mostly so complex that you will never see a DreamWorks, or even a Disney film embrace such a message or concept. A concept very difficult to market and so risky, that other studios would never explore. But that's whats makes PIXAR groundbreaking, because they take risks in exploring deep, universal concepts in the most profound, entertaining, and highest quality possible. As fun and exciting as it is, Inside Out is brave enough to deliver something that is not only profound, but will wreck you with sequences and themes, that are incredibly dark, and emotionally heartbreaking. It is a story of emotions who must discover the dark and gritty realities of leaving behind what you love and starting fresh. We get to see Riley go through an identity crisis, as her emotions are struggling to keep her functioning properly, and from her on then, and we learn that it's okay to be sad, because in the end, we are all energies of life that need emotions, because it whats makes us human. It is even more impressive that, in the end, there is no villain. There is no bad guy or antagonist that tries to stop Riley or her emotions. It's just a simple story about vibrant emotions interacting with their new life, and that is more entertaining and intriguing than big robots who want to destroy the world, the plot that so many blockbuster films use nowadays, but thankfully this film doesn't use.  In the end, the film's inventive story, masterfully crafted script, and emotionally moving heart, rivals the best live-action films in the last 20 years, all in just 94 minutes. 10/10Animation/Visual Effects: What's a PIXAR film without groundbreaking animation. With PIXAR's industry-standard technology, an astonishing $175 million budget, and the world's greatest animators, Inside Out incorporates some of the most gorgeous animation in history. Everything is done with top-quality detail, with photorealistic textures, blending with stylistic designs and settings. The use, style and tones of animation are exhibited brilliantly in this film. First we have 2 worlds: The Human World, and Riley's mind. Both worlds contrast each other beautifully, and looking like two completely different but gorgeous films.  First lets talk about the Human World. The Human World is a very interesting topic. First we have 2 primary settings. We have Minnesota: portraying itself as heaven with bright colors, and a happy undertones. However, Riley and her family move to San Francisco. San Francisco is supposed to portray hell, with the isolating undertones, extremely dull colors, and a dark and gritty look; a massive and polar opposite contrast to Big Hero 6's San Fransokyo.  However, the main highlight of the animation and the film is the world inside Riley's mind. This part of the film shows the true potential of the true ambitions and creativity PIXAR is capable of making. The world is filled with bright colors, abstract art style, and pure imagination, that only Pixar can deliver.  The character designs are a true work of art. The emotions perfectly match the look of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery, as they perfectly exaggerate the character animation with Looney Tunes-style comedy, perfecting the use of squash and stretch. It uses abstract character designs that homages the Looney Tunes, but also use sophisticated, and realistic movements to balance the overall feel, because the film remembers to treat it like an ambitious work of animation, and not a dumbed down cartoon. Every emotion is also shaped to represent a certain figure. Joy represents a star; Sadness represents a tear drop; Anger represents a fire brick; Disgust represents a piece of broccoli; and Fear represents a brain nerve. Everything in the films looks gorgeous, proofing that PIXAR delivers the best animation in the world that will blow you away, but you will have to watch and see for yourself. 10/10Characters/Casting: PIXAR can't have a film without any lovable characters. Inside Riley's mind lie our film's main stars. Inside her mind lies Joy, played by Amy Poehler. Sadness, played by Phyllis Smith. Anger, played by Lewis Black. Disgust played by Mindy Kaling, and Fear, played by Bill Hader. One of the most fascinating elements of these characters are the portrayal and concept of these characters. They aren't one dimensional or simplistic. It's actually unbelievably surprising by how complex and genuine they are. If you really get to the core of the characters, each emotion is made up of multiple emotions, In fact, the film's original story consist up to 27 simple emotions, but somehow were all condensed to 5 core emotions. And instead of being simple figures, they are all created as moving shapes of energy with bubbly textured skin. And they are all hilarious as s%^t. Casting was perfectly chosen. Instead of finding celebrities by popularity, PIXAR has chosen stellar actors that perfectly match the tone, which is what an actor is suppose to do. They are all naturals. Amy Poehler's happy goody persona works perfectly with Joy. Phyllis Smith's has truly brought us the sadness in Sadness. Lewis Black has brought Anger to life, who's performance is stellar. Mindy Kaling has brought Disgust and nailed the emotion. Bill Hader is a natural as Fear, delivering one of his best roles yet. The casting is nailed. However what made these characters human is their relations with each other. Living in a young girl's mind, you always wonder, what do they look like? How do they act? What do they think? And how do they interact with each other. It's what make this film a classic. These characters all interact with each other, and solve their problems together, and the act like what emotions they are, and they all serve one main goal: guide Riley to her new life.  What makes PIXAR film's classics is their abilities to take bizarre characters, and make them real, and let the audience understand these characters. These emotions are all so relatable. And they are unbelievably human, because we all know what it's like to feel what they're feeling. We know how Joy feels when she get excited. Anger knows how we can feel when we don't get what we want. Disgust knows when something is good or bad like us. Fear wants to protect Riley, and gets scared when he sees something scary, and we all know what's it's like when we get scared. Sadness cries, and always thinks about the memories that are sad, because it's okay to be sad when we need to. Each emotion represents a certain element of our personality and how we feel, because in the end, these characters are real. We do get happy. We get sad. We get angry. We get scared. And we get grossed out. These characters represent each emotion we feel, and they're in all in our heads. In fact, these characters are more human and believable than most live actors in many other films, and that is saying a lot. Although, there is a special character so profound and lovable, you will have to watch the film to meet him. 10/10 Inside Out is a profound, hilarious, inventive, ambitious, and emotionally fueled piece of storytelling that proves the PIXAR is practically the greatest studio of all time that repeatedly churns out masterfully crafted classics, that will define not just your childhood, but your life in general. Inside Out is a perfect example of how animation is not a kiddie genre, but a crucial art form that can be just as profound and incredible as live-action.  Bravo PIXAR, for bringing us the best film of the summer. Here's praying The Good Dinosaur is just as terrific as this film. 10/10.",

    "review": "  It's hard to be a kid. It's hard to be an adult as well. But when things go wrong for adults, they can use logic and assessment and other analytical tools they've learned and possibly sharpened over the years to gauge what went wrong and why and how it can be avoided next time. When things go wrong for a child, things have just gone wrong. It's cruel and unfair and seems to serve no purpose beyond making their lives miserable for that moment in time. Luckily, kids are pros at bouncing back. I've seen my own children get madder or sadder than they've ever been and thirty seconds later, they're laughing and playing and the trauma is forgotten. Not so with adults. With adults, when something we perceive as traumatic happens to us, for many of us, it sticks. It's hard to shake and takes little to bring it bubbling to the surface again. If Inside Out was a movie about the voices in my head, it would be a much, much different movie than the one Pixar has made here. I don't sense that there's as much harmony in my head as there is in the head of Inside Out's Riley. But that's one of the film's many strengths. It stars a normal girl. An everygirl, if you will. She's not gorgeous, or rich. She's not the daughter of a diplomat or a superhero. She doesn't have superpowers herself, and her favourite thing to do is play hockey. Not exactly a rare breed up here in Canada. What makes Riley special is what she's made of. It's what's inside that count. And what's inside Riley are five emotions that determine how every day will go. The goal of the five emotions seems to be to create good memories. That's the goal for Joy anyway. And keeping Anger, Fear, Disgust, and especially Sadness at bay is a full time job. As Riley starts to grow up and things start to change, like moving to a new city and having to start everything over again (boy, do I know what that's like), some of her emotions, Sadness in particular, are finding themselves compelled to complicate Riley's joyful manner. When Joy and Sadness are sucked from Mind Control into Long Term Memory, they have to try to find their way back to Riley before she loses all her Personality Islands and becomes a bitter shell of nothingness. Pixar has always been fantastic at making their films ageless. For adults, there are deep thoughts and ideas in this movie, things that will make you think and feel. Certainly laugh, maybe cry. And it presents the most complex area of human physiology (the brain), in an educational, imaginative way that is easy to understand. But if you bring your three year old to the film, they will have just as good a time as you. Because the film is also a colourful, exciting, action packed ride about things we all go through as early as our earliest memories are formed. Another masterstroke of Inside Out is in its casting. It may seem obvious once you've seen the movie, but whoever first thought to hire Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Mindy Kaling, Bill Hader and Lewis Black, as Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger, respectively, was a genius. Think about it. Think about what emotion each of these actors reminds you of and then try to imagine anyone else voicing those characters in the film. It might be the best casting of the year. At the end of the day though, Pixar's greatest achievement with this movie, for me anyway, is helping me to realize a very important thing about the emotions which guide us in our day to day. Which is that every emotion we feel, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Disgust, are there for a reason. They're all important and they all have a purpose and a function and they all work together to make us who we are. Sometimes you need to be sad before you can be happy. Sometimes you need to be afraid before you can safe. Or angry, or disgusted. There's nothing wrong with being any of those things at certain times. After all, how will you know you've had a good day if you've never had a bad one? Now if only I could get those other emotions to suck themselves out of my Mind Control and get lost in Long Term Memory. You hear that Judgement, Envy, Anxiety and Low Self Worth? Nobody likes you! Get lost!Verdict: Inside Out is the full package. A movie about emotions that will put your own through the ringer. It's big, it's bright, it's fast paced and fun and deep in a way most animated films are not. One of the best films of the year and one of the best Pixar films ever.",

But Inside Out just might in the top spot, it no only a fresh, not original but spectacularely clever animation movie, it might not be the funniest or the most visually impressive but the animation is gorgeous and what it does is so powerfull, and moving, that you can't help but find your inner child and treasure it for movies such as these. Inside Out follows the five emotion of girl named Riley, and how they direct her to cope with changes in her life, and how could i forget about the outstanding voice acting from the leads, special notion to Lewis Black as Anger there couldn't be a more perfect casting. Adventurous, funny, and unsurprisingly \"emotional\". Pixar you did it again.",

    "review": "  I almost don't know what to say. I was told this is in the front-running to really be Pixar's greatest yet; of course I was slightly dubious.But I'm still awestruck. Inside Out is absolutely incredible - pacing, tone, story, characters (both human and emotional), message... The only thing I have to kind of complain about is the visual representation of the abstract parts of the way a brain works leaving like a couple stones unturned (but it's not enough to affect my overall opinion of the film). It really delivered.I just loved it so much! The story is set up so quickly in an easy way to comprehend, so the inner workings of Riley's (the girl human main character) mind make sense as layers of new aspects of thinking kind of mix into the way the story progresses. I think the shining triumph, and this is Pixar's strength in all their films, is that the film is such a stripped down concept of a person growing up and coming to grips with their feelings that it applies to every person. Adults see themselves in Riley's parents (and probably in Riley as well) and younger kids obviously are coming to terms with many of the same things we see Riley deal with throughout the film - so the concept really lends itself to being related to from almost all points of view.The voice cast is stellar - Amy Poehler leads the charge like a champ and the casting is so extraordinarily appropriate and fitting that you don't question it ever while watching. A really well thought-out group to bring base emotions to life.The lead-in short, Lava, also put me in a really emotional state before Inside Out began so it served as a really great primer for the emotional paces the feature presentation teed off with. A great short on its own as well!I honestly can't put my enjoyment into words, Inside Out really is at least Top 3 in Pixar's catalog to date. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh through your tears from crying - the film really hits every base. Such a great return to form, really can't wait for The Good Dinosaur now, knowing what great development brought Inside Out to life.Get your butt to that theater! Take everyone with you! Inside Out deserves your attention!",

I was given the chance to attend Ronnie del Carmen's talk about Inside Out (too bad Pete Docter wasn't there!) and I could really see the tremendous passion and effort (and pixie dust) it took to create this one of a kind and one of the most imaginative movies I've ever seen. When I was young, I also thought that there were different personalities inhabiting inside my mind but I never envisioned the intricate \"laws\" the mind had unlike the Pixar team. The casting was perfect, the storyline was close to flawless (okay maybe not all but you never noticed the minor flaws like how Broccoli was the only culprit vegetable but never mind...) and it had a lot of heart. This was actually more of a movie for adults in the sense Toy Story 3 was also targeted more at adults as well. I just reallly loved it. It's definitely a movie that I'll never get tired of watching. So kudos Pixar team, what a great cinematic artwork you've given us.",

It's not perfect by any means - it works better on paper than in actual execution in some ways, but it was enjoyable, and darker than one might expect.",

The story follows an 11-year old girl named Riley as she adjusts to a recent move from Minnesota to San Francisco; and helping her are her core emotions Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear, but when an accident ejects Joy and Sadness from the control center of Riley's mind she starts to suffer an emotional breakdown. The voice casting is really well-done, particularly Amy Poehler as Joy and Lewis Black as Anger. And the animation is amazing; with extraordinarily creative designs for how the mind is structured and visualized. Another Pixar triumph, Inside Out is a fun and entertaining family film that has a surprisingly touching message.",

    "review": "  Pixar is back, and this return could not be better, because that good old magic of his films that picked us up in his many classics, that magic came back and at full strength I would say. Everything about this film is genial more'll try to explain to you the contents of this masterpiece. The main thing to say is that this is the most creative idea that Pixar ever had and also the most well executed. What they did was create a whole universe about how our mind works, all through a 11 year old girl named Riley and their primary emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust. Riley is headed by Joy, then her life has always been very happy, until one day she and her family move because his father got a new job. There are many changes and adaptations that this girl has to go, and then her emotions do not know how they will keep it normal as before, there comes a very serious accident, and Joy and Sadness end up accidentally leaving the control booth, where they operate her mind, and they will have to return quickly to save the consciousness of Riley. First of all this emotion and even Riley themselves are extraordinary characters, and all are dubbed with extreme talent all over the voice cast that includes Amy Poehler, Lewis Black, Phyllis Smith, Mindy Kalling and Bill Hader, all very well in their performances. But the highlight of the film is the script, it is not only intelligent but also well written and full of great ideas, why we forget something we do not want or why horrible songs stick in your head are all things so complex explained as simply and efficiently as possible. Of course do not forget that as animation of Pixar, the film has a very relevant message to our society about dealing with depression, and it also moves a lot, so much that in the most exciting or saddest moments, you will get enough heartbroken or even crying, in my case I cried like hell right, there is a scene in particular that left me totally touched, and if you do not at least get emotional, you have no heart, there are times when I did not cry in a movie, it really was a lot of emotions for a movie alone. Technically the film is all that is expected of it, after all this studio is synonymous with quality in this matter, so the visuals are gorgeous, especially in the use of colors representing every moment of the film, for example in happy times everything is strongly colored, already in sad moments to darker shades. The characters are visually beautiful and visual concept of the scenery is stunning, everything seems very real even the appearance being somewhat cartoonish within the Riley mind. The soundtrack is delightful, another victory for Michael Giacchino now shown in other films like the latest \"Jurassic World\" or \"Up\", which won the Oscar. It is pleasant to hear, has incredible melodies and further helps the film's time to thrill the viewer. As for the 3D movie he's cute as any animation you have, but if you want to dismiss him no problem. Of all the films I saw in 2015, Inside Out is not only one of the best, but was also one of the few where I had high expectations, and they were not only overcome, I saw a film that does not expect to be so striking and profound for me, I felt so much seeing him that is a feeling that I will never forget. For these and other reasons I'm not afraid to say that Inside Out is the best movie of all Pixar, surpassing even the great classics of them and taking shape as one of the best animations of all time. An instant classic that I plan to revisit again and again at home, and already consider the winner of best animated 2015 Oscar and maybe even more than that. Do not miss the opportunity to see it!",

This film was perhaps the most aimed at \"the parents\" of any pixar film, touching upon that very real feeling of loss that we get as we grow older; but also the opportunities that we gain as we leave childhood. As we watch both riley and her emotions attempt to deal with the trauma that is moving home for a young person we take that emotional journey with her. Inside Out, doing what pixar seems best at nowadays, actually achieved the most sobbing i have ever witnessed in a cinema capturing the emotion of \"sadness\" bang on the head.Not seen it yet? Do.

Inside Out features a dynamic and energetic performance by Amy Poehler, a bright and dazzling color palate, and a well developed story that sets the imagination on fire. Written and Directed by twenty-year Pixar veteran Pete Docter (Director: Up, Monsters, Inc.), Inside Out is the studios best picture.I've since rewatched Citizen Kane, Vertigo, The Grand Illusion, and the Godfather to try to find if they contain anything better, and haven't found it. Inside Out is the best film I've ever seen.As a side note, the trailers don't come close to doing the film justice. The marketing department just wasn't up to the daunting task of representing it. Perhaps the best trailer would have been just the first few minutes - with the title at the end, like what The Lion King did for its theatrical spots.",

    "review": "  I am not a professional critic, however, I think this is better. Professional reviewers get the premiers and get perks from studios to rave or trash a movie. I am a simple movie viewer in the real world. I have viewed several movies that the critics trash and are very good movies. I have also seen some that they rave abut and are trash. And some I also agree with. However, this movie. \"Inside Out\" is a MASTERPICE and I agree with the 98% rating of the movie thus far.This is the first movie EVER to make me both laugh and cry at the same time!!The use of real world Psychologists to guide development of this film was a definite plus. They added a touch of familiarity for EVERYONE!!I and my Husband were laughing our asses off as we watched the \"emotions\" in the parent brains react. For a while We thought that was the highlight of the movie. However, In the ending sequences there was a DEFINITE rebound of the humor mixed with some profound sentiments on human emotion!",

Mostly Joy dominates the control, but one peculiar day shatters the ryhthm and set forth the duo adventures to Long Term Memory library.Skywalker Sound works out the post production sound which turns out filling the pitch effects all right. Music in other hand is not too typical Disney theme, but quite speedy and vibrant.Breakdown is a state to breached whenever stress culminated in a harrowing time.

That being said, I'll state for the record that I love this film inside and out. Everything just works in Inside Out. The casting is spot-on, the actors are in top form, the script is rich and innovative, and the animation is perfect.It almost seems like Pixar went with the obvious choices in casting, but these actors are the obvious choices for a reason and I hold this film up as my evidence. Phyllis Smith breaks our hearts as Sadness, Amy Poehler bludgeons us over the head with happiness as Joy (in a good way), and Lewis Black does what we all love him for (ranting and screaming). If one were handed this assignment and told to pick a cast, they could hardly do better. Complementing our phenomenal cast, we've been gifted with perfectly timed and expertly manipulated animation. As they say, timing is everything and Pixar seems to have taken this lesson to heart. One truly feels like they have an appropriate duration with which to soak in the emotion impact of the heavier scenes and appreciate them in their entirety. As if icing on the cake, Pixar has decidedly spoiled us with a great script. Not only does it build up to an emotionally heart-wrenching crescendo, but it also explores concepts of what it means to be human. Exiting the theater, one almost imagines they've just attended a philosophy lecture while warmly embracing their loved ones. In light of its numerous highs, I do need to briefly mentions a weaker point to the film; namely the limited character development for Disgust, Fear, and Anger. In fact, one must wonder why we needed Disgust at all as the character's personality attributes almost nothing to the progression of the storyline. Beyond that, however, none of the above mentioned characters feel like more than wallpaper most of the time. That being said, it is an admittedly minor complaint which takes little way from the enjoyment of this film.Once again, Pixar has blown me away. I'm giving Inside Out 4.5 stars.",

Going into the movie, you probably just expect a fun gimmick about people in a brain controlling a person, but while that's true to an extent, you also get something that is a deep exploration of human emotion, and it gives you a rare look at how that affects us on the inside, which can have a significantly different appearance than what's on the outside. It has a fantastic visual style and creative design behind everything, and it's for sure going to be one of the more memorable Pixar movies, even if I think some of the others were more impressive in other areas.

    "review": "  This movie had far too many flaws. Disney gets an A for trying but a D for execution. For one they established that the emotions are supposed to generally act like the emotions they are. Obviously they are going to feel other things as they are personified but when you establish in the concept in the beginning you need to follow through. In other people's head the emotions act the same and don't show off their actual emotion. Such as the mom's saddness acts more like reasoning and logic than sad. Then the whole build up to the movie is Joy realizing that \"oh my god we need sadness.\" that's played down since a lot of tv shows tell kids the lesson of \"it's okay to be sad.\" and \"other emotions are okay to be felt.\" There was too much build up for just these lessons to actually make it a compelling movie. Maybe these can be excused to a certain degree since it is a childrens movie. But the one thing I can not excuse is the absolute lack of humor in the movie. I like kids movies despite being 19 mostly because they tend to be funny this movie has the worst humor ever. I have never sat through a kids movie with such a straight face, but it was so easy since there was basically nothing funny about this movie I figured if anything anger would make me laugh since Lewis Black is hilarious but he was just so bland. The funniest part was at th every end with the boy she meets and his emotions screaming \"girl!\" This movie gets far too much praise and honestly I think it's because Disney is written on the front.",

How wonderful to see this childish thought made into such a stunning and fun movie. Its colourful, imaginative and funny, for all ages!

In my opinion not enough fuss was made about this wonderful movie and is the best disney production since 'Frozen'",

Joy (Poehler) & Fear (Hader) are good, with Sadness (Smith) being very annoying and Anger (Black) & Disgust (Kaling) not having too much to do. Lots of interesting concepts - how memories are moved to long-term storage, then to the dump so they can fade, the personality islands, the thought trains - but it basically ends up being a film about how sadness is important to have too. Not sure that's revolutionary. It then takes a while for Joy & Sadness to go on a journey to get back to 'headquarters', which is harder than it should be, for some reason, and the film lags a bit. Great animation and a decent story - I'm sure kids will love all the colours and movement.",

While at the surface it looks like a children's tale, \"Inside Out\" strikes that perfect Pixar balance of fun for both adults and kids.The voice performances are superb with Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith as standouts.

Joy (Amy Poehler) naturally wants everything to be happy and feels that the other emotions with her (Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness) get in her way. An incident however causes them to be removed from the control headquarters and they must find their way back through the maze that is the mind to be sure that their host Riley does not continue life without Joy and Sadness. As the two try and return, the other emotions do their best to control the situation at hand. Only through viewing other emotions and memories do they begin to realize that together they form the best team to make Riley a better person. Inside Out is clever at parts, and has some good moments, but for the most part the emotions in my head found this movie to be too short and not as imaginative or interesting as some of its predecessors.",

I didn't enjoy the film at all, in fact I found it irritating. I may be the only one not raving about it, but I think there is cause for concern as to how Inside Out undermines the mind of a person. Firstly, it was a look into the mind of an 11 year old, as if she had no control over any of her emotions, and it was her emotions having control over her, pressing buttons as if she were a robot. It comes across as if we are are at the mercy of our emotions, and we start to doubt ourselves. Second, the animation was suggestive of stereotyping of the emotions. For example, the melancholic \"Sad\" character, was drawn as fat, bespectacled, short, blue and turtlenecked, while Joy, the happy character, was lithe, tall, slim and pretty. This animated film is packed with subtle messages which are detrimental to children's perception of themselves. It shames body types. It shames emotions. It shames the self. Inside Out is neither smart nor emotional. It is dangerous for children and young people.",

The execution of what is really in many ways such a simple premise, but in such an inventive and unique way, is the key to the genius of the film, as both a colourful kids movie, but also something a lot deeper that the more mature audiences members can appreciate and understand as well.On paper, Inside Out certainly may seem to come across as too smart for what should be a simple kids movie. Yet those Disney hallmarks are there to hold your hand; the colourful characters, delightful voice work from the talented cast and typical Disney charm, all remind you that despite some weighty themes and certain heartbreaking moments, Inside Out can still be the fun Disney escapism that you want it to be.",

Either that or I'm becoming really sentimental. *sighAnd, yet, there is so, so, so much to commend this film for. And, not sure about you, but I'm beginning to think that Pete Docter is the best, most imaginative person working at pixar today. Every single one of his films have been masterpieces. Inside Out is no exception. I've always admired pixar for tackling themes that, even by Disney's standards, are complex in a family. Here they tackle them literally head first. I would also attain that Inside Out is easily pixars funniest film, with Sadness' meloncholy and the differences with people's emotions being the highlights of the film.Joy is also brilliant, as her journey through Riley's mind allows her to grow as a character, as well as Riley herself. Her relationship with Sadness is another sheer highlight.Fear, Disgust and Anger provide plenty of great moments, as does Riley's imaginary friend, Bing Bong. What's really spectacular about this film is the world building; the characters, the settings, the situations.I'll be honest: I cannot find a flaw in Inside Out. Not to say that it doesn't have them, only that they are really so insignificant given the broader creativity and sheer ingenuity that everyone involved brings to the picture.",

The voice work is fantastic and the use of colour to evoke emotional response is at times intense.

Following 11 year old Riley and her emotions (Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness) this film explores the psychology of a child in a unique and gratifying way, with simple yet effective messages that will warm the heart of any child or adult. For me the message was quite beautiful that a memory doesn't have one emotion attached to it- it has a plethora of emotions, showcasing how unique and complex we are as individuals. It also tells us that we are allowed to feel joyful or sad etc, and that we shouldn't feel bad for feeling anything that we do because it is human to feel. Without spoiling anything there are a few scenes in the movie that may leave you with a tear in your eye. Pixar effectively gives emotions feelings in this brilliant animated movie.4.5/5",

However, the film retains much of the Pixar formula and it's emotional resonance. The characters Sadness and Bing Bong are the only interesting ones here. Inside out needs to be praised for it's original theme. However, it was slightly short and I don't think I can call it one among the best work from Pixar.",

I would have liked to see more time spent directly on Riley as opposed to the character who represented her emotions. I just didn't feel as invested in the characters as I did to Riley, so it was disappointing that the movie was so wrapped up in those characters.Overall, not a bad movie but not great either. I definitely wouldn't put it on the same level with the Toy Story movies or Up.",

    "review": "  Inside Out is a fantastic film which is one of if not the the best film Pixar has ever made. It tells the story of a 11-year-old girl named Riley who's life turns to chaos as her family moves to San Francisco, and the story is told through the prospective of her emotions personified as characters. Joy, played by Amy Poehler, Sadness, played by Phyllis Smith, Anger, played by Lewis Black, Disgust, played by Mindy Kaling and Fear, played by Bill Hader.Inside Out is fantastic because there seems to be several stories told at the same time. The first is the story of Riley's new life in San Francisco, and the story of the ark that the emotions go through, but when you look at this film in a deeper way, Inside Out is a psychological metaphor for growing up as there are many elements inside of Riley's head that reflects the psychology of our actual brains. Elements such as forgetting, train of thought, long-term memory, subconscious, abstract thought and other things. The movie also takes a serious but not overly dark look on grief, as Joy (Riley's main and most important emotion) has to deal with Sadness. The psychology and metaphors in this movie makes Inside Out extremely clever. If a parent was to see this movie with their kids, the parent and the kids would have very different experiences. The character ark are also well done with the lessons the emotions and Riley has to learn. The movie isn't just excellent with its writing, but its also great as entertainment. The movie is a roller coaster of emotions as there will be scenes you'll be bursting out in laughter and other scenes where you'll be bawling your eyes out. The movie tugs on your emotion and is quite a tear jerker but is evenly split out by being thoroughly funny. The performances by this film's flawless cast are hilarious and uses legit humour about emotions and the mind instead of just pandering to kids. The animation is also gorgeous to look at and is a must own on Blu-ray. There's absolutely no flaws I can give this film. It's personally my favourite film of all time and it's an instant classic. It is highly recommended that if if haven't seen this film than you should see it immediately.I give Inside Out an A+",

The creativity that went into this film is yet another example for why the people at Pixar might be the greatest film makers of all-time. The voice acting was incredible, the visuals were flawless, the characters came alive in realistic ways, the plot was interesting and surprisingly moving, and the concept overall was just genius. The only flaw was that it did drag just a bit towards the middle of the film but that's just my opinion. Overall, I think this is a film that adults might actually enjoy even more than children.",

It's a sky-high concept that could've easily gone wrong, but luckily it turned out to be a tremendously clever ornament of a thing, packed with subtle visual tricks and leitmotifs. Inside Out nevertheless may have more life in it as a discussion topic than as a film - and there's some irony in my having no idea whatsoever what young kids would make of it.",

Pixar succeeds again with a story that both kids and adults can enjoy. The five personified emotions in Riley's head speak a lot of truth. The movie seems to get a lot right psychologically when it comes to memory and childhood development. The bright colors, adventure plot, and deep pathos puts this over the top! Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, and Mindy Kaling are a great ensemble at the brain control center. Richard Kind as Bing Bong, Riley's fun loving imaginary friend, is the heart of the picture. It was an especially smart move to focus on Poehler as Joy and Smith as Sadness as an exploration of what it means to mature. I love that Dave Goelz and Frank Oz of Muppets fame have voice cameos in the subconscious. Cinematic memories and dreams make for an intelligent flick about growing up.",

    "review": "  Pixar does it again! The movie may have not been as fantastic as \"Up\" it's still is a touching incredible experience but who am I to compare it because they are 2 very different films. One of the best films and touching movie of 2015 definitely goes to inside out I was expecting worse from it because of the trailer but I was not disappointed because the movie is funny and it succeeds in being sad. Though it has a few plot holes out of 100 I would rate it definitely in the nineties. One of these reasons being how realistic the emotions of Riley (if you didn't watch the movie the main character) and any child for that matter really acts. In fact Pixar has got some information from child psychiatrists and that makes sense because it's just so good and realistic. For the age group I would suggest 8 or if your child is sensitive 10 because it can get a little sad but if your looking for a good movie for your child this is definety a great one to see.",

    "review": "  Pixar have created some of the best animations that can spring to many a persons mind, Inside Out is an addition that is just as excellent as you might hope it to be. The way in which this movie mixes not just fun but emotion and how we deal with it well it makes this much more profound and adds a lot of meaning. The movie basically is all about Riley, or to be way more specific inside Riley's head with all her emotions being little well, who knows actually, they are just emotions with bodies. Of course the movie isn't all just in Riley's head, we see Riley act out the emotions she feels and how it affects her new life as her and her family start a new life in San Francisco. The movie is crafted how animation should be with vivid colours and great detail, but add to that a sweet story in the middle and you have one absolutely fantastic little film.After the hugely popular \"Up\" in 2009, Pete Docter directs and co-writes a Pixar animation yet again and does a very good job making this look absolutely beautiful. The animation is also in fantastic detail in regards to that this movie is all made up mostly architecture wise with it being majority within Riley's head which contains a mind HQ, A vast array of memories stored and thrown away and even a dream production company who decide what Riley will be dreaming about that night. The film is massive in its scale and yet set in such a small space really; the people behind this really have used imagination to an extent that this must be one of the best thought out animations ever. With the emotions come voice cast like Amy Poehler (Joy), Phyllis Smith (Sadness), Bill Hader (Fear), Mindy Kaling (Disgust) and Lewis Black as Anger who really feels like he is about to swear at any moment he is on screen. The characters are fun but the voice cast are game too and really create a great sense of well character, I loved Poehler as Joy who is basically the main character of this movie but really all the little emotions and all the things living within Riley's mind are great fun and really well thought up. The film has as said a meaning to it, more than just big jumps and rolls and a fun little adventure, sure it has that but it also deals with basically depression which then goes on to show that it can strike anyone of any age however happy they may seem to be. The film of course is no psychoanalysis studies piece but it is on the surface a film that breaks down barriers where really the main character is not always a happy one and does suffer. I really have to applaud the movie for exploring such things which really aren't what you might expect from an animated movie which is let's face it directed toward the kids in society but it does it in a way where anyone of any age can feel for the movie and also find it fantastic.So Inside Out, an animated film that really is something a little special and something I found hard not to love just a little. It also I think can show that not all grown ups are ever fully out of there childhood, this is so fun it is hard not to watch it a little like being a child again and although the young one's will enjoy this, the adults should too. Pixar have yet again created something super fun and actually really important, hats off to the studio for really bringing something new to the animation game and showing that there is plenty of life left in Pixar.",

For example, most of us have felt lots of joy spending time with our families, and we've also felt anger towards our parents as kids at one point. It is such a silly movie because we see the emotions running inside the main character Riley's head throughout the whole movie trying over and over again to save her childhood memories. That is a strong representation of all of us growing up into our pre-teen years.",

A perfectly working formula of laughs, adventures, original ideas, dazzling visuals and family-friendly entertainment, this animation is the clear and obvious favorite for Best Animated Feature for 2015. A concept that would hardly be repeated, the idea of depicting the human brain as a bunch of funny, little, hyper-active creatures called emotions would stay stuck with you for a long time after seeing the movie. Simply because you would be asking yourself, how did the Pixar screenwriters come with it. A story of a young girl and how she copes with her first teen years and her family relocating to San Francisco, Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen's movie offer a most curious take on Riley's ( voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) coming-of-age. A take that is compelling to both major types of audiences, kids and adults and that has the power to entertain equally both parties. Inside Out is an animation which could not just be reviewed or described, as it offers a wonderful and personal experience for everyone who sees t. A must see, this is already an instant classic and could most deservedly be placed among the Top 5 Pixar deliveries ever.",

More suited for adults rather than children, it illustrates its' plot in a way that could easily represent an adult's emotions as well. The stunning visuals that are displayed in the mind of the main character are a new pinnacle for Pixar. The story of Riley and her developing emotions as she grows from infant to early teenager is a clever exercise in human behavioral development. The emotion, Joy, is the main emotion in charge, but is accompanied by Disgust, Sadness, Anger and Fear. When Riley is uprooted from her home in Minnesota to San Francisco, her suppressed sadness sends her emotions and life into a tail spin. I won't give away any more and recommend that you see the movie for yourself. Pixar has long been a high quality powerhouse when it comes to great stories, characters and digital art. \"Inside Out\" has set a new bar for them. Being their longest developed movie thus far, you can tell that they put a lot of thought into it. It is definitely worth a view!",

As Riley grows up, the difficulties and frustrations come to her life waves after waves, making her happy memories gradually become sorrow. Everybody has obstacles and changes that must conquer by him/herself, but it is hurt and difficult especially for a sensitive teenage girl, so does Riley. Feeling depressed and lacking strength to change the present better, she starts to do something defiant and gradually become aloof from her family, which somebody call it the rebellious stage. To my opinions, patents shouldn't take it as their excuse and do nothing. They should pay more attention to their children's emotions and guide them how to act more mature and how to deal with those unpleasant feeling instead of feeling disappointed about children's disorder behavior.

With an idea that is perhaps the best in the Pixar canon, it is a shame that things don't add up or are not thought through properly. It is also a shame that I would have prefered a movie of Riley and her troubles moving to a new home, as that is the most subtle thing about the whole movie. This movie is loud and clunky and it amazes me how well it is has managed to sway people. This particular story has so many things wrong with the engineering of its narrative construction that to dissect it all would ruin anybody from watching it on a first viewing. Let's just say that the five main characters do not evolve (or at least not as many as you'd want) in any pleasing way and three of them do not become more than their stock character. Everything that happens inside Riley is bombastic and theres a character ripe for a twister or a villain but the creators of this film are too short sighted to see it. The animation and character design and Riley's company are all that I liked about this. The very end credits are amusing too but surely they were done with that when they released Finding Nemo.",

    "review": "  I had such high hopes for this movie... As it was, the concept was really cool, but the plot was severely lacking. The effort it took to establish the \"world\" made it so that what was actually going on in the real story was super boring. Also, I'm not sure that the main character should have been 11 years old. This should have been a movie aimed at younger children who are just figuring out what emotions are. My 2-year-old repeatedly said to me, \"This is boring. I want to watch something else!\" Sadly, I had to agree.",

    "review": "  What a disappointing film.As the film follows the theme of proving the importance of sadness in developing a rounded personality, it puts some of the characters into some very dark places and prolonged periods of stress that will upset many of the children who go to see it. This should not have been rated as a \"U\". I know it could easily upset my own daughter and this DVD will be hitting the charity shop first.From an adult point of view, it has it's funny moments (virtually all of which are available FOC in the online trailers). Buying the film and sitting through the whole 91 minutes provides very few additional laughs.The story itself it mostly fairly dull, with very little in the way of a finale, while it was almost impossible to relate to, or even care about, the main characters in the film.A very rare dud from Pixar.",

    "review": "  UPDATED 04/09/15There's a reason why this film is the second best reviewed film of the summer (only behind Shaun the Sheep, which opened much later in America).The film is about an 11-year-old girl and hockey fan named Riley Andersen (yes, it's spelled with an 'en', not an 'on') whose family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco after her father Bill has a new job there. There are five feelings in each of everyone's heads; Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger, but the main crux of the story is the feelings in Riley's head. On Riley's first day of school in San Francisco, a malfunction in Riley's Emotions' Headquarters (where all the five feelings reside) causes Joy and Sadness to be separated from there when the former unsuccessfully tries to stop Sadness from creating a sad memory, leaving the other three feelings to make Riley have difficulties coping with her new life. Will Joy and Sadness make it back to the Headquarters before things go from bad to worse?This is a movie many people, both children and adults can relate to; balancing the effects of joy and sadness, the latter which can make things good or bad, as evidenced in the movie. Children will enjoy the animated characters, and adults will enjoy the concept of the movie of how the feelings can make Riley do certain actions, and how the absence of sadness and happiness eventually lead to her 'Personality Islands' (Family, Honesty, Friendship, Hockey and Goofball) crumble and land up in the Memory Dump below. And if you think Riley's mind couldn't be more complicated there's also Imagination Land, Dream Productions and Subconscious, where Riley's deepest fears are in, which includes a clown.It also helps that the film was thoroughly engaging, and there were some jokes to balance the heavy themes of the movie (for example, see the scene on Abstract Thought, where Joy, Sadness and an imaginary character named Bing Bong were gradually 'deconstructed into geometrical shapes' until they left the area). I was close to crying twice in the movie; in the beginning and the climatic ending.It's quite hard for an animated film to be one of the best of the year, but this film manages to do so, and it will easily be my no.1 film of 2015, if not the no. 2 film. After all, it's also an important lesson that life is not just about happiness; some sadness needs to be present too.I'm going to give this a strong 9/10 and definitely a recommendation. I could give this a 10/10, but this was so close to achieving that feat.Well done once again, Pete Docter. Keep it up.The voice cast in the movie includes Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling and Phyllis Smith (who voice 3 of the emotions in Riley's head), and as with most Disney animated films, is preceded by a short film if you watch the movie in a theatre. The short film here is called \"Lava\".Pros:Very innovative storyGreat animationEnjoyable charactersHeartwarming ending (you'll probably cry)Cons:Very minor and can be easily forgiven.",

    "review": "  WARNING: contains spoiler. This movie was outstanding. First off, let's just say that this movie is very unique. Featuring all the feelings was very creative of Pixar, and the crux of the whole film. Next, because they featured the emotions within Riley's mind, the development was unusually heavy and deep. You know why they brag that this movie is made by the guys who made UP? Because the Up guys really put their hearts into it. That 10 minute relationship between Carl and his wife? Here, it's turned into a full-feature child-parents relationship, but also with Riley and her relationship with the new area she moves to.Of course, uniqueness and development are only the tip of the ice berg. The movie is tension-filled, leaving me on my edge of my seat, tearing my hair out, yelling: \"Nooooo! NOOOOOOOO!!!\" (Especially near the climax scene where the emotions narrowly don't make it!) The fact that it's realistic and the lands Joy and Sadness travel to fall down one-by-one, showing that Riley is losing her core self and losing who she truly is--becoming a robot, becoming out of touch with her emotions--oh dang; that's truly suspenseful and horrifying! And shall I mention (BIG spoiler--You are warned here and now--BIG spoiler)-- Bing Bong sacrifices himself in order to make Riley happy--but it's not just about Joy. No; it's not about Joy leading onwards, optimistic no matter what. It shows that people have duality of emotions. It's realistic- - and the multitude of emotions, instead of simply one emotion (or no emotion at all in the case of the movie's crucial pinpoint), there are a load of emotions within the movie.Obviously, this movie is not just deep and touching. Let us end this review on a lighter note--this movie has excellent comedy as well. The main comical subject is the aforementioned Bing Bong in my opinion), which makes his \"death\" ever so-more heart-wrenching. But other than that, the humor is quite intelligent. The helicopter guy (\"come with me, La Chi-na.\"), Tripledent Gum, Angry's flame, goofball land, they all add a good amount of laughs and heart-warming moments to this film. So in conclusion, this movie is amazing. It's one of pixar's best, if not the best-- failing only second arguably to the Toy Story series. (And even that is arguable). If you haven't watched it, you definitely should. It has made it into the top ten of my best movies ever watched. :D",

    "review": "  Pixar's first full-fledged movie for grown ups. Ok, maybe that's not entirely true, but I can't see how a child would find this interesting. Sure there are bright colors and cute little avatars for emotions, but everything about this movie is designed to make parents sob and have all of the feels all at once. I'm speaking from experience here, because Jenny and I couldn't go 20 minutes without tears streaming down our faces at the thought of our own daughter growing up and going through all of these complex emotions. The moral of the story, which has so much depth and complexity and humor, seems to be this: NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES MOVE YOUR CHILD ACROSS THE COUNTRY. There's also a Chinatown reference that made me cry tears of laughter. Still, this feels less like a film and more like a fascinating experiment.",

    "review": "  I feel like I say this all the time with Pixar movies, but this one is something special. \"Inside Out\" is one of those movies that is truly unique. How many times have you heard the expression, \"Do you ever wonder what's going on in that person's head?\" Well, \"Inside Out\" gives a potential answer to that question by showing a person's emotions as living entities, all of whom reside in the person's head. Riley is an 11-year-old girl whose family is moving from Minnesota to California. As you might expect, she has mixed emotions about it. We see those emotions interacting with each other inside Riley's mind. There's the ever-chipper Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler), the despondent Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith), the red-hot Anger (voiced by Lewis Black), the fidgety Fear (voiced by Bill Hader), and the snide and sarcastic Disgust (voiced by Mindy Kaling). Depending on how Riley is feeling at that particular moment, that emotion will be \"driving\" inside Riley's mind. It's an interesting concept, but the movie goes even further, showing how memories are made and how they get stashed in a sort of internal vault. The mind houses different aspects of Riley's personality, like Imagination Land, Goofball Land, and Hockey Land. There's a \"Train of Thought\" that constantly runs back and forth between Riley's mind (dubbed \"Headquarters\" by the emotions) and the different lands. The mind can summon up a memory from the vault if Riley is attempting to recall something (though that will occasionally result in a catchy jingle from a chewing gum commercial, one of those grating tunes that, try as you might, you just can't get it out of your head). And this is all just the set-up. I don't want to get into too many details, as part of the pleasure is watching it all unfold for yourself. There is no shortage of imagination on display during the course of \"Inside Out,\" particularly when a few of the emotions begin plumbing the depths of Riley's mind. In typical Pixar fashion, the animation and visuals are stunning; the colors are bright and effervescent, and there are more than a few witty visual jokes. Also in typical Pixar fashion, the movie serves up an important lesson to kids (and maybe even adults, for that matter) without pandering to them. In this instance, \"Inside Out\" is letting children know that it's OK to be sad, something the emotions learn as well. Ideally, the emotions would like Joy to be in control the majority of the time, as it means that Riley is happy. But one of the more difficult facts of life to accept is that without sadness (or Sadness), there can be no joy (or Joy). The two are kind of dependent on each other. It's OK for happy memories to be tinged with a little bit of melancholia, and vice versa. The two complement each other. There's no shortage of poignancy in \"Inside Out\" either, and just like its other Pixar brethren, it earns these moments. They never feel forced or obligatory. One of the more painful aspects of growing up is leaving certain thoughts and memories behind, like an imaginary friend, for example. Once a child starts making actual friends, the imaginary ones tend to get buried deep within the subconscious before being forgotten completely. \"Inside Out\" visualizes this process, and it's hard not to be moved. Seriously, in how many other movies can you think of in which you felt involved in the plight of an imaginary elephant-cat creature? At this point in time, there's really no point of ranking the Pixar movies as each product they turn out continues to be quality. I will say that \"Inside Out\" offered one of the most original premises I've seen in years, be it Pixar movie or any movie in general. And the company continues to demonstrate that, as long they're around, it will not be a chore for parents to take their kids to movies. I know this much: if there really are little emotions commingling inside my head, it was definitely Joy who was in control while watching this movie.",

That does not diminuish the amazing quality of the movie and the task that they had to deal with to make these conecpts understood. It is clear that many psychologists will buy the dolls for their use. :) For everybody else (including myself), it was a nice reminder to think about the way you feel, how memories create our characters and our personality. The movie has so many subtleties that is is worth rewatching and rewatching. I love it. Inside Out 2 should prove to be difficult, due to the topic of puberty, however, the re-wiring of the brain at that time in one's life may be great as a film for teenagers (and parents) to understand what is happening and thus a welcome addition in the deepest sense of making great movies. Just one flaw: They got a bit off-track with the abstract thoughts, the movie could have lived without it. :)",

Its not an overly original concept lets be totally honest, I know I've seen this type of thing before in cartoons many times, and in pretty similar fashion, but again lets be honest, there's only a few ways you can do this.So the plot revolves around a little girl as she is born, and at the same time her little emotions are born within her head (I assume). We follow little Riley as she grows up with her parents and experiences all of life's wonder and beauty, but of course, all of the little negative bits too. At the same time we see everything from inside little Riley's head from the perspective of her emotions and how they each deal with individual situations. Naturally each emotion deals with different things such as sadness, anger, joy etc...they each specialise in their emotion of course. Alas, many years later aged 11, one day goes tits up when Riley attends her first day at school and loses control, she begins to cry because she is home sick, this causes a permanent negative memory which Joy (the happy emotion) tries to get rid of. In a series of bizarre accidents Joy and Sadness get ejected from the control room (the brain) and end up lose within Riley's head. Without Joy in Riley's mind (and life) keeping control, the duo now have to get back into Riley's brain/mind before she becomes depressed forever, seemingly.Right so the emotions, a generic bunch truth be told, Anger, Joy, Sadness, Disgust and Fear. Anger is a little red fellow that isn't a million miles away from a satanic looking creation, he also emits fire when in a rage. He is probably the second best emotion going for obvious reason really, one of the funniest emotions. Joy is the main protagonist and is a happy-go-lucky shiny female character that is rather vomit inducing. Sadness is probably the best emotion if you ask me, he looks kinda plain yet random in design, but his permanent, nervous, hyper paranoid persona is clearly the main laugh out loud machine. Disgust is easily the weakest of the bunch with not much to do or say frankly. She is modelled on young teenage valley girls which is a good notion, but highly annoying (check her glittery appearance). Lastly we have Sadness who is a stereotypically short, plump, glasses wearing female character that kinda reminds you of the nerdy high school girl, the librarians assistant type. She mopes around being all glum and useless, again, kinda annoying and makes you wonder why no one ever kills her.Overall the emotions are a reasonably fun little group but nothing overly hilarious, personally I found the other background characters much more interesting. The best of these has to be Bing Bong who was Riley's old childhood imaginary friend, but long forgotten. This guy is a combination of Riley's favourite things from that young age, his body is made of candy floss and various animal parts...plus he cries candy. His sidekick is an old child's tow wagon with rocket boosters that fire a rainbow coloured discharge, this was Riley's old toy back in the day which she would play and imagine could fly like a space rocket. This guy gives us some of the best laughs throughout the main adventure through Riley's mind, but he also gives us some of the most emotional. I don't think I can deny that I almost cried when he meets his end. Hands up who's with me here...yeah, I thought so. The various other colourful, bizarre, weird and wonderful little mind creatures we meet along the way are all really well designed and voiced acted, like I said, overall I think the majority were actually more engaging than the main characters. I really didn't like the designs for the main emotions, they just seemed way too simplistic and generic.I also have to say I didn't like or understand the other emotional representatives in other peoples minds, they didn't really make sense. Hear me out, Riley's mind emotions don't look anything like her, they are just visual representations of the emotion. Now when we go to Riley's dad (who has a tash), his mind emotions also have little moustaches, Riley's mum has emotions that look like her with the glasses and hair. Then in the end credits we see more mind emotions for other people, all of them look like the people they inhabit. One guy who works as a clown even has mind emotions that look like clowns, eh?? why would his mind emotions look like clowns when that's just his day job? So I guess the question is, why does Riley have random looking emotions when everyone else has emotions that look like them? Yeah I know this is a kids flick and I'm [b]really[/b] looking too far into this, but things like that kinda bug me cause it doesn't really add up. The animal ones really seemed far fetched as the emotions just run wild inside the animals head, so I guess that would work? who knows.The visuals are of course stunning, really slick, but did you expect anything less? really? I'm not trying to take anything away from the visuals but these days its really no big deal anymore is it, if a movie looks less than stunning then its something to talk about. I did like the imagination on display though, some really great ideas fleshed out, not all great, I would have done some things differently, but still good. I really liked the abyss of lost memories or memory dump, nice touch. The individual floating personality islands were neat, like family island or friendship island, that house memories of those certain aspects in Riley's life. I liked how they fell apart when affected by Riley's emotional state being rocked badly. I also liked the train of thought which was of course...a train. Overall the ideas and some visuals reminded me of an old animated movie called 'The Phantom Tollbooth', which also delved into such things as individual human traits being fleshed out, alongside things like words and numbers.Its a strong emotional ride that's for sure, no puns intended. The kids will love the visuals and the wacky characters, whilst the adults will enjoy the trip down memory lane for the...errmm, the childhood memory aspect of it all. I'm sure many people will be able to relate to what's going on, first day of school and crying, snow days, moving etc...its all there, the full gamut of human anguish and joy. The way they have thought out how things like memories, long term memories, forgotten memories, special memories etc...all work is very clever, typically adults make everything into a bureaucratic headache, but it works well. But like I said already I didn't really feel the main emotions, which was a problem, they weren't overly funny but slightly annoying. I mean come on, Sadness creates all the problems, everything is her fault! and she kept on touching everything and fucking it up!! arrgghhh!! Still I can't deny this was an excellent little rollercoaster that had me on the edge of my seat wondering how they would ever save the day.",

    "review": "  Here's this movie in a nutshell: A young girl gets sad and upset cuz she and her parents had to move to San Francisco. And then she decides San Francisco isn't all that bad.That's it. That's the movie. And the story is told thru some cute characters who represent the girl's different emotions (Sadness, Joy, etc.) Sometimes I wonder if I watched a different version of the movie than the rest of those who stumble over themselves to heap praise on it. That's certainly the case here. Sometimes animated feature films are written to appeal to 8 year olds, and other times they are written to appeal to a wider audience, including adults. In this case it was written solely for 8 year olds. She attends a new school and has to stand in front of the class and tell them about herself. So, you guessed it, Fear takes over as she stands up, then Joy tries to overcome and get her excited to talk to the class, then she sees the kids staring and gets fearful, and so on. That's the movie. You watch the emotion characters inside her brain dealing with events in her life as she moves to a new city. Now I suppose if you really enjoy the cute little emotion characters then the movie is okay. But otherwise there's nothing here. No story, no tension, no really funny moments. And the characters are the definition of predictable. Geez, let me see...what will \"Sadness\" say? Hmmm...I could only stand 1/2 hour and ended it. Terrible. UPDATE: I forced myself to watch the entire thing. Yeah, it sucked. Joy and Sadness spend most of the movie trying to get back to \"headquarters\", and in the end Riley decides San Francisco isn't all that bad. Yeah, this sucked.",

But that's a good thing! It got to me, I looked at this girl growing up in the movie and it made me look at my little girl and imagine her when she is older, growing up...and it made me weep. This is the Pixar I've always loved...the kind that can make me laugh and cry and enjoy a truly unique film that looks and acts like nothing else out there. I don't need endless sequels to \"Toy Story\" (even if they are all pretty amazing) and I certainly wish they'd stop making \"Cars\" movies...but if they churn out something like this every now and then...Pixar will remain tops in my book.",

The characters are all great and likeable, the animation is beautiful, the story is original and it's enjoyable throughout. It's heartwarming and relatable and has many laugh out loud moments. There are so many creative ideas throughout the movie that, while you know its not how the mind really works, it makes you think, \"wow, that's neat how they did that.\" The story has such a strong emotional and heartfelt core. The last 20 minutes are just incredible. If you don't shed a tear, your heart must be made of stone. Everything about this movie works. The only small gripe I kind of have is that it might be about 10 minutes too long. There were a few things the could have left out to shorten it, but I mean, thats the smallest gripe i have. The movie is perfect otherwise. One of the years best.",

    "review": "  I think it's safe to say that we can title this film as one of Pixar's classics, as this was one of the best animations I've seen in years. Inside Out has an extremely unique plot, along with some gorgeous animation and a clever script, and like I said, will probably be remembered as one of Pixar's best films to date. The voice actors in this movie did a great job of bringing out the personality of each and every emotion, and the animators were just as talented when they were tasked with bringing these characters to life on the big screen. This is genuinely a movie where kids can enjoy the adventure, teens can relate to, and adults can love. This movie pretty much relates to anyone who's ever been alive, and is one that can probably leave many in tears after watching this film. For those critics that gave this movie a rotten rating, I'm not sure how that occurred, but either way, this movie was awesome. What I really loved about this movie was the emotions. Obviously, they're the biggest part of this movie, but I really loved watching these emotions interact with each other. This movie even goes beyond the mind of one person and lets us see into the minds of everyone around us. It's also awesome how the director and writers were able to make each emotion clearly stand out. They all have their own personality and their scripts were made just for them. Honestly, Anger was my favorite because he gave a perfect amount of comedy along with the funniest lines in the movie. Fear and Disgust also added a lot the movie, and I probably liked Anger and Fear the most. Joy was also really good as the lead, and Sadness wasn't all impressive to me, but I enjoyed all the characters none the less. An animation is nothing unless the voice actors can bring the script to life, and I couldn't have asked for better actors. Amy Poehler was great as the lead, and although she wasn't the stand out in this movie, she did a great job. Lewis Black was the best part of this movie, even though you've probably heard that said a million times. With his angry state, he gives the wittiest and most clever lines, and he really made the movie for me. He was the primary reason for my endless laughter in a few scenes, and it's definitely a highlight. I actually really liked Bill Hader as Fear because he also brought a lot of comedy to the movie. As for the other two, there was nothing wrong with them, but they just didn't stick in mind like the other 3 emotions did. Although voice actors always get the praise in animations, you have to give credit to the animators, editors, and writers for this film. This film was beautiful in every way, and the path the director took was great. Everyone can laugh at all the jokes in this movie, but certain jokes are aimed at certain people. Adults and teens can relate to many of the jokes cracked in this movie, and many of them will love it.This movie was made for us to see a great adventure, but in the end, it can really pull on your heart strings. Everything in this movie was there for a purpose, and it was truly worth buying on Blu-Ray.This movie was really made for everyone, and was meant to teach us a lot about our lives. The way our emotions worked as a kid was portrayed perfectly in this movie, and it was exactly how most teens acted. This movie really has an amazing message in the end, and I'm happy that Pixar made such a unique film. In the end, this movie was gorgeous in every way. The voice actors were fantastic, the characters were outstanding, the plot was unique, the adventure was fun, the comedy was gut-busting, the message was heart-warming, and it really gives you a good feeling inside. You can watch this movie whether you're having a good day, or a bad day, and it can make you feel better in the end. I did wish that this movie was a bit longer, because it actually ended around the 1 hour and 28 minute mark, so I was disappointed in that aspect. In all, I give this movie a very strong 4.5/5 stars.",

Her emotions are all over the place and in turn is also guided along in life by them. Joy (poehler), sadness (smith), fear (hader), anger (black) and disgust (kaling). Things are almost always positive but due to the move there is conflict on how to adapt between the emotions and some disasterous events take place. Loved this movie, an insight as to how a person can be controlled and when Joy and Sadness become lost within Riley away from the other emotions its a race against time to get back to the main control room. Allot of heart and emotional roller coaster to watch. Very clever to make emotions characters, loved it.",

And in a kind of 'poppy' way at times, like why would you imagine a 'perfect boyfriend' who's such a cliche? And unicorns and stuff. I felt like it was trying too hard to use the most obvious pre-teen interests they could find to connect with a wide audience. Makes it come off as kind of generic, in those elements.It was most enjoyable to see the interaction of different people, and how their personal emotions come into play. However this was not the primary element in this movie. What we get instead is still good, but falls into a more tried-and-true formula for an animated movie powered by adventure.Loved the character design on Joy, Sadness, and Disgust, Anger was alright too, Fear struck me as pretty archetypical.Especially the skin effects on Joy, very unique, combined with her radiant glow a brilliantly visually distinct character.Shot design was kind of standard, lacking in flavor.The trailer used up all the funniest bits. It was still enjoyable, overall, but I simply didn't find this movie as humorous as most Pixar ones.My favourite part was the cat right at the end - so true!I do love the idea though, I really do.",

This creative gem focuses on a tween named Riley who moves from Minnesota to San Francisco with her family. Writer-Directors Pete Doctor and Ronnie Del Carmen develop this fascinating film by focusing on the mental emotions inside Riley by developing characters of her emotions; which include Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. Not to sound like a Debbie Downer, but my personal cerebral character of the picture was Sadness; actress Phyllis Smith did a stellar vocal performance as Sadness, which ironically brought me much joy in laughter. Anyways, back to the narrative. When things go wrong inside Riley's brain when Joy is jumped out from Riley's memory headquarters, Riley becomes disillusioned about her new life in San Francisco and finds no joy in it. Joy, alongside Sadness, must find their way back to Riley's Cerebral Headquarters before she loses all emotion. Other solid vocal performances came straight outta the mouths of Amy Poehler as Joy, Bill Hader as Fear, and Mindy Kaling as Disgust. \"Inside Out\" is one smart computer-animated flick you should delve inside to and check out. ***** Excellent",

    "review": "  This is the most heartwarming movie I ever seen. After finished watching this, I thought I really want to come back my hometown and meet my family, best friends from high school, and other people who are important to me. Anyway, who didn't watch yet, I will tell you a little summary. First, there was a 11years old girl called Riley. She grew up in Minnesota, and had a good time with her parents, and belonged to ice hokey team. So far, the main point of this movie is five feelings that everybody have in their head. It is Joy, Sadness, Angry, Fear, and Disgusting. These feelings are important to control a humans behavior, like fear helps to avoid dangerous things. Riley was always happy, and a feeling\"Joy\" was a main part of her head. One day, Riley's father forced to change the place of working, so they were moved together to San Fransisco. At first Riley was excited to start a new life, but in Sun Fransisco, she realized that she doesn't like here. Besides, in first day of school, she cried when she introduce herself. So, other students thought that Riley is a little bit weird. At that time, in her head, something wrong is happen. Sadness sometimes touch the Core memory, which is playing an important role of Riley's life. It means Riley was badly depressed, that even these happy memories changes to sad things. Of course, Riley's parents feels something wrong with their daughter. Mother asks about Riley's school, but Riley said just \" It was good, I guess.\" It was funny when mother sent signal to husband, he was thinking about soccer game, and there were battle in side both heads. It's shows that men and women's are not easily understands each other. Come back to Riley's head, there was another trouble happens. Joy and Sadness were blown away from the head quarters! They tried to go back to head quarters, but realized that it would be takes a long long way. But, Sadness read the all books about head, so she helped Joy as a map. While on the way to head quarters, they found that many island like funny, ice hokey, and friend island was collapsed. Joy was really disappointed. On the other hand, Angry, Disgusting, and Fear doesn't know what to do with Riley, without Joy. One day, when Angry controlled the head quarters, Riley decided to run away from home and go back to Minnesota. She robbed some money from her mothers wallet, and took a bus. Meanwhile, Joy and Sadness met to Binbon, who is the character that Riley create in childhood. Binbon helps them, but he was disappear. Finally, Joy and Sadness could reach to the headquarter, and Joy realized a role of Sadness. Joy passed the control pad to Sadness, and regained Riley's presence of mind. Riley get off the bus, went back to home, and told everything her feelings to parents. This moment, a new core memory was created. It is mix of Joy and Sadness. After this, Riley could get a new friends, and join in the ice hokey team. I really recommend this movie, so you should watch it!",

I promise, \"Inside Out\" will become a classic. As the voice of Joy, Amy Poehler is at her best. Come Oscar time, I say for Amy...why not? You and your kids will want to see this at least twice.

The 'emotions' make for interesting characters, which is the main reason this movie was amusing(good voice casting too). Still, it's not without its flaws. I left with more questions than anything and I felt like a lot of this made things up along as it went just to continue the plot, but it is a kids movie I suppose. Entertaining and no annoying singing(save for that gum commercial jingle, but it was used in a funny way so no bad marks for that).",

    "review": "  The movie is not the emotional gut-punch or the technical marvel I was told it to be. It seems to get too much praise for being a downbeat, mature story only translated into an animated movie for kids, though it can and should be enjoyed by people of all ages. I suppose my disappointment stems from the fact that the powers that be that created the emotional system inside everyone's head created a stupidly flawed world that not only puts the emotions (and thus the person) in danger, but also hopes to circumvent any logic gaps that might occur, granted though that this little world inside people's head is made from scratch, but set up for failure from the start.",

    "review": "  i enjoyed the ideas and i enjoyed the concept but i couldn't get into the plot. the character's emotions run away with her because she moved one time when she was a child? someone whose mother died and had to move from foster home to foster home takes absolutely no pity on someone who merely had to move to a different place. as well as running away simply because of that. boo hoo! you have a loving family and you go off on your shit. so privileged and i didn't appreciate it. the concept is great but the plot of the little girl certainly makes this movie scream #firstworldproblems because nobody who has actually had real struggles in their life would feel that bad for the child. now, in my defense considering it seems like i'm bashing this fictional little girl, i do understand that she was upset for moving, but if you want someone to feel for the character, something besides the insult of moving would do the trick.",

Enjoyed the animation style and characterizations. Odd to think that the original concept had Joy and Fear as the main characters; Joy and Sadness make a much more effective duo.

    "review": "  I just wonder if the one who wrote this wrote with a 90% of brain or a 100% (super used for a RIGHT purpose)...this movie is just to perfect. The script is magnificent. The way it is told is just so heartbroken, heartwarming. It hurts so much to grow up and forget we were kids, that we had true friends, a true life, a meaning. Growing up kinda sucks if you think about it. The message of the story is that all is in your mind...but (there's always a but)...the one thing humans forget for a good reason is this: memories will always be trigger in the moment we most need them. And yes, when we die those memories will be erased (hard to accept but it's true *hope not coz for some reason we tell our tales to people just to let them know who we are and so they can always re-tale our memories/stories, but is not the same...people forget and that is sad*).Anyway, leaving that out (it feels good to let tears, anger, happy, all of it out *for some reason it's called INSIDE OUT - it's like an internal analysis of ourselves-*), the music score is brilliant (since the TV show LOST, Michael Giacchino is just breaking hearts for real, even with the movie UP gosh). The one who directed this film Pete Docter] did a wonderful job as well. The voice actors did also a stunning job (english, spanish, all versions!). En fin, 5 stars of 5 to this fantastic animated film. The only thing left to say is live life as much as you can...''forget'' is something that comes with age, ''Living'' comes when getting older and older...''death'' is obviously a choice we cannot evade, it's coming sooner or later. In the end, we all are INSIDE OUT eh? - November 5, 2015 review.",

    "review": "  Pixar has done it again with this great animated film \"Inside Out\", this is a beautiful concept explaining emotions within humans and the story is just great. Inside Out is a great family friendly movie which I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to watch.When Inside Out was released in theaters we were on the road a lot and Annika got to check it out on opening night, sadly with her schedule she didn't have the time to put up a review and insisted that I check it out; well I did. After a few times of watching Inside Out to make sure that my opinion didn't change, I've certainly come to the final agreement that this movie is perfect. Being that Pixar along with Disney put this movie out, that alone tells you the graphics were off the charts but the story, wow beautifully put together. The voice overs fit the character better than most films in the animation genre; great stuff! This is one of my favor Pixar related films.",

    "review": "  It was ok at best. The animation was fantastic although the human characters look a little wonky depending on their facial expressions. The movies main errors come from the relationship between the emotion characters and their human host. Cheesy dialogue is present everywhere due to the fact that the emotions just kind of react to whatever their host does whenever they are in the \"Control room\" the brain. So in other words, there is a whole lot of \"Wow!\" and \"Oooooooohhh\" reactions from the emotions the whole time, which does get annoying. There are also too many plot conveniences and plot holes, but you can youtube those if you want to hear about them. Is this movies concept original? No, but well executed for the most part. All in all, it is much better than \"Frozen\" and worth a watch to formulate your own opinion.",

    "review": "  If you've followed my reviews for any length of time, and why the fuck would anyone do that, then you know that, for the most part, I've pretty much been in love with everything Pixar had done up until 2011 when Cars 2 came out. Cars 2 wasn't only awful by Pixar standards, it was awful by anybody's standards. It's not like the first Cars was any great to begin with, but Cars 2 took that very low standard and just went underneath it in every possible way. It was just dreadful. So, ever since then, I've lost a lot of faith in them, this includes the plans to do more sequels to films that don't really need them. Maybe greed finally got to them. Don't get me wrong, Brave and Monster's University were both really good films, even though Monster's University, to me, felt more like a retread as opposed to a step forward, but it's clear that neither of those films were up to Pixar's old standards of excellent in storytelling. The top-notch animation was still there, the storytelling wasn't. So, with Inside Out getting fantastic reviews since its release, I thought that maybe this would've been the resurgence Pixar needed to get back on track and to show others how it's done. Having finally seen the film, however, I'm left with mixed feelings. Do not misunderstand me, this is is an excellent film and one that I would wholeheartedly recommend to people who have grown up with Pixar in their lives, as have I, dating back to actually seeing the original Toy Story in theaters when I was SEVEN years old. I'm 27 years old right now. I vividly still remember going to the theaters to see A Bug's Life, Monster's Inc and The Incredibles. I've also seen Ratatouille, Wall-E, Up and Toy Story 3 in theaters, but those are undeniably closer to who I am now, as a man, than the aforementioned, which were part of my childhood. Inside Out features Pixar at their most inspired in, like, 6 years. It's been SIX fucking years since Pixar actually felt like themselves. And I'm talking about Up here when I refer to them being really inspired. Don't get me wrong, Toy Story 3 is fantastic, and one of Pixar's best (which is funny, because you can say that for, like, 8 of their movies). But that's a sequel and it almost felt like a Disney decision and not Pixar one. I think they, obviously, poured their heart and soul into that film and made it a fantastic film. But I digress, for whatever reason, whether it was Disney or the incredible artists at Pixar suffering through a creative slump, they just haven't felt the same. Like there was that creative spark missing from Cars 2, Brave and Monster's University. Inside Out, however, does give them that spark again, like you can see that this film was a labor of a lot of love from a lot of incredibly talented people. The animation is just absolutely stunningly gorgeous. It's, honestly, some of the best work they've ever done in terms of creating a beautiful and vibrant world. There's, honestly, no competition when it comes to Pixar and the work they do in creating beautiful and detailed worlds. But, and this is just my opinion of course, part of me feels that this what Pixar has in their mind that a Pixar movie should be. Like they're playing with their own rules and what people might expect of them. Honestly, the story, while it does have some beautiful and heartbreaking moments never really clicks for me. At least in terms of everything relating to when Joy and Sadness become separated from the rest of the group (Fear, Anger and Disgust) and Joy's and Sadness' journey, along with Bing Bong (Riley's imaginary friend) back to 'control center', if you will, where all the emotions that Riley ends up feeling are dished out by the appropriate 'worker'. Like, the journey itself, while full of some of the stranger and more surreal images you'll see in any Pixar film, doesn't really click for me. I understand Joy's desperation in getting back to Riley before all the core islands highlighting different aspects of Riley's personality, Happiness Island, Friendship Island, Hockey Island, etc, are wrecked and Joy and Sadness are forgotten forever in an empty pit of other forgotten memories (which ends up leading to one of the film's more heartbreaking moments). I just don't think they did as great a job at making you feel the connection Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust end up feeling with Riley. Particularly Joy, who's pretty much obsessed with Riley. After all, all these emotions end up controlling, essentially, Riley's life and how she responds to certain things throughout her life. These...beings, or whatever you wanna call them, are the most essential part of her life and yet, to me, you never really end up feeling that connection. No idea why, it just doesn't click for me. And while Anger, Fear and Disgust are entertaining characters, a lot of their segments at the control center play out exactly the same way, making Riley sadder and sadder. It's necessary in as far as story progression, but it was also a little repetitive. Though I do get its importance in making Riley less and less of the girl her parents knew and how cheerful she could be. With that said, however, I still think the film tackles some pretty hefty themes for what is promoted as a kids' film. Though, honestly, Pixar has always been among the best at bridging the gap. They make things simple enough for kids to enjoy, but mature enough that adults get a lot out of it as well. Though, honestly, this one is probably gonna end up appealing even more to adults than to kids with its themes. Essentially, the film's basic themes are depression and mental health issues. The fact that it's done so in a colorful animated film shouldn't keep anyone with even slight knowledge of how the human mind works to know that this is a film about depression and mental health issues. I think this subtler, more understated story is the best part of the film, to be honest. It plays with that concept in an intelligent fashion that highlights a spotlight that is very rarely spoken about in films like this. I'm not saying that these elements should've been more prominently featured, I prefer that it's more subtle, but I just wish that the journey of Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong would've been as satisfying as the thoughts the film puts in your head with its approach to depression. Hopefully it opens up discussion these issues and how it's important to address them. The film also, rightfully, tackles about how sadness is just as essential a part of who we are as people as happiness is. Joy wants Riley to always be happy, similar to every human being on earth, but the fact of the matter is that this is not achievable in a realistic manner. There are days where you're gonna be sad, mad, lethargic, afraid and that's all fine. It's part of what makes us who we are as human beings and I think that they were smart to tackle such a hefty subject matter in such a mature and intelligent fashion. The film is certainly funny and entertaining enough, it's supremely well-written, despite some hiccups, and the voice acting is, as is typical, outstanding. Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith and Richard Kind are all pretty incredible in their roles and they bring a lot of life and energy to the film with their performances. Part of me wants to give this film 4.5 stars, but there's also the aspects of the film that I didn't like that clearly keep it from reaching that point. Though, intellectually speaking, this film is at a level above anything Pixar has ever done, to the point that a lot of your kids simply won't understand a lot of the film and why it was doing certain things. Its exploration of the brain and how it affects your personality is really intriguing though and I'd, just for that, recommend the movie. But I think the movie definitely has a lot more to offer than that. It's entertaining, beautiful and heartbreaking in equal measure. So, yes, Pixar has made the comeback. Maybe not the comeback of the year, because this is still just a notch below their truly elite offerings, but I'd still call this an excellent movie and one that I enthusiastically recommend. Bring on Pixar's next film The Good Dinosaur, which comes out in 3 weeks. Gonna be an interesting test to see if their quality can hold up with two releases coming out within 5 months of each other. Here's to hoping that it's another excellent offering from Pixar.",

Sadness and Joy are the main emotions of this movie in terms of characters and actual feelings about the story. This is the 2nd best film of the year thus far and deserves every accolade that it will get. 4.6/5",

    "review": "  First of all, I was really concerned when watching it, if I could get a five or six year-old to watch it...Having said that, this movie was awesome as an idea. I loved the way that the workings of the brain were paralleled to the characters of the movie and in general the graphics, etc. Plenty moments of laughs, although not hysterical as in other movies, but still lots of laughs!Loved the anger character as well as disgust! Loved them! I really liked the small clips in the end where they show how the brains of other people work, as long as the brain of a dog and a cat (this last one was to die for!). Overall, when a movie is as good as this one, you don't need to write much. Definitely worth watching with you kid, I would say ages 9 and up, and for sure worth watching as an adult, still hang up on animated movies! ;-)",

Great, complex metaphorical movie with the usual Pixar trademark of appealing to children and adults alike, without talking down to anyone. I especially appreciate Pixar's commitment, in film after film, to not taking childrens' intelligence for granted and treating them as the smart, inquisitive little people that they are. \"Inside Out\" doesn't spell out everything for you, instead asking the viewer to dig a little bit in finding the profound message hidden among the entertainment. All other animation companies could learn a lot from Pixar's brand of storytelling. Another jewel in Pixar's crown.",

Delightfully innovative and upbeat, Inside Out is a wonderfully expressed journey of conviction, taking viewers on the rollercoaster of life's ups and downs in a thrilling, humorous and heart-felt adventure.Growing up isn't always easy as 11 year old Riley finds out when she is uprooted from her ice-hockey loving life in Minnesota for the broccoli pizza eating city of San Francisco. Guided through the turmoil by her emotions - Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Riley remains positive about her new home, school and making friends.

    "review": "  Inside Out is the very long awaited return of the powerhouse that is pixar. Going back to the family morals that made such movies like Toy Story so strong, Inside Out is incredibly powerful and moving that it'll make you cry even if your adult. Amy Poehler pulls out a great Joy and frankly every other character as well but Phlyillis Smith as Sadness is truly the highlight. Unbelievable film.",

The characters, namely Bing Bong and Joy, are complex yet easy to like. It's another smash hit in the storied history of Pixar.",

    "review": "  Riley, a normal schoolgirl, she has five feelings and emotions. They are called joy, anger, fear, sadness, and disgust. These feelings control and inspire her everyday movements, decisions, and her memory.Riley was born in Minnesota, within her mind, 5 emotions came to life. They live in the headquarters of Riley's emotional brain, the conscious mind, where all five of them control Riley's actions, emotions, and memories using a control console. The memories are stored in a ball shaped thing, which are sent into the storage.One day, Riley's father moves to San Francisco. Joy becomes concerned that sadness keeps touching happy memories, so she tries to keep her isolated from the group. Sadness, though, accidentally caused Riley to cry in front of the class, Creating a new sad core memory, which is the most important memories. Joy tries to take the memory out before it reaches the core hub, but she accidentally knocks out some of the other core memories, causing the island controlled by the memories to shut down. Before Joy can put those memories back in place, they are sucked up in the memory tube and in the labyrinth of the brain, where long-term memories are stored and kept. Anger, Fear, and Disgust attempt to make Riley happy and control the console despite Joy's absence. Anger believes that Riley needs to go back to Minnesota to create more happy memories. As a result, Anger plugs in an idea into the console.Meanwhile, in the storage of Riley's long-term memories, Joy and Sadness finds Riley's imaginary friend, Bing-Bong. They asked Bing-Bong how to get back to the headquarters. Bing-Bong tells them they can ride the train of thought. Sadly, before they arrived, Riley slept and the train shut down. Joy and Sadness tried to wake Riley up, and it succeeded accidentally when she had a bad dream. Joy and the others took the train again, but it broke down when another island fell to the memory dump, where forgotten stuff are kept. Joy tries to get back to the console using a recall tube, but it broke, sending Joy and Bing-Bong into the dump. Joy saw a small wagon. Joy and Bing-Bong rode the wagon, trying to get out of the dump. After several failed attempts, Bing-Bong realizes that the combined weight is too heavy. As a result, he jumps of the wagon, allowing joy to reach the islands. Joy uses various tools, including imaginary boyfriends from imagination island and got back to headquarters successfully with sadness.When Joy and Sadness got back to the Headquarters, Joy encourages sadness to pull out the idea, and Sadness successfully pulled it out, reactivating the console and making Riley return home.Once Riley returned home, she broke down in tears and confessed she missed her own life. Her parents comforted her, and after that, together, Joy and Sadness together made a mixed feeling core memory, which naturally created a new island, a year later, Riley slowly adapts to her new life, turning her into a more emotionally complex girl, with more islands and core memories .",

The animation again, has been bumped up another notch by the Disney owned Pixar. As a 3d artist, I took note of the hair on the characters, hair is incredibly hard to get right in 3d animation, as is interacts with everything, while receiving and casting shadows on every strand of hair.The story, starts off a little bit slowly, but as the viewer understands the idea / concept behind this cute tale, it turns out to be a very heart felt and wonderfully cute story.Thoroughly enjoyed it!",

    "review": "  Inside Out is easily the riskiest movie Disney Pixar has ever produced and also the most challenging one yet. It tells the story of young Riley who is forced to move to San Francisco and how her emotions, which are joy, sadness, disgust, anger and fear navigates her through this extremely emotional point in her life. It is a genuine and heart-felt story filled with emotionally relatable characters. One of my favorite movies of the year, Inside Out sets out to do what it aims. It makes you fall in love with all the fantastically animated emotions, it makes you cry as it reminds you certain things that you have experienced in your life, it makes you fell okay about crying and most of all, it makes you love your family and friends even though the times are tough. I cannot point out any negatives about this movie since it was an thoroughly emotional experience for me and very rarely does a movie makes me feel this way.It is a triumph of animation and story-telling through well directed characters and dialogues. The actors who lent their voice to the characters did a fantastic job especially Amy Poehler as joy, Phyllis Smith as sadness and Richard Kind as Bing Bong. Inside Out is a genius and rare convergence of humor and emotions. This is a movie so spectacular, one can never forget.",

    "review": "  When Inside Out released in June, it had been two years since Disney Pixar released Monsters University in 2013. With the Summer 2014 The Good Dinosaur being postponed (now coming out November 2015), Pixar animation had to once again prove itself. After its conception in the 90's, Pixar rattled off blockbuster after blockbuster with each of their movies receiving 90+% on Rotten Tomatoes (Cars being the exception). Yet, with Cars 2 (39%), Brave (78%) and Monsters University (78%) many questioned where Pixar was heading... Until now. Inside Out, is a story about a happy go-lucky hockey loving 11 year-old whose world is turned upside down when her parents move her to San Francisco. She is run by the emotions in her head, Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger. The movie is incredibly hilarious as times, and downright sad in others, but it is the realness of the story that hits home for its viewers. Few animated movies have the courage to make a movie where a character is truly sad, nearing depression about her current situation. Inside Out moves past its string of sequels and we've seen this before movies to bring us the type of original idea that made us love Pixar in the first place. With just over two months until the release of The Good Dinosaur, which was postponed 18 months because it wasn't ready, we can't wait to see Pixars' next original title, because for the first time in a long time, they are trending in the right direction.",

I thought if I saw it in 3D, better! Yes, that was the problem! This is 3D movie, but I saw it in 2D... So half the excitement. Anyway I kinda disappointed... I think small children shouldn't watch it, too dark and too dangerous... But climax was nice and wonderful. I love Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Wall-E.

We see how children naturally evolve from their compartmentalized basic emotions to composite secondary and tertiary emotions. Even I didn't understand Joy's fanatic tenacity for much of the movie, but the overarching message about how putting a happy face on all the time can take its toll is quite kathartic and accurate. There are some random, goofy tangents throughout the journey, but Bing Bong's sacrifice is so sad and moving.*Mild spoiler: So does that mean children's comprehension of Sadness becomes Reason later on in life?",

Pixar like always takes all the themes that makes a great movie and represented them using emoticon characters. The story plays out beautifully , less subtly from its predecessors , and handles some critical elements beautifully . It however does lack a bit of humor unlike Toy Story but it possess more characterization . I found the middle of the movie a bit of drag but the climax makes up for it .Seeing emotional representatives of various characters does liven up the scenes though . Overall it is a very neat concept and one can definitely hope for a sequel of it . Inside out is a brilliant return from Pixar",

    "review": "  Pixar has always made films that are tailored to audiences young and old, yet \"Inside Out\" is made in a way that appeals to an even larger audience than that.Pixar films are typically for younger audiences, yet to help keep adults and parents interested they include witty dialogue and parts that only adults can understand. That's not to say that \"Inside Out\" does not do this as well. It does, yet again it does even more.There are films where you can just sit back and enjoy the show and not have to think about anything. An example being classic Hollymood Musicals like, \"Singin' In The Rain\". But there are also films where you have to stay attentive throughout the entire thing or else you will be completely lost. Such are movies like, \"Inception\".\"Inside Out\", however, is a combination of both these styles of film. You can watch the film mindlessly or contemplate everything that's going on in a current scene, but it will still be enjoyable either way. For this reason, the movie can be watched repetitively because its different depending on how you watch it.And unlike other Pixar films which narrate the fictional adventures of toys, bugs, fish or even rats in Paris! \"Inside Out\" is a fictional twist on a non-fiction subject; human emotions. Its a movie about all of us.The movie explores human psychology and the importance and science of our emotions and personality, all the while sticking to the Pixar formula we all know and love! There's something for everyone; loveable characters, adventure, comedy, suspense, wit, surprise, horror, and moments which make us cry our eyes out! \"Inside Out\" not only sets the bar for other animation companies, it also \"one-ups\" its predecessing movies, further increasing the quality we will now expect from future Pixar films.In conclusion, \"Inside Out\" is in my opinion the best Pixar film ever made! It is what you would expect from a Pixar film, yet its surprisingly far more than that.",

The psychological jokes and world building of this adorable film is totally relatable to the viewer on many emotional levels. Therapeutic and comforting, Inside Out invites the viewer to reflect on their own memories and emotions.",

Sure it was cute, but not as cute as I had hoped. It was funny at times. But parts were really Disney cliche and generic, plus I had to ignore the character issues and plot holes. I like human psychology (not that this movie was clever, but its simplicity I guess was for the child audience), but this was meh. Too bad, cuz I really wanted to love it. I wanted to feel, to cry, but I was let down. 6.5/10",

    "review": "  With the recent Pixar movies, it seems to me that they are putting more effort on trying to intrigue all ages not just only children anymore. This movie is about a young girl moving into a new city as her emotions navigate her decisions. One emotion which is Joy get into a conflict and is in search of a solution but while she is on this journey she learns a lot about Sadness and her part in the young girl life. As she evolves on this journey, as do the other emotions and the young girl. First off, the images and sound play a huge part in this movie as it adds all the emotions needed in the pictures. It gives us a different perspective in how our emotions bleed out to others and how creative we forget we can be. The director does well in this part as he gives different scenes that are out of this world mostly on Joy journey as you would not expect most of the stuff happening seeing greed, selfishness, and others which you wouldn't presume to happen in a \"young movie.\" He gives you a different picture on life and how generally our society forgets how we could view it from all different sides. The director also actively engages the audience as Joy goes on a journey to rescue the girls Morals or Personality that she obtain throughout her life. Certainly A movie that made me tear up is a first as it is hard for a guy to cry sometimes. What could have been worked on is the music as it should really amplify more of the scene rather than a little aggression. Some felt like it was lackluster as it was a powerful scene. As for the voices of each character, I believe it was splendid as Angry had the right tone of voice and sarcasm. Disgust had this almost blonde personality but what really gave in was Bing Bong played by Richard King, he put so much emotion and thought in his voice that it felt so real in the movies. The usage of colors allows more eye candy in the different section of the movies that appealed to the audience giving them not a monotone view but at time vibrant for happy feeling and same suit color for sadness. Overall this movie 9/10 as there is some part that are a little off but the plot, character, and voices were on point. Other than that the movie is about 1 hour and 30mins giving it a perfect time for the plot to end, nothing I felt was rushed as everything flowed nicely. This movie oddly relates a lot to our daily lives as our emotions get in a way with a lot of our decision-making comprising some paths that we choose but also how we deal with other people in our daily lives. Our choices and voice make big decision in other views as working with others to make a better place.",

Like in other Pixar movies, there are at least two levels here: the story and the metaphor behind it. Behind its funny and colorful adventure, \"Inside Out\" tells the story of what happens in a little girl's mind at the passage from childhood to puberty while the world she used to live in changes. Little kids will enjoy the adventure, the gags and the characters, adults will enjoy the symbolic level of the movie, if they pay attention to details and accept to play with the metaphor behind the movie : from color choice to little details of scenes, nothing is there without a meaning, in a Pixar movie.",

This leads to a choppy, and partly unfocused script that could have been so much more.

For me it didn't even come close to most of the other Pixar movies i have seen, most of which received a ten out of ten rating from me. My biggest problem was that i just didn't laugh very much and i usually find Pixar movies hilarious, I also didn't fall in love with any of the characters and i usually always come away with a favourite but on this occasion i did not. I was entertained though and i do appreciate that the film was clever, it also looked fantastic and it did at points either make me cry or it managed to warm my heart. I just expected more and for me personally, i felt that it didn't fully deliver but i can see why other people love it.",

    "review": "  Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school. Written by Pixar.",

    "review": "  Disney continues to impress with this clever and creative creation. An ambitious animation that truly could have gone disastrous, but ended as a critical and box-office masterpiece. 'Inside Out' might at first glance look like a childish 1.5 hour-'Minions-sequel'. But that's just what the kids will see, meanwhile we older individuals will embrace this amazingly visualized plot where emotions and everyday problems are experienced. Everything from within is seen from a new perspective, and it truly is a ride of joy, emotions and surprisingly much action-sequences. The concept works for everyone; both the humor, the relatable and enduring aspects. The characters are just as relatable, there's much development to them too and they are so well envisioned in a such beautiful-animated way. It's like magic. To take our ordinary life and put it out in different characters with specific emotions; that's an ambitious idea, even for Disney! But they managed to come up with this extraordinary world that works so well, and that totally makes one crave for more popcorn! It might be one of the most flawless movies of 2015, with its stunning focus on imaginative and deep characters. The first 15 minutes of the opening shots might be a bit too fast and it could have been a bit less rushed - if you look at such small critical details. It also got some very minor fact-based reaction-dialogs. But the rushed opening later on did slow down considerably, and truly managed to grasp the depth of the characters and the clever plot that never stopped being inventive! So to keep it short; 'Inside Out' is without any doubt another great animation by the Disney-Pixar corporation, and that got a lot to tell about family, emotions, everyday life and every individual's own mind. Go watch it.Personal rating: 8.5/10 Critical rating: 9.5/10",

    "review": "  A brilliant idea that shines for the first few minutes and gradually dies out for the rest of the film due to the lack of animation creativity and deep script, hmmm, this sounds familiar to me. Ah yes, \"Up\" - a profoundly creative and emotional ... short film of first-ten-minutes coupled with an utterly boring full length animation that follows. They might share the same director, right? Bingo! Indeed \"Inside Out\" has a very good premise - the simplification of human's feelings and thinkings into some distinctive factors, but its execution is somehow boring, full of clich�s, repetitive scripts, few emotional moments that were dwarfed by the same monotonous set-pieces like \"Monsters, Inc.\" (which was directed by, obviously, the same director). A human mind is always something fascinating, but its depiction here in \"Inside Out\" is disappointing with not much creativity put into its vast boring emptiness of a landscape. Basically the film has no \"villain\", but the poorly-developed characters themselves are already villains to the audience - why does Joy (should have been \"Optimism\") always lead instead of Sadness (should have been \"Pessimism\"), given the psychological fact that sadness is, in most case, the most memorable feelings in our memory? Why does Disgust need to be here, given another psychological fact that it is way less important in our mind than, let's say, imagination, creativity, or especially desire? And why in the world do emotions prevail reasons in controlling our everyday life? The simplification of the mind is acceptable if it brings out a clear, coherent, and fascinating \"inside out\" portrait of our mind, our emotions. But if such simplification only induces misunderstanding and incoherence, than it is simply a failed effort. I understand that the journey of Joy, Sadness et al. is only an euphemistic depiction of the changes in the mind of a coming-of-age girl in new situation, but her emotional journey is disappointingly uneventful and thus could not bring any weight to her \"inside journey\". Still, the film is very OK as an entertaining piece, but its lack of creativity and caring execution is unforgivable. It will be very sad if this film wins another Oscar for Peter Docter, such winning only gives way for more unimaginative animations and a poorer taste by the audience.",

Non era affatto facile.A dire il vero avrei eliminato la parte del \"pensiero astratto\" che mi � parsa un po' troppo pretenziosa... mi chiedo cosa possa aver capito un giovane spettatore in quel frangente.La storia � lineare (forse troppo) e non ci sono grossi colpi di scena: tutto si svolge come ci si aspetterebbe, ma il film non � assolutamente banale e i momenti comici si alternano a scene un molto toccanti che mi hanno fatto scendere la lacrimuccia.Inutile spendere parole sul look generale della animazione e il gusto grafico, perch� lo standard Disney � davvero elevato.Il cortometraggio Lava prima del film � molto carino, ma non memorabile.",

This is animation at it's best- creative, interesting, childlike, questioning, filled with high level concepts broken down to a simpler state, adult humor that doesn't insult nor offend, well crafted images, matching sound quality, and a film that gets better with every viewing- I'm up to 3 now! The story is so well constructed that you almost feel like the director somehow managed to open up his daughter's own mind and faithfully copy it's complexity and beauty. Bing Bong, Bing Bong!!!",

    "review": "  You don't need me to tell you that \"Inside Out\" is one of the best films of the year because every other review is telling you the exact same thing. At the time of this writing, there are only five negative reviews out of nearly two hundred and seventy- that, in a nutshell, shows how impressive this Disney-Pixar outing is. Starring the five core emotions that run a little girl's brian, \"Inside Out\" shows how everyone has to deal with the tough emotions of going through change. In the course of the film, the home to the emotions, Riley, is forced to give up her friends, her school, and her home to move thousands of miles away. Then, when Joy (Amy Poehler) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) are lost in the depth's of Riley's mind, everything falls apart. By the end, Joy, who had been dominating Riley's emotions, realizes that everyone needs a little sadness, a little disgust, a little fear, and even a little anger to get through growing up. Lewis Black shines as Anger; every line he yelled was pure gold. And the secret weapon, Richard Kind as Riley's old imaginary friend Bing Bong, was beautifully used to bring the realism of growing up to the big screen. In short, \"Inside Out\" might just prove to be one of the best films of the year.",

Perfect casting, stunning animation, great humor for children and adults alike and Pixar's usual poignant touch are all familiar in the best way possible. It's not perfect, like I said. Some parts with the imaginary friend are almost impossible not to predict, the order of the islands is so incredibly convenient, and the archetype parents are bland. But the story they're telling is brave an inventive, the animation is as creative as it's ever been (not their best though, that goes to Wall-E), and it's definitely worth watching.",

    "review": "  It is such a joy to report that Pixar is back in form. After a few years of weak soup, it's so nice to see them back on the track that made us fall in love with their confections in the first place. In the animation game, Pixar was always been the better factory, churning out creative projects that were destined to last for generations while their rivals simply spat out quickly made product mounted solely on what was popular at the moment. But after Up six years ago, the studio seemed to have lost its way and they haven't produced greatness since. At least, until now.Inside Out is a grand and bold work of imagination and creativity, made by people who are not content to give the audience the bargain basement, but to offer something that is going to last. Thematically, it resembles Toy Story 2 in that it is also about the pangs and stresses of growing up and losing the most valued trappings of childhood as adolescence washes ashore.The movie, for the most part, takes place inside the head of Reilly Anderson, an 11 year-old girl from a nice family who is suffering the slings and arrows of approaching adolescence. Inside her brain is the complex that make up the core of her being, driven by the aforementioned Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler); Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith from \"The Office\"), Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) who looks like a question mark; Anger (Lewis Black) who dresses like middle-management; And Disgust (voiced by Mindy Kailing), a green shimmering ball of teenage dismissiveness.Of course, this is not the most original plot in the world. I think immediately of the early 90s sitcom \"Herman's Head\" which had the same plot only the protagonist was a grown man. There was the Eddie Murphy comedy Meet Dave, and horror adventures like The Cell and Identity. I can also think of a bit once written by Woody Allen that takes place inside the body of a man during his mating ritual.The movie is original in it's approach. It begins on the day Reilly is born as the palette of her inner being begins to form. First a ball of light, then a pixie figure called Joy. Little Reilly's mind is a blank slate that very quickly forms the emotional core of her being. Along with Joy come Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust. What her mind eventually evolves into is a complex of emotions, feelings, trains of thought, ideas, images, moods and memories. What she carries with her, what she keeps, and what she dismisses are at the core of this very impressive visual textbook, one that not only forms into a visual masterwork, but also one of the most creative and ambitious animated features in many years. This is what animated movies are all about.The quintet at the controls all form the core of Reilly's current mood. Joy seems to have the lead most of the time, but there's never a sense that anyone is elbowing anyone out of the way. Everyone has their turn at the console of Reilly's current emotional state. The key battle comes between Joy and Sadness. Joy sees Sadness as an unnecessary element to Reilly's state of harmony, but Sadness knows that in order to achieve harmony one must experience sadness to get to joy.Every minute of every day, Reilly's brain produces a memory that is represented as a tiny marble colored by whatever emotional state the memory comes from. Those memories are either stored in Long Term; stored in a special place for Core Memories; or are disposed of all together. What comes of Reilly's current experience is juxtaposed by what has happened before. New things come in and old things go out - some are stored in her long term memory, some are buried in her subconscious, and old, forgotten memories are deposited into a dark chasm where they eventually evaporate from existence much like a deleted file on a computer. Her current emotional state is also represented by various theme parks that begin operating based on her current state of mind representing Family, Honesty, Hockey (her favorite past time) and her moments of Goofball playfulness.The drama begins with a change in Reilly's life. Her parents are uprooting from Minnesota to San Francisco, meaning that Reilly has to leave behind friends, and the best memories of her childhood. Her churning emotional states breed confusion, and anger, and resentment forcing a battle between Joy and Sadness mostly due to Joy's concern that Sadness will infect core memories (when she touches them they turn blue). The two end up outside the command center with no way to get back, leaving Reilly's supplementary emotions, Fear, Anger and Disgust at the controls. What lies on the other side is the strangest journey since Alice fell down the rabbit hole. Joy and Sadness take a strange journey through the recesses of Reilly's ever-changing brain, particularly the Long Term memory library that is often cleared out when Reilly no longer needs them.The script draws a very clean line between what is happening to Reilly in the world and the universe inside her head. Things are changing, evolving, breaking down, rebuilding - in other words, she's growing up. And just as Reilly doesn't understand these changes, neither do the representations in her brain. The tragedy of what happens to the trappings of childhood once Reilly has moved past them is a key theme here, expressed most achingly in the form of a circus elephant named Bing-Bong (beautifully voiced by Richard Kind), who once served as Reilly's imaginary friend, but now lingers in the forgotten realms of her brain, always aware that he is many years late for the memory dump. Bing-Bong is a tragic figure who, much like Jessie the Cowgirl in Toy Story 2, is a figure whose purpose dried up long ago. He serves as a guide to get Joy and Sadness on board Reilly's train of thought and back to the control center even though everyone knows his eventual fate.The journey getting back to the control center is a trip through a virtual psychology textbook including a a trip through the memory dump where all of her useless memories are dried up and forgotten. Then a creepy journey into Reilly's subconscious, where Joy and Sadness come across an oversized clown who isn't evil, but is terrifying in the way that a small child might see it. He's a giant, but only because that's how Reilly saw him in real life.But the most bizarre sequence comes when the trio takes a shortcut through a forbidden realm called Abstract Thought where the three figures find themselves misshapen into a cubist state then into a flattened out form representative of early European animation. It's a fun sequence - a head scratcher - but a fun sequence none-the-less.Much more of the plot, I cannot discuss. What has been described here only scratches the surface. Let me just say that as with last year's The LEGO Movie, this is an animated feature made with loving care, a story told by writers and animators that aren't satisfied to nail down their story to a pat formula or to whatever colorful bupkis they can sell at McDonald's. The people behind Inside Out - that being screenwriters Meg LeFauve, Josh Cooley, and Peter Docter writing from a story by Reynoldo del Carmen - want to make something special, something that will linger in your mind. They've taken the animated genre and they've stretched it to the limit in an effort to create something special. They've created a great journey, an emotional journey. One that will last for generations to come.",

On a third level, it provides adults with a metaphor for talking to children about their emotions and getting them to understand why they feel they way they do: \"I think Anger is running things at Headquarters today. Do you know why he took over the controls?\" With great reviews from the critics as well as audiences, this is going to be a blockbuster for Disney Pixar.",

    "review": "  Disney-Pixar has dug deep into the depths of creativity and imagination crafting a stupendous formula of humor and heartbreak. 'Inside Out' is less than a film but more of a trip to the recesses of a child's innocent and boggled mind, terrifically molded with psychological substances, lighthearted adventure, and heartbreakingly relatable real-life experiences. With all pride and confidence, I could say that Inside Out was more than a movie. It was an experience.",

I do like that they took a risk and made something completely new and different from everything else. A story told from the inside world of a little girl's mind was unique to me. Plenty of humor and some heartwarming moments too. As with many of Pixar's leading ladies, I fell in love with the tomboy Riley. However, it was the character \"Sadness\" (played by Phyllis Smith) who stole the show.",

The movie manages to make you feel a colourful spectrum of \"human emotion\" whilst never feeling manipulative or melodramatic. I've seen a lot of tear-jerkers in my lifetime, but never has one been this bittersweet - pushing you to the brink of tears multiple times while somehow still leaving a big old smile on your face as you exit the cinema. Unsurprisingly though, audience members at each of the THREE screenings I attended were mostly adults. Whilst other studios insist on making adult-friendly movies for kids, Pixar continues to make kid-friendly movies for adults, which has been a big factor in their films transcending age for almost 20 years now since the first Toy Story. Final thought: There's a beautiful and encouraging message here on why sometimes in life it's important to feel certain emotions, and that it's OK when you do.",

Her emotions run her world like the rest of us: Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness. Things start to go downhill at the emotional headquarters when sadness starts taking over most of Riley's memories. Joy and Sadness try to piece Riley back together while Anger, Disgust, and Fear run the show. Pixar did an amazing job with Inside Out. It's colorful and emotional. A lot of people can relate with the experiences Riley goes through and I think that's why it made so many of us cry during certain scenes. It isn't my favorite Pixar but it is definitely an amazing movie.",

The emotion is heartbreaking and genuine, the humor is constantly hilarious, the animation is some of the best ever put to screen, the voice acting is stellar, and it has amazing, deep themes about emotions, growing up, letting go, and accepting reality.

    "review": "  \"Pixar has done it again\", those words have been slowly diminishing from Pixar's dictionary throughout the years. With above average outings and sequels to established franchises, there were doubts and chatters among audience, \"maybe Pixar's lost their magic\", \"Creativity is down the drain with Pixar\" and whatnot. Inside Out is here to prove the naysayers wrong and completely refill the wavering magic gauge, maximum to the very brim. Before we begin exploring Inside Out, as with Pixar's trend, the movie is soft-booted with a short movie titled \"Lava\", a tale of a dormant and not-so-dormant volcano falling/finding for love, all this is depicted via singing and beautifully crafted images that oozes with color and life. As short movies come and go, I was touched by its tale but at the very core it was pretty simple and flat for Pixar's standard and this doesn't indicate that it was bland, the message was very clear but it just lacks that extra level of creativity that's very well honed by Pixar. Getting to the bone of the topic, Inside Out is a story that asks the viewer a question, what if, just what if our feelings/emotions had characters and what if in a secret compartment in our head, each of these feelings ranging from, fear, happiness, sadness, disgust and anger controlled our reactions towards situation that arise in our daily life. For each and every human being the main emotion in control differs, some people are extremely joyous and for them \"joy\" will be the central figure, while others are very short tempered and for those you have \"anger\" being the boss. This is the fundamental concept behind Inside Out, we live through the life of Riley from a first person and third person point of view, gaining deep inside on how each and every actions of hers is managed and well-maintained for her betterment and how these emotions despite having definite characteristics all root for Riley's overall happiness. Inside Out is a pretty complicated movie that explains how the feelings function through well-explained exposition that ensures it's best to not feel too preachy but you do feel there's tons of topic to go through in order to fully enjoy the meal that is Inside Out. From, how do short term memory, long term memory, memory dumps, central core memories, imagination land to abstract thinking, *phew* the list goes on and on. I did wonder at one point how would a child crunch on all these information loaded to them, would they fully understand it or at the least get a rough idea enough to enjoy the hijinks of the emotions. Inside Out does all it can to keep it kid-friendly with comical explanation, bizarre situations that span out in each area to further tackle the different worlds within the brain all packed full with comedy, slapstick and whatnot. Though I sincerely believe, Inside Out is an animation disguised as a kid's film meant for adults who still have a little kid in them. It doesn't go absolutely Nolan on us, but just enough to keep us wondering and hoping for much more, if only school taught us science like this, if only. The plot starts out with decent pacing to flesh out the characters both in the head and those in the flesh of the character and give us a rather welcoming feel to this new Pixar world. The very crux of the movie lies when Happy and Sadness go on journey in the brain when a technical accident occurs in the central core, leaving fellow emotions lost in a maze of creativity trying the best to get back to the central core because even you could imagine how one's life would be without happiness and sadness and there's where the plot's true moral of the story comes in, the punchline. I did not see it coming and I bet it will keep you guessing what's coming next and hit you in the face like a sucker punch of packaged emotions. A very good lesson to learn in life in fact, something very relatable and agreeable. There is no such thing as completely one emotion to live your life through and the sooner you accept it, the happier you will embrace your life, this is well the vague spoiler-free version, but you'll get the gist of it. The characters aren't one dimensional, one trick-ponies, no sir. Even though, they are an embodiment of one emotion, say \"Happiness\" one could argue, how could there be character development if the very existence of said character is to be happy. Well, Pixar is prepared to prove you wrong together with the jolly Amy Poehler voicing \"Joy\" the protagonist, or to be more precise the true protagonist behind the scene of Riley's mind, on a personal level, knowing that Park and Rec fame Amy Poehler giving life to this character only felt natural and in fact an extension of her character from the television show, an extended acting if you will. The characters evolve and you as a viewer would love one character one point and switch to disliking it midway and at the very end(hopefully) accepting both of them for what they are, as how the character accept the reality of the situation. The emotions aren't the only ammo in this shell-case, there's a wide variety of side-characters and namely one unforgettable hero, Bing Bong, a truly misunderstood character with a very tragic life. Even if Riley forgot Bing Bong, I promise I won't. This is where Pixar shines, even if Bing Bong is a side-character, a plot device to attune Joy and Sadness towards their right path, he still shines wonderfully with heart. As Joy and Sadness, learn about each other through their travels we too as viewers engage in that well-crafted relationship that starts rather straight out obvious and absolutely taking a 360 degrees turn into unknown territory, a volatile yet satisfying relationship. We connect with the characters on an emotional level and manly tears were shed upon multiple occasions where you could feel the grit and passion of these characters through hardship and sacrifice, a bond like no other. Comedy is top notch, there is the usual slapstick comedy meant for kids, the adults would just pass a smile and there is the universal bone-tickler that sees no age or maturity. A lot of clever jokes too and some even touching DreamWorks crude adult humor, all-in-all, comedy for the whole family, Pixar never goes wrong here. Usually I'd discuss in length on how well the CG is executed with the expected usage of the word \"eye-candy\" but through my experience I was so lost in the largely built worlds within the brain that I did not actively start picking up on creative technical cues. At the same time the CG isn't truly groundbreaking but lives to meet the expectation that we expect from a Pixar outing. Inside Out is Pixar's game on face, I can't wait to experience \"The Good Dinosaur\" which hits cinema near the end of this year. With an extraordinary story infused with loveable characters and jolly good comedy, Inside Out is a masterpiece to stay in our minds and hearts like its predecessors, ever memorable. I would really love to visit the world of Inside Out again, there is so much more to be explored in the brain, character dynamics and emotions to be discovered even, who knows, maybe one fine day. On the downside, there are some plot holes that occur directly close to the epic finale, whether the director noticed it through the chaotic sequence or not would be a good debate but it does make one wonder whether this method of reaching the central core could have been achieved much earlier instead of having an insane number of Uncharted/Tomb Raider bad luck moments with crumbling skyscrapers to so-close-but-not-that-close moments but luckily it doesn't deter the experience as a whole, noticeable but forgivable. PS: The end credits is a jolly good one, we enter the minds of various people that the character Riley meets throughout her life including dogs and cats. A fun take-out, clearly to put a smile on your face after that emotional ending.",

It is brave in that it refuses to talk down to it's audience or to spoon-feed its message. Great animation, jokes for all ages and realistic characters all round.If I had to make a criticism it would be that I would have liked to see more of the other characters, who felt slightly undeveloped. Phyllis Smith as Sadness, however, was an inspired casting choice!With the critical and box office success of this film, and living in the sequel-obsessed age that we are, we will no doubt meet Riley again, inside and out.",

    "review": "  The concept of Inside Out is one which you could expand at least into twenty films. Focusing on the five different emotions (joy, sadness, fear, anger, disgust) inside the head of its main character, the 11-year old Riley, the film inevitably makes you think what would all this look like from the perspective of a teenager, a senior, or your own. But regardless, this is a film in which everyone can find something to relate to. Inside Out is every bit as heartfelt, funny and instructive as you'd expect from Pixar, but it's also surprisingly thoughtful and multi-layered. The surrealistic adventures of the different emotions (displayed as brilliantly comic caricatures) inside Riley's head are not just ludicrous madness, but a constant reflection of what's happening in reality and what Riley is going through. Unpicking all the clever metaphors and parallels that writer-director Peter Docter and his writing team have injected into the film is what makes it a masterwork worthy of repeated viewings. But above all, Inside Out touches your heart with its beautifully human central message: emotions, even difficult ones, are something that everyone just have to learn to accept, and sadness is just as inevitable and necessary as joy. To say that a film makes you feel better about yourself and makes you want to be more open when it comes to emotional difficulties is a praise that few films deserve these days.",

This movie's over-arching themes are complex and mature; showing us the serious side of Pixar. Giving us a glimpse into the depth of their writing talent. I definitely recommend this film to ANYONE over the age of 20 to re-experience the joy and imagination of childhood.",

    "review": "  Inside Out is one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. I'm writing this on my phone right now, just right after walking out of the cinemas. Animation is only for children? Puh-lease. Inside Out proves otherwise.I honestly feel like Inside Out wasn't made for tweeny boopers; it was made for it's older audience, the audience that grasps its message fully and tuck it into their long term memory. I feel more moved than it than ever. It's hard to write a review without spoiling anything, so I'll just say this: Inside Out will remind you of your childhood. It will remind you of growing up, and everything that goes along with it. And most importantly, it will remind you how to feel.But the best part of Inside Out is that is says this: it's okay to feel sad. It's okay to feel lonely. It's okay to feel hurt, and angry, and scared, and disgusted. All these emotions are natural and needed and they work together. I'm so glad this movie was made; it's so timely and wonderful. It's the movie we never knew we needed.This may not prove a point because I cry in movies a lot (I cry way too easily. Guess sadness is in charge during movie marathons.) but I'll say it anyway - Inside Out broke my heart and made me cry more times than any movie has ever had. There were so many emotional moments and never once did they feel forced or manipulating - they felt so raw and genuine, making touching its audience feel effortless.This movie is not one to be missed. It's well worth the admission price. And I'll be rooting for it for all of the awards shows next year...but wait....The Little Prince...Congratulations, Pixar. You did it again.",

    "review": "  This is such a smart and clever animated movie about our feelings, personalities, and how we change. I'm sure some of the concepts and messages built into the film may be lost on the younger set, but the complexity of what is presented is surprisingly digestible due to the imaginative yet enlightening internal world of the mind created in the film.The movie certainly has its humorous parts, but there definitely were some pretty poignant moments as well. I really appreciated how the movie stayed true to itself by letting us feel all the emotions... joy, fear, anger, disgust, and fear. It could have let us coast on the positivity of joy, but beyond the creative animation this movie demonstrated real emotional depth. It eloquently illustrates the fact we are humans that feel a range of emotions, and it can in fact be harmful if we don't allow ourselves to feel them. This is a great films for kids and adults alike. Kids learn important lessons about expressing their feelings and how they can overcome challenges. And for adults, the movie creatively reveals all that can go on inside of us and others; and that with that understanding we are reminded to let ourselves and others feel what we need to feel. We gain insight that denying our emotions may stifle our personal growth and connection with others.",

It's simple in message but that message is a fundamentally necessary one; opening up a dialogue about feelings and emotions is something our society needs, perhaps now more than ever, and I'm so glad we have a film like this for young children and adults alike to enjoy, discuss and possibly (definitely) cry over. Conceptually, it's intriguing and highly original, and while it may get convoluted at times, by the end its message is plain for all to see. If it's a choice between this and the Minions, see this one.",

    "review": "  Taking moviegoers in and out and shaking all about a young girl to her emotional core, Pixar's awe-strikingly creative latest charts among the studio's best and ballsiest. Talk about cerebral. Of course, Pixar always appeals to gray matter as much as the funny bone, but this psychological amusement park ride takes it to a whole other level. You know how people knock small jobs with the dismissive expression 'It isn't brain surgery'? Well, Inside Out kind of IS brain surgery. It's no small job to literally characterize emotions and show how they have to work together to form a well-balanced person. But this inventive family flick accomplishes this and elicits a great deal of true emotion from the audience as well. The sputtering breakdown Cars 2 notwithstanding, Pixar vows to never release a feature until it's as good a film as the animation house is capable of creating. Inside Out proves no exception to this rule, succeeding on most every level. Informative without being too brainy and funny without being too pedestrian, the film nonetheless represents a huge gamble for Pixar. Perhaps, the film's only brain freeze proves to be the fact that, despite the winning characters, it goes above the head of the younger set. The Junior Freud explanations will confuse anybody under 6, but the writers nonetheless do an expert job of breaking down a rational animal into a team sport. In this G-rated animated flick, a young girl's emotions get plunged into chaos as they compete for control of her mind after she leaves her friends and moves to a new home across the country. It takes one of their most expert craftsmen and biggest risk-takers, to mold and shape this high-concept cartoon into a highly entertaining biology lesson. Pete Docter (Up) deserves much credit for thinking outside of the box by going inside the head. Thankfully, in Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness, he gives us amazing characters with - ironically - a good amount of emotional depth. A pitch-perfect voice cast including Amy Poehler, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Bill Hader and Phyllis Smith, however, colors in these colorful characters all the more.Bottom line: Emotional Rescue",

    "review": "  Inside out is a profound movie about human emotions and the emotions I felt while watching this movie was Joy and Sadness(on the verge of tears at 2 points) which are the two most dominant emotions portrayed in the film. I was awed at the messages,themes and ideas the film presented and it clearly shows that Pixar is the master of western animation. This is Pixar's return to form since 2010's Toy Story 3 and the second best and most creative movie of 2015 thus far. All the emotions have excellent voice acting and Lewis Black was hilarious as Anger. This movie is definitely aimed at adults more so than kids as some of its lessons might fly over most younger kids heads. I love how the film makers respected children and did not have stupid poop/fart jokes to entertain them and actually had some intelligent jokes which were catered to the adults as well. The animation was excellent and I dug the score as well. Inside out is a movie that every parent should bring their child to see and not only will the child learn some valuable lessons about life but the parents themselves might learn a few things. A+",

The story arch is starting to become a bit of a formula for the animation studio, but not one that has entirely grown to be unwelcomed yet. The characters are excellent and iconic and the heart of the film, an oddly succesful blend of real life struggles for preteens leaving friends behind and a moral story about how humans and our lifes are a complicated mix of various emotions that in the end all defines us, actually works. But it is in the small moments of pixaresque insanity and brilliance the film really stands out, like the mid-credit sequences.While not among the best we have seen in animation films the last couple of decades, it is definetly worth watching, but nothing in it justifies the ticket price for the theater when a home cinema can deliver the same results.",

    "review": "  Inside Out is a funny, heartwarming, and deep journey into the human mind. Pixar has a filmography that's hard to match, and things will remain that way if they keep putting out films of this caliber. As per usual the story is well crafted, and inventive, but the most impressive thing is the use of humor to help the moments of true drama. By that I mean the film has a relatable humor, that anybody can laugh at and have a good time with, so when the film decides to get serious it hits the audience even deeper. This something Pixar's always been good at, but this movie has some of the most touching moments since Up. On top of the brilliant use of humor, the visuals are stunning, the voice acting is perfect, and the characters are surprisingly well crafted. In the end Inside Out is one of Pixar's best films in the last 5 years, and is worth seeing on the big screen.",

    "review": "  Pixar kicks start the film with a beautiful opening score and slowly introduces the emotion characters throughout the platform of a simple normal growth experience of an 11-year-old girl. The plot is familiar but the creativity and conceptualisation of Pixar to tell the story from inside the mind of a girl using five different emotions - joy, sadness, anger, disgust and fear have brought their latest picture to secure the Oscars. Not only focusing on the emotions, the story further expands into memories (short/ long-term and core memories), imagination, dreams and forgetfulness in a fantastic landscape to construct the feeling, mind, reaction and soul of the main character. This original approach connects well both the adults and children, emotionally engaging, entertaining, visually colorful and inspiring. The level of intellectual and emotional daring are consistent until the end of this major emotion animation, reminding audiences the balancing of all these five feelings that leads to the human's capability of love and affection.",

    "review": "  - Inside OutBranded as the first original Pixar movie since Brave (which was barely an \"original\" film), Inside Out is exactly what anyone would expect to see in a \"good\" Pixar Movie: masterfully written, grand in ambition, effortlessly joyful and undeniably moving.With the \"what-if\" idea that is usually present in classic Pixar films, Pete Docter decides to focus on one single coming-of-age girl, in what is actually a coming of age film, disguised as an animated film. The film started out with Riley opening her eyes for the first time. Appeared in her mind was Joy, as she provides voice-over of her first few seconds with Riley. Then came Sadness, who Joy fears the most. After that, the headquarters got bigger with Fear, Disgust and Anger, each with their own responsibility and task to keep Riley, well, Riley. Each of their actions creates memories, with some memories turning into \"Core Memories\", which form Riley's personality, and in Riley's head, islands. After 11 years of being in charge of Riley's mind, Joy still can't figure out Sadness' duties and responsibilities. One day, Riley's family moved to San Francisco, which caused chaos in Headquarters. Joy tried to keep Riley on a happy mood, but on the first day of school, Sadness accidentally affected a Core Memory with sadness, and as Joy tries to keep everything in place, Joy was sucked into the Memory Tube, as well as Sadness, as they are dumped down to Long-Term Memories. Upon trying to find a way out, Sadness and Joy stumbled across Riley's former imaginary friend, Bing Bong. Bing Bong agreed to help Sadness and Joy back to The Headquarters, but only if Joy agrees to remind Riley of Bing Bong again. Back at Headquarters, Fear, Anger and Disgust struggled to keep Riley the same person, but was unable to and as a result, spiraled Riley's life out of control, as she sassed her parents and ditched her friends. Anger then came up with an \"Idea\", which was shown as a lightbulb in the film, for Riley to run away from home. Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong must get back to Headquarters on time in order to bring Riley back to her life.Pixar was in a crisis phase before they had Inside Out, with their qualities dwindling because of their lack of original ideas and over reliance on unfavorable sequels (looking at you Cars 2) after it's collaboration with Walt Disney Pictures With Inside Out, Pixar brought back one of it's core players, Pete Docter (the man behind Monster Inc., Up) and boy, was it a masterstroke. Described by many as Docter's passion project, Docter took full advantage of his creative freedom with the film to craft an imaginary land inside a little girl's head, which was visually stunning and colorfully broad. The script itself is going down in history as one of the few original ideas left in Hollywood that manages to connect with a wide variety of audience: everyone has been through rough patches, whether it is moving houses, socially crippled or puberty, basically, but the script masterfully, and deliberately, hid it behind all the inventiveness and originality of the film. The layers of the story perfectly align with the film's hidden tone (a girl who is having difficulties with growing up decides to run away from home), powered with delightfully-written dialogue and emotional segments, especially the deeply written third act of the movie, which was one of the most memorable sequence of the decade, that ended with most of the audience reaching for the tissues (if they had prepared one)It was aided by colorful characters, which were memorable in their own rights: the optimistic Joy, the moody Sadness and the imaginative imaginary friend Bing Bong (we all had one, you know, the one who cries candies, is an animal-fantasy creature hybrid and had a rocking spaceship) to name a few. The character development doesn't take a huge role in the film, but as the film progresses, we can see how the characters have grown out of their original ideas, with Joy being more down-to-earth and calm, Sadness being happier (which wasn't supposed to happen, but since this is an animated movie, even a flying house is considered normal) and Riley being more mature. All of the film's more subtle messages were delivered with poignance through the development of the characters, not words, which is a huge achievement in it's own right.The voice actors also did a spectacular job in capturing their animated counterparts. Amy Poehler was delightful to listen to as Joy, while Phyllis Smith stole the show with her down-beat but undeniably wonderful performance as Sadness. Speaking of sounds, how about the score ? In a film that is already filled with brisk animation and an inventive script, the score, by the beloved Michael Giacchino still managed to be the stand out of the show, energizing moments of joy, fear, anger and sadness (pardon the pun), and further push the film's climax (Riley reuniting with her parents) into a tearjerking sequence. For all the people who have seen the film, who didn't cry ? How could you not cry ? HOW ?In the end, the film's poignant subject matter about a young girl who has to move away from her hometown, has trouble coping with her new life, and in the end tried to run away even pushed the boundaries of the film's greatness even more (Imagine what would happen if this was helmed by Brian De Palma). The defining original film of the century (evenly matched by Inception), Inside Out sits unopposed on top of The Best Animated Film of The Decade, eclipsing each and every aim on Pixar's checklist. Beautifully crafted, wonderfully written and deeply loved, Inside Out is the equivalent of Citizen Kane in the animated worldPerfect in every single way possible. 100/100.",

The clever ideas and excellent voice-acting (specifically Richard Kind's role as \"Bing-Bong,\" Riley's invisible friend) that Pixar is known for are still there; the only thing that knocks it down a peg for me is that while the concept is another grand idea from the filmmakers (as is the main message of the film, how we inevitably change as people as we grow up), ironically the story itself feels kind of small and isolated. I would have liked to see more of how Riley and the rest of her life was affected by what was going on internally with her emotions and less of a focus on the adventure of Joy (Amy Poehler) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) trying to get back to \"headquarters.\" As an additional note, Michael Giacchino delivers yet another incredible score for the film.",

Yet many fans consider post Toy Story 3 films to be the dark age of Pixar. However not only does this film break Pixar's losing streak but it shines alongside the other greatest films they have made. And ironically, they do it with a cast of 1 dimensional characters. How? The audience knows that it's the concept of the Emotions to have only one personality so it never feels stale or out of place. The parallel stories match perfectly and the fictional logic behind the inner workings of the mind are so possible that it makes anyone think that this fantasy world really does exist in all of us.",

    "review": "  Wow.... a 5* film? I very, very rarely give 5 stars, but I felt it really was that good! It was moving, funny, uncomfortable, joyful and sad. I have to commend the great voice acting, crisp sound, excellent animation, and a really original idea paced perfectly.At last Pixar have moved away from some of their pointless sequels and have created a work of genius. This is a shoe-in for the animated film Oscar, and dare I say it, it deserves to be nominated for Best Film.This was an awesome fantastical ride from start to finish.The film explores (amongst other things) abstract thought, the complexity of memory (e.g. how you can at one moment remember the most inane things, but can lose hold of your dearest core memories), depression, joy, and the human subconscious.Pete Docter was the man behind Up, and Monsters Inc, and I think he's matched and just about beaten both of them here (although don't get me wrong, both of those films are amazing!).Usually there are pop culture references throughout Pixar films, but here they were scarce, and it worked. When they were used, it was to good effect (\"opinions and facts - they look so similar!\"). By keeping the \"human\" characters simple (and in places quite stereotypical) it allowed me to really focus on the fantastical characters who carry the real plot, and empathise with the humans.This is great for kids and adults alike, but unlike other Pixar films where it is just excellent, this worked on completely different levels for different people. I am pretty sure, that adults, teens, kids, singles, and couples would all get something different and equally beneficial from the film. I would probably say being a parent gave it a whole new level for me as well - I'd be surprised if any parent didn't appreciate this film.Reflecting on the story now, I wonder if the adventure was causing the protagonist Riley to act the way she did, or was what she was doing causing the story with Joy, Sadness, Rage, Disgust and Fear to occur? The great thing is that both directions work equally well. The former is a great rollercoaster ride like most Pixar films, and the latter is a psychologically moving drama. I will be very surprised if you can make it through this film without almost shedding a tear at least once!At its most abstract, it reminded me of Fantasia, and at its deepest it would probably make Freud smile.For me, it's one of the best depictions of depression put to film. Loads of films still show people crying lots and just being \"very sad\" when they are 'depressed'. But here it was the absence of joy and sadness that really showed depression. Watching a child with an absence of joy and sadness, watching her personality crumble and be replaced with an emptiness that only fear, disgust and anger could fill, was rather heart-rending. What made it genius is that it was still exceptionally funny in places, and stay a really fun film. It never stopped being a film that kids would enjoy and get a lot from, and stayed true to being a film that was at heart discussing the importance of sadness in your life. It had unsentimental morals that really aren't common in American films for children. I really liked that it treated it's young audience as if they had brains, and that they were not just there for some yawn cartoony ride with a pointless dance off at the end (cue latter Shreks, Hotel Transylvania, A.N. Other CGI Animation, etc).There is a lot of simplicity in the film too (e.g. humans don't just have 5 emotions, and the parent's brains were very stereotypical), but I found that a clever way to direct the audience to give the fantasy it's full attention and not be distracted by side stories.It's not at all a departure from other Pixar fare, but I felt it was doing much more than just tell a story and that pushed it into the \"favourite\" category.Some people may feel that it's too ambitious, and didn't really hit its mark, but I just feel that that may be because there was a LOT to get out of this in one sitting. Not only will I have to (and want to) watch this again, but I am pretty sure I will pick up something new every time. For example, it was really interesting to see that the mum's head was captained by Sadness, not because she was sad, but because she is comfortable with having sadness in her life. Everything put to screen seems to have a meaning - from the islands, to the deep memory, to the disintegrating memories (startlingly adult), to the subconscious, to the imagination, to Bing Bong (who for me was the unsung star in the whole film).It's a drama, a comedy, a road movie, a buddy movie, a coming of age story, and of course a brilliant animation. It's all so surprisingly smart!Best animation of the year? Maybe best film of the year. I can see this becoming a favourite fun film at kids birthday parties and at the same time being discussed in classrooms.",

Yes it is fully animated, CGI, Disney movie for kids, yadda yadda yadda but the thrill (yes there're lotsa thrill) and the tense in between every dire situation faced by Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong make you anticipate what's gonna come up next! And then there're Anger, Fear and Disgust trying to solve the problem by creating even more problems. But the one criterion I love the most in this movie is how the production team expressed what's going on inside our head. I would give this movie 5/5 if Sadness wasn't being too much emo through the whole movie.",

The adventure on top is just icing on the cake. I'm just somewhat underwhelmed by the lack of exploration with the other three core \"emotion\" members (anger, fear and disgust) Like Sadness I think they're a lot more interesting as perceptively \"negative\" emotions. Instead Joy gets an unprecedented amount of focus that I just don't care for.Inside Out is a great \"journey\" adventure, but a missed opportunity to simplify and explore the complexities of its own cast.",

It is not only that it has translated to a visual language complex thoughts as those related with our thinking, but also shows the value of sadness, the importance of growing and also accept the bad things that happens in life, focusing in an aspect not very underlined in movies for children -depression in kids.

Even 'Lava', the beautiful short film that premiered before Inside Out itself. The movie tells you the story of Riley and her internal emotional struggles when her family is forced to move across the country. The way that the filmmakers portrayed the emotions was unlike anything I had ever seen. In particular scenes, the audience was watching Riley, or her parents think through things just as I normally would. You move from fear of something, to anger, and onto sadness. You ride the waves of the emotions, but once those emotions were given a personality and a character all their own I found a much deeper level to how we think about our emotions. Imagine if your sadness that you feel every day had a personality. Had emotions of her own. Was a complex and unique person just like us, with motivations and feelings. It gave purpose to Joy's actions be them just or misguided. It gave meaning to the relationship between Joy and Sadness, or Anger and Fear. It is a beautiful movie that truly moved me. One of the best I've seen this year and quite possibly the best Pixar has ever made.",

This film just takes one of the first rules or filmmaking (Show, Dont Tell) and slaps it right in the face. There's so much exposition spat at you that within the first 10 or 15 minutes, you can form the entire plot, character arcs and twists straight away. The design here is lacking the immagination or other Pixar movies and is nowhere near the level of eye-candy we've some to expect from animated features. The story felt forced, and I found it difficult to give a damn about any of the characters, the main two are downright boring/irritating/unlikeable. Side characters are great though, making it tolerable, and were animated really well, but the film lacked substance and heart of other Pixar films. There were a few gags in here that made me laugh, but mostly I was rolling my eyes in frustration at plot-holes and those horrible \"golf-clap\" moments. Definitely one you can buy on DVD and play for you 5-year-olds on a loop to keep them busy with purdy colours, but far from films that anyone of teenage and up would enjoy (Like pretty much all of their other films) Hard to beleive this comes from the guy who made Monsters Inc. and Up,",

    "review": "  I actually saw this movie several weeks ago. I just haven't been able to come up with a lot of in depth things to say about it; at least not enthusiastically. This seems to happen to me a couple of times a year. A highly anticipated movie starts generating a lot of buzz with critical acclaim and with great word of mouth which gets me pumped to see it. I then see it; I like it, but don't love it. Skyfall, Captain America 2, Lego Movie, and now Inside Out.I've never been a die-hard Pixar fan. I do really like most of their stuff, but they've clearly seen better days. It seems since Toy Story 3, Pixar has been in a slump. We got a sequel nobody wanted (Cars 2), a prequel nobody wanted (Monsters University), and a creatively bankrupt bait n' switch (Brave). Don't get me wrong, Inside Out is a good solid movie that has a lot going for it and it is a step in the right direction for Pixar.Inside Out's premise is very intriguing. A young girl named Riley whose emotions are manifested within her mind as real characters: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. These characters collectively represent Riley as a person as they each play a role in her life and upbringing. As she gets older and goes through life-changing situations, her emotions become conflicted and at odds with each other. This is easily the deepest, most complex movie Pixar has ever conceived. Although not at all an ORIGINAL concept, it is still very creative and thought provoking. Everything going on in the mind is visually represented here. Core memories, the Train of Thought, memory dumps and many many others. It's very clear really smart people worked on this story and they go straight for the jugular on its emotional impact. This is a movie everybody can relate to and I will admit, I got a bit teary-eyed toward the end during a final moment between Riley and her parents.So why aren't I over the moon about this movie? It's very creative, beautifully animated, and is universally relatable. For me, Inside Out is so deep, so mature, so... emotional that it often forgets to have fun. Oh, there are fun moments, but they are completely drowned out by the heaviness of Riley's increasingly chaotic inner thoughts. I can't remember the last time I've seen so much crying in a movie. It just wasn't very pleasant to watch at times because the movie rarely ever takes a break to lighten up the mood which can make it seem dull at times. When I watch a Pixar film, I expect to be entertained as well as emotionally moved and Inside Out just didn't do enough entertaining for me to fully love it.Inside Out is a respectable step in the right direction for Pixar, but I still don't think they're fully \"back\" yet. I did enjoy it and I'm sure most others will too.",

    "review": "  How often do we believe that something deep down in our mind, the inner voices can propel us to react in a different manner. And then, it is termed to be called as a \"Reaction\". Thats what the latest PIXAR movie is all about. Pete Doctor of \"UP\" fame has created a new world with new rules. It sets your tryst with Imagination from the second one when the movie starts off with the \"little baby smiling with JOY and then crying out in SADNESS.Throughout the film, the movie entails you with the journey of Joy and Sadness to regain the core memories from Riley's Mind. It includes the downfall of Dream Islands, questions that whether they would be able to make it to Headquarters before things get more goofed up and the new characters that they come across throughout their journey. After all this happens, the END is what makes this movie a top notch one. Its heartwarming, sentimental and leaves you with a feeling of happiness that you can carry out after the movie ends. In recent times, when the studio has faltered with movies like BRAVE and CAR2, INSIDE OUT comes out as a resurgent effort from the Studio. And yes!! it comes out with flying colors. A true GEM, A true winner all the way.",

    "review": "  Just got back from my 3rd viewing of Inside Out, and I have seen portions in the theater numerous more times. Rating: Flawless I absolutely adore this film, definitely the best of the year for me and I cannot think of another movie I have enjoyed this much in some time. This film captivates you from the moment it starts rolling and never misses a beat. The fantastic and emotional journey you take along the way with the complex character culminates in a heartwarming climax. The actors that bring the voices to life are perfect for the roles that they play, even if some of them are type-casted. The leads of Amy Poehler as Joy and Phyllis Smith as Sadness are amazing, and supported by everyone else as well. My personal favorite is Bill Hader as Fear, since he is the main source of humor which we know he does wonderfully. The concept is refreshingly creative and presented in a beautiful artistic manner. Once the movie starts rolling with the different emotions and how the brain saves memories you latch on and become invested. As the film continues to build on its concepts you get to enjoy more complex aspects and move into other people's emotions, but it never feels like a gimmick. The last part that I have to mention is the moving score by Michael Giacchino. The piano in the beginning and every time that is presented afterwards gives you the fuzzies. This is one of the best animated films made to date, I will own it and love it for all time.",

    "review": "  I went with my family to see Inside Out today and I really think we must have watched a different film to everyone else. We don't go to the cinema that often as it's difficult enough to find a film that will suit both my 4 year old daughter and 8 year old son, who have understandably pretty opposite tastes in films. None the less, based on trailers and good reviews we had high hopes for Inside Out. We were very disappointed. I think I've seen it described as\"poignant and joyful\" which I will now take to read as dismal and depressing with the odd funny moment. From a promising start it took us on a slow plod of a journey into depression to a bizarrely rushed upbeat ending. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film, it could just have been a lot better (or at least a lot more funny and a lot less depressing). The bits with the banter between the different emotions were very good, and had the film focused more on those and less on the increasingly tedious attempts of Joy and Sadness to get back to HQ it would have been a far better film. By the umpteenth obstacle that got cast in their path I just wanted the film to end - this was not helped by my four year old spending most of the film curled up on my lap asking when the nasty film was going to end. In her own words she found it too sad, too scary and too boring. It is probably not the best Pixar film to take very young children to. So on to my eight year old. His summary - \"Ok but dull\". Not a real winner there either. I don't think it's one we will be buying on DVD.",

Usually, that means they are only fun for the youngest age bracket of movie watchers and the rest of us are just waiting for it to be over. Pixar is my exception to this rule. Toy Story is one of my favorite movie trilogies. I laughed out loud at Finding Nemo, Up, Monsters Inc, and so on. Not everything they have done is gold, I admit. After a few that were okay at best, I was starting to worry that the glory days of pixar were behind us. Well, Inside Out was my confirmation that they still know how to get the job done. Not only was the inside of a young girl's mind the perfect setting for a Pixar movie, it was done exactly how it should be. It was funny and clever from start to finish, and at the same time, it was a very honest and touching perspective on growing up. The scene towards the end when everything is put in perspective is perfect, and I have the feeling it's going to stick with me for a long time. Thanks, Pixar. Let's never fight again.",

From the outset Inside Out looks like it shouldn't work, a film pretty much playing out entirely inside the mind of an eleven year old girl. Unsurprisingly it works and on many levels managing to offer something for everybody no matter the age or gender. Very young children may struggle but older kids will love the well designed characters and beautifully developed worlds. Adults will very likely be left a sobbing mess and that's before the main film even begins as the 'short' beforehand LAVA is wonderful.Very possibly Pixar's best film.",

    "review": "  I finally went to a viewing to see what all the hype for this movie was about, and BOY what an emotional ride it was!! Disney/Pixar's latest animation feature film showcases the journey that \"emotions\" living inside a little girl's mind embark on as the girl's family copes with a big transition in life. I have to say the pacing for this film was so impeccable from beginning to end, I couldn't find a single scene that felt like it was stalling or drifting away from the storytelling; the humorous moments were spot-on, while almost all of the emotional moments were so strong, they brought me to tears (and FYI it's been a very, very long while since the last time a movie made me cry this much). The only bit of complaint I have is that they actually used the juiciest bit of the entire movie in the trailer for the film (which BTW I'm pretty sure most of us have already seen a million times); I wish they had included even more of the firing-back-and-forth between each of the characters' emotions. And oh, did I mention that the graphics in this film looked fantastic? As with most Pixar films, people may think they're just for kids. But if you look more closely, you'll find that a lot of the underlying messages can also be applied to adult situations as well; especially with this movie, I think many grown-up people (including me) will find something in it that they can relate to. This film is magical, the way Disney/Pixar films are meant to be. For me, it replaces Wall-E as my favorite Pixar film of all time. A noteworthy mention also goes to the animated short that plays before the actual film itself titled \"Lava\"; despite the fact that it depicts singing volcanoes, it also boasts a tearjerking storyline that rivals that of the feature film itself, and deserves to be seen and cherished on its own. I'm boldly predicting at this point that both \"Lava\" and \"Inside Out\" will go on to win Best Animated Short and Best Animation, respectively, at the Oscars next year. Hiro's Score: 5/5",

    "review": "  Congratulations San Francisco, you've ruined pizza.We are all filled with emotions that impact our feelings and memories; of which, include Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear, and Disgust. Riley is a twelve year old that has life made in Minnesota with her friends, school, and hockey team. One day her family has to move for her dad's job to San Francisco. The transition causes her memory system to hit a glitch and historic memories start transitioning from happiness to sadness. The emotions will need to work together to discover what's wrong and fix it.\"For this we gave up the Brazilian helicopter pilot?\"Pete Docter (Up and Monster's Inc) and Ronaldo Del Carmen (episodes of Freakazoid) collaborate to deliver Inside Out. The storyline for this picture is very good and well thought-out. I enjoyed how the plot comes together and the conclusion is perfect. The animation is classic Pixar and first rate and the voices fit the characters well. The voices were provided by Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Diane Lane, Bill Hader, and Richard Kind. \"I cry candy.\"This was recently playing at the drive-in with Ant-Man so we had to go see it. My daughter loved this movie and was glued to it from beginning to end. I loved the concept and how it was written. This isn't an all time classic, but in-line with the Toy Story Sequels and Wreck-it-Ralph. I strongly recommend seeing this gem and it is borderline worth adding to your DVD collection.\"I'm starting to envy the dead mouse.\"Grade: B+",

Amy Poehler is as lovable as ever as Joy and Phyllis Smith acts the perfect foil as Sadness. The rest of the emotion crew, including Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling), are equally hilarious. Richard Kind as Bing Bong the Imaginary Friend, however, may take the prize as the standout character with his wonderfully absurd and heartfelt antics. The film's plot suffers a bit from predictability, but is held up in the end by those trademark Pixar \"feels\". Overall, a great trip to the movies (especially if you can avoid the kiddies).",

It's teaches people that it's ok to be emotional once in a while, and that your emotions are here to help you. With almost unanimous praise for this masterpiece of a film, I say to the great Mr Docter, that you would be crazy not to bless this film (and Up) with a sequel.

The film explores the emotions of a young girl (Riley) dealing with a tough change in her life; these emotions are portrayed in the form of 5 diverse and very humorous characters. I can imagine that younger viewers will get the most 'Joy' from seeing these unique colourful characters fight over control of Riley's behaviours. As an older viewer I was impressed with how the film explores the inner workings of the mind including aspects such as the 'train of thought', 'imagination land' and how memories are stored and portrayed. With all the complexities in the human mind, Pixar has still managed to make a simple yet clever animation that keeps you smiling throughout and makes you think about the emotions that take control in your own mind. This heartfelt film concludes that you can't have joy without a little sadness and that all the different emotions work together to make us who we are. One of the best Pixar films to date is sure to make you laugh throughout and have you exploring the inner workings of your own mind.",

And then (of course) finds it again - by rehabilitating sadness because sometimes, Sadness Can Be Good. Sentimental skit, no that's not a typo, based on the premise that Joy, and her handmaiden happiness, constitute the fundamental human condition. This is of course a truth we hold to be self-evident, and therefore cannot be disproved - like by actual evidence. Best moment comes at the end (no, not for that reason) when the conceit that humans are driven by four simple emotions operating a console that becomes upgraded as we grow up (i.e, the apps get cleverer but the operator doesn't), is extended to other characters, including (best of all) a street cat (no, not that sort, an actual cat).",

Eleven year old Riley and her family leave the Mid-west for a new start in San Francisco and things don't go as planned. This setup is bizarrely the SETTING rather than the characters in this film. The main protagonists are Riley's emotions, led by Joy (Amy Poehler) whose influence has been the main one in young Riley's life so far. After all, who doesn't want to be full of joy? However, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust all start to play their part as Riley deals with the challenges of a new and unfamiliar environment, family friction, new school and growing from young childhood to those awkward teen years.I must admit, I was very unsure whether this pretty unusual premise would work. This idea that we all NEED sadness and anger to appreciate the good times, that we are all a mixture of emotions, and that different ones control us at different times is rather deep. Critics adore it, I do wonder whether children are quite as enchanted, or whether they are confused or wishing for more crashes and bangs!However, despite the philosophical thread running through the film, there is plenty of fun to be had. Amy Poehler is perfect as the chirpy Joy, trying to find a way to get back in control. The script is full of quick wit and throwaway jokes - a whole run of hilarious looks into other brains at the end was brilliant, particularly the cat! I also loved the brief visits to Riley's mum and dad's brains too.So innovative and thought provoking, this is a mini masterpiece!",

Think of it as a culmination of all the worst films you've already watched with a sprinkling of your worst fears. I'm talking clowns for all you party virgins out there. I don't think I could possibly put into words how terrible this film is. I spent about half of the film with my fist in my mouth trying to prevent myself from either screaming at the screen or just laughing tears of despair and frustration. Sadness (an extremely sad, depressed emotion living in the pits of Riley's brain) is probably the most unfortunate character one could ever have the misfortune to turn their nose up to. Think of her as the offspring of the annoying little kid from UP who everyone seems to pity because of his lack of a brain or any form of common sense and Jack Frost from Rise of the Guardians - or, even better, the disastrous result of a cruel sexual experiment between Justin Bieber and Susan Boyle. And that's putting it lightly.I can only begin to imagine the sheer temptation to throw her over the edge and into that pit of forgotten memories. How Joy managed to refrain from doing so I cannot comprehend.I would like to end this review by saying NO. Just NO. This film is one big disappointment and left me feeling, quite frankly, like a deflated walrus.Do not put yourself through an hour and 40 minutes of this. It's not worth the �7.70 you spent on it.",

I said to a staff member who has seen the movie, whom I know well, that you'd have to have a very good mental health ie not depressed etc., etc., You'd have to be very mentally strong. A girl Riley(Dias) moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. However her emotions are played upon. Emotions being Joy(Poehler), Sadness(Smith), Fear(Hader) Disgust(Kaling) and Anger(Black). Sadness keeps interfering with the Memories and the Core memories. And hence Joy and Sadness somehow get out of teh HQ, so they meet up with Bing Bong(Kind) and have many an adventures. So overall, not the best movie from PIxar. However I can sense a sequiel thou. So lets hope that'll be better. hahah",

    "review": "  This beautiful new Disney-Pixar animation passed the six laugh (and the six tears!) test easily. It's a thought-provoking, life-examining film that will stay with you for days afterwards. My friends and I enjoyed talking through the five core emotional drives (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust) and whether they do a sufficient job in summing up the human experience. I personally found the sections of the film which were OUT more compelling than those that were INSIDE, though probably 80% of the movie is the latter. I was deeply moved by 11-year-old Riley's public grief at losing her childhood home and centre of emotional gravity, and the much-trailered dinner table family interaction is hilarious. The vast bulk of the film is set inside Riley's head and it becomes a somewhat agonised quest-romp to get two of the key emotions back to the HQ and so to restore Riley's full personality. It's a fantastic gem of a movie - I just would have enjoyed it even more if there had been more outer world/inner world interaction, more actual real world plot, and more insights into the heads of other characters. I saw it with a group of people with ages ranging from 15-50, so would be intrigued to see it again with littl'uns to watch their joy, anger, disgust, fear and sadness in watching this...",

    "review": "  I didn't think that this movie lived up to the 98 percent score and critical acclaim that it got. While it was a fun and fresh story by Disney, it wasn't Frozen, Toy Story or one of the other Disney heavyweights. A definite renter especially for those with children, but I'd temper expectations a bit.",

    "review": "  Enthralling, shattering, an amazing journey... if you're an adult. Kiddies will be pleased enough by the colours and concept, but the long stretches of emotional depth and phenomenal creativity won't appeal to all of them, and combined with a lack of action and relatively non-charismatic characters, might result in quite a bit of chair kicking.",

    "review": "  There is no denying that Inside Out was the most intellectually stimulating Pixar project right from its trailers. The idea was simply brilliant and no other animated movie made me this excited in recent times. Finally we got a movie which was little of a mixed bag but with loads to charm and ingenuity. The portrayal of different emotions, variations and properties of memories and how they change once we grow up and our personalities set in were portrayed beautifully. As ever, Pixar still stands as a company which illustrates human emotions like no one else. A must watch for kids and adults alike, Inside Out is bound to win accolades and the best animated movie of this year so far.",

    "review": "  This may well go down as one of Pixars better movies in a list of movies that are all pretty good. This film follows a little girl named Riley and the emotions that control her moods and its the emotions that really make this movie. Joy, Anger, Fear, Disgust and Sadness make up the team but as Riley moves home with her parents the once joyful kid hits a bumpy path as Joy and Sadness find themselves outside of HQ leaving Anger, Fear and Disgust in charge which means they really need to find their way back. It was an awesome made movie and although aimed at kids is still an awesome watch for adults too",

This is one of the first animations in a while to make me feel like how I did as a kid watching some of those great classics, and it may have even done that better. I don't care that it's not perfect in certain respects. This film is now so close to my heart that it transcends the need for reviews anymore.",
