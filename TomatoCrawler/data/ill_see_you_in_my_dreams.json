    "review": "  A patchwork quilt of wish fulfillment and dream for all the single ladies out there, the senior single ladies. Blythe Danner is our ever elegant surrogate in this day trip to Autumn, a wineglass never far from her graceful fingers, and capably aided by friends Mary Kay Place and Rhea Perlman. The highlight: Danner's version of the delectable \"Cry Me A River\". Like many of the dreams of filmdom though no hair is ever out of place, and even an intrusive rodent seems tame and Disney- fied.",

    "review": "  Beautiful from start to finish, \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" follows Carol, a middle-aged woman who recently lost her dog, and is still getting over her late husband of 20 years. Following her as she learns to let go of certain aspects of here life and welcome in new people is just an amazing viewing experience. Blythe Danner and Sam Elliott share fantastic chemistry, as does Martin Starr. Essentially, this picture is about learning to let go, let in, and learn about life in general. There are so many hidden messages about life throughout this film, that it will demand multiple viewings. With extremely believable dialogue, superb direction, and brilliant performances, \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" may be in the tight race for my favourite film of 2015. This is as simple of a premise as you can get, but the maturity level of screenplay is cranked up to eleven, which makes it that much more engaging. To me, this little film is a revelation, I (to put it bluntly), cannot find a single thing to complain about. \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" is beautiful.",

    "review": "  I absolutely loved I'll See You in My Dreams, which opened the Cleveland International Film Fest in 2015!! It succeeds because of the funny, sweet and stellar ensemble cast. Carol Petersen (Blythe Danner) is a widow with a routine. She lives independently, but visits her three friends (Squibb, Perlman, and Place) regularly for card games at their retirement community complex. She mostly keeps to herself, always somewhat in an attitude of mourning. Quite unexpectedly she befriends her much younger pool cleaner, Lloyd, the droll Martin Starr who I've enjoyed since Freaks and Geeks. The title refers to a song that Lloyd shares with Carol. Within days another man, Bill, played by perpetual cowboy Sam Elliott, who is close to Carol's age begins flirting with her. Suddenly Carol has two men vying for her attention, paying her compliments, and encouraging her to really live life. Her friends and her daughter Katherine, played by Malin Akerman rather than her real daughter Gwyneth Paltrow, are a little puzzled by the changes in Carol but ultimately very supportive. There are heart-touching moments of sadness whether you are a retiree or you have a parent who is reaching retirement age and you realize that life doesn't need to end with isolation in what could be thirty more years of living. There are also uproarious laughs with so many comedians in this cast. This indie film was amazingly shot in 18 days and carries an energy and realistic spirit in its simple story that is especially rare.",

His Lloyd the pool boy is a truly nuanced and heart-felt turn for the comedic actor (as we witnessed in Freaks & Geeks, Party Down and all the Aptow movies). I want to be Sam Elliott. (8--1-15)",

But what happens after the primes of our lives have come and gone? This is what makes \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" such a wonderful movie. If you can make it through the first 15 minutes of the movie without shedding a tear, you are a stronger person than me. We look into the everyday life of Carol, who clearly is widowed and lives alone in a big house in Southern California. We see her waking up, going to bed, and doing everyday chores alone. Yet the movie doesn't want us to feel sorry for Carol. She herself doesn't seem to be phased by how she has had to live the las20 years of her life. Yet good things are in store for Carol, as we see her kindle a few budding romances, perform karaoke in a bar, and smoke medical marijuana with her similarly single lady friends and go on a binge trip to the grocery. All of these moments are depicted with humor, and without giving anything else a way, the movie tells us that life creeps up very fast, and there is no way to be certain you have always made the best decisions for yourself. To enjoy life and to live ifor the moment is what is important. Blythe Danner as usual is wonderful, and the tone of the film is subtle but touching.",

Following her as she learns to let go of certain aspects of here life and welcome in new people is just an amazing viewing experience. Blythe Danner and Sam Elliott share fantastic chemistry, as does Martin Starr. Essentially, this picture is about learning to let go, let in, and learn about life in general. There are so many hidden messages about life throughout this film, that it will demand multiple viewings. With extremely believable dialogue, superb direction, and brilliant performances, \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" may be in the tight race for my favourite film of 2015. This is as simple of a premise as you can get, but the maturity level of screenplay is cranked up to eleven, which makes it that much more engaging. To me, this little film is a revelation, I (to put it bluntly), cannot find a single thing to complain about. \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" is beautiful.",

    "review": "  Older, or \"mature\" Americans are one of the most under-served demographics in terms of films meant to appeal to them. Americans over 50 make up nearly 1/3 of the U.S. population. Yet, it's clear to even the most casual observer that the number of movies featuring mature themes is well under 1/3 of the movies that appear in theaters. Still, many of Hollywood's most popular actors, including Johnny Depp, Denzel Washington, Brad Pitt, Meryl Streep, Adam Baldwin and Liam Neeson, are over 50. All this makes it an unusual sight (and for those over 50, a welcome sight) when a movie with specific appeal to the AARP crowd shows up at the local multiplex. Sure, more mature Americans enjoy a variety of movies, just like all other moviegoers, but like moviegoers in all demographics, they also want to see movies to which they can relate on a very personal level. They want to be able to go to a theater and, at least some of the time, see movies that \"get\" them, that understand who they are, what their lives are like and what they care about. Unfortunately, quality films that fit that definition are few and far between. In the past decade, some of the better movies featuring more mature actors in the main roles and/or dealing with themes of particular interest to those over 50 include (in chronological order): \"The Bucket List\", \"Letters to Juliet\", \"Enough Said\", \"Last Vegas\", \"Nebraska\", \"Philomena\" and \"Grudge Match\", plus the \"Expendables\", \"RED\" and \"Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\" films. There are some excellent movies on that list, but there really weren't many more like them produced in recent years. Then there's \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" (PG-13, 1:32). So, how does that last one stack up to the others I just named?Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mother, who has an impressive body of work of her own, including the \"Meet the Parents\" films and numerous TV appearances) stars as Carol Peterson, a widow who lives alone in her comfortable Los Angeles-area house with her dog. Carol seems happy enough. She has peace and quiet, she controls her own schedule and she has friends. She makes frequent trips to a nearby retirement home to play cards with the free-spirited Sally (Rhea Perlman), the nosy Rona (Mary Kay Place) and the usually very proper Georgina (June Squibb). Carol also sometimes plays golf with Sally, and Rona occasionally stops by the house.Still, it feels like there's something missing in Carol's life and we see in her eyes and her actions that she's starting to realize it too. Carol strikes up a conversation with Lloyd (Martin Starr), the much-younger pool maintenance man and they become friends. Then she meets Bill (Sam Elliott). He's handsome, charming, self-assured and about her age. After running into Carol a couple times around town, he takes her to lunch. Soon they're going out on his boat and even Carol has to admit that she really likes him. Meanwhile, Carol's daughter, Katherine (Malin �kerman), is flying in for a visit. It's obvious that Carol and Katherine love each other, but it seems that they don't have a lot of contact and their relationship feels just a little strained. Through all these interactions, Carol seems to be gradually coming out of her shell and living her life again. Her friends and her daughter do what they can to keep Carol moving in that direction, in spite of some setbacks. And... that's about all there is to tell about \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" (while avoiding spoilers). This is a small and relatively short movie without much of a plot. It's a pleasant enough diversion and it has a few funny moments and a few touching moments, but it doesn't seem to have very much to say. We gain a greater understanding of what it's like to be getting older and living in a house by yourself, but the movie's messages are almost too subtle to be detected, and even the story's dramatic moments are too muted. The same can be said of a couple of the actors, but not the leads. Danner is a wonderful actress and Elliott oozes his trademark charisma. It's great to see them both back on the big screen. Perlman, Place and Squibb all have personality to spare, but can only do so much with this lackluster script. Ironically, it's Starr and Ackerman, the youngest members of the main cast, who lack the energy to make their characters compelling. Even the film's title doesn't say much. It only relates to the plot in a rather inconsequential way. I'm afraid I can't recommend this movie and it's a shame. Mature Americans who go to the theater hoping to see movies made with them in mind deserve better. \"C\"",

Sam Elliott and Mary Kay Place are two of my favorite actors, bringing a sensitive undercurrent to the empty shell of a script - such a waste that they had nothing to work with in the way of dialogue and character development. Rhea Pearlman brought the only zing and pep in a plodding, clich� of a story about a woman who shut her life down for the past 20 years following the death of her husband. Blythe Danner, who has always been overrated, put her all into playing Carol Peterson, a tight-lipped woman who is internalized and numb. In combination with a script that fails to ever go anywhere near deep, her character is a shell we can't feel and can barely care about. She lost me when in her fairly empty life she can't seem to make the effort to welcome her daughter or inquire about her life. A scene that brings a couple of welcome laughs, when the girlfriends get stoned together, is ruined by the implausible threat of a bust by a police officer as they walk their shopping cart back to the retirement home. This is a dreary waste of time.",

With this delay Iinadvertentlystarting hearing/seeing (without trying)reviews about the strong cast/director picture yet the film was \"ugly\"So was looking forward to the indy-ish film \"I'll See You In My Dreams\" starringthe always under the radar \"Blythe Danner\" who often plays the role of a calm,quiet/gentle Mom/Mother. But she has killer blue eyes that dance on the bigscreen. I'm not sure she's ever gotten singular, top billing in a prominentfilm yet deserves it. As she doesn't grace the big screen too often and shedeserves our undivided attention.This films \"disappoints\" but \"is not\" disappointing. Really tugs at someemotional themes while intersecting with some awesome \"golden girls\" likecomedy.Seriously, comedic jousting and talking between best friends (senior and single)Danner, June Squibb (of Nebraska fame), Rhea Perlman (Cheers) and Mary Kay Place(lots) is a home run. I, and I'm sure many others were desperate for morescreen time for this Quad Squad?they were magical. This film wanted to exploredeeper themes for Danner which were important, just not nearly as warm and fuzzy.The first 10 minutes a wonderfully poignant and accurate portrayal of her main friendshipwith her dog Hazel and the dogs subsequent euthanized death (been their 4 timesand captured very well) set forth several new paths.Closer relationship with her friends; sort of an odd lightly flirtatiousrelationship with \"the dorky pool boy\"; closer bonding with her core 4friends; exploring her 1st serious relationship since her husbands passing20 years prior (with the hunky Sam Elliot) takes quite a twist; and aconnecting with her only relative, daughter all play major themes inthis film.I like the shortness of the film (90 minutes) but in some parts it drags.Still this was a very fine film with emotional highs and lows and no doubt,that light banter between the friends stole the film and easily was worththe price of admission.",

    "review": "  I absolutely loved I'll See You in My Dreams, which opened the Cleveland International Film Fest in 2015!! It succeeds because of the funny, sweet and stellar ensemble cast. Carol Petersen (Blythe Danner) is a widow with a routine. She lives independently, but visits her three friends (Squibb, Perlman, and Place) regularly for card games at their retirement community complex. She mostly keeps to herself, always somewhat in an attitude of mourning. Quite unexpectedly she befriends her much younger pool cleaner, Lloyd, the droll Martin Starr who I've enjoyed since Freaks and Geeks. The title refers to a song that Lloyd shares with Carol. Within days another man, Bill, played by perpetual cowboy Sam Elliott, who is close to Carol's age begins flirting with her. Suddenly Carol has two men vying for her attention, paying her compliments, and encouraging her to really live life. Her friends and her daughter Katherine, played by Malin Akerman rather than her real daughter Gwyneth Paltrow, are a little puzzled by the changes in Carol but ultimately very supportive. There are heart-touching moments of sadness whether you are a retiree or you have a parent who is reaching retirement age and you realize that life doesn't need to end with isolation in what could be thirty more years of living. There are also uproarious laughs with so many comedians in this cast. This indie film was amazingly shot in 18 days and carries an energy and realistic spirit in its simple story that is especially rare.",

    "review": "  +I don't know if 2 movies of the same genre are the start of a trend but I hope so. During the second week of May I went to see \"Five Flights Up\", a movie about an elderly couple together for forty years with neither dying of Alzheimer's or any other 'old people' diseases nor were they battling with being an inter-racial couple. They were a pair who made and enjoyed a life together the only trauma being of the old man and their old dog having to climb 5 flights of stairs. The leads were played by Diane Keaton and Morgan Freeman each looking and feeling comfortable in their long term relationship and the audience believed in them.This week I saw \"I'll See You In MY Dreams\" with Blythe Danner sparkling in her role as an independent woman, a retired school teacher, who, when younger, had dabbled as a band singer, now a widow for 20 years, has a daughter who lives on the other coast and they maintain a mother/daughter relationship and friendship. She lives in her own home having enough money to maintain it along with hiring a pool boy. Her major conflict at this point in life is that she may have to put down her beloved Hazel, a dog, of 12 years. Just watching the light go out of Danner's blue eyes as the procedure is done is the dramatic moment of the movie though other things do happen.Danner plays cards with her girlfriends June Squibb, Rhea Perlman and Mary Kay Place, all who are trying to get her to move into the retirement community where they live. These are women who have adapted to being seniors who can get goofy on medical marijuana, go on a speed dating romp, play golf, talk a little 'naughty', drink some, well a lot, of wine.When Mary Kay sees Danner's pool boy leaving her house early one morning she is not above thinking what most women would think and when a handsome, virile looking, possibly Mr. Right in the form of Sam Elliot shows up in a meet cute scene you think you know where the movie is heading just as you might justifiably think you know what will happen between Danner and the pool boy Martin Starr when they go to a karaoke bar on what might be or not be a date.Directed by Brett Haley, who also wrote it along with Marc Basch, this is not a Golden Girls television situation comedy or a cougar and young man story or woman desperate for another man to make their life whole. This is a film, like \"5 Flights Up\", that looks at a group of people who have lived most of their life, are near the end, and still find aspects to explore. Actually along with \"Love Is Strange\" starring John Lithgow and Alfred Molina, these pictures show professional actors who have always supported others with first class work now doing the same with and for others giving themselves a chance to be the stars they are.PS No one ever made scarves look as good as Blythe Danner's face and eyes do!",

    "review": "  Such a delightful film in every way. Blythe Danner is radiant and lovable as Carol who is pretty much in every scene of this movie and you know why because it's a performance that you can't take your eyes off of. Right off the gate, the movie just lets out a scene that makes you want to ball your eyes out but picks back up with delightful scenes with Carol and her new pool boy played spectacularly by Martin Starr. I could watch these two talk all day their chemistry was that wonderful. It kind of threw me off because the trailers make you think this movie's focus would be more on Blythe Danner and Sam Elliot's relationship but it really is more centered around Danner and Starr at first. But when Sam Elliot comes along, you will smile and it will make your heart warm. The movie is actually more dramatic than comedic leaving the comedy to the pros Rhea Perlman, June Squibb, and Mary Kay Place. Malin Akerman and Reid Scott have great small parts that I wish were longer but were worth their time. The movie kind of plays out like a play with Blythe focused on a friendship in the first act and a relationship in the second but it flows so well and makes you want to stay with these characters longer than the movie. I thought the movie could have been a little more funnier with the light tone it was providing and I wanted more scenes with the girls and with Malin Akerman in mother/daughter bonding scenes but overall in this summer of explosions and sequels, this is definitely the best alternative if that's not your thing. Even if those are your thing, this is such a warm and loving movie that will make you want to hug the person sitting next to you in the theater. Also I'm not 100% sure if the song sung at the very end and then again in the credits is original or just a cover but if it is original, I would love to see it get a nomination for Original Song. Really beautifully written and summed up the movie. I suspect that the Globes will take this movie as a Comedy so I hope Danner is remembered by the end of the year. After seeing this, you'll scratch your head why Danner isn't a bigger star headlining more movies like this",

    "review": "  Went to this on a whim because of the great tomatometer percent (91%), and it was sweet. An older woman who loses her dog finds comfort in befriending the pool boy. She has girlfriends but hasn't been with a guy in 20 years, (which I didn't believe), then she meets Sam Elliott. Blythe carries the film effortlessly, but it didn't have enough impact or emotional punch for me to say I would recommend it. It's light and straightforward, well-acted--not uplifting or particularly moving. I would like to see how a French director would film a French version of similar subject matter.",

    "review": "  I guess I'm out of the loop given the high scores from critics and movie goers for this. It's a maudlin, saccharine, dramady for senior citizens. The plot isn't the point; it's more a mediatation on the passage of time, the meaning of life and how life's not fair. New stuff? Nah. Blythe Danner radiates elder class and beauty and Sam Elliott is always enjoyable. Carol (Danner) plays bridge at the retirement home she refuses to retire to and her gal pals are gossipy bridge partners. Along comes her pool man (no, not that pool man) who is a kindred lost soul. They bond over karaoke and becomes each other's emotional support. It's a triffle of a film and good to know that older female actors can continue to demonstrate their skills.",

    "review": "  An effecting drama with ample light touches to offset the surprisingly profound messages of life and loss. Excellent performances and heart-tugging moments abound, grabbing the audience and making an emotional impact in unexpected ways. With that said, however, the film could use some tidying up in the writing and editing departments, but those shortfalls don't significantly detract from what is an otherwise-worthwhile cinematic experience.",

But all of the cast take their turn as Martin Starr, Rhea Perlman, Sam Eliot, Mary Kay Place, June Squib and Malin Ackerman all add to the movie in their own way. The film will make you laugh and cry, and leave you feeling good. The movie is a must see.",

Amazing how a 30 year old man wrote this very moving story about people struggling throughwhat at 1st glance are \"older people problems\" but truly they are problems we often are faced with in younger years as well. Funny, sad & worth seeing for sure. All of the womeni were fantastic too but you can't blame me for the shout out to Sam :-)",
