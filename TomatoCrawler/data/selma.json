    "review": "  Such a travesty that David Oyelowo and Ava DuVernay were not nominated for Best Actor and Director Oscars. Oyelowo could and should have easily swept awards season (since McConaissance wasn't in the picture :-P) with his resonant basso and gut-rumbling delivery of MLK's marcato articulation. His dynamic gestures as well as his wide, knowing eyes carry the wins and losses of the Selma protest march and almost foreshadows the tragedy to come. Ava DuVernay's perceptive direction interweaves several concurrent threads: from the earth-shattering bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, to Annie Lee Cooper's stalwart struggles to vote, to MLK and Coretta Scott's marital strife.",

    "review": "  Combined review of Selma (2014) and Black or White (2014).There's a reason that race is regarded as the \"third rail\" when it comes to American politics. A half-century after the marches and protests, chief among them the influence of Martin Luther King Jr., the world feels just as fractious as ever when it comes to race relations. The inauguration of America's first black president was seen as a significant touchstone, but optimism has faded and recent headline-grabbing criminal cases, and the absence of indictments, have prompted thousands to voice their protest from assembly to street corner. Race relations are one of the thorniest issues today and will be for some time. Two recent films take two very different approaches to discussing race relations, and they're clearly made for two very different audiences. Selma is an invigorating, moving, and exceptional film showcasing bravery and dignity. Where Selma is complex, Black or White is a simplified and misguided sitcom writ large. In 1965, Alabama was the epicenter for the Civil Rights movement. Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) has his sights set on organizing a march from Selma to the sate capital in Montgomery. His wife, Coretta (Carmen Ejogo), is worried about the safety of their children, as death threats are sadly common for MLK. He needs to turn the tide of public perception to light a fire under President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to get him to prioritize legislation that would protect every citizen's right to vote. Without question, Selma is one of the finest films of 2014. It is powerful, resonant, nuanced, political, immediate, and generally excellent on all fronts. It's a rarity in Hollywood, namely a movie about the Civil Rights movements without a prominent white savior. This is a film about the ordinary and famous black faces on the ground fighting in the trenches for their freedoms. There are compassionate white people who heed the call, don't get me wrong, but this is a movie told from the black perspective. I suspect the portrayal of President Johnson had something to do with Selma's poor showing with the Oscars, though I can't fully comprehend why. Yes, Johnson is portrayed as a man who has to be won over, but he's on MLK's side from the beginning. He is not opposed to legislation to protect voting rights; he's just hesitant about the timing. Johnson says, \"You got one issue I got 100,\" and the pragmatic reality of pushing forward legislation through a divided Congress was real. Johnson was not opposed to MLK's wishes; he just wanted him to wait until the political process would be easier. In fact, in my eyes, Johnson comes across as compassionate, politically savvy, and he clearly makes his stakes on which side of history he's going to be associated when he has a sit-down with the obstinate Alabama governor, George Wallace (Tim Roth). Like the rest of the varied characters in Selma, it's a nuanced portrayal of a man in the moment.The march in Selma is a moment that seems like an afterthought in the narrative of the Civil Rights movement, dwarfed by the Montgomery bus boycott and the March on Washington. The movie does a great job of re-examining why this moment is history is as significant, an eye-opening moment for the nation to the brutal reality of oppression. The opposition is entrenched, thanks to a stagnant system that wants to hold onto its \"way of life.\" It just so happens that way of life meant very different things for black people. The movie is politically sharp, with dissenting perspectives arguing over the next course of action in Selma and the national stage. Selma is another in the current crop of biopics eschewing the standard cradle-to-grave approach to highlight a significant moment that highlights exactly who their central figure is (Lincoln, Invictus). With Selma, we get a battleground that allows us to explore in both micro and macro MLK, the man. The courage of ordinary citizens in the face of violent beatdowns and police bullying is effortlessly moving and often heartbreaking. There is a moment when an elderly man, reflecting upon a recent family tragedy, cannot find words to express his grief, and my heart just ached right then and there. I teared up at several points, I don't mind saying.There isn't a moment where I didn't feel that director Anna DuVernay (Middle of Nowhere) was taking the easy road or pulling her punches. The screenplay respects the intelligence of the audience to sift through the politics and the arguments, to recognize when MLK is igniting a spark, and just how complicated and fragile the Selma situation was back then. Here's a movie ostensibly about MLK but spends much of its time on the lesser known individuals like James Bevel and Congressman John Lewis, who walked alongside the man, taking time to flesh them out as people rather than plot points. MLK's wife is also given an important part to play and she's much more than just being Wife of Great Man. DuVernay's direction is impeccable; you feel like she has command over every frame. The sun-dappled cinematography by Bradford Young (A Most Violent Year) makes great use of shadows, often bathing its subjects in low-light settings. The score is rousing without being overpowering, just like every other technical aspect. This is a prime example of Hollywood filmmaking with vision and drive. With respect to the Academy, it's hard for me to imagine there being five better performances than the one Oyelowo (Lee Daniels' The Butler) delivers as the indomitable Martin Luther King Jr. It is rare to see an actor inhabit his or her character so completely, and Oyelowo just sinks into the skin of this man. You never feel like you're watching an actor but the living embodiment of history made flesh. This is a complex performance that shows refreshing degrees of humanity for a figure sanctified. He was a man first and foremost, and one prone to doubts and weaknesses as well. An excellent scene with top-notch tension and peak emotion involves MLK and Coretta listening to a supposed tape of Martin's infidelity. In the ensuing tense conversation, both parties acknowledge the reality of his affairs. It's a scene that's underplayed, letting the audience know she knows, and he knows she knows, but not having to rely upon large histrionics and confrontations. It's the behind-the-scenes moments with King that brought him to life for me, watching him coordinate and plan where to go with the movement. Oyelowo perfectly captures his fiery inspirational side, knocking out every single speech with ease. It's a performance of great nuance and grace, where you see the fear in the man's eyes as he steps forward, hoping he's making the best decision possible for those in desperation. There isn't one bad performance in the entire film, and this is a deep supporting cast including Wendell Pierce (HBO's The Wire), Tessa Thompson (Dear White People), Common, Giovanni Ribisi, Dylan Baker, Lorraine Toussaint (Netflix's Orange is the New Black), Stephen Root, Cuba Gooding Jr, Jeremy Strong, and Oprah Winfrey. It's been weeks now since I watched Selma but there are still many moments that I can recall that still have a tremendous power on me even in mere recollection. The opening sequence of the Birmingham bombing, a moment of horror frozen in chaos and debris, is a gut punch of a way to begin a movie about human beings fighting for equality. The sheer brutality of the response from the Selma police force and associates is horrifying, and a true pivot point for the movement in the eyes of the public. More so than anything else, Selma brilliantly and beautifully recreates the suffocating reality of injustice that was so prevalent for many African-American citizens, especially in the South. This is an era where people are being lynched with impunity just for being \"uppity.\" There was a supreme danger in simply standing up for equal rights, and many suffered as a result. The movie recreates this mood, this permeating feeling of dread and outrage and sorrow, so expertly and so artfully. From an early scene with a middle-aged black woman jumping through hoop after arbitrary hoop just to register to vote, you quickly realize that this vehemently hostile environment was never going to settle things on their \"own time,\" as apologists are prone to citing in lieu of federal intervention. Selma makes it abundantly clear why MLK felt the movement just could not wait, as Johnson requested. People are senselessly dying and being beaten al for the right to fairly vote. You feel the same sense of urgency with every scene, whether it's cold-blooded murder, noxious intimidation, or reciprocation that goes above and beyond any sense of responsibility, you understand exactly the terror it was to be black in the South during this time period.Another potent point of acclaim for Selma is how relevant it is to our own world today. While 12 Years a Slave was an often stirring and very professionally made biopic that exposed the ugly reality of slavery, it was not a film that screamed \"immediacy.\" Slavery ended in this country over 150 years ago, and while we're still dealing with the repercussions of treating other human beings as property, it's an easy film to dismiss in a backhanded, \"Well, that was so long ago, and we've come so far\" manner. The actions of Selma and MLK are still being felt to this day. We live in a world where many feel the justice system has its own separate-but-equal division, and the recent controversial grand jury decisions in the cases of Michael Brown and Eric Garner cannot be ignored. The reality for many black men in this country is statistically far more dangerous than others, fueled by a culture of entrenched racial bias that assumes the worst at first. The transit officer who executed Oscar Grant (detailed in the harrowing 2013 film Fruitvale Station) served eleven months in prison for a crime that had scads of witnesses. Garner's death is captured on video, and yet even the Staten Island coroner's report of \"homicide,\" wasn't enough to convince a grand jury that there was sufficient cause to at least go to trial. It's been noted that prosecutors could get a grand jury to \"indict a ham sandwich.\" According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, of the 30,000 cases that were not prosecuted in this country, only 11 were because a grand jury did not return an indictment (.0004%). However, grand juries rarely indict when a police officer is accused (In Dallas between 2008 and 2012, there were 81 grand jury investigations of officer shootings and only one actual indictment). It's hard not to feel like these things don't add up.Then there's the all-important struggle of voting, central to Selma and the plight of African-Americans in the South. You would think with Johnson's passage of the Voting Rights Act that we wouldn't be litigating the same issues of the past, but the Supreme Court determined that this country is far different then it was in the 1960s and there was no need for the Voting Right Act today. Within hours of striking it down, scads of new legislation appeared in the (primarily Southern) states that had been limited beforehand because of their past history of discrimination. The right to vote is just as relevant as it was during MLK's time and there are forces trying to stifle that right, to throw up new obstacles, new hoops, new challenges, all in the name of \"polling security,\" never mind that the cases of in-person voter fraud are so rare as to be one in every 15 million voters. It's a solution without a cause, and it's why many see it as a disingenuous political ploy. It's the twentieth-century, and yet the struggle for equality frustratingly repeats too many of the same battles. It's this historical and contemporary context that gives Selma its extra surge of relevancy, of reminding how far we still have to go, reminding the world that MLK's work is by no means complete and that it is up to the rest of the populace to fight for the kind of country that he spoke of in his \"I Have a Dream\" speech.It is this complex, complicated, and dire reality that hobbles another movie that tackles modern-day race relations, Mike Binder's imprudent Black or White. The plot of the film, inspired by a true story reportedly, centers on Kevin Costner as Elliot Anderson, a rich lawyer who has custody over his biracial granddaughter Eloise (the angelically adorable Jillian Estell). Now that Elliot has lot his wife, Eloise's other grandmother, Rowena Jeffers (Octavia Spencer), wants joint custody so Eloise can spend time around \"her own people.\" The two of them push and pull and lock horns over what's best for their grandchild, which gets more complicated when her biological father (Andre Holland, who is actually in Selma as well) comes back into the picture. Right away you can tell very early on that there will not be anything approaching subtlety in the world of Black or White, its own title serving as the first clue. The characters are sketched broad and the premise feels like a weird mishmash of Archie Bunker appearing in a court drama. And because it ends up becoming a court drama, you know where a majority of its third act will be spent. It's a preachy movie that doesn't have a deft hand when it comes to crafting a message that rises above easy observations disguised as something deeper. Eloise's father, Reggie, is so poorly underwritten that he feels like he stepped off the set of some after school special. He's addicted to crack, a lifelong screw-up, and a general disappointment that has never been present for his daughter's life. He even smokes crack out in the open on the front porch across the street from where his mother lives. At one point, Anthony Mackie's character berates Reggie for being a walking stereotype. Just because Binder calls attention to it doesn't excuse it. But he's not alone, because Spencer's sassy black matriarch character and Costner's gruff and frequently soused character are right there with him. The frequent arguments feel like they should be punctuated by studio audience hoots and applause, that is, if you could hear them over Terrence Blanchard's relentlessly overpowering musical score instructing the audience exactly how to feel with every clunky moment.In a way, the overbearing musical score gets at the major problem of Black or White, which is that a complicated case is being told from the safest point of view. Elliot is more akin to Clint Eastwood's character from Gran Torino then, say, Archie Bunker. He's irritable and prejudiced and old-fashioned and wary but balks if you call him a bigot. I mean he's polite to his Hispanic housekeeper. The more you examine the character you more you realize this is a movie designed to coddle an older generation (my tiny theater was packed with patrons over 60). The movie doesn't challenge anybody and actually rewards Costner's character and his outdated viewpoints. The opening conflict over his refusal to share custody with Rowena makes no sense. She's an excellent grandmother, caring, nurturing, a fine role model as well for her perseverance and starting several small businesses out of her home. Not only that but Rowena is surrounded by a large family of relatives that adore Eloise. It's contrived that these two could not agree on shared custody when they both have much to offer the girl. The only way any of this works is if Reggie is somehow responsible for the death of Eloise's mom. Perhaps he introduced her to crack and she overdosed. Unfortunately, it's never explained in the slightest, and so Elliot's hostility for the entire Jeffers clan seems petulant, especially with the happiness of his granddaughter in the balance. Without better context, his rampant anger seems to be guilt-by-association overkill. To his credit, Rowena has a major and annoying blind spot when it comes to Reggie's stability as a parent. In fact he's so obviously still on drugs that her ongoing refusal to accept reality harms her character irreparably.I the end, Black or White isn't so much a film that about race relations as it is about privilege. Costner's would-be bigot doesn't have a problem with black people, just as long as those black people abide by his rules of conduct and expectation. It's the same kind of qualification he's never had to consider for himself, and one the intended audience will likewise miss. He comes from a wealthy position and Rowena and her family are likely lower middle class at best. He has a world of class privilege at his disposal that the loving Jeffers family does not, and because of that he feels they are less suited to raising little Eloise. Perhaps he's worried about Reggie re-entering her life, but what animates Eliot Anderson is spite. He's consumed with the overriding assumption that he must be right in all things. While the film draws many heavy-handed parallels between Reggie's drug abuse and Eliot's alcoholism, it clearly presents the both of them on completely different planes of judgment. One of them is ultimately redeemable and the other less so. Eliot's perspective is essentially he can provide more and therefore more has to be better, but his definition of more is a private school, a housekeeper, a tutor who is treated as a caricature of initiative. Rowena provides a large and loving support system, but apparently they are less valued in the eyes of Eliot. And if you needed any more of a clue that Eliot and his sense of privilege are the unbeknownst star of the movie, he gets to deliver the big speech at the end that Says Something Meaningful. It feels a bit odd that the one character that uses the N-word in the film (albeit there is context) is the one telling lower-class black families how to live. I don't doubt the sincerity of writer/director Mike Binder; I don't think he purposely made a film to make older primarily white Americans feel better about thinking what they do about these troublesome times. It's not a nefarious movie but it is misguided and will provide cover for a certain selection of audience members who wonder why nobody is asking the old white guys their opinions on modern race relations. Even overlooking this charge, Black or White is just overblown melodrama that has to constantly explain everything to you at all times and guide you through every strained point. Selma and Black or White are both aiming at hearts and minds, looking to add to the conversation on contemporary race relations, but only one of them works as both an eye-opening message of empathy and as an exceptionally made film itself.

    "review": "  Martin Luther King organizes protests against Alabama's unequal voting laws.One of the best films of the year, Selma features a profoundly affecting performance by David Oleyowo, a wonderful script filled with rousing speeches and perfectly composed scenes, and some interesting directing choices by Ava DeVernay. Oleyowo was certainly robbed of a Best Actor nod as he embodies King's compassion, heroism, and flaws. His rousing speeches, with pitch-perfect delivery, could compel even the most hard-hearted out of his/her chair, and one scene in particular, where King visits the father of a slain protester, is so well-written and well-played, that despite its subdued tenor, still manages to be deeply haunting. DeVernay often frames her actors in the smallest corner of her shots, and while I didn't understand the reason for these choices, I found myself liking her choices.Overall, this is an important film without \"insisting upon itself,\" truly moving and compelling filmmaking.",

    "review": "  A number of historical dramas fall into the trap of sugar-coating the details of its subject matter in order to stress the qualities of its protagonist. Selma doesn't fall into that trap.A masterclass in directing, 'Selma' is a gripping, hard-hitting and moving depiction of events in early 1965 that refreshingly presents its main character as a flawed but inspiring figure. It's not just required viewing because it addresses issues that unfortunately exist in contemporary society; it's required viewing because it's a freaking fantastic film.",

    "review": "  There is not a misstep in this entire picture! Had to honor Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy on the holiday dedicated to him. The Golden Globes gave Ava DuVernay and David Oyelowo nominations. It is a shame the Oscars didn't nominate more people involved in this film. Oyelowo delivers King's powerful speeches well. He also shows King's human doubt and the film briefly explores King's infidelity to his wife played by the stunning and bright Carmen Ejogo. The ensemble cast is multifaceted and this important period of history was a great one to portray on the screen. It is a more important lesson to listen to African American leadership, rather than denying it and trying to maintain white control over HIStory (the white male story). It is surely not beyond reason to see that political red tape and maneuvering could have caused President Johnson to repeatedly delay speaking about legislation that activist Martin Luther King, Jr. wanted action on much earlier. The marches King led definitely changed the nation and brought many people together, though there is still work to be done.",

    "review": "  With this movie, director Ava DuVernay crafts a remarkable feat of telling the story of the protest marches in Selma, Al in 1965 that resulted in the historic Voting Rights Act from as many points of view as possible while keeping the issues that are still relevant front and center through some electric debate scenes. At the focus of the action is Dr. Martin Luther King(David Oyelowo, who is superb). But this not St. Martin we are talking about here. Rather, what we get is a rather human interpretation, with King having serious doubts and haunted by thoughts of mortality. So, it is no wonder that at the moment of his greatest triumph, namely about to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, he confides to his wife Coretta(Carmen Ejogo) about the possibility to start over at a country parish. But even then, he still goes on to serve as an inspiration to so many, with the film also recognizing the acts of everyday courage and heroism that took to make the marches possible.Where \"Selma\" falters is in the White House scenes and not in the way you may have been led to believe. Aside from the specifics, on the one hand, you can see the beginning of the rift between King and President Johnson(Tom Wilkinson) that would widen as Vietnam would consume Johnson's presidency and which war King would oppose vociferously. At the same time, these scenes are undermined by a woefully miscast Wilkinson who can never quite get the right Texan intonation. And the referred to, but never seen White House demonstrations, only serve to have the movie's modest budget serve as a distraction.",

    "review": "  Selma is a masterpiece, and I don't use that word lightly. Powerful doesn't begin to describe this movie. It seems every year we get some sort of film that touches on racism but no movie I have personally seen has effected me quite like this. This tale of Martin Luther King Jr. doesn't follow his entire life, but it doesn't need to. It follows a very important moment in his fight for equal rights in Selma, Alabama to give blacks the same rights to vote as whites. While the story was indeed engaging and had me in it from start to finish, its the respect they give the characters that really shines. David Oyelowo delivers a tour de force performance as the great man himself, but it was his interaction with his followers and the grand speeches that really made my jaw drop. Few performances can actually leave me speechless, this was one of them. He undoubtedly needs to recieve some attention come award season. You could fight about what is accurate and what wasn't, but at this point I have come to accept that no biography in cinema will ever stick completely to the true story. If it means a more entertaining experience, I am all for it. This film had me involved emotionally, it didn't shy away from the truths of violence, it delivered its messages respectfully, and best of all it gave us the best portrayal of Martin Luther King Jr. to date. David Oyelowo should be commended, as should director Ava DuVernay for giving us a real depiction of bravery and what a true hero really looks like. Selma is a work of cinematic art in my opinion, and it never once backed down from the reality of life and the life of a great man.",

    "review": "  A RELEVANT REVELATION - My Review of SELMA (4 Stars)So many biopics succumb to piousness, reverence, and a bland, straightforward \"this happened and then this happened\" approach to their subjects, that it's thrilling when one comes along with passion and a true directorial voice. Such is the case with SELMA, directed by the very talented Ava DuVernay, wonderfully written by Paul Webb, and featuring an astounding, commanding and sometimes surprisingly subtle performance by David Oyelowo. Covering a three month period in 1965 where Martin Luther King led civil rights marches and lobbied President Johnson to sign the Voting Rights Act, the filmmakers paint a broad canvas over a limited time period. At times overstuffed with characters and famous actors in small roles, SELMA benefits from looking at this historic and important struggle from a myriad of angles. While the details of the struggle are well known and etched in the memories of anyone who cares about the Civil Rights struggle, what surprised me was what a joltingly visceral and cinematic experience SELMA offers. In the opening minutes, a surprising event occurs, and without spoiling anything, it knocked me back in my seat. From there, I knew I was being guided by a director with the ability to get your attention. What kept me watching was the serious but accessible tone. Beautifully shot by Bradford Young, who along with Oyelowo have A MOST VIOLENT YEAR to their credit, SELMA presents complex characters whose intelligence, deliberateness, and bravery, rather than the typical noble victimhood, is given a chance to truly shine and be deeply felt. Although they did not get permission to use any of King's speeches, the writing replaces them with thunderously impactful orations nonetheless. Oyelowo makes you want to stand and cheer in these moments, but his quieter scenes show a vulnerable, flawed man. One particular scene with his wife Corretta (a wonderfully self-possessed Carmen Ejogo) turns on a dime with just a simple pause between words. It's a recurring motif in which DuVernay allows for extended takes, sometimes holding on a character's face as they think before speaking. The cumulative effect is to build power with a rare patience, where other filmmakers would choose to pace things up more. DuVernay's choices, her command of intimacy, her refusal to devalue the power of its subject while avoiding pretension, are what makes this film a cut above the usual movie of the week this could have become. SELMA feels at times like LINCOLN's more tense and exciting cousin. Both films detail minutiae surrounding the passing of laws, but while LINCOLN felt like a very good stage play, SELMA is riveting. The march scenes are suspenseful and heartbreaking. You feel every baton hit, every frightened reaction, the horror of people running from racist cops on horseback. This film has tense set pieces and memorable dramatic exchanges. In addition to our leads, Tom Wilkinson and Tim Roth do excellent work as President Johnson and George Wallace respectively. Oprah Winfrey in a small role as a woman who bravely seeks to register as a voter makes an indelible mark. She truly is a wonderful actor, in addition to producing important films such as this. Wendell Pierce, Niecy Nash, Common, Lorraine Toussant, and Jeremy Strong make lasting impressions. Relative unknown Stephan James emerges as a true star here as John Lewis, with his smart, soulful performance, although at times it feels like DuVernay accommodated everyone who wanted to do the film, rather than trimming the fat here and there. A minor quibble. The end credits song brings the past to the present in an astonishlingly relevant way, making SELMA required viewing for anyone with a pulse and a heart.",

Essentially a chronicle of the events leading up to, and the aftermath of, the famed march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, Selma is a film that looks at the civil rights struggle from a mature perspective. We are not treated to villains or saints, but instead people in a real-life struggle. We see MLK not as a pure man, but a flawed man with astute political calculations. We finally get a depiction of LBJ which is at least somewhat unflattering, a man whose treatment in history is much to whitewash.An overall even-handed and emotionally compelling film.4/5 Stars",

    "review": "  An electrifying presentation of real events that never feels like a history lesson, Selma's authenticity and timeliness make for a rousing spectacle that feels present and not unreachably epic. The director puts you wholly in the moment, never letting style (and the film boasts a good deal) get in the way of passing down an imperative piece of our country's narrative. Even with so much attention to period detail and historic figures, Selma speaks so truthfully in the present tense not just because current events eerily reflect the story to a startling degree but because the characters come alive to such a degree that you feel like you know them. These are characters, mind you, that have been blown up to mythic degrees on everything from inspirational posters to coffee mugs. Plus, screenwriter Paul Webb's multidimensional characterization of all involved articulates the still-ongoing struggle for equality. Ava DuVernay's PG-13-rated drama chronicles Martin Luther King's (Oyelowo) campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965. As realized by David Oyelowo in a brilliantly layered performance wrongly denied an Oscar nomination, Martin Luther King has never been represented on screen so letter perfectly. In fact, everybody from Carmen Ejogo, who looks like news footage of Coretta Scott King come to life to Tim Roth's on-the-racist-nose portrayal of George Wallace rings completely true...except for Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon Johnson. Why DuVernay would go to extreme lengths to flawlessly present the events leading up to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and NOT have the actor nail down LBJ's distinctive Texas drawl is beyond comprehension. Still, this mostly British contingent (Oyelowo, Roth, and Wilkson hail from the UK) gets it damn right. Just like with the production team behind 12 Years a Slave (also mostly British), sometimes it takes an outsider to hold up a proper mirror to our society. Regardless, you don't have to be American for this tale to resonate and echo in your heart and mind...and it does.Bottom line: Civil Righteousness",

    "review": "  Built and centered on an admirable topic, Selma proves to be a surprisingly weighty historical drama in a season of underwhelming Oscar bait hopefuls. I actually always wondered what a well-made film about Martin Luther King, Jr. would look like that was NOT about the march on Washington, the Montgomery bus boycott, or his assassination. In addition to a different setting than we are used to seeing him in, we also are allowed to look at King the human being, i.e. the flawed man who used politics and arm-twisting in order to achieve his goals. The script avoids pandering hagiography in a similar manner to Lincoln. King understood, both here and in reality, that any struggle would have to be public and caught on camera for Middle America to see, and this helped steer his choice toward demonstrating in Selma, Alabama where resistance would be fierce. We also have David Oyelowo giving an underplayed King, while displaying more assertiveness than we are used to seeing. Oyelowo probably gives the best depiction of MLK we have seen to date and I must join the chorus of voices arguing that this actor was robbed by the Academy for a nomination. There are some problems with accuracy regarding the role of President Johnson, which some historians have rightfully pointed out. Namely, this version of LBJ comes off as a bit cowardly and downright obstructionist toward civil rights. He is shown yelling at King in most of his scenes, conspiring with J. Edgar Hoover to damage King's marriage by releasing evidence of his infidelities to his wife, and only pushing the Voting Rights Act to protect his legacy after it becomes clear the way the wind is blowing. I got news for ya. Johnson, like most if not all U.S. Presidents, probably hated J. Edgar and often avoided him if he could. The wiretapping of King and other Civil Rights leaders predated LBJ, and Hoover often acted unilaterally on that kind of behavior and without oversight. Furthermore, Johnson for the most part approved of King's actions, and specifically in Selma. This is not to say Johnson was an angel. He could be a gigantic asshole. But he was not a coward and he certainly didn't act to obstruct MLK, even if they disagreed on many issues. On that note, they definitely got George Wallace right. He really was a creepy, racist self-absorbed douche - largely unconcerned with the future or his legacy...until he got shot and paralyzed years later.But I digress. This is the kind of low-key, unpretentious, honest story telling I wish I saw more of. The stellar portrayal for our protagonist, competent direction, tight writing, and simple but relevant message make this a must see. Get chill bumps listening to the speeches. Cringe every time nightsticks are brandished and George Wallace opens his mouth. Easily one the best films of the year.",

It is an important movie about significant times and events and, as such, in includes some shocking, confronting scenes that, quite frankly, make you ashamed to be a part of the human race. And, thankfully, it didn't canonise its subject matter, including reference to his marital infidelities. As King, David Oyelowo gives an outstanding performance that makes you wonder why he was not recognised by a Best Actor Oscar nomination in 2015.",

I have watched many such films, movies and made for television, and, this is the most disappointing, boring take on telling his tale that I have ever encountered. However, I read, in an article, that Oprah Winfrey starred in this movie and she was not in it, when it was rented from Red Box. And, the thing that I saw was so boring that there is no way 86 percent of anyone would like it, ever. So, that does make me wonder what they saw versus what was released in other places.

While black citizens of Alabama constitutionally have the same voting rights as whites, they are hamstrung by racist local registration officers, politicians and lawmen. Dr Martin Luther King and his followers go to Selma, Alabama to attempt to achieve, through non-violent protest, equal voting rights and abilities for black people.A great telling of a great moment in history. Interesting from an historic perspective and powerfully and emotionally told.Great performances help too. David Oyelowo is superb as Martin Luther King.

    "review": "  Without wanting to sound ignorant of how far we've come since, it's hard for me to imagine a so called civilized nation like America in the 1960's being so backward and full of hate that it would require a leader like Martin Luther King, Jr. to stand up and fight for equality. Really, it's hard for me to imagine in any respect hating another human being so much due to nothing but the colour of their skin. You would think that the Holocaust would've awoken people to the senseless, utter pointlessness that hate on that level accomplishes. But while we've come a long way in some respects since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's, there are still examples of hatred and judgement amongst people who just don't and aren't willing to understand what they perceive as different or wrong (gay and transgender rights come to mind, though we've made some strides on that front as well).Selma looks at a very important moment in time, not just for America, but for Canada and the rest of the world as well. It looks at a man who decided that enough was enough and at the struggles and triumphs that followed that resolution. This movie is filled to the brim with the stuff good movies are made of: great writing, great direction and cinematography, a fascinating, important story, and acting that will blow you away. I don't know who this David Oyelowo is, though a quick search on IMDB shows he's had a busy and impressive last couple of years as a supporting actor. But he shines in his portrayal of Martin Luther King, Jr. He looks like him, he acts like him and he sounds exactly like him. Which is impressive given that Oyelowo is from the U.K. The film follows King and his band of supporters as they appeal to president Johnson to pass a law stating that African Americans be given full and legal right to vote. Of course, African Americans already had the right to vote, but, particularly in the southern states, they more often than not are given no more right to vote than a salamander. When the president tries to take the easy way out; i.e. 'I don't have time to pass a bill about voting right now, I'm far too busy. I'll hit you back next year on it.' King takes to the streets in peaceful protests that eventually finally awaken the world, and the president, to the kind of brutal mistreatment African Americans have been suffering in certain parts of our 'civilized world.' These are powerful themes to tackle and Selma is a powerful film. Martin Luther King, Jr. was one of the greatest humanitarians the world has ever known. A man of self sacrifice who burned with a passion that, as all men were created equal, all men should be treated as equals. Black or white. You have to be careful when adapting such men and women to the screen. This film could be an introduction to King for younger audiences and you wouldn't want to misrepresent such an important figure. And for my money, Selma does a fantastic job, giving us a portrait of a man who was humble and selfless, who cared deeply for fundamental human rights, but who was human and was someone you could see and touch. Not a celebrity. Not a rock star standing on a stage miles away surrounded by body guards and riding around in limos. He was a man who called people to action, but lead the charge once the masses were gathered. This was a man who's story and accomplishments deserve to be told again and again. Selma does justice to this man, and this moment in time that it's extremely important we don't forget.",

    "review": "  Hoo doggy! after seeing this I really got the same vinegar everyone else has about the Oscar snubbery - it was SO good! I'll freely admit I had no idea about these marches or the political landscape immediately following the Civil Rights movement. Martin Luther King Jr. was this crazy constant in American news so I'm sure while there was all this pushback from LBJ, it's no surprise how many people traveled down to Selma for the black voting cause when the call was put out.the film is pretty incredible - the beginning seems a little bit of a scattershot of the world of the early 60's and the climate before the focus on MLK really ramps up, which was hard to get a good grasp on, but from there it really takes off and MLK begins leading the charge in the film. David Oyelowo bring such a powerful voice to the role of arguably one of the most competent leaders and figures in American history. the production design was something I kept taking note of; the recreation of all the sets in historical pictures is something I stand completely in awe of. the detail is staggering.The other thing I really appreciated was the looks at MLK's relationships and all the planning that went into intelligently forcing the US govt's hand. it's crazy how much discussion between the committee there was, including the local Selma voting advocate group, and that it wasn't all totally coming from MLK.but yeah, seriously, this movie is pretty incredible and powerful (and not in a totally white guilt kind of way). the story was a really satisfying slow burn, just an edge-of-the-seat pleasure. do yourself a favor and go see it - make the Academy regret their decision by pumping this puppy chock full of profits!",

This is a Hollywood trend that seems to be hitting biopics and period pieces really hard, and that is if there is something about a true story you don't like just change it to make your movie better.The movie falsely portrays President Lyndon B. Johnson as an enemy of MLK, going as far as using the FBI to discredit him. In reality this couldn't be farther from the truth. Selma was LBJ's idea, he considered the Voting Rights Act his greatest legislative achievement, he viewed King as an essential partner in getting it enacted, and he didn't use the FBI to disparage him. Did they really need to create lies in order to tell MLK's story? No, it's already good enough in full truth.",

Yes there really powerful in many ways.However we have seen these emotional scenes before and for a Oscar caliber movie it didn't bring anything new in the way 12 Years a Slave did. it kinda just felt like the Oscars wanted a 'black lead' film to be in the running so they said....Selma.. there happy.But I am not happy and really don't think this is a Oscar caliber film at all.I never got into the actor playing MLK. David Oyelwow just didn't capture me. I also think Ava needs more time to become a better director and don't get some first time writer in the chair as well, because it did not go all that great as far the story was concerned.There are just other movies that do Martin more justice-Our friend, Martin - Bringing King to ChinaThis film also had many chances to go deeper and darker with Martin Luther King, but instead it runs away and tries to play it all safe.Overall there is some good here, and if this is your kids first look at Martin Luther King then hey let him watch it, but I have seen too many Martin Luther King documentaries and movies and this just doesn't do it for me.",

A portrayal as it should be, I guess, to be realistic and not sugar-coated. Unfortunately, the film also felt a little schematic, in that most of the characters never felt fully rounded or lived in or real. King, we know from his speeches (paraphrased here) and David Oyelowo is fine. Every other character is pretty sketchy - they have a few key scenes but we don't know them or their backgrounds. A little bit of artificial tension is created between King and Coretta Scott King but it is almost an aside. The focus is instead on the actions and reactions that happened in Selma, Alabama, and on the larger political pieces that needed to be moved to remove obstacles to voting rights in the South. So, an important history lesson for us all.",

    "review": "  Released at a time of high racial tension in the United States, Selma is a perfectly timed look back at the civil rights movement that serves to both educate a new generation to the happenings of the past and draw parallels to the present. Opening in 1965 with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (played by David Oyelowo) being welcomed to the White House by Tom Wilkinson's President Lyndon Johnson, Selma wastes no time beating around the bush - despite his efforts to urge the president to pass legislation ensuring the ability of African-American citizens to vote, King is shot down - the president has decided to focus on the War on Poverty for the time being. Despite this initial rejection, King continues to fight for the desegregation of America and refuses to let his cause fall out of the spotlight. Although Selma appeared to be advertised as a biography that would follow the life of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, it instead focused on a three-month period in 1965 - from King accepting his Nobel Peace Prize to, after two attempts to legislate voting rights for African-American citizens, leading a fifty four mile march in protest of the lack of voting rights for black Americans in the South. Written by Paul Webb, the film did an excellent job of compressing a complex timeline without making it feel like anything was missing - the story flowed smoothly and contained a good balance of major and minor events. One thing, however, that I felt the film could have done without was the added tension to the relationship between President Johnston and King. While historical films can often feel like facts being reeled off in succession and filmmakers may have to alter the course of history for the sake of entertainment, the modification of this specific relationship was ultimately unnecessary. The southern United States was easily one of the most difficult and dangerous places to be an outspoken person of color in the nineteen sixties and, as such, King (and other civil rights advocates) had no shortage of real historical adversaries and people who were vocal in their dislike of him and, although scenes featuring King and Johnson were dramatic in their own right, adding another ultimately did nothing for the story itself.  One of the hardest tasks present in the creation of this film was, in my opinion, the characterization of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It would have been incredibly easy for him to have been put on a pedestal and portrayed as larger-than-life in an incredibly inaccessible way - small details in the movie prevented that from happening. For example, the film opens with a shot of King fiddling with his necktie (which is actually an ascot) in the mirror. While seemingly insignificant, this immediately creates an image of King, not as a Nobel Prize winner and incredibly important historical and political figure, but as a man like any other. By showing him doing unimportant and mundane day-to-day tasks, the audience is reminded that despite his importance he was, at the end of the day, a suburban family man. Of course, great writing is nothing without a great performance which is exactly what David Oyelowo did - he captured the essence of the character and played him to perfection. Ultimately, Selma is both a look back on a pivotal period on the path to desegregation and equality and a passionate (and incidental) call to arms - the parallels between a time that is often thought to be long past and the world we live in today are striking and do not go unnoticed.",

The biggest negative of the movie was all the cryptic typed government subtitles as if the information came from some secret government files.

    "review": "  Selma is the story of the Selma Civil Rights Marches of 1964. It was lead by Martin Luther King Jr. and were spurned on because the black communities in Alabama were being denied the right to vote. King spoke to President Johnson and when the President took no action King went to Selma and marched with the people multiple times.Things I Liked:David Oyelowo. Oyelowo plays Dr. King. And I personally think it was a very wise casting choice. He owns the speeches and delivers them with the same resonant power and inspiring voice that we think of when we think of Martin Luther King Jr. I also think he is a stronger choice than a higher profile actor because his star power doesn't steal from his performance and you get lost watching him become King.The Cultural Relevance. This movie, like Straight Outta Compton, has an incredible timeliness on the issues. It shows that, while we have progressed, and are taking steps to improve our views on race and class and cultural diversity, we still have a ways to go. This movie was a great reminder of where we have come but also where we need to go.Things I Didn't Like:Pace. The movie, while telling an interesting story, gets lost at points and drags back onto the story with unneeded side moments and things that make the film go on longer than it needs to. The movie becomes boring and tiresome as you watch it and you feel slightly fatigued by the pace and not in the way you should by watching an emotional drama later on.Political Stance. This movie seemed a little too on the nose with it's political agenda. It turned some characters into valiant heroes, and others into almost cartoon villains. The movie has a message about civil rights as any movie about Martin Luther King Jr. usually does but this one is so blunt with its agenda that it loses sincerity. I liked the culturally relevant ideas but when they are accompanied with an almost blatant message of \"this is bad and you should hate it\" it becomes something else that doesn't make me want to rush out the door and change the world.Overall. Overall the movie is good. It has a strong cast and tells an interesting story. The problems come in stretching the story more than it needed to be and taking the films political themes and turning them into an agenda. The film needs to tell the story first and when it gets lost in its message it loses the moments in the story that are memorable. There are powerful images in this film but they get dragged under things that scream civil rights movement ideas at you and that seems insincere and like this movie could have been replaced with a lecture. A good film but not something that ultimately stands out.",

Selma is an excellently crafted biopic, but does not cover the whole birth-to-death aspect of it's main subject, and really only focuses on the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery. Though the movie does fluctuate in it's pacing, it is mostly engaging to the audience, and one must applaud David Oyelowo for his depiction of the great African American rights activist. I had a great time with this film, as the intensity that was so beautifully directed during the recreation of horrible historic events is both chilling and amazingly scripted. I will admit that I would've liked to have seen more of Martin Luther King' s domestic life, but the depiction of his marches and protests are done so well, it has nothing short of my forgiveness. David Oyelowo and Carmen Ejogo are just the few of the cast members that put on mesmerizing performances, in one of the the most accurate, intense and beautiful directed biopics of the year.

    "review": "  Selma is a triumphant film that takes us into the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as he leads the people of Selma to a greater and better future. The film has powerful themes of racial equality, corruption, love and power and is truly a great showcase of new time director, Ava DuVernay's talents as a visionary film maker and David Oyelowo's performance as King Jr. is truly phenomenal and powerful, expect big things from Oyelowo. Highly recommend this film to viewers interested in history and/or biopics",

He get�s his role, but more important is the civil rights movement, the dirty politics and the astonishing display of racism in the American society. Catchy and with its ending not just a piece of history, but connecting to our times and the ongoing struggle for equality and human rights. Watching it, the movie does not let your mind rest and if you want so that�s its only downside.",

    "review": "  SelmaInspiring, heartfelt, and resonate without being condescending or pandering, Selma is the rare example of Hollywood taking the civil rights genre seriously. Essentially a chronicle of the events leading up to, and the aftermath of, the famed march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, Selma is a film that looks at the civil rights struggle from a mature perspective. We are not treated to villains or saints, but instead people in a real-life struggle. We see MLK not as a pure man, but a flawed man with astute political calculations. We finally get a depiction of LBJ which is at least somewhat unflattering, a man whose treatment in history is much to whitewash.An overall even-handed and emotionally compelling film.4/5 Stars",

    "review": "  People were upset at the 2015 Oscars that this movie didn't get recognition in certain categories, making it seem as if the Academy was discriminating. I disagree with this disappointment as I didn't see greatness in this movie.Selma was a slow movie for me, but it had a lot of allusions and historical figures to make for a good movie for history buffs. The movie had an aura of significance throughout, but it wasn't necessarily intriguing to me. The film's focus is on a short segment of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life, specifically the march from Selma to Montgomery (I believe) to protest the suppression of African Americans' right to vote.The film was only mediocre. Firstly, I did not think David Oyelowo played a good MLK Jr. Secondly the film seemed to rush through interactions with historical figures instead of keeping them on for the ride. When they show Malcolm X in the film he is pronounced dead only a few scenes later. J. Edgar Hoover shows up once in the film even though he is mentioned on a few occasions.Nothing stood out for me regarding the overall aesthetic of the film which is why I call Selma mediocre at best. Everything seemed pretty typical - the direction, the cinematography, the editing had a slow pace to it, the acting - all fairly typical. With a boring movie I really don't have much to say, and this film bored me, but it was historically significant and still relevant to recent African American issues such as the riots in Ferguson.",

Brilliant acting from the lead role to the point where it's as good as when Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed Abe Lincoln, near excellent historical accuracy (a few errors on Johnson and King's relationship) that even includes the faults of Dr. King, and an overall powerful portrayal of a time when racism was all over the USA freely and without anything to stop it. Selma feels less preachy than most films about the Civil Rights Movement and focuses on the history and the man who led the movement rather than just make all white people look evil. The film even shows how some whites joined the blacks and how some blacks were considering countering racism with weapons and violence, despite King's ideas of non-violent protesting. Even shows how some blacks despised King because he refused to use violence, which puts further emphasis on King's powerful ideals and his amazing strength at being able to choose not to be violent. Selma get's a 4.5/5.",

David Oyelowo is great as Dr. King, especially when he gives his speeches (which are mostly original as another film studio holds the rights to those speeches). I love the flashbacks at the end and the closing song, 'Glory' by Common and John Legend. Overall, even though this film isn't a perfect film is accomplishes what many movies set out to do as it moves its viewers and was one of the most powerful films I've seen in a long time.",

It accurate portrays the struggles Civil Right activist had during one of the biggest tipping points of US history (does the US stay pro-white as things worked they way they were or does the US change its policy making all equal and changing how society operates) either could have been good or bad. It shows the struggle of MLK to give freedoms to non-whites. Fantastic movie10/10",

A powerful story fuels a movie that was good, but could have been great. The indoor shots are too shadowy and the supporting characters seem under-developed, making Selma harder to follow for people who don't know the history behind the movie.",

    "review": "  Ava DuVernay directed the indie darling Middle of Nowhere in 2012 and has been a favorite of the Oscar-azzi ever since. Selma is her big moment. An African-American female director tackles the biggest icon in Civil Rights history at a pivotal moment in time. And does she ever rise to the occasion. DuVernay takes her small budget and makes it big with the assistance of her talented cast and crew. Focusing only on the march to Selma, Alabama to secure access to voter registration for blacks, King's life, love and leadership are all examined without turning the film into your typical sprawling biopic. His sometimes tumultuous marriage to Coretta Scott King with rumors of extramarital affairs, ideological battles with other black leaders, treacherous politics with Lyndon B. Johnson and race against time to prevent more death and disaster are painfully and precisely detailed by David Oyelowo's remarkable performance. It's an unforgettably human portrayal. Strong supporting work comes from the entire cast especially Tom Wilkinson's controversial performance as LBJ. His confrontation - real or imagined with Tim Roth's odious George Wallace - is a highlight toward the end of the film. DuVernay's crew also excels at making a lot with a little. Hats off to Bradford Young's creative cinematography, Sharen Davis' always precise costume design and excellent production design on a shoe string budget. The one gripe I might have with the film is the presence of Oprah Winfrey. Her Harpo Productions partly financed the film, and Winfrey is a capable actress but every time she's on the screen she distracts from the proceeding with her star power. Is Oprah bigger than MLK? Maybe. Still, we should thank her for contributing to the success of films like 2009's Precious and Selma. It remains to be seen if Oscar will feel the same on Thursday morning.",

Ya que mientras uno v� filmes como este, uno no puede dejar de pensar como es posible que consideren racista un libro, f�cilmente el UNICO libro costarricense que tiene a un negro como personaje principal. Y no es que el libro se haya proh�bido, ya eso ser�a el colmo, pero quitarle el aval del Ministerio de Cultura, es b�sicamente la excusa para que dicho libro sea exclu�do de los programas de lectura en escuelas y colegios, y con ello, uno de los libros de cuentos infantil m�s entra�able y disfrutable de la literatura Costarricense dejar� de ser le�do por los j�venes, ya que si hoy en d�a, cuesta m�s y m�s que lean los libros de rigor en los programas educativos, ser�a un sue�o de opio que alg�n joven tico, por su propia cuenta decida leer este cuento, cuando puede mejor ir a escuela m�gicas en Inglaterra, a pueblos gringos con vampiros que brillan, o acompa�ar a muchachas que luchan en torneos dist�picos, y nunca conocer�n la tierna historia surrealista de Cocor� y su jornada para entender por qu� una rosa vive tan poco tiempo. Y regresando al filme en cuesti�n, no crean que nosotros estamos lejos de este tipo de problemas, ya que nunca nos cuentan como los negros que ven�an de Lim�n eran bajados a la fuerza para no poder avanzar m�s all� de Turrialba. Oh, s�, nosotros no ocupamos ver historias sobre lugares lejos de aqu� como Alabama, e inocentemente pensar, que nosotros somos mejores y que nunca har�amos cosas as�. Las historias que nos averg�enzan como seres humanos, cuesta mucho que salgan a la luz y que sean contadas con valent�a. \"Selma\" narra los eventos ver�dicos de la tumultuosa era de 1965, donde Estados Unidos libraba una batalla interna entre blancos y negros, ya que todav�a en 1965, no era permitido que los negros votaran (eso debe darle una lecci�n al mont�n de vagos que no mueven su trasero aqu� para ir a votar una vez cada cuatro a�os, aaaaah, pero no les pesa la lengua para criticar al gobierno que est� en ejercicio), pero no solo eso, aunque en papel se supon�a que acababa de ser aprobada una ley para que pudieran votar, se les pon�an toda clase de trabas como cobrarles un impuesto retroactivo para poder votar, exigirles un patrocinador que los avalara para votar, etc... y eso sin contar que los cabecillas de los movimientos pro-derechos a los negros eran seguidos e intervenidos con micr�fonos por el FBI. Honestamente me parece incre�ble que no haya estallado una guerra civil en ese tiempo, y es que aunque se menciona lo \"imposible\" que era enfrentar a la polic�a y el ej�rcito, creo que lecciones modernas de las guerras de guerrillas en el medio oriente que todav�a no han podido ganar realmente, demuestra que guerras formales son factibles de ganar, pero una guerra de guerrillas es una tarea para S�sifo condenada para nunca acabar. Y es que es importante ver filmes como estos, para que la gente no se le olvide que esos derechos que hoy en d�a toman como algo natural, les costaron sangre a gente valiente que enfrentaron a la ignorancia, la intolerancia y la soberbia.",

    "review": "  Obviously, a movie like this rises or falls on the back of its star. David Oyelowo certainly does the part justice -- likely creating the most iconic performance of Martin Luther King Jr. yet. He, quite frankly, makes the movie. The Brit also handles the southern accent unusually proficiently. The rest of the cast does a decent job as well. Director Ava DuVernay also proves a dynamic filmmaker who really knows how to control and build tension while also creating some hauntingly beautiful shots during some of the most violent and dramatic scenes.I question the sometimes over-the-top portrayal of Lyndon Johnson (and even some of his cabinet members and political contemporaries). While Tom Wilkinson is good -- providing an intensity and mostly believable, presidential presence in the role -- his Texan accent is iffy and his frustration with the civil rights movement often comes across cartoony. Unfortunately, many of the racist southern characters in the film also come across not so much as human beings (that humanity up for debate of course) but as stereotypical, SNL parody brands of ignorance. They aren't hard to dislike, which is certainly appropriate, but there comes a point where their buffoonish performances no longer ring true (a problem with a lot of historical films dealing with southern racists). What's terrifying about the racism in the south is that it was widespread -- both ignorant hicks and articulate, learned professionals carried these abhorrent views. Aside from suffering some of the usual biopic pitfalls (contrived moments for pacing/timing, crafting private scenes for the subject which may lack historicity, too much self-reflection, etc.), Selma is a powerful, well-directed film that touches all the right notes for portraying this pivotal moment in American history. Most notably, the film sports a terrific performance in Oyelowo. He looks and sounds the part of the great, dignified orator, but also injects the appropriate amount of levity and emotion to keep him relatable. Incidentally, he should definitely have been nominated here, even if the Oscars had to expand the number of nominees.",

    "review": "  An adequate though uninspired depiction of the momentous events in Selma, Alabama in 1965. All films, even historical films, deserve some license to enhance the narrative. Ava DuVernay and Paul Webb have an odd relationship with the actual events in Selma and it detracts from the natural drama. Notwithstanding the wholesale misrepresentation of LBJ, the film also toys with the timeline of the actual events. The fact that LBJ had publicly announced his intent to pass the Voting Rights Act before the actual march on Montgomery, or that a federal judge had also ordered Alabama to end it's literary tests before the march aren't depicted even remotely accurately in the film. I'm bewildered as to why J. Edgar Hoover, whose intense animus for MLK led him to constantly torment Dr. King, is soft peddled as a mere loyal servant of the president. The reality is that Hoover was Kings primary foe and LBJ was very much a partner and ally in 1965 (they later fell out over MLK's anti-Vietnam stance). It was unnecessary and odd to transfer Hoovers enmity to LBJ. The cast is fine. David Oyelowo is a talented actor but, not for a second do I feel like I'm watching Dr. King. The film was hamstrung by the fact that Dreamworks owns the rights to Kings actual speeches and they had to be paraphrased/re-created in Selma. Oyelowo doesn't have Kings voice or cadence. Paul Webb has, frankly, done a poor job trying to replace the eloquence of Dr. Kings original words. MLK was famous primarily for his oratory. His speeches and delivery were transformative and without the powerful words and delivery, we are left with a very thin facsimile. The film hardly compares to the great Jeffrey Wrights masterful portrayal of a younger MLK in Clark Johnson's fantastic TV movie \"Boycott\". Wright captured MLK with a mesmerizing performance and Johnson did a far better job humanizing the real life hero's of the civil rights movement. Where \"Selma\" fails \"Boycott\" soars. I'm still waiting for someone to do justice to Dr. King on the big screen, until then check out \"Boycott\". Sadly \"Selma\" was adequate at best.",

Fue el hombre que cambi� la historia al ser el l�der del movimiento hacia los derechos civiles de los negros en los 60's, Una marcha que comenz� en Selma hasta Montgomery, fue el detonante para que el Acta de Derecho al Voto fuese aprobada. Est� pel�cula cuenta todos los inconvenientes que se presentaron antes de poder realizar esta marcha.Es interesante ver el \"detr�s de escena\" en esta lucha civil. Me imaginar�a que todo queda en manos de King, y la realidad es mucho m�s burocr�tica de lo que parece. �l estaba en contacto constante con Johnson y ten�a que pensarlo bien antes de mover las piezas del ajedrez, ya que toda la responsabilidad ca�a sobre sus hombros. Es todo una estrategia pol�tica al fin, y es decepcionante, pero as� funciona el mundo. Igualmente en t�rminos de direcci�n, fue interesante mostrar este �ngulo de la historia, y sobretodo ver al hombre m�stico como un humano al fin y al cabo con sus propias inseguridades y dificultades. El era un l�der para miles de personas, pero tambi�n era un hombre que constantemente le fallaba a su familia, ya que es dif�cil balancear estos dos aspectos de su vida.David Oyelowo como King da la actuaci�n de su vida. A pesar de mostrar un lado no tan favorecedor de este personaje, su carisma y buenas intenciones salen triunfantes. Es dif�cil interpretar a una persona que realmente existi� y no caer en la caricaturizaci�n de �ste, pero Oyelowo logra darle un aire fresco a King. Al escuchar sus discursos que ya se han hecho famosos, pareciera que los escucharamso por primera vez, por la pasi�n con la cual los recita y es hipnotizante. Fue un crimen que no fuese nominado al Oscar. Carmen Ejogo (Coretta King), Tom Wilkinson (Lyndon B. Johnson) y Keith Stanfield (Jimmie Lee Jackson) dan actuaciones s�lidas.La direcci�n de Ava DuVernay es consistente, y se enfoca en los eventos m�s importantes de este movimiento, y logra un balance entre este lado y el aspecto m�s mundano de la vida de King, y igual lo hace interesante. Es admirable que haya tomado un proyecto de esta envergadura, luego de haber dirigido pel�culas independientes bastante m�s peque�as, pero lo logra con �xito y nos entrega una pel�cula bien hecha que logra cautivarnos y enfurecernos que esta era la situaci�n hace unos pocos a�os atr�s.",

    "review": "  Sometimes a film comes along at a certain moment in time when tensions are at their highest and it perfectly mirrors the frustration and anger that people in the present actually feel. It feels like as if everything is going against you no matter what and there is no hope for peace. But fifty years ago, it was reaching a tipping point for civil rights in the biopic Selma with renowned civil rights leader Marin Luther King Jr. leading the charge in hopes that downtrodden African Americans get the rights they deserve. Shocking in its depiction while truthful in its delivery, it's hard to find a timelier picture that speaks to our inherent need to speak up and enact action that gives all people equal rights.Set in early 1965 in Selma, Alabama, Nobel Peace Prize recipient Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) and civil rights leader is in the midst of social change as he leads a march from Selma to state capitol Montgomery to protest in response to violent racism and gross voter registration laws that makes it nearly impossible for African Americans to vote. Along the way he has to contend with a less than supportive President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson), a racist Alabama governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) hell bent on stopping him and his loyal but pained wife Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo) struggling to deal with the increased pressure from detractors and King Jr's own inhibitions. King Jr. faces an uphill battle that many don't think he can win but despite all he changes the nation to ensure that African Americans will get the rights they deserve.There weren't many performances this year where an actor completely immerses himself into a true life character. Eddie Redmayne's amazing performance as Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything would be one and Oyelowo's riveting performance as Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma would be the other. It would be hard to find another actor who fits the role more fluidly than Oyelowo who practically becomes him in so many more ways than one. You almost feel like you are watching him on screen and you can't help but get lost in his impassioned words of social reform. He showed amazing chemistry that helps when you're portraying one of the more important figures in American history and effortlessly goes with the flow, taking on whatever challenge that comes toward him. His voice and mannerisms looked spot on but it's also the quiet moments where you get to see the historic man behind the curtains and you see he is just as liable for fault like anyone else. Ejogo was the perfect companion to Oyelowo much like Felicity Jones as Jane Hawking to Redmayne in The Theory Of Everything. She was much more nuanced in her portrayal but was just as in tune with Scott King. Like any great co actress, she was the perfect anchor and was equally as powerful. Her straightforwardness towards King Jr. when she learned about his infidelities on tape was a clear stand out as well as Oyelowo's stone silence response that spoke many volumes. She was the needed element to bring King Jr. down a notch and show how his actions affect both of their lives as well as their children for better or for worse. Wilkinson is always great in everything he does and performs rather well as Johnson. I have no inherent knowledge of Johnson or his presidency but I enjoyed Wilkinson do what he does better than most people. Although he isn't as duplicitous as he was in real life, it was in the end necessary to portray the needed dramatics to drive the film home. The same for Roth as the racist governor who was rightfully held back and had his overt villainy toned down to not make him a caricature of himself. He spoke like any hustler would and contradicted himself on what rights he wants African Americans to have in a revealing conversation about their immortality after death with Johnson. King Jr.'s inner circle also had much screen time to take over and take center stage including an impressive supporting cast composing of James Bevel (Common), Bayard Rustin (Ruben Santiago-Hudson), Amelia Boynton Robinson (Lorraine Toussaint), Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey), Fred Gray (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), Richie Jean Jackson (Niecy Nash), Ralph Abernathy (Colman Domingo), Andrew Young (Andre Holland), Diane Nash (Tessa Thompson), Hosea Williams (Wendell Pierce) and a few others. While the acting was rather excellent all around, I just couldn't help but not notice Oprah. A person of her stature is too hard to ignore and it made it somewhat hard to ignore. It kind of took me out of the film the times she was shown. I personally find her grating and I know that she's a producer on Selma, but just felt like another thing she can put her name on.The direction by Ava DuVernay was really top notch from many standpoints. She had great control for the camera and the surroundings. Emotionally palpable but fueled with real life intensity, it often comes at you hard where you don't expect it too; especially if you aren't familiar with the civil rights movement. DuVernay doesn't resort to cheap biopic tactics or gloss over certain themes and shows them all for all of their ugliness. Being that it's a biopic, many things get enhanced to make the movie more interesting. The depiction of Johnson as a blockage to King Jr.'s plans for voter rights was embellished no more than other biopics who take creative freedoms. She frames characters within a tight space, often on the edge of the screen to give the scenes an added pressure feeling. The bombing of the church got a huge jump scare out of me, mainly because I forgot that it was happening and how natural it was filmed. It didn't just happen but you see the girls just talking about Coretta and her hair and then it just goes off. Very loud and brutal without even showing blood, it was quite the visceral scene that sets the tone of the film. The second march into Montgomery onto the Edmund Pettus Bridge which came to be known as Bloody Sunday was terrifying, violent and as shocking as anything you'll see all year, fictional or not. Not many other film sequences in the past year matches that in terms of outright barbarity, especially because it's true. It's something you don't want to see but have too as it's a vital and unfortunately an important part on the civil rights movement. It set the tide for the eventual victory for King Jr. and a gross blemish in American history. The lighting looked spectacular as many times throughout the film, characters are shrouded in darkness with only a hint of light hitting them. You really get a feeling that hope may never come and the moody lighting perfectly set the tone of gloom. This worked especially when King Jr. was imprisoned and was covered in a mixture of shadow and gold light; where it showed a dichotomy to the state of mind of King Jr. Even though he is imprisoned, there is always a glimmer of hope within. The cinematography by Bradford Young was exemplary as the shots were so exquisitely executed that it completely transports you back into those tumultuous times. You get a perfect example at how big the movement really was and the scope of the people involved. The angles were also great as they skewed how King Jr. was seen to go alongside the increased pressure he was given. What may be most impressive is that the screenplay by Paul Webb didn't have access to any of King Jr.'s speeches and wrote them all himself. They sounded exactly how they would sound like from the real King Jr. with the same amount of passion, intensity, emotion and frustration. You couldn't help but feel impassioned by those speeches, even though they were written for the film, as they hold as much resonance in a biopic as they do in real life. The rest of the script was human and relatable that allowed you to really get the ins and outs of King Jr.'s crusade. It painted him as the ultimate general using all the power at his disposal to get his voice heard by as many people as possible. He knew exactly how to concoct a plan without using or resorting to violence and to use the media for the greatest benefit. With so many acts of violence against African Americans all over the country by police, it's hard to not talk about rights violations and the like. Clearly we have come far as a nation but only so far when it comes to race relations. Selma shows that these issues are just as resonate as ever and that it must still be talked about even with all the supposed equality many talk about. Voter registration violations are still happening today as we speak which says something on how ignorant we really are as a nation. We are still just as ignorant and violent towards others that look different than us. But if people start to enact violence in response, the work of Martin Luther King Jr. and his team as well as all those who were killed and injured will be meaningless and no one will have learned a thing. It's easy to shoot, punch, stab or what have you against another person but it's a lot harder and meaningful to say no to violence and to not resort to a mob mentality. It's easy to shrug Selma off as mere race baiting and a shallow attempt at Oscars but thinking that is just the reason why it was made in the first place. Obviously there is racism towards many people all over the world but as soon as we as a people and a nation realize that the color of one's skin shouldn't matter to anyone, there will continue to be films like this.I don't want to boast certain films as a must see that everyone should watch, but Selma certainly fits that mold. It may not even need awards recognition to be important but it may be even more so in the long run. Because of its shutouts of various award ceremonies, people continue to debate its place in a society that is uncomfortable talking about race. Coming from someone who has no deep knowledge of Martin Luther King Jr. and his fellow civil rights leaders, it has piqued my interest considerably on that time period. I don't know all the players in the game but I was more interested on this issue than I was before I saw Selma. That in itself should be a victory since as long as people are interested in history and talking about events that shaped a nation and the world in a civil manner, it shouldn't matter how many awards it gets. Selma is the true to life harrowing story that is all too poignant and timely when race issues are at their most fervent. Four and a half marches into Montgomery out of five.",

Likewise, some characters are given unsatisfying arcs (Coretta) and some are dubiously portrayed (Johnson). Still, what makes it worth watching is Oyelowo�s strong performance as Martin Luther King Jr. because besides portraying the historical figure we all know about, he gives him depth, presenting him as a flawed and internally conflicted human being. There is always more than simply goodnes and morality to a person.",

The script is full of historical references that all create a rich, full atmosphere that immerses the viewer almost as much as a complex, well written TV show. The movie also exceeds in making this movie about the march from Selma to Montgomery and the political and social relations that surround it. The protagonist is Martin Luther King, but he is neither glorified nor is his death, which is always regarded as a tragic yet overused moment, featured, which makes the film seem that much more original and clever.

Director Ava DuVernay doesn't fail to hold your attention with realistic and compelling depiction of the events of the Civil Right Movement which could have felt boring history chapter otherwise. The tone of the storytelling is outright serious and make sure you keep that in mind before deciding to watch it. The story mainly focuses on MLK's campaign in Selma and the historic march for equal voting rights in 1965. Despite the dry nature of the script, it holds your attention thanks to great acting and the resonating themes which it dwells into. With moments be it the energetic speech delivery by Dr. King or the arousing feeling you get while watching the campaigners march hand in hand, Selma really strikes the right chord. 'Glory' which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song is really soul- stirring. The cinematography is solid and captures the unrest among the people perfectly. The screenplay could have been a bit less broad and a bit more stimulating. Despite few of its shortcomings, Selma is a really good biopic and a well crafted film.RATING: [3.5/5]",

As critic Paul Chambers from Movie Chambers indicated: \" A treasure trove of outstanding performances, brilliant writing and heartfelt direction.\" From beginning to end, a gripping, educational, moving film inspired by true events that took place during the epic showdown between the Alabama state troopers, police and black residents of Selma, Alabama as they attempted to march along the bridge to the courthouse in order to register to vote and obtain voting rights. A piece of American history that was brilliantly told, depicting moments of doubt by Martin Luther King Jr. (amazing performance by David Oyelowo). Bravo to the cast and crew in particular Tom Wilkinson as President Johnson, Alessandro Nivola as John Doar (great Southern accent), and Carmen Ejogo as Coretta S. King. An interesting bit of trivia- Selma's director is a woman (Ava DuVernay) and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) who oversees the Oscars nominations, made history in 2013 when for the first time elects a black president and only the third woman chosen to the post. If you watched the Oscars this year (like I did) you will remember her giving a speech during the Oscars. Recommended!",

The approach here is the biggest problem and it is very polarizing - it is at times very grounded and wonderfully realistic, but at times also very typical, never quite distinguishing itself from other movies of this type and the film unfortunately lacks the energy and inherent power that it should have had.",

    "review": "  An inspirational, emotionally and racially charged depiction of defining moments of the American Civil Rights movement, Selma is a powerful movie that asks uncomfortable questions, relates to our post-modern times and pleases with strong performance of its leading actor. Slower than necessary in the first part, it manages to build up in the second half a superb and electrifying atmosphere that keeps the audience captivated and hypnotized by this short, but extremely remarkable moment of the US history. The movie tracks the events of 1965 related to the Civil Rights Movement, the preparation for the legendary march from Selma to Montgomery and the whole political gambling and playing during this period. The story shows in details how Martin Luther King (David Oyelowo) and his companions managed to electrify the whole country so that President Lindon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) signed the Voting Rights Act later that year. Ava DuVernays' delivery needs some more time to take off as the first half of the movie is slow, hardly intriguing and taking more time to show King's personality rather than the events that electrified the whole nation. The patience, however, is rewarded and soon the story goes into a dramatic direction which confronts the audience with the tragedy of the activists, with the fears of the conservative white society and the political brinkmanship surrounding the events. Two major assets of the movie should be pointed out in Selma. First and above all is the charismatic acting of David Oyelowo who stuns with his voice performance and articulation. The dialogues with President Johnson (Wilkinson) are the other fascinating element of DuVernays' movie. A finest example of political gambling and brinkmanship, observing MLK vs. President Johnson is an absolute pleasure. The same should be said for the moments when Oyelowo takes control with his presence in meetings with his companions, his ability to restrain himself and his people from acting emotionally and thus endangering the whole movement is remarkable. In the end, the movie becomes a sort of showcase to David Oyelowo's abilities to impersonalize Martin Luther King - something that he does formidably!In conclusion, there has been much dissatisfaction that Selma did not take home at least several Academy Awards. It is hard to say whether it was right to receive only one award for Best Original Song (Glory), but one thing is sure: it could have received at least several nominations. With \"Oscar Contender\" written all over it, Selma deliver what it aspires to - a gripping and inspirational drama, outstanding performances and a topic that is still relevant to our post-modern society. Definitely a must see !",

Dr. King's way is a good way as it draws attention and if there is violence it is not from you. Turn this into today, what can we do to turn the situations around? No rioting, no violence, and no looting. Be peaceful, be mindful...... think forward. Demand change sure but what change do you want? Not all law enforcement is bad so let us look at cameras as a way that can tell part of the story and help us see what happens. We live in a country where we can ask for this and we can get it be applying pressure, without violence, to those in power. Rally together and not apart. Peace to victory, peace to change......",

I actually wanted to see a biopic movie about Martin Luther King Jr. as it's fascinating about what he has done that change history. David Oyelowo is amazing in this that I'm surprised that he didn't get nominated for best actor in the Oscars. The directing and the writing are really good, and the rest of the acting is great. It's actually human to see that Martin Luther King Jr has no idea if it's going to work, and instead thinks that it's not going to work, but still tries no matter what. The soundtrack is really good, and the characters are memorable, especially Martin Luther King Jr. himself. Selma is a memorable movie that I know that many schools would use this for history classes.",

The talented cast, led by a phenomenal David Oyelowo, leads us through an emotionally and politically astute stand against racism. The flawless direction from Ava DuVernay questions the sanity of the academy awards. 2 nominations? The Direction, Acting, Cinematography, Music, and Writing are all more than valid for this Years oscars. its a film despite being unrecognized by academy members, a hard-hitting, phenomenally executed depiction of Martin Luther Kings march from Selma to Montgomery that doesn't glorify his death, but illuminates the importance of what he changed in history. Luckily, David Oyelowo was able to connect with everyone in the theater, reaching out to many, projecting Martin Luther King as the powerful and thoughtful man he is. And they nominated Bradley Cooper for best actor over Oyelowo? ha, nice one.",

    "review": "  Very well done. Really engrossing. Like the movie Lincoln which concentrated on passage of the 13th amendment to the Constitution it was a smart move to concentrate on one episode in Martin Luther King's life and the Civil Rights movement rather than a more comprehensive look. As far as I could tell they stuck pretty accurately to real events. A couple of things bothered me a bit. The scene where MLK turns around the second march across the Pettus Bridge was portrayed in a way to make it look like he had lost his nerve. In fact he was in a bind needing to follow through for all of the folks that traveled to Alabama to participate, but at the same time not wanting to defy a court order. He ended up making a deal with reps from the justice department to march to the spot where the violence had taken place and then turn around. This was hinted at in the courtroom scene but not explicitly stated.Also, I know there has been some controversy over how Lyndon Johnson was portrayed. After seeing it I have to say I agree with those critics. First, though the FBI had been bugging King for years and had plenty of evidence of his womanizing, as far as I know it was J. Edgar Hoover who sent the threatening tape to King and his wife. The movie made it look like LBJ had ordered that done. I do not believe there is any evidence for this and it makes no sense. Johnson needed King to be the face of the Civil Rights movement to help channel it away from violence that was always a possibility. No legislation would have passed had the movement turned to violence which is what Johnson wanted.Related to this the film gave the strong impression that Johnson was forced into supporting Civil and Voting rights against his wishes. This is just not the case. Johnson was committed to civil rights and was deeply affected by the violence that was taking place. The film also made it appear Johnson's protestations that his delay in submitting voting rights legislation was just him dragging his feet, unwilling to risk another fight with Congress. However, there is truth in this. Johnson was bucking the southern wing of his party by supporting Civil Rights and relied on Republicans to help break filibusters on these bills. Careful planning and preparation had to take place were they to have any chance. The film is correct in noting Vietnam was also diverting Johnson's attention, but so was the war on poverty.So, while I really admire this film and would recommend it to anyone as a pretty accurate portrayal of events folks should keep in mind these departures from history!",

It also seemed like if you were going to include X in the story, you should have explained the major philosophical differences between him and Dr. King and why King's strategy worked but X's did not.

    "review": "  Such a travesty that David Oyelowo and Ava DuVernay were not nominated for Best Actor and Director Oscars. Oyelowo could and should have easily swept awards season (since McConaissance wasn't in the picture :-P) with his resonant basso and gut-rumbling delivery of MLK's marcato articulation. His dynamic gestures as well as his wide, knowing eyes carry the wins and losses of the Selma protest march and almost foreshadows the tragedy to come. Ava DuVernay's perceptive direction interweaves several concurrent threads: from the earth-shattering bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, to Annie Lee Cooper's stalwart struggles to vote, to MLK and Coretta Scott's marital strife.",

    "review": "  A doozy. This shows the life and times of the great Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo), and how he inspired an entire race of people to stand up for themselves and march from Selma to Montgomery for equal voting rights. I'm writing this well after the Oscars have already come and gone, but I actually watched this before they aired. Obviously, we all know the end results, but even before February 22nd, I foresaw the outcome for Selma at the Oscars, given that this got snubbed for best director and, much more egregiously, best actor. David Oyelowo transforms for this role; if you close your eyes, he has the voice and speech patterns down, and when you open them, he is not an actor, he is Dr. King himself, but Oyelowo still manages to own it and put his own personal stamp on his committed performance. He manages to capture everything you know about MLK and more. He is so good at delivering speeches, and it is not hard to see how this man was one of the most inspirational people to ever walk this Earth. What is so great about Selma is how notably relevant it is. There is so much brutal, violent racial crime today that is still occurring today against the black community, and you would think that more progress would been made these past 50 years, but you'd be surprised. Trayvon Martin. Michael Brown in Ferguson. The list goes on, and events like this are going to continue to happen until another great influential person can come along to instigate change. Even if you are Caucasian, this is going to make you really mad at white people at the beginning, although this does show people of all races standing up for what is right in the end. It really makes you irked with the South, and speaking as somebody who has lived in Florida for twelve years, I think I can go the rest of my life without going to Alabama. Selma is an effective, emotionally charged movie. It will upset you, and it is very easy to get invested in because the film does a great job of constantly reminding you just how high the stakes are. Also, there are these real life logs from FBI communication that periodically pop up throughout, and it gives you a weird feeling about the government; was it really absolutely imperative to monitor and spy on a person just trying to stand up for his civil rights? For a movie about race that is noticeably apropos, Selma is a very important film.",

Otherwise, there wouldn't have been such criticism.\" But the film exceeded my expectations a bit. It is slightly better than most Oscar-bait historical dramas, and oddly, I found its central strength to be what many of the awards pundits considered mediocre - the direction. Now I feel it did get a bit of a bad rap. The Oscar campaign may have been preachy, but the film was not - white supporters of King have linchpin roles in the story. As a screenwriter, I can say the script is not anything special. It leans on the content of Dr. King's amazing speeches. It doesn't do a great job of forming the events into a narrative structure. The supers that some may not like because they do not resolve are script things, not director things as many might assume. Also, there are a whole bunch of characters that are glorified cameos. It's kind of King and everyone else. But the lead's performance, in terms of emotion if not totally in terms of accuracy, really elevates the material, and I would say, so does the direction. The ending of this film, after it returns from news footage of the famed march to a cinematic version of the speech at the capitol, is incredibly stirring and it is that way purely by the hand of the director and the lead.",

Though I may be biased seeing as how Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is my favorite human being in all of history, as a film, this piece works well with what it has. After hearing several complaints in regards to Tom Wilkinson's performance and portrayal of LBJ, I can safely say that these rants are ill-founded and have no negative effect on history or the man himself. There are no stand-out performances here, but rather the entire cast is excellent, immersing themselves into their roles as active participants in King's legendary non-violent movement. While there are a few lulls and the story does seem to float off on a tangent at times, these small problems do not affect the movie as a whole, as it expertly handles a rocky and difficult subject. As to why this film did not win best picture? I am at a loss.",

He decides to choose this location for a protest march against the whites denying the blacks the right to vote, even though the law allows them to.This felt real, from the beatings of those who were protesting along with the savagery they were handled with during these peaceful marches along the bridge. You see the story unfold mainly from the point of Dr King and those working with him.Tom Wilkinson also excels as President Johnson who was weak as he didn't stand out but i guess he had a lot of flack from all sides to deal with.

    "review": "  Important movie. But not much has changed in 50 years.'Selma' is a historic drama based upon the true events of the civil rights movement, in particular the march for voting rights for blacks in Alabama, USA in the year 1965.It is one of a long list of educational and insightful films about that era. Some of my favorites include 'Separate but Equal' (Sidney Poitier), 'Ruby Bridges' (Penelope Ann Miller), Malcolm X (Denzel Washington), 'Ghosts of Mississippi (Whoopi Goldberg), 'Freedom Song' (Danny Glover), and movies about civil rights in other countries such as South Africa (Nelson Mandela) and India (Gandhi).'Selma' has a courageous screenplay, touching on sensitive, yet crucial elements. A powerhouse cast of actors and actresses. Historic accuracy and respectful story-telling makes this film a winner.However, I am reminded that even now in the year 2015 - a full half century later, the country has the exact same issues. Let us take a look at some: Civil Rights - yes, blacks are still denied equal opportunity in many parts of the U.S. There are many systemic and deliberate laws still in place to keep them poor and uneducated. Voter apathy is encouraged by dumbing down the population with sports and religion. Discrimination and inequality - from education, to income, to life expectancy. Blacks rank the lowest of any minority group. Not because they don't want an education or because they don't want to earn a good wage. But because of generational injustices and inequalities that have long been placed upon them by a racist government that has never considered them equal. Police Brutality - how convenient has it become for police, or anyone, to murder a unarmed black man and be found non-guilty. America has never considered the black male equal or worthy. Has always been afraid of them and considered them suspect. Apartheid and Segregation - from Detroit to Washington DC, from Los Angeles to Miami, blacks are still segregated. 'White Flight' into the more expensive suburbs relegates poorer blacks to the ghettos and hoods of America. Immigration - latinos are lured to the U.S. to do the worst jobs for the worst pay, but 14 million of them are denied any path, whatsoever, to proper immigration. They remain with no work visa, no green card and no citizenship. Essentially living with absolutely no rights. Asians (India and China) immigrants after waiting a decade or more for a green card, eventually give up and go back to their home countries. Incarceration and institutionalized Slavery - there are more black men in prison today, then there were black men in slavery 200 years ago. The justice system is determined to put as many black males inside a prison cell as possible. Once inside, they are used as slaves to do work for zero pay.50 years. Not much progress. No real hope for change in this country for minorities. Very sad.",

    "review": "  It's unfortunate what happened to Selma this year. And no, I'm not talking about the nominations issue, though I'll lay it out there right now, Ava Duvarney, David Oyelowo and the screenplay all deserved nominations. No, I mean the fact that hundreds of people who didn't even see the film launched their \"Who was this not nominated?\" outrage, causing the typically defensive talking heads to launch back about how \"Lyndon Johnson isn't portrayed right\", leading to a lot of inflammatory shouting and damaging overexagerations (hint, don't use the word \"only\" unless you mean \"only\", because the very existence of Training Day's Oscar proves the Academy doesn't \"only\" award subservient black roles, just almost exclusively, and if you're gonna go up against actual racists in the media, you gotta be armed with irrefutable facts, not generalizations). All of this, all of the political grandstanding and stunts on both sides detracted from what could have been a very poignant film that could have made a difference. The \"Oscars so white\" movement thrust Selma as a pawn in the ongoing racial tension in America, rather than it being a bridge across a gap. After all, this raw, human portrait of MLK, rightly called an \"anti-biopic\" for deftly avoiding the deification of its subject or the Hollywood-ization of its story, has a lot to offer today's America, if the people who needed to hear it actually saw it. So soon after a series of murders rocked New York City, to see a scene where an angry young man wants to find a gun to \"fight back\" against the police, he's advised that \"you kill two of them, they kill ten of us\". The film is an example of many things, from the power of non-violent protests to the cruelty of a world before the (now repealed) voting rights act, all the while at its core being the portrait of one incredible man. It's my hope that in years down the line, people untainted by the politicizing of this marvelous film might get to appreciate it for what it is.",

La historia en t�rminos generales es algo que me fascina y esta cinta est� impregnada de ella de principio a fin.

Selma is one of the three major events in the fight for civil rights.But what made it so disturbing is that the very same issues are still prevalent.Only minor issues changed. There's still widespread injustice and racism. Dr. King thought that the voting right will get blacks into juries and racial injustice will disappear. It did not. Juries are profiled, as voters were profiled before. Judges, police and government can still do what they want, and will not be held accountable.There are still such demagogic protests necessary.

David Oyelowo gives a commanding performance as Dr Martin Luther King, and it's easy to see why some felt he missed out on not getting an Oscar nomination. Uncomfortable viewing at times, but thankfully violence is not overplayed, in fact much of the film concentrates on behind the scenes action, with King's family and debate among other activists, almost introspective. For long periods I could just hear the steady sound of crunching from the kids in the row behind me munching their way through a seemingly never-ending bucket of nachos.

I thought Selma had its moments but just wasn't a great film and had lots of problems -- poorly-written dialogue, a confusing crux, a lack of oratory, the best actors playing small parts, constricted camera shots, too much about the Kings' domestic conflict, too much about LBJ (he could have appeared just once or twice). It maybe attempts to be restrained but comes across as constricted and lacking the full range of affect and emotional depth. It doesn't even come close to a film like Spike Lee's 4 Little Girls, which was nominated in the past. Another film that comes to mind is Malcolm X, which is an excellent and masterful portrayal of a charismatic figure. The fact that King's family didn't endorse this film speaks volumes.",

    "review": "  This movie, Selma, was a very moving film that depicted the struggles of the african americans in Selma, Alabama. It's actors made the film a reality for the audience through the real events that occurred. I enjoyed this film for many reasons that I will explain to you in the following paragraphs.  The film was set in the mid 20th century in the south, where blacks were being persecuted because of their color. I was fascinated by the events that unfolded in Selma. In Selma, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was convinced that they needed to stage an epic march from Selma to Montgomery to show that peaceful protests were the only way. In the middle of the picture, their was a small protest and the police killed a young man by the name of Jimmy Lee Jackson. He was beaten and then shot in the abdomen trying to protect his father from the police in the town. At the end, they made their final march from Selma, with white and black people hand in hand, to Montgomery.  Actor's can be hard to come by for a motion picture, such as, this one. The actor, David Oyelowo, played Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the film. This man sounded and gave the persona of what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would be like in my opinion. His speeches changed the environment in the theatre. The actor's in this film made me become so attached to it at the beginning, that I cried when they cried, and smiled when they smiled. David Oyelowo also developed the character of Dr. Martin Luther King so well that he included the part in Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s life where he didn't care if his life was going to be lost in this time of hardships, which made his wife very frustrated.  The final part of this movie that I would like to talk about, is how real it made me feel as I sat there motionless in my chair. One of the most emotional parts in this movie, was when Jimmy Lee Jackson's grandfather was starring at Martin Luther King Jr. in the Autopsy room, and says, \"When will this end. This fighting, this feuding. When Dr. King?\" Martin Luther King Jr. just stands there, and starts to weep. This was taking a great toll on Martin luther King Jr. and he finally sees what is coming from this protesting.  As an overview, I would say that this film moved me and inspired me, as those proud white and black people walked across that bridge and all the way to Montgomery. I don't know what it was in the film that made me realize how much people will give to receive what they want. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, \"The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy\". I was shown in this film, that there are controversies in our world, but that we can still overcome with bravery, courage, and a will to do something about them.",

The fact that I came out of Selma feeling quite angry is testament to the power of the way the film was made. Last year The Butler and Mandela were relatively light portrayals of recent black history and they didn't do their subjects any real justice. Selma emphasises the wrongs that occurred in America only a few generations ago and by concentrating on specific events it amplifies the emotional response. David Oyelowo is surprisingly nuanced as King, it is a powerful performance that is big when it needs to be but for the most part it is understated. It should have received awards recognition, there are no two ways about it (just what was Oscar smoking this year?).",

Por mucho que alguien como Martin Luther King luchara de esa forma por los derechos civiles de la poblaci�n negra, hoy en dia estamos cada vez mas lejos de aquellos momentos, de los puntos de vista qiue defendia. Y por eso una pelicula como Selma merece ser tenida en cuenta, premiada y sobretodo valorada como lo que es, una obra maestra absoluta que remueva la conciencia de todos.

    "review": "  Earnest civil rights drama depicting the 1965 marches from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery, Alabama in support of voting rights equality for African-Americans led by the non-violent activist leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (David Oyelowo). The march on the Edmund Pettus Bridge by peaceful demonstrators who were attacked by armed officers - an incident that became known as Bloody Sunday - led to passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act. The movie is most effective as a complex representation of King. He's not presented as a saint but as a man struggling with self-doubt and marital infidelity. Oyelowo is impressive at showing King's enormous oratory skills, but is just as compelling in conveying his shrewdness. It must be noted that the portrayal of LBJ (Tom Wilkinson) as an antagonist to MLK and Civil Rights is so historically dubious it almost undermines the picture. Fortunately, writer Paul Webb and director Ava DuVernay have crafted a passionate, emotionally stirring movie that reverberates even more now. Won Oscar for Best Song. Cinematography is by Bradford Young. Music is by Jason Moran. With Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King; Tim Roth as George Wallace; Oprah Winfrey; Lorraine Toussaint; Cuba Gooding, Jr.",

I personally think that he was MILES ahead of Bradley Cooper in American Sniper, and that he should have been nominated. Tom Wilkinson is also terrific. Even though the Film did not capture the REAL Lyndon B. Johnson, and that HE had the idea of the march, he is still well interoperated. One red flag: The Studio marketed both Oprah and Cuba Gooding Jr a lot, but they were basically in it for 8 and 2 Min respectively. Still, that did not affect the film. Ava DuVernay has created an American Classic, that will be the legacy of Martin Luther King. Overall: Selma plays out exactly how MLK's Legacy should be, and rises even more. One of my personal favorites.Rating: 97% and A+.",

This film reminds us not to take that right for granted and that we need more fearless leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. The greatest injustice of the Academy Awards is the fact that David Oyelowo was not recognized for his portrayal of MLK.

    "review": "  A solid reenactment of - obviously - actual events with amazing performances, cinematography, atmosphere and exemplary filmmaking in general, Selma is something that, basically, will never be captured by the awkward re-enactments and biopics that litter the History Channel and Lifetime. And while it is yet another award-bait, biopic entry for 2014/2015, screenwriter Paul Webb chose to go with a specific time period in Martin Luther King, Jr.'s life rather than one which constantly flashed back to his previous years, and despite being a long shot, Selma's success is attributed to this refined focus on just one of the many crucial moments of MLK's life, rather than splitting the movie up to focus on different parts of the latter's life, which was what the likes of The Imitation Game (2014), Unbroken (2014), and American Sniper (2014) had excruciatingly done.Selma's narrative is simple enough to understand; it's a civil rights march for equal voting rights in a time when equal rights was something that was spoken with apprehension, vitriol, ignorance and downright contempt in the southern parts of the United States of America; which, ironically, still is spoken as such. Drawing heavy inspiration from Gandhi's strategy of civil disobedience - though Selma omits explicitly mentioning it -, Martin Luther King rallies his 'forces' to march from Selma to Montgomery in a show of non-violent defiance to demand the removal of voting restrictions, the bureaucratic struggle that he faces with President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) and the 'forces' of Alabama are laid bare for all to see.A complete transformation of sorts, David Oyelowo drops his more recognizable appearance from what was seen in the likes of A Most Violent Year (2014), steps out of the shoes of a supporting actor and into the larger, leading actor shoes to take on the immense role of Martin Luther King, Jr., as he delivers a powerful and nuanced performance as the late leader of the African-American Civil Rights Movements known for his fire and brimstone speeches, while flanked by his many and just as talented co-stars such as Carmen Ejogo, as Coretta Scott King, and Tim Roth as the primordial laughing stock of Alabama, George Wallace.Director Ava DuVernay holds nothing back, going so far as to capture the tense and gritty stare-downs, violence and verbal sparring, as she impeccably keeps the movie moving at an exponential rate which fed on depth and flavor of its own scenes from Webb's screenplay. Selma doesn't exclude the toll that MLK's pursuit for equality has on both his convictions and the increasingly strained relationship that he shares with his wife, Coretta - played just as excellently by Carmen Ejogo -, and family, which also serves to humanize the iconic civil rights activist by painting him as a man who is as vulnerable as anyone else.",

I preferred it to Boyhood and Birdman which I felt were really over-rated films, but like those two films, I feel like that this film is really aiming for an Oscar and often that can be a film's downfall. Where as I felt films like The Imitation Game were just trying to be a good film. Does that detract from the film, not too much though it also detracts from the fact that the cast and characters do feel slightly under-used. I really enjoyed this film for all the right reasons. It did some excellent commentary on some recent dark history, it gave some outstanding performances from various cast members and I wouldn't mind seeing it again at some point and is a great credit to director Ava DuVernay.",

Not because it is a great film, although it is very good, but because this is a subject that still totally deserves to have a light shine on it very brightly. Martin Luther King was an icon and a hero and David Oyelowo plays him with perfect dignity. The film focuses on the march in Selma in 1965. All the main players are there, LBJ, George Wallace, Ralph Abernathy and the film really captures well in many powerful scenes the danger and emotion of the times. A very fine film that sometimes falls in sentimentalism and the direction is well crafted rather than original, but it achieves its aims in spades.",

There are years of oppression to overcome...the dark years of the South do come back to haunt those who can remember. It was not too long ago that Ferguson happened. Selma could easily be a lesson for events for today and assist in a great approach to make things better. Nothing is that easy though and this movie wants to tell its story. David Oyelowo is very good as Martin Luther King...fiery in his speeches and humble in his introspection on what he faces. Carmen Ejogo also brings a subtle, thoughtful approach to her Coretta. We see fear and the love that extends to all who join their flock. This could have easily been a historical pageant ...yet the director Ava DuVernays fights against this. She wins for the most part. Some of the scenes in the Oval office almost approach that typical approach. It is interesting to note that often Oyelowo would be shown in silhouette with back lighting. Perhaps this is because he is not completely identical to King...yet he certainly does embody his heart and soul.",

    "review": "  While watching Selma you forget that Martin Luther King Jr. is no longer with us. David Oyelowo absolutely comes alive in this role. Selma accurately helps us understand King's impact and paints him as the larger-than-life man that he was. However, you feel his struggles--his fear that this may all be for nothing. But he convinces himself that it won't happen--and it doesn't.While the director, Ava DuVernay, is superb in her ability to paint this fear along with the fear of the people, she fails to capture the grandiose of the turning points. She handles the buildups of emotions and tensions with great subtlety, but with this not being a story seen through to King's assassination she must give us climactic intensity through other means. Not to say that this movie isn't intense, but the build up keeps escalating to reach--not an explosion--but just a peak. And then the film ends. Oyelowo's performance gives us chills, but nothing else does. LBJ's speech leaves us wanting more, and the southern segregationists don't seem as disappointed as we would like them to be.But I applaud Selma for not taking the cliched easy route by depicting King's assassination. Instead, it leaves you hoping and, just like me, allowing the image of the man living on.Much like 2012's Lincoln, it's a film that helps us understand the politics behind the politics. However, unlike Lincoln, which gives a lot of detail without a lot of relatable intensity, Selma portrays events that happened right around the corner from where we are right now. We can still imagine that time. Not that that's bad in Lincoln's case, it just might make this movie more appealing to more of the younger demographic. Now in a movie that's as great of a watch as Selma, it's hard to write a review that has criticisms. So note that my criticisms don't mean that it's still not a great film. It's a really really great film and one that moves us. And it might be earth shattering for many, but a few of us will find it not outstanding from other civil rights films. I mean, it tells a terrific story, but just doesn't exactly have that finishing oomph that we crave the whole time.Twizard Rating: 96",

I wanted so badly to like this movie because it is so well made, and perfectly acted, and it tries so hard to be honest and righteous, but it is so damned slow and plodding that I felt myself almost willing Luther King to triumph in his endeavours just so the film could end. The best parts of the movie are undoubtedly the magnificent speeches delivered by King which are now legend but if I wanted to hear these I would prefer listening to the actual recordings no matter how well David Oyelowo performs them.

The Golden Globes gave Ava DuVernay and David Oyelowo nominations. It is a shame the Oscars didn't nominate more people involved in this film. Oyelowo delivers King's powerful speeches well. He also shows King's human doubt and the film briefly explores King's infidelity to his wife played by the stunning and bright Carmen Ejogo. The ensemble cast is multifaceted and this important period of history was a great one to portray on the screen. It is a more important lesson to listen to African American leadership, rather than denying it and trying to maintain white control over HIStory (the white male story). It is surely not beyond reason to see that political red tape and maneuvering could have caused President Johnson to repeatedly delay speaking about legislation that activist Martin Luther King, Jr. wanted action on much earlier. The marches King led definitely changed the nation and brought many people together, though there is still work to be done.",

    "review": "  Selma captures the true struggle MLK had to go through to at least get civil rights for African Americans. David Oyelowo is fantastic as Martin Luther King as he leads a great cast to tell the true story behind the build up to the famous Selma, Alabama march for civil rights. Selma is brutal at times as it shows the true beatings and violence blacks had to go through to just send a message. MLK and his group were never violent and wanted to protest in peace but certain white groups just didn't want it. Selma is a very enjoyable film and feeds you the historically facts of this march. It does feel a bit dry and slow at points but almost anything historical can feel this way. Selma sends the right message of inspiration and shows that what you believe in can be achieved. The power of Martin Luther King is shown in the film and really gives you the view of what he wanted.",

    "review": "  Combined review of Selma (2014) and Black or White (2014).There's a reason that race is regarded as the \"third rail\" when it comes to American politics. A half-century after the marches and protests, chief among them the influence of Martin Luther King Jr., the world feels just as fractious as ever when it comes to race relations. The inauguration of America's first black president was seen as a significant touchstone, but optimism has faded and recent headline-grabbing criminal cases, and the absence of indictments, have prompted thousands to voice their protest from assembly to street corner. Race relations are one of the thorniest issues today and will be for some time. Two recent films take two very different approaches to discussing race relations, and they're clearly made for two very different audiences. Selma is an invigorating, moving, and exceptional film showcasing bravery and dignity. Where Selma is complex, Black or White is a simplified and misguided sitcom writ large. In 1965, Alabama was the epicenter for the Civil Rights movement. Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) has his sights set on organizing a march from Selma to the sate capital in Montgomery. His wife, Coretta (Carmen Ejogo), is worried about the safety of their children, as death threats are sadly common for MLK. He needs to turn the tide of public perception to light a fire under President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to get him to prioritize legislation that would protect every citizen's right to vote. Without question, Selma is one of the finest films of 2014. It is powerful, resonant, nuanced, political, immediate, and generally excellent on all fronts. It's a rarity in Hollywood, namely a movie about the Civil Rights movements without a prominent white savior. This is a film about the ordinary and famous black faces on the ground fighting in the trenches for their freedoms. There are compassionate white people who heed the call, don't get me wrong, but this is a movie told from the black perspective. I suspect the portrayal of President Johnson had something to do with Selma's poor showing with the Oscars, though I can't fully comprehend why. Yes, Johnson is portrayed as a man who has to be won over, but he's on MLK's side from the beginning. He is not opposed to legislation to protect voting rights; he's just hesitant about the timing. Johnson says, \"You got one issue I got 100,\" and the pragmatic reality of pushing forward legislation through a divided Congress was real. Johnson was not opposed to MLK's wishes; he just wanted him to wait until the political process would be easier. In fact, in my eyes, Johnson comes across as compassionate, politically savvy, and he clearly makes his stakes on which side of history he's going to be associated when he has a sit-down with the obstinate Alabama governor, George Wallace (Tim Roth). Like the rest of the varied characters in Selma, it's a nuanced portrayal of a man in the moment.The march in Selma is a moment that seems like an afterthought in the narrative of the Civil Rights movement, dwarfed by the Montgomery bus boycott and the March on Washington. The movie does a great job of re-examining why this moment is history is as significant, an eye-opening moment for the nation to the brutal reality of oppression. The opposition is entrenched, thanks to a stagnant system that wants to hold onto its \"way of life.\" It just so happens that way of life meant very different things for black people. The movie is politically sharp, with dissenting perspectives arguing over the next course of action in Selma and the national stage. Selma is another in the current crop of biopics eschewing the standard cradle-to-grave approach to highlight a significant moment that highlights exactly who their central figure is (Lincoln, Invictus). With Selma, we get a battleground that allows us to explore in both micro and macro MLK, the man. The courage of ordinary citizens in the face of violent beatdowns and police bullying is effortlessly moving and often heartbreaking. There is a moment when an elderly man, reflecting upon a recent family tragedy, cannot find words to express his grief, and my heart just ached right then and there. I teared up at several points, I don't mind saying.There isn't a moment where I didn't feel that director Anna DuVernay (Middle of Nowhere) was taking the easy road or pulling her punches. The screenplay respects the intelligence of the audience to sift through the politics and the arguments, to recognize when MLK is igniting a spark, and just how complicated and fragile the Selma situation was back then. Here's a movie ostensibly about MLK but spends much of its time on the lesser known individuals like James Bevel and Congressman John Lewis, who walked alongside the man, taking time to flesh them out as people rather than plot points. MLK's wife is also given an important part to play and she's much more than just being Wife of Great Man. DuVernay's direction is impeccable; you feel like she has command over every frame. The sun-dappled cinematography by Bradford Young (A Most Violent Year) makes great use of shadows, often bathing its subjects in low-light settings. The score is rousing without being overpowering, just like every other technical aspect. This is a prime example of Hollywood filmmaking with vision and drive. With respect to the Academy, it's hard for me to imagine there being five better performances than the one Oyelowo (Lee Daniels' The Butler) delivers as the indomitable Martin Luther King Jr. It is rare to see an actor inhabit his or her character so completely, and Oyelowo just sinks into the skin of this man. You never feel like you're watching an actor but the living embodiment of history made flesh. This is a complex performance that shows refreshing degrees of humanity for a figure sanctified. He was a man first and foremost, and one prone to doubts and weaknesses as well. An excellent scene with top-notch tension and peak emotion involves MLK and Coretta listening to a supposed tape of Martin's infidelity. In the ensuing tense conversation, both parties acknowledge the reality of his affairs. It's a scene that's underplayed, letting the audience know she knows, and he knows she knows, but not having to rely upon large histrionics and confrontations. It's the behind-the-scenes moments with King that brought him to life for me, watching him coordinate and plan where to go with the movement. Oyelowo perfectly captures his fiery inspirational side, knocking out every single speech with ease. It's a performance of great nuance and grace, where you see the fear in the man's eyes as he steps forward, hoping he's making the best decision possible for those in desperation. There isn't one bad performance in the entire film, and this is a deep supporting cast including Wendell Pierce (HBO's The Wire), Tessa Thompson (Dear White People), Common, Giovanni Ribisi, Dylan Baker, Lorraine Toussaint (Netflix's Orange is the New Black), Stephen Root, Cuba Gooding Jr, Jeremy Strong, and Oprah Winfrey. It's been weeks now since I watched Selma but there are still many moments that I can recall that still have a tremendous power on me even in mere recollection. The opening sequence of the Birmingham bombing, a moment of horror frozen in chaos and debris, is a gut punch of a way to begin a movie about human beings fighting for equality. The sheer brutality of the response from the Selma police force and associates is horrifying, and a true pivot point for the movement in the eyes of the public. More so than anything else, Selma brilliantly and beautifully recreates the suffocating reality of injustice that was so prevalent for many African-American citizens, especially in the South. This is an era where people are being lynched with impunity just for being \"uppity.\" There was a supreme danger in simply standing up for equal rights, and many suffered as a result. The movie recreates this mood, this permeating feeling of dread and outrage and sorrow, so expertly and so artfully. From an early scene with a middle-aged black woman jumping through hoop after arbitrary hoop just to register to vote, you quickly realize that this vehemently hostile environment was never going to settle things on their \"own time,\" as apologists are prone to citing in lieu of federal intervention. Selma makes it abundantly clear why MLK felt the movement just could not wait, as Johnson requested. People are senselessly dying and being beaten al for the right to fairly vote. You feel the same sense of urgency with every scene, whether it's cold-blooded murder, noxious intimidation, or reciprocation that goes above and beyond any sense of responsibility, you understand exactly the terror it was to be black in the South during this time period.Another potent point of acclaim for Selma is how relevant it is to our own world today. While 12 Years a Slave was an often stirring and very professionally made biopic that exposed the ugly reality of slavery, it was not a film that screamed \"immediacy.\" Slavery ended in this country over 150 years ago, and while we're still dealing with the repercussions of treating other human beings as property, it's an easy film to dismiss in a backhanded, \"Well, that was so long ago, and we've come so far\" manner. The actions of Selma and MLK are still being felt to this day. We live in a world where many feel the justice system has its own separate-but-equal division, and the recent controversial grand jury decisions in the cases of Michael Brown and Eric Garner cannot be ignored. The reality for many black men in this country is statistically far more dangerous than others, fueled by a culture of entrenched racial bias that assumes the worst at first. The transit officer who executed Oscar Grant (detailed in the harrowing 2013 film Fruitvale Station) served eleven months in prison for a crime that had scads of witnesses. Garner's death is captured on video, and yet even the Staten Island coroner's report of \"homicide,\" wasn't enough to convince a grand jury that there was sufficient cause to at least go to trial. It's been noted that prosecutors could get a grand jury to \"indict a ham sandwich.\" According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, of the 30,000 cases that were not prosecuted in this country, only 11 were because a grand jury did not return an indictment (.0004%). However, grand juries rarely indict when a police officer is accused (In Dallas between 2008 and 2012, there were 81 grand jury investigations of officer shootings and only one actual indictment). It's hard not to feel like these things don't add up.Then there's the all-important struggle of voting, central to Selma and the plight of African-Americans in the South. You would think with Johnson's passage of the Voting Rights Act that we wouldn't be litigating the same issues of the past, but the Supreme Court determined that this country is far different then it was in the 1960s and there was no need for the Voting Right Act today. Within hours of striking it down, scads of new legislation appeared in the (primarily Southern) states that had been limited beforehand because of their past history of discrimination. The right to vote is just as relevant as it was during MLK's time and there are forces trying to stifle that right, to throw up new obstacles, new hoops, new challenges, all in the name of \"polling security,\" never mind that the cases of in-person voter fraud are so rare as to be one in every 15 million voters. It's a solution without a cause, and it's why many see it as a disingenuous political ploy. It's the twentieth-century, and yet the struggle for equality frustratingly repeats too many of the same battles. It's this historical and contemporary context that gives Selma its extra surge of relevancy, of reminding how far we still have to go, reminding the world that MLK's work is by no means complete and that it is up to the rest of the populace to fight for the kind of country that he spoke of in his \"I Have a Dream\" speech.It is this complex, complicated, and dire reality that hobbles another movie that tackles modern-day race relations, Mike Binder's imprudent Black or White. The plot of the film, inspired by a true story reportedly, centers on Kevin Costner as Elliot Anderson, a rich lawyer who has custody over his biracial granddaughter Eloise (the angelically adorable Jillian Estell). Now that Elliot has lot his wife, Eloise's other grandmother, Rowena Jeffers (Octavia Spencer), wants joint custody so Eloise can spend time around \"her own people.\" The two of them push and pull and lock horns over what's best for their grandchild, which gets more complicated when her biological father (Andre Holland, who is actually in Selma as well) comes back into the picture. Right away you can tell very early on that there will not be anything approaching subtlety in the world of Black or White, its own title serving as the first clue. The characters are sketched broad and the premise feels like a weird mishmash of Archie Bunker appearing in a court drama. And because it ends up becoming a court drama, you know where a majority of its third act will be spent. It's a preachy movie that doesn't have a deft hand when it comes to crafting a message that rises above easy observations disguised as something deeper. Eloise's father, Reggie, is so poorly underwritten that he feels like he stepped off the set of some after school special. He's addicted to crack, a lifelong screw-up, and a general disappointment that has never been present for his daughter's life. He even smokes crack out in the open on the front porch across the street from where his mother lives. At one point, Anthony Mackie's character berates Reggie for being a walking stereotype. Just because Binder calls attention to it doesn't excuse it. But he's not alone, because Spencer's sassy black matriarch character and Costner's gruff and frequently soused character are right there with him. The frequent arguments feel like they should be punctuated by studio audience hoots and applause, that is, if you could hear them over Terrence Blanchard's relentlessly overpowering musical score instructing the audience exactly how to feel with every clunky moment.In a way, the overbearing musical score gets at the major problem of Black or White, which is that a complicated case is being told from the safest point of view. Elliot is more akin to Clint Eastwood's character from Gran Torino then, say, Archie Bunker. He's irritable and prejudiced and old-fashioned and wary but balks if you call him a bigot. I mean he's polite to his Hispanic housekeeper. The more you examine the character you more you realize this is a movie designed to coddle an older generation (my tiny theater was packed with patrons over 60). The movie doesn't challenge anybody and actually rewards Costner's character and his outdated viewpoints. The opening conflict over his refusal to share custody with Rowena makes no sense. She's an excellent grandmother, caring, nurturing, a fine role model as well for her perseverance and starting several small businesses out of her home. Not only that but Rowena is surrounded by a large family of relatives that adore Eloise. It's contrived that these two could not agree on shared custody when they both have much to offer the girl. The only way any of this works is if Reggie is somehow responsible for the death of Eloise's mom. Perhaps he introduced her to crack and she overdosed. Unfortunately, it's never explained in the slightest, and so Elliot's hostility for the entire Jeffers clan seems petulant, especially with the happiness of his granddaughter in the balance. Without better context, his rampant anger seems to be guilt-by-association overkill. To his credit, Rowena has a major and annoying blind spot when it comes to Reggie's stability as a parent. In fact he's so obviously still on drugs that her ongoing refusal to accept reality harms her character irreparably.I the end, Black or White isn't so much a film that about race relations as it is about privilege. Costner's would-be bigot doesn't have a problem with black people, just as long as those black people abide by his rules of conduct and expectation. It's the same kind of qualification he's never had to consider for himself, and one the intended audience will likewise miss. He comes from a wealthy position and Rowena and her family are likely lower middle class at best. He has a world of class privilege at his disposal that the loving Jeffers family does not, and because of that he feels they are less suited to raising little Eloise. Perhaps he's worried about Reggie re-entering her life, but what animates Eliot Anderson is spite. He's consumed with the overriding assumption that he must be right in all things. While the film draws many heavy-handed parallels between Reggie's drug abuse and Eliot's alcoholism, it clearly presents the both of them on completely different planes of judgment. One of them is ultimately redeemable and the other less so. Eliot's perspective is essentially he can provide more and therefore more has to be better, but his definition of more is a private school, a housekeeper, a tutor who is treated as a caricature of initiative. Rowena provides a large and loving support system, but apparently they are less valued in the eyes of Eliot. And if you needed any more of a clue that Eliot and his sense of privilege are the unbeknownst star of the movie, he gets to deliver the big speech at the end that Says Something Meaningful. It feels a bit odd that the one character that uses the N-word in the film (albeit there is context) is the one telling lower-class black families how to live. I don't doubt the sincerity of writer/director Mike Binder; I don't think he purposely made a film to make older primarily white Americans feel better about thinking what they do about these troublesome times. It's not a nefarious movie but it is misguided and will provide cover for a certain selection of audience members who wonder why nobody is asking the old white guys their opinions on modern race relations. Even overlooking this charge, Black or White is just overblown melodrama that has to constantly explain everything to you at all times and guide you through every strained point. Selma and Black or White are both aiming at hearts and minds, looking to add to the conversation on contemporary race relations, but only one of them works as both an eye-opening message of empathy and as an exceptionally made film itself.

    "review": "  With the world of cinema long overdue for a film about Martin Luther King Jr., Selma sounded like a powerful film which was absolute necessary viewing.Selma is not a perfect film, but the passionate directorial work of Ava DuVernay is all too easily felt. It wasn't precisely what I had expected as the film did not tell his entire story or even depict his famous \"I have a dream\" speech. As a whole, Selma is a film more about his influence on the people around him and the general movement regarding the rights of African-Americans. While the film is a slow one which is not too deep in its characters, it certainly is a tale which is likely to leave the viewer cheering.Selma depicts one of the hardest ways that African-Americans had to suffer in history: simply through the process of fighting for their rights. The story of what Martin Luther King Jr. wanted is much different to the vision that Malcolm X had which was more racist and aggressive. Malcolm X is actually depicted briefly in Selma, and the contrast between his attitude and Martin Luther King Jr.'s is interesting. The way that Selma depicts Martin Luther King Jr.'s role in the movement really forces viewers to examine exactly how futile and pointless the concept of prejudice is. Selma shows the way that African-Americans attempted to fight for their rights in the most peaceful manner, refusing to respond to injustice with the violence that was forced upon them by racists and corrupt officials. The screenplay addresses this all with intelligently written language which is an accurate representation of the dialect spoken by people of the African-American race without ever resorting to racial stereotypes in the process. And although there are very many characters in the film who are not explored too deeply, the characters in the film give a lot of potential to the cast and they all end up turning in strong efforts. This adds to the film by capturing the large scale of events and depicting just how many people were influenced by Martin Luther King Jr.'s efforts, showing how strong the movement grew despite being in the face of such prejudicial violence. The harsh nature of 1960's racism in Selma is hard to confront, but Selma does it without getting too graphic or having to dramatize things forcibly, instead allowing the brutal nature of the true story to develop atmosphere on its own. To be frank, Selma is largely a recreation of the true story and not a Hollywood film which means that it has more honour to it than most biopics these days. Its themes are handled in much the same way that Bennett Miller handled the story of Foxcatcher, only Ava DuVernay does it better because she really has the spirits of the viewers rising with her film. She makes audiences look at just what kind of oppression her people faced back then, but also encourages them to consider that we really still have a long way to go to match up to his vision. The central theme at the heart of Selma is about giving African-Americans the right to vote. The film points out that even though they have that right, they are still prevented from using it due to ingrained prejudice in society. Even today this is a problem because being a conivicted felon stands in the way of one's voting abilities, and with the lack of education for African-American communities and prejudicial legal system standing against them it prevents them from being given the fair voice that they deserve. If viewers can't see it because of the media then perhaps Selma will make them do it because it certainly served as a ray of sunlight into my mind where I had to look at how peace can be used to combat violence while also examining how difficult it is to do that in such a prejudicial society. Ava DuVernay did a wonderful job of capturing me on that.All in all, everything about Selma does a beautiful job paying tribute to the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., and the leading performance of David Oyelowo is one of the most memorable reasons for that existing.David Oyelowo is perfect casting for the role of Martin Luther King Jr.. I wouldn't say that his performance was snubbed from an Academy Award nomination considering that Selma did not focus on the personal aspects of the character that much and was more about his influence, but there is no denying that his performance is still thoroughly grand. He looks the part perfectly and flawlessly captures the right tone of voice to deliver his words in a very wise manner. His line delivery embodies the heroism of the man while also capturing a sense of wisdom rarely found in actors, with the only appropriate comparison being Morgan Freeman. David Oyelowo could very well be the next Morgan Freeman, and his performance is just wonderful. He sinks really far into the role and delivers every word with a beautiful tenacity over them and a passion for the subject matter of the film without getting melodramatic or stepping out of the role for a second. His performance is a thoroughly beautiful one, and if Selma focused more on the character itself then there is no doubt that he would have scored an Academy Award nomination because it is a thoroughly beautiful effort.The supporting performances of Tom Wilkinson, Giovanni Ribisi, Cuba Gooding Jr., Oprah Winfrey, Carmen Ejogo, Nigel Thatch and Martin Sheen are also very strong. None of them stand out like David Oyelowo, but they all do a powerful job.So although Selma does not tell the full story of Martin Luther King Jr. or get all that deep about him, the powerful job it does of depicting his influence over society and the courage of the African-American rights movement through beautiful directorial work from Ava DuVernay and a strong central performance from David Oyelowo.",

Maybe producers should consider an HBO mini-series perhaps. Of course, having said that, there are exceptions to this. \"Selma\" serves as a great snapshot of the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr, but I'd have been keen to see a whole series highlighting more than just one part of the man's story. Oyelowo definitely delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.",

I will say that this was a rally good and really well acted movie. Particulary it's main star David oyelowo. He gives a fantastic performance as dr.King and you can see the drama that mr,king went thourgh. Though the other characters aren't as interesting as him, they still are interesting and I like each and every single one of them. It's a shame that David Oyelowo or the films director didn't get a nomination by the Oscars because she does a good job directing and moving the story forward. There was one weird scene where doctor king was smoking and I thought it was unnecessary but other then that this was a good film. But I think I should have liked it more but that's pretty much all there is to Selma.",

Ok I would suggest reading: Too Much Oprah: Oprah's Global Domination Overkill Who's it written by? Me. Yes yes yes, I knew that Selma was produced by two other production companies aside from Oprah's Harpo (jesus. even typing \"Oprah\" and \"Harpo\" in the same sentence exudes pretentiousness). But before watching Selma I mentally crossed my fingers and every other crossable body part hoping that Oprah wouldn't show her face in a movie she produced ( a la The Butler) Alas when she shows up in the second scene as one of the first shown black women trying to vote, that magical Make-A-Wish Foundation hope was obliterated. Thank Oprah-Almighty she only appears in like 4 other \"Oh look it's Oprah again\" scenes during Selma's 2 hr running time. My bigger issue surrounding Selma is related to the high-profiled or highly-celebritized people attached to film. Oprah; Tom Wilkinson (who actually did a decent job of playing President Lyndon B Johnson ), Giovanni Ribisi, Cuba Gooding Jr., Tim Roth, Martin Sheen and (pardon me why I ask the multiracial Gods of this universe WHY? For the love of WHY?) Common. Yes Common and John Legend do a powerful, get-off-that-pew-and-clap-your-heart-out synthesized performance of Glory (the film's only chance for an Oscar I feel). Played as the film closes, it backdrops Selma's final and most successful segment: the inclusion of real life, black and white news reals and camera shots of the actual march of Selma. But Common as an actor? Believable? Comm-on! No!! David Oyelowo does a valiant job at capturing the prestige yet keen fighting persistence of Martin Lurther King, Jr. Even if at times the ego in his portrayal feels somewhat inflated. There was one shocking moment where I gasped: the explosion of the church that kills the four girls. However after its initial quivering effect, it became one of many gratuitous stand alone scenes that was integrated into Selma as an incongruous scene purposely trying to sway the audience's feelings, perceptions and impressions to the film's subject material. Or at least that's how I felt by the finish of the film; a bit emotionally manipulated by director Ava DuVernay (first Hollywood wide release directorial debut) Even though it wasn't a \"bad\" movie, Selma was not a revolutionary movie I would put on any \"best of\" lists. Selma - along with American Sniper - feel like Patriotic historical pats-on-the-back flicks that got recognition not truly for it's material but for how they were produced and showcased. I would have more graciously enjoyed and appreciated watching a documentary on Martin Lurther King Jr's life rather than sitting through an all-star glamorized, Hollywood red-carpet engagement of it.",

Also, most MLK movies portray him almost as a saint. This movie portrays him as a man. A great man, but a man who worries about his wife, kids, and everyone involved in his protests. This is also helped by a powerful performance from David Oweloyo. He was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Along with showing MLK as a man, we saw the behind the scenes struggle to even make the march happen, which made it even more meaningful. My only complaint about this movie is that the middle drags. Even though the behind the scenes is interesting, the middle is a lot of people talking at each other for long periods of time. But overall, this movie shouldn't be ignored.",

    "review": "  Selma is a pretty entertaining drama about Martin Luther King, Jr. I think that David Oyelowo did a great job acting. He had a strong role and did a great job bringing the elements of courage and bravery to the screen with his powerful performance. It also had pretty good emotional power in it. This is not for everyone with its talk heavy dialogue but for those who like slower films then this is for them. It doesn't have the same power as \"12 Years a Slave\" does though. Still, it's good for a few viewings and it is pretty moving at some parts. I was pretty entertained by this. A couple of the boring or slower scenes lost me but there weren't too many of them and most of them were only in the first hour. It did a good job capturing the ugliness of the 1960's with the marches and some other sequences of violence. If you want to see a history lesson on screen then you'll likely enjoy the film.",

I have a very serious problem with the way the politicians were depicted in the film. Multiple times in the film LBJ and George Wallace refer to bleeding-hearts, liberals, and progressives in derogatory terms, which the majority of the public would likely assume indicates that they were Republican. This is an implication by omission due to the fact that BOTH LBJ and Wallace were DEMOCRATS and this information was conveniently excluded from the film, never to be mentioned. It makes me wonder if either actually was a Republican if the same omission would have been made. I seriously doubt it. Also, am I the only person that finds it completely bizarre that so many black people worship a Semitic god given to them by white people?",

    "review": "  Whenever I see a movie about a historical figure, certainly one as famous as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I have two questions a) What new angle is this movie bringing that makes it worth watching in addition to all of the previous footage, documentaries and films we've seen already and b) is the movie good on its own merit, or does the quality of the story reside entirely on the fact that what happened was true, and that history has proven this person to be right in the long run? In the case of \"Selma\" I am excited to say that not only is the film worth seeing even if you are familiar with the events that are being portrayed on-screen, but the performances and the angle at which the story tackled are so strong and so powerful that it's one of the best movies of 2014. This film is similar to 2012 \"Lincoln\" in that it's about Martin Luther King, Jr., but it's not about his entire life, it's about the events that developed in the small town of Selma, Alabama around the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches.I suppose I should begin by saying that this is a movie that anyone can watch and enjoy. Even if you're white (like myself) you're not going to be offended, you're not going to feel guilty about the racism being displayed in 1965. Not unless you're racist and you've done similar things to others, at which point either I commend you for being brave enough to see a movie that will hopefully change your views, or you're not even watching this film because you're a fool with Cro-Magnon era beliefs. The reason you will not feel guilty watching this picture is because you are intelligent enough to see past the colour of people's skin; you are going to be putting yourself in the shoes of the protestors, not of the racists who attack them. It's a powerful emotional experience, that is often troubling, but it's meant to be. You will feel upset, but it's the good kind of upset. It's the type of emotion that you are glad to have felt because it enriches your life and makes you understand your fellow man better.My understanding is that, like every movie that's \"based on a true story\" they take some liberties to make the film more coherent and dramatic, particularly during the moments between King and then-President Lyndon B. Johnson. I didn't care, and you shouldn't care because you shouldn't be basing your history reports (or book reports for that matter) on films. If you want the facts, you go to the library. If you want to be entertained, go watch the movie.Within \"Selma\" are some powerful and scathing reviews of the politicians at the time. The people in power at Selma, most notably Alabama Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) are very satisfyingly exposed for the brutish trilobites that they were. Are the portrayals exaggerated? I don't feel like they were (Except as I mentioned before when it comes to the President). The facts are that crimes against African-Americans were being committed and that no one was doing anything about it until the people who were being oppressed rose up. Even then they were met with senseless opposition from devils who hated them solely because of the colour of their skin. I found myself feeling white-hot hatred towards the spineless, dust-brained sons of jackals who dared to stand up against people simply trying to exercise their rights as ordinary citizens. Fortunately for me, and for those that were being oppressed, we are having the last laugh by seeing this film. History will remember them for what they are, and their legacies will only be one of hatred. Their names have become a curse to be thrown at the lowest of bottom-feeders and the most ignorant half-wits that barely qualify as \"living\". In that sense, I have gotten my revenge against them and boy am I glad.I love watching a movie with powerful emotions because it makes me feel alive. It's the opposite of watching something as awful as \"The Boy Next Door\", which made me want to cease existing out of embarrassment for the human race. This is a movie that makes you feel. It will shock you, it will make you feel sad and angry, but it also makes you feel empowered. I left the theatre invigorated, ready to take on the injustices of the world and determined to do something with my freedom to give the rest of humanity the same joys that I experience and take for granted every day. A big portion of the power of this piece is due to the transcendent performances on display. David Oyelowo as King is particularly powerful and nearly out shadows everyone else involved. It's the kind of powerhouse display of acting that knocks you off your feet it's so good, because it feels so genuine. I want to stress that this movie would have been good solely because of the subject matter, but it's the performances and the tangible dedication of Tom Wilkinson, Tim Roth, Keith Stanfield, Lorraine Toussaint and everyone else involved. There is not a moment where the film feels artificial or false, and for that I give praise to director Ava DuVernay.I can't think of anyone that shouldn't see this movie. Even if you extensively researched the events portrayed in the film and wrote a book about them, I think there are some things here that would powerfully resonate with you (you'll have to forgive the exaggerated events and character though). \"Selma\" is easily one of the best movies of the year, and it still would be if it was just David Oyelowo playing Martin Luther King, Jr. ordering a slice of pie at a diner. He is that good. (Theatrical version on the big screen, February 3, 2015)",

The first hour of the film is a bit slow and heavy on sermonising, however, it does allows you time to get to know the many characters better and MLK is, after all, known as an inspiring orator, so it seems churlish to complain as you cannot possibly have a film about him without showing off his oratorical skills. Thankfully, drama and emotions begin to build during the latter half of the film and in spite of a slight sense of manipulation, it never feels undeserved or unearned. Putting aside the obviously worthiness and relevance of the subject matter and the fact that the film was unjustly ignored at the Oscars with a pithy 2 nominations, I still can't help but feel that this is a film I ought to see, rather than a film I want to see.",

I was genuinely surprised to learn that King was only 39 when he was assassinated. I had always imagined he was older. To think, that at the time of Selma he was only 36 years of age. What a truly astounding individual! Of the film itself, David Oyelowo is magnificent as King, though I found the film perhaps a little too considered in its delivery and pacing to the detriment of the drama and chaos of the time (but that's just my opinion). It's also hard not to view the film through the prism of events occurring in contemporary US - and wonder who might step up, as King did, to lead the new generation in the struggle for civil rights. All in all, a very worthy film about an incredibly important time in history.",

    "review": "  Selma does so many things that I love in movies. It's a heavy topic, and there are some very dark moments, but there are moments of great levity, and an ending that is joyful and cathartic without forgetting all the low points that came before it. It's a historical drama that focuses on one very specific time period and goes for depth instead of breadth without remaining over-focused on one thing. If there are flaws to this movie, I suspect people would say that King's family doesn't get a ton of development, and his marriage is relegated to a subplot, but how else would they do it, and why does his family life need to dominate, anyway? What's wrong with keeping it as a small plot in the background? Especially when the few scenes that do carry it really count for a lot.I don't really know where to start. The acting is all fantastic, especially David Oyelowo, who gives dual magnetic performances as a charismatic leader and a regular old guy with flaws and insecurities. The direction is pretty great; all the action scenes are amazing, and there are a lot of interesting shots that I'm trying to analyze based on my film class composition lessons - in some shots there wasn't much head space, or look space, and the characters often didn't follow the rule of thirds like I've learned. These shots didn't bother me at all, but I'm curious as to what my professor would say about them.Once again, I have to mention how impressive it is how the film juggled breadth and depth. By sectioning off the narrative to three months, the film is able to touch on King's marriage, his cause, and many of the minor supporting characters who are involved, like Oprah's character, and the family of three whose son tragically died. The scene where King comforts the man's father is one of my favorites, and I was almost misty-eyed. It's remarkable how quickly I came to care for all the characters who had almost no development beforehand; the trick of adding in little tidbits and shots of them throughout the beginning of the movie really paid off in creating audience sympathy later on.The movie also somehow has time to explore Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. Frankly, I don't understand people's complaints with this. Johnson was still shown as coming around and signing the Voting Rights Act, and even if his real-life reasoning may have been more altruistic than the way he was depicted in the film (which I can neither confirm nor deny, knowing basically nothing about the subject), he did the right thing in the end. My general policy is that historical accuracy shouldn't be compromised if the truth would make a more compelling narrative, but I found LBJ's characterization pretty multi-faceted and fascinating, even if facts were distorted. I love that he was mostly unlikable, but not entirely unreasonable, and more likable towards the end (even if it was ultimately for manipulative or selfish reasons).And then there's just so many beautiful touches, like the priest who was beaten to death (another character given unexpected dimension just by virtue of seeing him several times), the arguments between King and his wife, and even the little 'thank you' you can see the sister of dead Jimmie mouth to King as he steps onto the stage for the last time in the movie. It's a triumph of civil rights with chilling echoes to the present, and it made me want to cry, laugh, and get up and march, all at once.",

These rooms are filled with the real subject of the movie: dialogues between men and women filled with faith and doubts and political concerns. These are interspersed with open-air scenes of protest and shocking brutality. I've seen \"Selma\" twice now and the endless nuances of the intimate scenes, esp. as played by David Oyelowo, are gripping in a way no amount of action can ever be. Ava DuVernay returns history to the personal level, but it's no less epic for that. \"Selma\" will far outlive just about any movie currently out there because no one ever gets tired of true and resonant insights on the problems and joys of being human, and the acts of faith and sacrifice required to change things.",

    "review": "  An electrifying presentation of real events that never feels like a history lesson, Selma's authenticity and timeliness make for a rousing spectacle that feels present and not unreachably epic. The director puts you wholly in the moment, never letting style (and the film boasts a good deal) get in the way of passing down an imperative piece of our country's narrative. Even with so much attention to period detail and historic figures, Selma speaks so truthfully in the present tense not just because current events eerily reflect the story to a startling degree but because the characters come alive to such a degree that you feel like you know them. These are characters, mind you, that have been blown up to mythic degrees on everything from inspirational posters to coffee mugs. Plus, screenwriter Paul Webb's multidimensional characterization of all involved articulates the still-ongoing struggle for equality. Ava DuVernay's PG-13-rated drama chronicles Martin Luther King's (Oyelowo) campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965. As realized by David Oyelowo in a brilliantly layered performance wrongly denied an Oscar nomination, Martin Luther King has never been represented on screen so letter perfectly. In fact, everybody from Carmen Ejogo, who looks like news footage of Coretta Scott King come to life to Tim Roth's on-the-racist-nose portrayal of George Wallace rings completely true...except for Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon Johnson. Why DuVernay would go to extreme lengths to flawlessly present the events leading up to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and NOT have the actor nail down LBJ's distinctive Texas drawl is beyond comprehension. Still, this mostly British contingent (Oyelowo, Roth, and Wilkson hail from the UK) gets it damn right. Just like with the production team behind 12 Years a Slave (also mostly British), sometimes it takes an outsider to hold up a proper mirror to our society. Regardless, you don't have to be American for this tale to resonate and echo in your heart and mind...and it does.Bottom line: Civil Righteousness",

    "review": "  (90%)Owing to the fact that this is above all else a historically important piece of film-making resulting in a very difficult review to write because there's no real angle anywhere for criticism. Couple that with David Oyelowo's faultless leading performance; likewise the support, writing, insight, relevance, power, depth and super tight direction, leaving next to nothing to take issue with. From the off this is one of those super substantial films that everyone should go and see regardless of race or nationality, because it's a film about fighting for what's rightfully yours in a completely peaceful, non-violent manner. Having said all that this is essentially a political drama, so there's lots of discussions, planning, and things of that nature, which won't be for everyone; but as far as recreating this particular important part in world history, then this is pretty much without fault.",

    "review": "  \"Glory, glory, glory!\".Over the past couple of years or so there's been a seemingly boom in film about the struggles of 'African Americans'. Delivering films like the great 'The Butler' and the masterpiece '12 Years a Slave'. It seems odd that they all come at the same time but, hey, when most if not all are great who's complaining?. And indeed for someone like me who has little knowledge of these situations and can't really understand that this type of oppression exists - they're all vital to my learning.'Selma' chronicles 3 months of 'Martin Luther King Jr.' and his group pushing for voting rights and through the town of Selma, 1965. It's not so much about the man himself but rather the continuation of the civil rights movement that was passed - but this time it's not about the broad problem but more about voting specifically. It makes the story far more focused and thanks to the tight cast the characterisation is top notch. Naturally 'Dr.King' gets most of the screen-time and thanks to a fantastic performance from 'David Oyelowo' he's always a welcome presence. It's a simplistic short film with straight up camera movements and no stylish bullshit as it should be. The story, the movement and looks at the banding together of not just African Americans but White Americans is at the centre here - and it shines through. As far as accuracy goes the constant arguing about such things is of none interest me. The core thing here is, is it telling the spirit the message that the movement and 'Mr.King' were about? and the answer is yes, so some embellishment - be it Lyndon's arguments apparently being false doesn't matter so much.There's a look into the inner circle's view points on the issues, Dr.King's wife - everything gets the right amount of time - and packed with powerful scenes of brutality that also won't prevent those of younger age learning of the problem.'Selma' Is a nicely framed and simply shot film. it know what it wants to tell and it does it very well. Focusing on one particular part of the movement and 3 months of Dr.King's life as oppose to the whole of either or both. From his acceptance of the Nobel peace prize to the march to Washington D.C the intimate knowledge of the limited time helps us get to know the characters more. Even the lesser side characters have a voice in some capacity. And even though the rights of African Americans have been getting better the films knows that there is some way still to go.",

You are sort of expecting this inspiring and uplifting film that will have its emotional moments once King stands up and delivers his world famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech, but Ava DuVernay takes an entirely different approach. Instead of following a timeline and going through important dates in King's life she simply introduces us to an important and defining moment in his life. And by doing this DuVernay allows us to center on the person that King was, learning about his struggles, fears, and so on. King is portrayed in a different and more humane light and isn't simply a figure we idolize. It is something similar to what Spielberg did with Lincoln, but much more engaging this time. DuVernay is able to avoid falling into biopic genre conventions and centers the narrative on King's efforts to organize a march in Selma in order to secure equal voting rights for all. In the large context it might just have been a short period in his life, but by focusing on this specific and detailed event we are able to learn who King was and how he was able to face each obstacle. It also reminds us that organizing a march isn't as simple as one can imagine. In a general biopic about Martin Luther King this would simply take about five minutes, but here we get the specifics which at the same time allows us to learn the importance of what King was fighting for while we also get to finally see him portrayed with some depth. DuVernay was robbed by the Academy from a Best Director nod because she crafted a powerful film avoiding familiar clich�s and melodrama.Selma gets about everything right: the script by Paul Webb is solid and there are some fantastic dialogues and speeches throughout the film, the cinematography by Bradford Young is sharp, and the production design transports us to the 60's in a very authentic way. But the film wouldn't have worked without the right actor to play Martin Luther King. David Oyelowo delivers one of my favorite performances of the year as King. His transformation is impressive. Not for a second did I think that this was an actor playing the famous figure. Oyelowo is like a chameleon, able to transform from one movie to the next. This is a completely different person from the actor who played Yardley in The Paperboy. He portrayed King in a very different light from what we are used to seeing him. We've all seen and heard King deliver his speeches and Oyelowo personifies him in the same way with similar tones and pauses. But it is in the smaller moments where Oyelowo's subtle performance stands out as he shines a more humane light on King, reflecting some of his fears and doubts as he second guesses himself at times. There are quiet moments where he doesn't know what to say or how to react to situations. There is a scene where he has to comfort a family who has lost their son, and he seems to be lost for words. He also shares some great scenes with Carmen Ejogo who plays his wife, and Tom Wilkinson as President Johnson. The supporting performances are also strong as several popular and historical figures pop into the movie. Tim Roth delivers one of my favorite supporting performances as Gov. George Wallace, but many more stand out as well. Selma is a gripping film beautifully directed by DuVernay with a wonderful and memorable performance from Oyelowo.",

    "review": "  ExSELent: The Tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. Doesn't DissapointYoung Critic1/25/2015Biographic films are mostly unsuccessful. The majority of directors take a path that follows the person of subject from his or her childhood years up to his or her death. This approach is generally boring and makes the film seem long, to the point that you're praying he or she finally dies. And in the end that type of film accomplishes what a book does: state facts; it never fully lets you see the person of subject in a humane and intimate way. In 2012 Steven Spielberg took a different approach to the biographic film style with his film Lincoln. Spielberg focused on a key moment in the 16th President's life. In Selma, female director Ava DuVernay, takes that same approach, looking at Civil Rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s struggle to have president Lyndon B. Johnson pass the Voting Rights Act. Through it we see a celestial figure of American history opened up and analyzed in a warm and personal way. Selma is the story of how Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) strikes up a march for Voting Rights in the Alabamian city of Selma. King's objective is to have a Voting Rights Act passed in Congress that would protect colored voters in the South from being barred from voting booths. The problem is clearly explained in one shocking scene in which producer Oprah Winfrey cameos as a woman registering to vote. The man in the registering booth is very reluctant and proceeds to first obligating her to recite the preamble of the United States Constitution. The woman proceeds in doing so impeccably, but the man, infuriated, then asks how many county judges the state of Alabama has. She again answers correctly and the man proceeds in asking her to name them. The scene doesn't take up five minutes of the film, but it's power and portrayal of injustice perfectly highlights the problem and basis of Selma; a problem, which has not dissipated today. Selma begins as a political drama, similar to House of Cards, with King flying everywhere to negotiate and give speeches, in churches to the general public and with President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson). As the story progresses, we see the tone meld into a more violent drama. You can actually see (or rather hear) this change in the actors' voices. Yes, their tones switch from a Shakespearean clarity and formality at the beginning of the film to a more depressed mumbling. This oral phenomenon was a subtlety that was delightful to find. Actor David Oyelowo had previously appeared in extremely small roles in The Butler and Lincoln; in Selma he was, finally, able to show his amazing skills, being constantly in control of the scene. The Brit perfectly replicates King's unique voice and even his physical features were spookily similar. But Oyelowo's great accomplishment is in the way he humanized King, with extremely simple actions, like bending down and changing a trash bin's bag, or in staring into space at loss and confusion. However, not everything was perfect in the film. The greatest drawback is how long the film finally feels. Even though the film is only two hours, it feels much longer. There are various factors that contribute to this. One is the long pauses that the actors take between speaking their lines. While this helps the audience digest Paul Webb's well-written script, it makes the pace of the film seem dragging and eternal. Another factor that could have contributed to this lengthy feel is the amount prompting endings the film has. The film seems to be at its perfect resolution scene many times so that the tempting finales, end up being a little annoying. However, the drawback is not enough to debacle DuVernay's beautiful tribute to King. It was surprising at first to see that one of the greatest American figures didn't have his own movie yet. But this was because King's sons and daughters' legal battle over copyright. After directors like Steven Spielberg, Stephen Frears, Paul Haggis, Spike Lee, Lee Daniels, and Michael Mann were scared off, DuVernay willingly embarked on a fight for King's script rights. And, slyly, through the tweaking of King's speeches, switching out word, she was able to save herself paying for the rights of both King and his speeches. This would be a perfect place to say: behind every great man there is a strong woman.A",

    "review": "  History is a storytellers medium, burdened with so many perspectives as to make accuracy a fools errand. Dates and facts are undeniable but digging deeper so that we may learn lessons from our past to shape our future - that takes some doing. When the history in question is so unnervingly recent and uses an icon to centre it's story, comparisons abound with the stock footage that exists and the accounts of those who lived these events living still. Selma avoids the trap of the \"cradle-to-grave\" biopic genre and instead plays out as a piece of historical drama - focusing it's attention on one chapter in the life of the civil rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr. For the most part it is successful in it's aims to show the essence of the man and the movement. Indeed, the film's biggest strength, are the moments when David Oyelowo is permitted to channel the great Doctor's soaring oratory and command you to attention and action - a performance so magnetic it practically pulls you into the screen in these moments of rousing political heroism.However, to draw a comparison I look to Spielberg's take on Lincoln. Here too is a film that offers up the story of a near-mythological figure through a microcosm. Anchored by a stellar central performance but failing to maintain interest consistently. There are lots of flat conversations in dusty rooms populated by dusty men. Selma does have the booming preachers voice that would drown out the folksy yarns of Mr Lincoln, so for that we can be grateful, but there are several scenes here which slow down proceedings somewhat.That being said, the scenes of non-violent protest meeting violent subjugation are handled extremely well and it would take a stone heart not to be incensed or distressed in equal measure. The supporting cast too offer up a real weight to an important story.Make no mistake though, this film lives and dies with Oyelowo's Dr King - a flawed but fearless giant of a man explored here with care and craft. And, digging just deep enough to beg the question \"why haven't we come further?\"",

    "review": "  This was a reasonably good film, well acted, with a good story, albeit the pace dragged at times. Worth seeing for sure, but not at that level where I'd consider getting a DVD of it (4 stars) or giving it an Oscar (5 stars).As always, whenever I review any film, I strip out all the silly modern-day politics and politically correct reviews bruited about journalists of all parties and instead focus on what really counts (at least, in my own humble opinion): the story, the actors, the film and whether it really moved me emotionally and left me thinking.The film revolves around the build up to a seminal moment in the Civil Rights movement: the Selma march. There are some very dramatic, very powerful scenes - the church bombing, police brutality in the street, on the bridge and in a restaurant that capture the mood and sets some of the tone. But interestingly, rather than a lot of action, spends a lot of time in the back rooms where we see another side of King: which you could call a \"warts and all\" picture. King as the womaniser; as a man who is at times uncertain, while at others, is a shrewd, media-savvy politician; a man who has doubts and has to wrestle with his own conscience; and above all a man who has to struggle to keep a consensus going among divided factions, but does so through the force of his own personality. Now, for me, this could have worked very well as a dynamic, making the film more poignant, gripping and historically interesting but it didn't. Why? Because we got no context. If we'd seen things to put that back stage action in context - in terms of both Civil rights and also King himself. Perhaps some archive footage of civil rights 'action' riots, lynchings, King giving electrifying speeches etc. - it could have really transformed it and made it as tense as the action sequences were. (If you want to see an example of how well that can work, watch Oliver Stone's \"Nixon\"). But unfortunately, we didn't get any of that. Instead we get a lot of \"talking heads\" involving conversations that didn't really go anywhere. Result: a mental sigh as the pace sank and at times stalled altogether. It was really a pity. Because this film and story had the capability to go much further than it did. The film is worth a view, but as a screenplay, it's not an Oscar winner for me I'm afraid.",

The film just sort of meanders to King's inevitable victory. Its depiction of LBJ is wildly inaccurate; its depiction of George Wallace fails to show why he opposed desegregation (it was a way to get votes). So he becomes simply a fool and a boogeyman, which dilutes his true evil. Not a terrible film, but many critics think they have to praise it or else look \"racist\" even if everything tells them this is a rather unremarkable movie.",

Great cinematography from Bradford Young enhances the well written screenplay aided further by a good score. This is defintely a good film and an important one but I didn't find myself completely connecting with the film, it felt a bit too clinical to me. Though I think it's great I wasn't blown away.",

It puts us in the moment, with all the insecurities. David Oyelowo manages a herculean feat in this portrayal of a man who, to many of us, has become a legend. Selma is also artful, if less than subtle about reminding us of the issues of today, specifically regarding the Voting Rights Act. It would a shame to walk away, and think \"Well good, problem solved\"",

    "review": "  The word 'chronicle' in the IMDB description is apt for this overlong drama. While I learned a lot about the incidents surrounding the Selma campaign, it was a mostly dry telling of the story. It is as though we are somewhat distanced from the events with rare moments of emotional engagement. It doesn't seem \"raw\" enough or tense enough. Apparently the real people of Selma had to struggle with rain, mud and hardship during the marches. None of this is portrayed in the movie. The narrative unfolds chronologically and \"objectively\". Not enough is really explored about King's relationship with his wife, although there are tantalising hints. But it's all a bit too simple. David Oyelowo does an excellent job of reincarnating King with a few inspiring oratory moments - he is probably the best reason for seeing the movie. Overall, it's a pretty average retelling of a very significant story. The most disturbing thing is how recent this history is and how far there is to go in furthering the ideals King promoted.",

    "review": "  There are moments in \"Selma\" when I felt like I was watching Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (played brilliantly by David Oyelowo) himself speaking on screen. Moments that made me want to clap my hands and stand up and cheer in approval of what he was saying. Moments when I was having to hold tears back. And these moments have stayed with me a couple of days after watching the film. These moments prove how timeless the story and issues are that \"Selma\" presents to us and although it would be difficult not to get these across, \"Selma\" does so in a way unlike any other biopic. David Oyelowo, a British actor, is fantastic and it is an absolute scandal that he has not been nominated for the Best Actor Oscar this year. Perhaps the Academy is still tapping themselves on the back for giving \"12 Years a Slave\" the Best Picture Oscar last year. When Oyelowo is making those speeches that King made to the Selma black clergy it was like I was watching King in the flesh. Oyelowo looks and sounds like King, effortlessly capturing his manner, grace and style and arguably most importantly his faith. Oyelowo simply pioneers the film in regards to performances, obviously helped along by the fame of his real-life counterpart, the other actors and actresses in the film simply revolve around him. This is especially obvious in the scenes where we get to see King and his colleagues deciding how to proceed in Selma. These backstage scenes seem just like how they would have been, providing an interesting viewpoint considering there isn't a lot of material detailing what happened. In these scenes King's colleagues also shine through, Colman Domingo (playing Ralph Abernathy) and Wendell Pierce (playing the Rev. Hosea Williams) are both worth mentioning for their performances. These scenes though do not focus on King and thus do well to emphasise that he was both not alone nor was a God of sorts, but just simply a great man, making him even more relatable and deserved of my sympathy.Of course \"Selma\" is a true story and the film sticks to it throughout ultimately doing it a perfect kind of justice. The fact that the film chose Selma as what it was going to cover was a good choice. There was the \"battleground\" that King decided to use as a means by which to end the struggle blacks had experienced in regards to registering to vote. It's ultimately the moments which have been well documented that are where the film thrives, \"Bloody Sunday\" for example. But where the film begins to waver is in its half-hearted commitment towards King's personal life and I believe this comes from how we obviously know less about King's personal life then what we know about him as leader of the Civil Rights Movement. It's those scenes where we see King giving speeches or leading the marches through Selma which are the film's best, whereas the hypothesised conversations between King and his wife, and meetings between the C.I.A. director J. Edgar Hoover and President Lyndon B. Johnson really bring the film out of focus.\"Selma\" though is ultimately the best biopic I have ever seen. Although I've mentioned that King's personal life for me got in the way of the film, you have to see \"Selma\", not only because of how, as critic Richard Roeper put it, it's a film that provides a history lesson but certainly doesn't feel like a history lecture, but also because of how the film finally grants King the cinematic justice he deserves with a brilliant performance by Oyelowo.",

It's certainly not as good as it should be, as it deserves to be.It's refreshing for a biopic to be so focused on a particular chapter, rather than rushing through all the chapters of an historic figure's life. David Oyelowo is very good -- his omission from the list of Oscar nominations is simply wrong. He conveyed the entire spectrum of emotions, often with his face alone.However, \"Selma\" generates a surprisingly low emotional impact. It did not engage me the way it should have. There were moments -- too few and too obviously intended to shock the audience to attention -- but overall, i felt detached. The truth is that the first couple of times i saw the trailer on the big screen, i was moved -- literally shaking -- and there were tears. But the film fails to meet the expectations of the trailer ... and that is a shame.",

    "review": "  \"Selma\" is full of powerful imagery that we'd like to pretend never happened but have a responsibility to pass on from generation to generation. This film tackles this dark chapter in American history with tact and honesty. While it has been met with criticism for its inaccurate portrayal of Lyndon B. Johnson, director Ava DuVernay sends a powerful message of equality through this story. The single factor that makes this a great film is the acting of David Oyelowo. His portrayal of Martin Luther King, Jr. is magic. The tone of his voice is a bit higher than King's but the cadence of his speaking is so accurate that you would think that it was King himself. It is hard to believe that this actor naturally has a British accent. It is unfortunate that Oyelowo was majorly snubbed by the Academy and I am positive that he would've earned an Oscar nomination (and probably won) in a less competitive year. His speeches after the death of Jimmie Lee Jackson and at the end are absolutely chilling. The other notable performance comes from Tom Wilkinson, portraying the tough position of the president when he's caught in the middle of a very public debate. There are several other big names in the film but the sheer number of characters allows many of them to only appear for a scene and then disappear. I find the film's nomination for Best Picture to be appropriate, but I also understand why it wasn't nominated in any other major categories. Its script doesn't stand out as being anything too special and the other aspects of the film recreate 1964 Alabama without being flashy, but the true magic of \"Selma\" is Oyelowo's on-screen manifestation of Martin Luther King, Jr. It is as if King walked out of the history books and onto the screen to once again share his powerful message of equality.",

Too often, it pumps the brakes to fumble character moments or remind viewers of things they should already know from either history or the dialogue from two minutes ago. But when David Oyelowo's MLK goes up to the microphone, or whenever shit remotely approaches the fan, Selma lights up and becomes rather incredibly engrossing in ten minute spurts, with Ana DuVernay taking absolute control of your attention. It's a shame it can't keep it up for the whole running time, but admirably Selma doesn't bite off more than it should chew, restraining itself to one specific campaign rather than telling the story of MLK from birth to assassination (take notes, Imitation Game). Underneath the surface, it leaves serious room from analysis of MLK's tactics, portraying him as just but also media-saavy and not averse to letting his supporters be used as pawns in a larger, more dangerous game. Selma is far from perfect and incredibly flawed as a film, but as a movie, its moments add up to more than its doldrums.Also, \"Are you trying to shit me George Wallace?\" should immediately become part of the cultural vernacular.",

Oleyowo was certainly robbed of a Best Actor nod as he embodies King's compassion, heroism, and flaws. His rousing speeches, with pitch-perfect delivery, could compel even the most hard-hearted out of his/her chair, and one scene in particular, where King visits the father of a slain protester, is so well-written and well-played, that despite its subdued tenor, still manages to be deeply haunting. DeVernay often frames her actors in the smallest corner of her shots, and while I didn't understand the reason for these choices, I found myself liking her choices.Overall, this is an important film without \"insisting upon itself,\" truly moving and compelling filmmaking.",

I recommend everybody to see it since you dont usually see the victim's point of view of racism in a movie",

    "review": "  A Film that would make you think, wonder and research. A Stunning film that gives you the confidence to stand up for what you believe in, no matter how big the obstacle is or how impossible the task is. andMan, what a performance from David Oyelowo. An Oscar worthy performance if you ask me. Ava DuVernay probably should have gotten a nomination for her stunning directional work. Somehow last year's Best Song nominated \"Ordinary Love\", soundtrack for \"Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom\" has its very big similarities with this amazing song \"Glory\" by John Legend and Common. The main themes and issues tackled in the movies speak for itself. Certainly the favorite for the Oscars also.A cinematic masterpiece, this feature may be small in scope but it's momentous in its ability to capture how complex and powerful the civil rights movement was. - John Hanlon",

He and it really are the main focus of this movie, and viewed from their lens it is a fascinating story, and one which is also very well acted (once again, with the exception of LBJ).It's hard to understand why the film's creators were not more careful about the role of LBJ in these events, and their carelessness about that is a shortcoming in this film. But, even with that, it is a powerful and worthwhile retelling of one of the more important bits of American history in recent decades. Very much worth seeing.",

    "review": "  Is a movie great just because the subject matter is important for all of us to see? To me not necessarily, and case in point the movie Selma. There are parts of this movie that are top notch. First off the acting is very good. David Oyelowo nails his performance of Dr. Martin Luther King, and much of the supporting cast is very good. I think Tom Wilkinson is at his best at President Johnson. So why only 3 stars you ask? The movie at times seem like they are stringing together many of King's top speeches, and his entire message and body of work into a small period of his life. While this movie is about his time in Selma, and planning the march from Selma to Montgomery, it feels like the filmmakers are trying to cram in as much history behind his entire civil rights movement as they can. I liked this movie, didn't love it. Oyelowo very well might when the Oscar for Best Actor as his work is excellent here. I just wish the writing and story movement were as excellent as his acting. It is a movie I believe we can all learn from and see.",

    "review": "  David Oyelowo delivers a spellbinding performance as Martin Luther King Jr. in \"Selma\", an inspiring, powerful and deeply moving film which shines light on a fascinating historical figure. It is an incredibly difficult and daunting task for an actor to bring to life a historical figure who has changed the world. Capturing the way they look, talk and behave- both in public and private- is a backbreaking task for an actor to pull off. When that person is Martin Luther King Jr., arguably one of the most important leaders to ever walk the planet, it's tough. Yet, David Oleyowo, in the performance of a lifetime, has set an example for actors of his generation. From the spot-on Southern accent to the enthusiastic way of delivering a speech, he disappears into the role to the extent that you begin to believe that you're watching Martin Luther King Jr. himself. However, although the center of attention in this drama, he is not the only actor deserving praise. Whether it the emotionally resonant Carmen Ejogo or a perfectly cast Tom Wilkinson, every actor leaves a lasting impression with the viewer. Director Ava DuVernay also deserves recognition for her splendid work behind camera and for having the courage to take on such a larger-than-life time in History. Particularly enthralling are Dr. King's speeches, which are both incredibly inspiring and motivational. Despite Oyelowo's towering transformation, however, the film is not without it's problems. At a running time of over 2 hours, it is not the most well-paced film. Personally, I found myself engaged when the African-Americans were fighting for their rights but not nearly as interested in the presidential politics. Also, despite the power of the performances, Oprah Winfrey is surprisingly wasted. Given her knack for tackling complex roles, she could have been given more to do in this film. In the bigger picture, however, these are minor complaints against a film that is definitely worth watching. Timely for the world we live in today, \"Selma\" delivers an inspiring message of hope and fighting for what you believe in. Although disturbing to watch at times, it's an important film that demands to be seen for David Oyelowo's breathtaking performance alone.",

    "review": "  Let's start with the positives. I had heard from a local rag newspaper (The Boise Weekly) that Oyelowo's performance didn't match the vocal tone and pitch of MLK. Not sure what that means or how someone born after his death would gauge that but it isn't true. Oyelowo does not give a Best Actor performance but he delivers better then anyone else in Hollywood currently. I loved the speeches and I really can't think of anyone else who had both the look and attitude to pull of this role. The emotion of the movie is powerful. Selma really captures the horribly racist attitude of Alabama and the tangible ways in which that was expressed. I liked the supporting cast as well, with the exception of LBJ, who I will get to in a moment. Pretty good soundtrack, although I could imagine a more moving score. On the African-American side, relatively accurate portrayal historically as well. There was a nod to the affair rumors that surrounded King but the movie didn't make the mistake of giving rumors to much screentime or importance. But Selma is far from perfect and in fact, really takes a dive in the face of historical scrutiny. I am quite familiar with the LBJ presidency and Johnson's attitude towards the events of his time. Although his personal feelings may never be known, Johnson's public persona was strongly in support of King's movement, with the president going so far as to publicly bully Congress in order to see results. Portraying Johnson as a weak, indecisive and paranoid leader who stood in the grey in regards to racism is a leap that takes this movie from history to fiction. It would have been completely acceptable to portray Johnson as having to wrestle with some of these actions but the creators of Selma take one of the icons of the Democrat Party, African-Americans and the Civil Rights Movement and turn him into a weakling. To top it off, the movie blatantly ignores the fact that Johnson had the final march escorted by 2,000 soldiers, a move that stands as one of the most blatant government acts against racism since the Civil War. I would really like to say that the movie moves past this mistake, but it doesn't. Unlike other historical blunder movies (Fury being my top choice), Selma simply cannot overcome the weight of its mistakes. And the biggest question in my mind is the why. Johnson was never on the fence. He never did anything publicly to earn the ire of liberals, especially not with the 20/20 vision we have today. To attack him, of all people (Governor Wallace, the KKK and the town leaders are all people who could have been successfully deconstructed without an issue) seems counterproductive, especially in the current context and I think that this is a good indication of DuVernay's future as a director. On top of all of this, the LBJ character wasn't even a great choice and the final scenes of the movie seem to be an about face, as LBJ does what he did historically, in direct opposition to what an hour and half of film just told us. In truth, I think that movies like 12 Years A Slave and even Django Unchained do a better job of pushing for modern day civil rights reform. Selma was a mistake and is a failure to honor all of the dimensions of the story of that march.",

    "review": "  Martin Luther King, Jr.: \"When will we be free? Soon and very soon. Because you shall reap what you saw. When will we be free? Soon\".Selma tells the story of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led a dangerous campaign to secure equal voting rights in the face of violent opposition. The epic march from Selma to Montgomery culminated in President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the most significant victories for the civil rights movement. Director Ava DuVernays SELMA tells the real story of how the revered leader and visionary Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) and his brothers and sisters in the movement prompted change that forever altered history.Poor Selma, being shut out from the Oscars and BAFTA awards for acting and directing (Which deserves some nominations for god sake) but to be honest I thought this was going to be a Oscar bait film, you know like The Butler or Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, because I had no idea that this movie existed until award season stared and that's when I had that thought of Oscar bait, but after seeing the film myself I can say no it's not a Oscar bait film. It's actually a pretty good movie.What really surprise me is how much films David Oyelowo has been in 2014, I didn't take much notice but now I have and I was extremely shocked how he got overlooked by the Academy and the BAFTA, because his performance in this movie is by the best I've seen this year. I didn't just see David Oyelowo being Oyelowo, no I only saw Martin Luther King and nothing else. I can see that David Oyelowo had strong passion for this role that he put everything in it and he absolutely nailed it. David you may not got a Oscar nomination for you outstanding performance but you won everyone over with your acting and you got a bright future a head of you buddy. Great work David.Ava DuVernay who to me is a unknown directed. I haven't seen the other work that she did so I can't really say, but after watching Selma I know straight away that we got a good one here, because she directed this movie with has much care as possible and effort to show how bad it was back then and she did it so well her that getting snubbed at the Oscars for directing is crime in my eyes.The one thing that makes Selma a truly great movie is the fact that the movie isn't all inspiring or beautifully touching like most Holly Wood cliche Oscar bait movies, no the director smartly takes a different turn for the best and just show what really happened and try not to make it all inspiring and make Martian look like a god like person and all that other stuff that's been done to death now. Selma steps away from that and shows the mistakes that this guy did because let's not forget that Martian Luther Kings was only human, just a guy who's not perfect of what he did and I hate it when Holly Wood takes a real life person and make him perfect and a god to everybody's eyes and when you look up the person in real life you start to see these other stories where he made mistakes then and there and you find out that the movie isn't being truthfully to the real life person, but in this movie Selma takes that cliche and say \"Sorry but that dose not happen. Go away Holly Wood\". Now for problems: Martin Luther Kings was the only interesting and the one person I cared about in this movie, but the other character's I didn't really give a fuss about them. I know I should but really I don't, I don't even remember they names at all. You may find them interesting but I didn't.Selma overall isn't just a Oscar bait or too HollyWood movie. The movie has outstanding performances from David Oyelowo, great directing from Ava DuVernay and a movie that I hope get's viewers attention in the late future.",

Selma brings to life this amazing man who rallied a nation to face the injustices of Southern voting policies and racial segregation. I applaud the movie producers and writers from not avoiding the human elements of Mr. King's character. Yes, Mr. King strayed from his marriage but that did not take away from his role in the Civil Right's Movement. I found it interesting that our government would sink so low as to try to thwart the Civil RIghts Movement by threatening his public image. Go see Selma you will be glad that you did.",

We think we've come a long way as a nation but after the unrest from last year it seems we still have a long way to go. I don't understand why David Oyelowo was not nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Dr. Martin Luther King but I guess it doesn't really matter anyways. This is one of my favorite movies of 2014 and I hope a lot more people will see it.",

    "review": "  A superb, emotionally exhausting film that effectively portrays the black civil right movement by focusing on the events that occurred within Selma, Alabama. David Oyelowo is Martin Luther King Jr. and is complete perfection. In the film, MLK is not a super-being but is portrayed as a man with some flaws who struggles to balance his family life with his role as a leader. Despite his human weaknesses he is still able to overcome them and emerge as a hero. The film has plenty of hard-hitting moments, and it really puts you through the wringer. The film also has great supporting performances by Tim Roth as Gov. George Wallace, Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King (what a strong, inspiring character. Crazy to think she was last seen in The Purge Anarchy as the mother), Oprah Winfrey as Annie Lee Cooper, Tom Wilkonson as President Lyndon B. Johnson (who is not portrayed here as a bad guy but as a coward who chooses to remain neutral in the conflict and in doing so causes more harm), Giovanni Ribisi as Lee White, Dylan Baker as J. Edgar Hoover, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Fred Gray, and Martin Sheen as Frank Minis Johnson. This is a heartbreaking, and angering film. It's hard to believe we ever lived in a time where these kinds of terrible things happened and were allowed and even encouraged. It's a stark reminder of some of the USA's dark history, and that even though we have come so far the battle is still not over. An absolute must-see and not only one of the best films of 2014, it's also one of the most important.",

This is the type that was made for history classes in school and not something to be marveled as a masterpiece of film itself as most critics would say.

It can be a difficult task analyzing a film you so passionately agree with, but in Selma's overwhelming flood of acclaim, I can't help but feel an honest examination of its imperfections has been lost in the shuffle. David Oyelowo's spirited performance commands respect, admiration, and enthusiastic praise, but the film stumbles elsewhere in its otherwise unremarkable characterizations. In examining merely one event, director Ava Duvernay occasionally stumbles into over-simplicity, providing a single full-bodied persona surrounded by a host of half-measures. Most disappointing is the general scarcity of Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, whose talents are criminally underused and had me craving for more. Tom Wilkinson gives a fine performance as Lyndon B. Johnson, but one can hardly call it penetrating. Tim Roth as the racist Governor George Wallace doesn't fare as well with his cartoonish drawl and one-note evilness. These are small detractors ultimately, ignored though they be. However, while not perfect, Selma is still an important enough film to recommend on a wide scale. It is a film with the power to unite, and conjure up the better aspects of our human nature. It's a healthy film, and essential.",

    "review": "  With this movie, director Ava DuVernay crafts a remarkable feat of telling the story of the protest marches in Selma, Al in 1965 that resulted in the historic Voting Rights Act from as many points of view as possible while keeping the issues that are still relevant front and center through some electric debate scenes. At the focus of the action is Dr. Martin Luther King(David Oyelowo, who is superb). But this not St. Martin we are talking about here. Rather, what we get is a rather human interpretation, with King having serious doubts and haunted by thoughts of mortality. So, it is no wonder that at the moment of his greatest triumph, namely about to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, he confides to his wife Coretta(Carmen Ejogo) about the possibility to start over at a country parish. But even then, he still goes on to serve as an inspiration to so many, with the film also recognizing the acts of everyday courage and heroism that took to make the marches possible.Where \"Selma\" falters is in the White House scenes and not in the way you may have been led to believe. Aside from the specifics, on the one hand, you can see the beginning of the rift between King and President Johnson(Tom Wilkinson) that would widen as Vietnam would consume Johnson's presidency and which war King would oppose vociferously. At the same time, these scenes are undermined by a woefully miscast Wilkinson who can never quite get the right Texan intonation. And the referred to, but never seen White House demonstrations, only serve to have the movie's modest budget serve as a distraction.",

    "review": "  I've been putting off seeing Selma until today, for obvious reasons. On the day we celebrate the man himself, it only seemed right see his life celebrated on film. Selma finally brings Martin Luther King to the screen. A proper look at the life of one of America's greatest heroes was long overdo. Making a movie is relatively easy, making a good one is much harder. But Selma, most certainly, is a good one.There has been much controversy of late about the film's lack of recognition at the Academy Awards. Most egregiously, David Oyelowo's stirring performance as King was overlooked. I'll be the first to agree that 2014 has had more than enough unbelievable performances, but is Oyelowo's one of the five best of the year? Absolutely. It is one of the most grounded, impassioned, and impactful performances 2014 has to offer. The film's greatest challenge is portraying MLK correctly, and portraying him well. I am more than happy to say that David Oyelowo succeeds at every facet of this performance. It is obvious that the portrayal, much like the man, is anchored in a very quiet, spiritual strength. Oyelowo is on record as saying, \"I always knew that in order to play Dr. King, I had to have God flow through me because when you see Dr. King giving those speeches, you see that he is moving in His anointing.\" The actor is a powerhouse, proudly marching in Martin Luther King's shoes.The second most prominent rebuff this film received at the Oscars is for its director, Ava DuVernay. I can understand the outcry. The Academy has never been kind to female directors, and nominating an African American female director would be a first. But at the same time, I do not feel like DuVernay's work is Oscar worthy. There are some noticeable filmmaking slip-ups (ignoring the 180-degree rule entirely during the jail-house talk, for example) that do detract from the overall experience. Don't misunderstand, this is an impressive film. But on the waiting list of directors who deserved to be nominated for an Oscar this year, DuVernay is definitely behind Dan Gilroy, Christopher Nolan, and Damien Chazelle.Selma absolutely excels when the main performances are allowed to shine. There are a myriad of talented actors represented in this movie, though many of the supporting characters fail to differentiate themselves from each other, to the movie's detriment.The film has a vast amount of painful, dramatic power. There are multiple scenes that are truly difficult to watch. The filmmakers nail the sense of injustice that is pointed against the peaceful protestors of Selma. The movie also doesn't alienate its white audience (myself among them) by painting with too broad a brush. There can't help but be a sense of accomplishment when protestors of both races join in the march toward freedom.Selma does an awful lot right. The performances are praiseworthy no matter where you look, the story is easily one that needed to be told, and the script provides for a powerful look at a man who deserves to be celebrated. The film won't find its way into my top 10 favorites of 2014, it may slip into historical biopic trappings every now and again, the musical score is unfortunately nondescript, and some of the technical aspects of the movie seemed a bit off at times; but the story and messages on display in Selma are more than worthy of all the recognition they continue to receive. The film does not simply demand our respect, it genuinely earns it.\"We build the path as we can, rock by rock.\" 7.5/10",

    "review": "  In the wake of a certain series of current events that have brought back racial barriers in America, this film couldn't have come at a better time to throw out some good perspective while honoring the late great Martin Luther King Jr during his annual time of recognition. \"Selma\" plays reference to Selma, Alabama, which was the starting point to an extremely important chapter of the 60s American Civil Rights movement where African Americans peacefully protested for their ability to vote by attempting to march from the small town all the way to the state capital of Montgomery. Dr. King's direct involvement in this war of political and human rights was heralded due to his dedicated ability to stand against what seemed at the time an impossible force. Angry mobs, brutal police retaliation, corrupt officials, J. Edgar Hoover and his goons, even President Eisenhower, each presented a severe form of resistance in this march. Against so many odds, Dr. King and the countless persecuted people he voiced for, took blow after blow and kept on marching until they finally broke through to make another change in racial injustice forever.  The point of the march with the rising publicity of the act during it's time, was directed at raising general awareness and to better expose the dirty secret the powers that be were so poorly keeping under wraps. Half a century later, this behind the scenes expose' further enlightens us as to how much more dire the situation was than even when general media was alluding to. On both sides of the line, we witness a passionate and unwavering group led by Dr. King with all the resolve they could muster, just as we get a play by play of every grueling obstacle that was thrown at them by their white oppressors. Last year's Oscar winner \"12 Years A Slave\" was a soul crushing roller coaster that really played up the monstrous side of racism during its prime time of America's upbringing. While not as graphic, \"Selma\" plays to a similar emotional cord and bears importance because unlike \"Slave\", these events took place during our current life time. It really goes to show how topsy turvy we were as a culture not so long ago, and how truly far we have come in breaking the ultimate barriers. The film as a whole is a wonderful piece of insight that is laid out to glorify the event as SO much more than a march. Up and coming actor David Oyelowo (Interstellar) had some massive resolve of his own in being responsible for portraying the historic figure of Dr. King, and was remarkable in showcasing his powerhouse side just as much he really brought a little seen perspective of Martin, the humble and humane family man. Helped along by his surprisingly British supporting cast, the lot of them bring to life a series of true characters and tell a supremely emotional tale that deserves remembrance. Kudos on a very well done biopic, and happy Martin Luther King Jr day. . .GRADE: A",

    "review": "  SELMA is a movie about process, about the gruntwork and strategy and planning and procedure of staging a civil rights campaign, about how change is enacted through through careful swaying of public opinion and deliberate framing of a compelling narrative on TV screens and in newspapers around the country. In a similar way to Spielberg-Kushner's LINCOLN, it's thrilling to see a movie that gets at the practical political mechanics behind an easily romanticized revolution. But, for a movie about strategy and power dynamics to work, it needs, more than anything, the couple of things that hurts SELMA above all.The first of those is subtext. This is a movie almost entirely made up of people standing in rooms explaining what they are going to do. It's historical drama Christopher Nolan-style. It's a problem in the writing and it's a problem in the direction--nowhere is there an inventive variation on the dramatic dynamic to make things interesting. Contrast this with a film like LINCOLN, which is all about how people lie and cheat and make deals and barter and trade and wheel and deal. These are obviously two very different films about two very different sets of characters in two very different sets of circumstances, but it's that lack of subtext, that lack of dramatic layering that keeps the whole thing playing on one level. And, seemingly opposed to this, but actually tied directly to it is the second point...A driving sense of clarity. Clarity in the drama. Clarity in the objectives (both macro and micro) and in the tactics. In the obstacles. In the sense of cause and effect. In each character's particular motivations and where and why and how they clash in any given moment. Clarity in the timeline. Clarity in even something as basic and seemingly irrelevant as screen geography (I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie that crosses the line so frequently or so carelessly, and the lack of establishing shots in almost any scene only adds to the confusion--especially when much of the film plays out in a series of pretty nondescript rooms and curiously-framed, and coldly desaturated medium close-ups). When SELMA has this clarity, it is exciting and engaging--some of the conversations between Dr. King and President Johnson are among the highlights of the film precisely because the negotiation is so thoroughly grounded in such clearly articulated stakes (probably not coincidentally, this subplot is drawing some heat for taking some dramatic license with the events). The finale, aided by some actual documentary footage, is rousing and moving in the way it should be. But there are long stretches that do little to advance the story in actual story terms, content instead to reiterate the same dramatic beats without providing any further context or elaboration. The movie's ambitions are admirable, but it's never as smart as its subject matter, and the result is some often deflated drama. Still, this story is important, and continues to be discouragingly relevant in all kinds of ways. It's a story we need to hear, but I wish it was better told.",

    "review": "  A riveting, sometimes shocking biopic that takes us into the daily lives of Martin Luther King and his followers, and gets to the roots of the protests in Selma, creating a sense of community and solidarity. Accuracy aside, it's a great work of art, if a little dry and unfocused in places. The performances are excellent - weird though (not wrong or bad) that King, Johnson, and Wallace are all portrayed by non-American actors. From a technical and artistic perspective it's not one of the more atmospheric or creative of 2014's movies, but it is powerful, enthralling, and often surprising, including 2 or 3 of the year's most shocking and effecting scenes (the explosion, the police brutality, and King's speech at the end stand out to me). On paper it might be calling out for awards, but in execution it's the least Oscar-baity of the nominated biopics, focusing more on characterization and on a concise plot than on King's entire life. The film makes it clear to us that it's so much bigger than King, allowing him to be central to its plot without raising him to the level of a god or showing us that he was in any way more important than his movement. Though I don't think it will go down as a great work of art or an accurate portrayal of history (films based on other material, in my opinion, don't need to be accurate to be good) I think it's a film we should celebrate as great in-the-moment cinematic storytelling, resonant with a struggle that still continues to this day.",

Ava DuVernay tells a memerizing story and David Oyelowo gives a dramatic portrayal as Martin Luther King, Jr. History books can make monumental events seem so impersonal, so I appreciate films like these that show how much had to be overcome to get to where we are today. The movie has several uncomfortable but powerful moments, and in some ways, it also reminds me that while our society has progressed a lot since then, we still have a long way to go.",

I believed his performance in telling this story, but MLK had one of the most distinctive voices you can have. It does't take away from the film, but it seems pretty obvious that nailing MLK's vocal cadence would have sealed the Best Actor nod. Anyway fat ignorant white people in power still suck. Sad how little has changed.",

Granted, this is a movie that should have been made long ago, and coincided perfectly with the turmoil created by the police shootings; I was not impressed. The first half of the movie discussed the politics and legal wrangling involved in the march. I felt that Martin and Coretta's characters were underdeveloped, and needed more fleshing out. How did Martin's absence affect the children? Why did Coretta put up with the cheating? Okay, but not worth buzz.",

    "review": "  Captivating true story overdue to be told on screen, held together by a spot on performance by David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King Jr. The story's content is monumental and inescapably informative. Oyelowo has King pegged on every gesture, voice tone, and mannerism. He even captures King's astonishing speech delivery. We see MLK as a human being who is vulnerable, asking himself questions: Is this the best way? Is this the right place and right time? He weighs the options of putting people in harm's way vs achieving the objective. He's not an unstoppable superhero activist who has a clear path and a surefire plan. He's a conflicted man who is figuring out the best way to proceed as he goes along. The brutal violence against peaceful demonstrators is light on gory detail but puts a spotlight on the brutality, which is shockingly hateful. Police on horseback armed with clubs and tear gas charge into a crowd of defenseless marchers. Aged men and women are struck repeatedly in the head with police clubs, even when lying still on the ground. A young man goes to shield his grandfather from being beaten by police, and for this he is thrown against the wall and shot in front of his mother. The three officers depart as the mother cries out. This was only 50 years ago in this very country. You don't forget this is a true story. Use of actual footage from these very events and the scenes introduced by actual FBI logs of King's activities appearing to the sound of a typewriter keep everything grounded in reality. A couple stylistic changes might have made the film stronger. I wish the extended scenes of quiet discussions did not so frequently interrupt the suspenseful urgency of planning and carrying out the protests. While perhaps serving as an oasis for some, I felt it anticlimactic. Dr King's internal struggles could have been developed in more punctuated scenes. Nevertheless, this is a powerful film that perhaps all Americans should see.",

    "review": "  A story of conviction that fuels the fire of justice and righteousness -- Selma soars high above the rest. The film excels on multiple fronts in the name of justice, whether it be social, political, or otherwise. The message is clear, concise, and divulged to the audience through raw emotion and passion.The leader of that emotion and passion comes from the highly spirited performance from David Oyelowo as Dr. King. Oyelowo brings King to life and does a fantastic job of showing the layers of the person beyond the struggle during the Civil Rights Movement. The personal and social dilemmas are vital to the story of who King was an not only an activist, but as a man, and that is brought to the forefront by Oyelowo.The film produced some wonderful cinematography... Different shots of the various marches or the manner in which the violence was captured, for example, transform this into a piece of art. With that said, I did find the film to be slightly longer than I felt necessary. It seemed like Selma could have been even more powerful if it left a few scenes on the chopping room floor to shorten the length just slightly. The musical and sound arrangements were well produced and organized, and it is fair to say that Selma is well deserving of every award or nomination it may get. There is a bit of a fury regarding the lack of nominations, but there is no need to get into an uproar... Good things happen to those who exhibit patience and peacefully revolt against what they believe to be unjust.",

For starters, very few of the characters were formally introduced, so their story or names for that matter weren't well known until the end of the movie when they flashed their names with a bio. Also, the police report-style text that came after some scenes really didn't seem to have much of a purpose or fit in with what was going on in the movie, and it wasn't ever explained why it was shown. Besides that, the movie was very slow-moving with a lot of awkward silence that just added to its longevity. Overall, Selma just didn't do justice to its important subject matter and it felt unfinished. It just needed a little more clarity and cohesion to be a good movie.",

Now I will try to be civil as much as possible, but I liked this movie better when it was called \"Lincoln\". I am kidding! Please don't start the protest. All kidding aside, \"Selma\" is an important piece of filmmaking that chronicles Dr. Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965. Like \"Lincoln\", \"Selma\" is the kind of movie that should be shown to every high school student in their American History class. Director Ava DuVernay might just be marching on to more directorial gigs with her accurate orchestration of the picture. Paul Webb's screenplay of \"Selma\" marched on to the applicable verbal beat of the story it was telling. Oye esto, David Oyelowo was majorly snubbed of a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his triumphant performance as Dr. King. I don't want to get too political but Tom Wilkinson and Tim Roth pitched in with solid supporting performances, respectively as President Lyndon B. Johnson and Governor George Wallace. Now, \"Selma\" is not a \"I have a dream of a perfect movie\" type of film, but I still think you should march on to it. **** Good",

David Oyelowo is almost Shakespearean in his delivery of King's various speeches and eulogies and in his quiet moments of despair, including a late night call to the singer Mahalia Jackson in an effort to fortify himself. This is powerful, powerful stuff and in light of what's been happening in the U.S. the past few years, not just in Ferguson and with the NYPD, but in the shameful treatment of the President and the continuing effort to discourage voting in the South, this movie might capture the zeitgeist better than any made before it. I always remember hearing about German citizens being marched by American soldiers through the now-emptied concentration camps that were near enough to their towns and villages to be smelled and occasionally dusted with the soot of burned remains. They were forced to witness what was done in their name. I still believe the American public needs that moment, as a people they have still never come to grips with their original sin. Great films like \"12 Years A Slave\" and now \"Selma\" will hopefully hold up that mirror and even if the people only see their reflection in a corner, at least its a start.

But, it did and our world is a better place for the efforts of Dr. King and the civil rights movement. LBJ is depicted as unsupportive, but he was, in fact, very pro civil rights. But, that's Hollywood, isn't it? Definitely worth seeing...",

(wow, no pun intended). I liked what it had to say but it seems, if 12 Years A Slave hadn't come out last year, maybe this movie would be making more of a buzz. I still stand by my statement that Django was the period at the end of the sentence on movies about racism. Anyway, it's a darn shame that the academy has almost no love for this movie. I think one of my friends said it best: \"Didn't the academy prove that it wasn't racist last year?\" Too bad. This movie is very good. But no one cares.",

    "review": "  Selma is a triumph of a film worthy of representing one of the most influential moments in American history. DuVernay depicts Martin Luther King, not as the immovable giant we are accustomed to but rather the man who will eventually blossom into that figure. The journey taken by DuVernay is that of portraying King as a man with the weight of a Nobel Peace Prize around his neck. The film equally uncovers the emotions of the people of Selma and ultimately those of the nation.  David Oyelowo plays the role of a lifetime in this portrayal of Kings pursuit of human dignity and unity. Although we are privy to brief glimpses of King preaching to the masses, the story focuses on the quiet struggles of leadership as well as his suffering for decisions made in life-or-death situations with little information. The powerful interactions between Oyelowo and Carmen Ejogo ignite the screen and allow for an intimate glimpse into the private life of the King family through all their hardships and uncertainties.  A beautifully written story with an incredible ensemble of supporting cast has created this definitive account of the events of Selma. This is a story not about the victories of the past or the fame of the man but rather the work ahead. This film not only paints a picture of the racial injustice of the sixties but forces one to look at the racial injustices becoming weekly occurrences during recent years and even months. The message of this film becomes clear that even with a 99% reaction from critics, an outstanding lead, and an incredible ensemble of support cast, this film was only nominated for two Oscars that do not focus on the cast itself, Best Picture and Original Song. The question King must grapple with is what is the body count in which King is obligated and burdened to sacrifice to progress the movement?",

Ava DuVernay weaves a very tense epic, demonstrating the viciousness of the violence against those fighting for civil rights, as well as the difficulty of managing a non-violent movement composed of so many different people. Alas, the movie would have been far better served with more historical accuracy. The changes served to detract from the incredible story, rather than enhance it. Unnecessarily making a villain of Lyndon B. Johnson didn't really serve the story any more than the truth. Heightening the tension between the SCLC and SNCC was also unnecessary and distracting. But don't let it's intentional ignorance of history prevent you from seeing it; there is still a lot to like here.",

The parts with Dr King and LBJ were well done, but maybe not so real. Tom Wilkenson was very good as LBJ. David Oyelowo was pretty good as Dr. King, although he wasn't nearly as inspirational a speaker as Dr. King. I'm not sure it was the movie, but I was tired and sleepy at some points of the movie. Overall, I liked the film. I doubt I would watch it again. I would recommend it to all children as semi educational, and something will make them understand more about how we got where we are.

We all know the story of Dr king but the movie shows that there's more to this story. What really brings Selma to greatness is its performances, for his breakout performance, David Oyelowo becomes Dr King, all the mannerisms, the voice, the actions down perfectly, but he also brings humanity to him showing that he's also just a man with his heart in the right. I'm shocked that he wasn't nominated for best actor. But I have to respond to the controversy with the scenes involving president Johnson, He's not portrayed as a bad guy, the give him reasons and it makes sense, the rest of the acting is fantastic. The direction is tight and shows huge amounts of details making this one of the most violent and raw pg-13 movies I've seen but, DuVernay was horribly snubbed for the best director nomination. The dialogue is fantastic as well, every character is given a strong amount of depth and humanity showing the reasons of why they act, it also shows the the historical events and facts in very smart ways. Unlike a lot of biopics, Selma never becomes preachy or cheesy, it shows the story the way it should, this is a movie that you must see, its both important and well made, it's one of 2014s best.",

    "review": "  This movie is called Selma, NOT \"The Martin Luther King Jr. Story\", for a reason. The intensity and significance of the Civil Rights movement is captured all through one seemingly small, but ultimately huge, demonstration. And while King's a more than prominent part of this story, and is even the de facto protagonist, Selma was a victory for more than one individual, and DuVernay and co. know that. With a beautiful lead performance by Oyelowo, this is stirring and engrossing dramatic filmmaking that humanizes history and an icon, embracing every part of the ugly truth.Selma doesn't rely on lazy-biopic gimmicks to catch us up to speed. The filmmakers rightly assume a basic knowledge of King and his impact. This gives the story room to breathe, letting the depth of details and emotions hold the screen over dry facts. We get to see the heartbreak of the injustice up-close, the politicking of all reigning parties (including a fascinating look at the White House), the fear and difficulty inherent in true non-violent protests, and the ultimate hope of goals reached. The script has a few dull moments that could've hit the editing room floor, and some of the casting could be seen as stereotypes, but there is intentionality to director DuVernay's subtly dusty yet intensely personal film.Really, it's hard not to feel personal about Selma, given the state of current racial unrest. We are far from past the teachings of Dr. King, but a devastating-yet-forward-looking film like this can help us learn to see the complexity inherit and necessity in justice. Selma isn't emotionally manipulative; it is emotionally necessary.",

    "review": "  An emotional juggernaut of a picture, Selma just happens to be another exceptional 2014 biopic, further proving to hopefully not only myself but many others that films of this genre are not just empty and sentimentally-devoid Oscar-bait pictures, but genuinely good motion pictures. Headed by one of the finest and moving performances of the past year, Selma tells the story of Martin Luther King Jr's struggle to gain voting rights for Alabama (and general American) Negroes with respect, heart and dignity, and never stumbles for too long, even in its least satisfying and compelling moments, those of which there are few. Director Ava Duvernay handles the delicacy of the topic at hand with ease, her graceful influence on the film paramount in both its most glorious and triumphant moments, as well as within scenes of intimacy which showcase the humanity inside a man revered by many. But it's ultimately the screenplay, penned by the exceptional Paul Webb, which allows Selma to enter and traverse numerous concepts and ideas, tones and moods, flowing through them oh-so effortlessly, without feeling structurally bound by convention or genericisms. The result of the picture is to an extent predictable (because it happened; duh), but it's the journey there that Webb expertly crafts, a journey that shan't be forgotten soon.Selma's heart comes in its depiction of Martin Luther King Jr, who is painted here not as a saint, but as a human man, capable of failure, deceit and misfortune. His path to success is riddled with desperation, despair, pain and blood, and whilst the outcome of the picture is radiant and triumphant, we, alongside our protagonist, can not help but reflect on the darkness faced all throughout. The great thing about Selma is that it often allows us moments of contemplatation, and allows us to think on what has been suffered. In a moment of monumental and ingenious filmmaking within a poignant scene, Duvernay holds the bravest and most powerful shot of the film. She doesn't allow the score to intervene, nor does she desire a close-up. This is in a scene of gloom, right after a brutal murder is depicted. A mother screams out in anguish as her beautiful and helpless son dies in her arms. Duvernay does not feel obligated to leech the emotion of the scene with unnecessary camera angles, cuts or music. She understands the primal sympathy that we all, universally, feel. So she allows the single shot to play out, and what we feel is pure and utter emotion. It was this shot and the scene which played out after such that brought me to tears.Cinematographer Bradford Young, who also simultaneously worked on A Most Violent Year, heads the photography department of the film, and his work is astounding. His framing is pitch-perfect (the vast majority of the time), his visceral foreshadowing of events or shots is applaudable, and he never bows to the cliches that many would expect of such a film as this in a visual context. No, Young does not consistently frame King at a low angle, accenting his prowess as a human being and activist. He does utilize a strange quantity of hand-held camera work that does seem unnecessary in a number of scenes, but isn't overtly distracting; at least not for the casual viewer, I would imagine. His pans also feel relatively unneeded; perhaps when King is delivering something important, so as to add a strain of visual dynamic to the scene, it is required. But often, this is not the case, and the pans feel a little too much. All that said, Young's work is absolutely stellar on the whole, and his work is some of the finest of 2014. He captures the size of the marches Martin King leads, the intimacy between King and his wife Coretta and the boldness of King's speeches. His versatility is applaudable, and his colour palette is appreciated (thank God the filters from The Theory of Everything weren't utilized here).There are moments of melodrama which feel oddly out of place in a film so concerned with the quiet nature of things. A scene towards the beginning of the running time that shows a black hate crime is not only completely out of place, edited in sloppily, but also ends with a generic dash of slow motion and jarring loudness. It's really quite terrible. Fortunately, the rest of the picture is mostly devoid of such moments, but even with their minimal quantity, their impact is still felt. Perhaps the biggest fault within the running time is the editing, done by Spencer Averick. His work for much of the film is acceptable, but there are moments where he not only sacrifices coherency in the visceral sense, but abruptly ends scenes that do not feel completed. A scene featuring King debating against the president at the time, Lyndon B. Johnson, is cut oddly short in what seems like the middle of a sentence, and it throws off the tightened speed of the picture. This happens numerous times throughout, and it is infuriating.Wow; I feel like I am absolutely shitting all over Selma. In all reality, I truly adored this film. It is an exceptional cinematic achievement that I was engrossed in all throughout its two hour length. This is namely due to the efforts of David Oyelowo as Martin King, whose performance is absolute perfection. He handles the speeches, personal conflictions and emotion of his character perfectly, and it's impossible to fault him in any way. The fact that he was denied a nomination from the Academy for Best Actor enrages me, as he wholeheartedly deserves to be nominated over Michael Keaten in Birdman, or Bradley Cooper in American Sniper. He was truly sensational in every single sequence of film he was in. The rest of the supporting cast feels relegated to smaller roles, unfortunately, and outside of King, we don't get a whole heap of development in terms of the rest of the ensemble. That said, those who make appearances give exceptional performances, whether or not their characters are given as much time to shine as they probably deserve. Opera Winfrey excels as Annie Lee Cooper, and her initial scene is one of the finest of her career. Full of despair and contained enragement, it is a potent way to introduce us to her character. Henry G. Sanders also delivers the most powerful singular scene in the film, his heartbreak shared by the audience in the film's most pivotal moment.This is a beautifully made film. It's far from perfect, but it is all the same riveting, compelling, heartfelt, somewhat unpredictable and always affecting. It does not shy away from the brutality of the era, and the brutality inflicted upon the blacks by the whites. It features an interesting concoction of music, performance, editing and cinematography, and delivers in a visceral sense far more so than other biopics released this year. It's also commendable to see a director within a film of the likes of this utilizing a score which contains thematic consistency and instrumental variety, unlike numerous other scores for films of the likes of this. For example, Hans Zimmer's work for 12 Years A Slave last year was minimalist, derivative, unoriginal drivel, that was not only entirely unemotional, but also immensely underused. McQueen seemed afraid to accent emotions with music. Duvernay, a director who comes off as brave all throughout, is not so scared, and consistently utilizes her score, composed by Jason Moran, to great effect. This kind of bravery to attempt things not otherwise attempted in films of this like is commendable, and whilst she suffers faults throughout (some of them major, others not so much), she earns herself an admirable rating due to the heartfelt emotion, acting prowess, quality cinematography and screenplay on offer. Deserving of its Best Picture nomination.",

But this could've been so much better if they had placed more focus on the individual stories of the townspeople! The most powerful scene in the movie is when King is talking to Jimmie's grandpa in the coroner's office. Why couldn't we have had more of that? More heartbreaking personal anecdotes that give weight to the individual conflicts of the people of Selma and flesh out the supporting cast.",

Ava DuVernay skips over the darker parts of his life in order to show MLK as a man with a clean slate. All this does is create a fiction. To present every caucasian in this film as evil does nothing but show ignorance. To be honest the message was clear from the beginning. If you don't know it yet just listen to the lyrics of Common's track during the credits. Destroying the truth is injustice in itself.",

    "review": "  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's march from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery gets the biopic treatment in the new film Selma, a movie that does get a lot of things right, but never achieves the greatness that it could have. With recent events in America revolving around racial tension, a movie like this seems aptly timed. The story here is all about what Martin Luther King Jr. did to overcome a very violent and racist time in the town of Selma, Alabama to reach equality in voting rights in Selma. This movie does sport great performances, a solid story, and some very violent moments that hone in on what made this such a monumental moment during the Civil Rights movement. Lets start out with the parts the film gets right. David Oyelowo plays Martin Luther King Jr. in the film and he does an outstanding job here. He delivers on all fronts and there is a single shot in the film where he looks just like King. We also see Common, Wendell Pierce, and Carmen Ejogo deliver fine performances as well as MLK's friends and wife. Tom Wilkinson, Stephen Root, and Tim Roth also deliver as the antagonists of the film making sure that we get a good view of both sides of the conflict. The story here is also handled with care giving credit where credit is due throughout the film and is effectively paced. There are some issues here but more about that later. The direction of the film is also solid with Ava DuVernay adding just the right amount of violence in the storytelling and also making sure the emotional aspects of the film hit home, although it does appear that DuVernay did try and copy the tone of 12 Years a Slave to make her film seem more artistic than it really is. With all these things going so good for this film, there are a few aspects that prevent this from being a great film. The main issue here is the lack of character development. There are indeed a lot of characters here, but the film neglects to tell you who the main supporters are. We do get the mentioning of a few nicknames but that is it. Basically if your name isn't Martin Luther King Jr, you will not get mentioned no matter what your name is. Wendell Pierce has a huge part in the film but they never tell you who he plays, only mentioning in passing he is a Reverend. Not only that but there is some parts of the story that we can't confirm if it actually happened. There are scenes with J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson that nobody can even say if it actually happened. Which means that either they made some of the film up just to lean toward one side of the story or they fabricated these events just to make the antagonists more bitter and spiteful. For a film that boasts accuracy, this is just a huge mistake and a giant risk as far as being an actual retelling of the Selma story. There is one very shoehorned character played by Oprah Winfrey that serves no purpose to the story but just to have Oprah be in the film. This isn't a major thing but that just adds on to the argument that this movie made things up to support it's cause. I realize those are bold statements but from where I was sitting, that is how this movie played out for me as a movie goer. All in all Selma is indeed a good movie, albeit a bit overrated. Yes, this film is a solid film that gets a lot of things right and it is easy to see why there is hype for it. However the liberties it takes prevent the film from being a truly great film. I still believe it is worth watching, it is a solid biopic that tells a good story about an event that sometimes gets overlooked in Martin Luther King Jr's career. I'd say this is worth seeing in theaters, might be best as a matinee.",

    "review": "  Everyone has to see this movie. Not because it's the best movie I've ever seen, but because the subject matter is so important. It is especially important in a time of such racial tension.The breathtaking (based on a) true story of a small, but incredibly important, segment of Martin Luther King Jr's civil rights movement. The title, Selma, refers to Selma Alabama. In 1965 King and a large following planned and executed a fifty mile march from Selma to Montgomery Alabama. The performances in Selma are perfect. The story is incredible and even the few slight liberties taken with history can be forgiven for the sake of the narrative.Martin Luther King Jr (David Oyelowo) is a preacher who shoulders the responsibility of trying to improve the social standing of all African-Americans, and all minorities in the United States. King constantly butts heads with President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson). Johnson has a respect for King, and understands his mission. Selma indicates that Johnson had the power to, at anytime, accomplish what the fifty mile march of the film's climax ultimately would. This is likely true, but Johnson did not want his presidency to be run by someone else. He didn't want his image hurt. Johnson says that he believes King's goal will accomplish itself in due course. He ,Johnson, just doesn't seem to see the severity and importance of taking action on it right away. Johnson isn't painted as a racist. He just doesn't care as much. The real history of the scenario is different, Johnson cared more than he was shown to in the film but it is understandable for the narrative that the dividing line needed to be more black and white, no pun intended.There is a monumental scene in which Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch) and King meet. Two icons in the civil rights movement who had different techniques at accomplishing their goals. The two historic giants settle their differences and show a mutual respect to each other for the greater good.It seems no movie is complete without a villain, in this case the villain is historically accurate which makes him even more terrifying. George Wallace (Tim Roth) is the Governor from Alabama who actively works against civil rights and the Black community. Through Wallace it is clear that King isn't fighting for new laws, he is fighting to have existing laws enforced. African-Americans in the 60s did have the right to vote, nationally. It is a sad fact that this right was denied to them on a state by state, or more local, level.The Selma march itself is the focus of the film, it is not a full biography of King himself. However, the movie does an outstanding job of showing the historical legend as a man. A very human man who shoulders a cause for the good of an entire nation. The portrayal of King by David Oyelowo is perfect. Carmen Ejogo plays King's wife Coretta Scott King. Coretta is a strong and supportive woman but the tension between husband and wife is addressed. With King spending so much time away from home, away from his wife and kids, and on the road with the 60's equivalent of groupies, it makes sense that the wife would be stressed about their situation. The scene between Coretta and Martin is handled with extreme care and executed perfectly.Giovanni Ribisi, Oprah Winfrey, and Wendell Pierce fill out the amazing supporting cast. There are more actors with roles big and small, limited screen time or not that leave quite an impression. For example, Tinity Simone, Mikeria Howard, and Jordan Christina Rice are far from household names. Their screen time was incredibly limited. Credited only as Girl #1, #2, and #3. These young actresses deliver some of the most haunting and effective moments in any movie that came out this year.While the subject matter and performances are absolutely something to be praised the film itself is not without issues. The framing, picture quality, and cinematography were a mess in Selma. Characters were often framed to far parts of the screen, off center, and grainy. The camera bobbed in strange ways and the colors were often so muted it felt like there was a cloud over the lenses on the cameras.Poor cinematography aside, Selma is an important movie. It tells an important piece of history and acts as something of a biography for a man who was larger than life.My thoughts on the \"Oscar Snubs\"I understand racism is still very real, and I understand there is a lot of racial tension in our country lately. However racism is a serious claim. To say that this movie was locked out of all of the awards purely on race is, in my opinion, taking things too far. I fully believe Oyelowo should have been nominated for best actor. I don't know which of the fantastic actors I would have dropped out of the category in his place however. Plus, isn't dropping one actor just to have a minority actor in the running racist in itself? Furthermore, to say Director Ava DuVernay was \"snubbed\" is a bit ridiculous. As far as a visual story telling medium goes the visuals were largely ugly and not award worthy.",

Luckily, this helps to punctuate the drama caused by police brutality, acts of terror, and King's negotiations with President Johnson. When victory is achieved at its end, it remains all too real that there's a lot more work to do.\"I'm not even angry at the white man. I'm angry at the black man. How did we get here today from that?

Carmen Ejogo also infuses Coretta Scott King with a quiet dignity. But the pace is slow and the call to peaceful resistance feels passive, despite dialogue telling you that just the opposite is true.

David Oyelowo so completely transforms into Martin Luther King, Jr. that it is easy to forget that fact.I watched this film on Martin Luther King Day, and how better really to honor the great Dr. King's legacy than to be reminded of his incredible legacy through film. Ava DuVernay gives us perhaps the seminal film on the American Civil Rights Movement, and presents us with the additional stories of the other often overlooked players of that historic time. What is most remarkable about Selma is that no screentime goes to waste. Every frame seems weighty and full of import, so much so that the over two hours' runtime is well deserved. With excellent performances all around from a strong cast as well as excellent work behind the camera, Selma is an outstanding entry into the film anthology of American history.",

It only got a 'Best Picture' and a 'Best Song' nomination but failed to get nominated in any other category.Now I won't deny that there's a 'soft' kind of racism at play here, combined with an unfortunate release date and a bad Oscar campaign. But did 'Selma' really deserve to be nominated in other categories? Well, let's see.First of all: Selma is a hard watch. It doesn't shy away from showing you the awful truth. I often flinched and felt my stomach turn in disgust while watching the atrocities on screen. So far so good - but in between those poignant moments the movie struggles to hold your attention. And yes, that is largely due to a screenplay that's never more than just 'ok'.Another Oscar snub was for Ava Duvernay, the director, a black female. She would've been the first black female to be nominated for a 'Best Director' statue. But to be quite frank: visually the movie is no '12 Years a Slave'. It's decently directed but nothing ever pops the way it should and again the small moments are never noteworthy.Is 'Selma' an important film? Yes. Why? Because Oscars are political. Period. Therefore it is important for a film with this message to be included in the race. Does it deserve to win or did it deserve to get nominated in other categories? No. Because in spite of its important and powerful message, the film as a whole doesn't have the qualities of an Oscar winner. It's a good film but it fails to be as great as its real life subject.",

David Oyelowo is pitch-perfect as King, portraying him as a humbled man who often doubts the implications of his actions, while still delivering the gravitas and speeches the man was known for. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent with some heavy hitters like Martin Sheen and Cuba Gooding Jr in small roles and plenty of familiar faces in King's entourage. The real weight of the film comes with the striking, unpredictable violence and nowhere is that more apparent than in the opening five minutes which completely took me by surprise. The racial inequality is handled very matter-of-factly and while it is powerful filmmaking it sickens me that this time in mankind's history was only half a decade ago. The directing is stellar, the acting superb, and the story is so well-told that I believe this film should be primary viewing in schools as a great history lesson and eye-opener to respect your fellow man.",

It's not that I didn't like the glimpses into King's personal life and struggles, but it took away focus from what is presumably the focus of the film: the behind-the-scenes of those protests, and peaceful protests in general. The actors were good, especially King. I wish also that they had used less slow motion. It made the scenes seem more movie-like as opposed to realistic and visceral.",

    "review": "  Mi pregunta es que hace que una pelicula como American Sniper tenga 6 nominaciones al Oscar y Selma tenga solo 2. Es inconsebible que no se reconozca la calidad filmica de esta produccion en sus principales categorias. Oyelowo se transformo en Dr. King, lo hizo creible, admirable, se encarno en el personaje. DuVernay como directora es digno de reconocimiento al retratar on delicadeza y sin romanticismo una historia que nos interesa a todos y que motiva a seguir en la lucha.Selma es de lo poco bueno que se produjo en el 2014. Se debe ver.My question is, what makes American Sniper to deserve 6 nominations and Selma only 2. It is inconceivable that the major categories were not recongnized by the academy. Oyelowo nailed the character, he tranformed himself in Dr. King, he was believable. DuVernay deserved a nomination not for being a black womand director but for bringin to life a remarkable and iconic story without cheap hollywood cheap romanticism. Selma is one of the few good films we could see in 2014. A must see.",

    "review": "  Much like Daniel Day-Lewis and Lincoln (2012) three years ago, Selma (2015) is a perfect example of an astounding performance elevating what is otherwise merely a decent film. Whenever the camera is focused on David Oyelowo's Dr. Martin Luther King, the story of Selma has a sharp focus. However, when the camera strays from its lead, the film begins to wander amongst all of the other (mostly-difficult-to-identify) characters. Partially, this is due to focusing on one event in a much longer story, which involved many many people, so it's understandable. Oyelowo's King is a fresh and blood human being - not a marble statue - burdened with doubts and flaws but possessing undeniable talents tailored-made for the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. Quite frankly, it would be an injustice if anyone but Oyelowo won this year's Best Actor Oscar but he isn't nominated, so there you go. Well done, Hollywood",

Performances like these make the movie-goer question precisely why British men have a longer track record than American actors for giving great performances as African American historical figures. However, the big thing is that the film is set in 1965 and strangely feels chillingly contemporary. Selma is a relevant film, moreso now than ever before, as this type of stuff - the fight for equality in the polls as well as equality in general - continues to go on today, both on US soil and overseas. As a presentation of Dr. King, it was absolutely brilliant. It put his flaws and doubts right in the spotlight with his genius. He was the man the world saw 50 years ago, not the man we see in the animated history videos in school. The film was really wordy, but all those words were equally important. The whole thing was almost Shakespearean.The film wasn't the biopic we wanted. The film was the biopic we NEEDED.",

Multidimensional storytelling sheds light on the conflicts and challenges to the 60s Civil Rights Movement, and MLK's efforts to to get Voting Rights legislation passed. We get to see MLK's doubts, fears, and personal failures. All of it presented and portrayed in a very sensitive and impressively cinematic fashion. I was fortunate enough to privately meet with Martin's wife Coretta back in the late 80s. It was a thrill I will never forget. This movie reminds me why I'm proud to be American and African-American. Our contribution in this country is so deeply ingrained, both politically and culturally.

However, it pains me to say that due to bad pacing and a stretched run time - I felt myself struggle to reach the end of the march. Tim Roth, Wendell Pierce and Tom Wilkinson give impressive supporting turns that keep the film afloat and I was also impressed by the candid take on MLK Jr.'s private life regarding his affairs that has often been swept under the rug regarding his cinematic manifestations. Other problems arise as producer, Oprah, feels she has to act in the film and pops up sporadically as a glorified extra which makes for distracting viewing. Some odd music cues, stale direction and uncertainty to the story it wants to tell; Selma is the most mediocre of the Best Picture nominees this year at the Academy Awards. Nevertheless, if you are not well versed in the history of the civil rights movement, this film could be a nice eye-opener to the plight and struggle of African Americans during the 60's",

His mannerisms and delivery were spot on and you can tell that he did a lot of research. His speeches were passionate and amazing to watch as well, which made me feel as if the role was exceptionally important to him. Beyond Oyelowo, there are several minor parts played by big actors with Martin Sheen, Oprah Winfrey, and Cuba Gooding, Jr all with cameos. The film itself is well directed and at times powerful. It focused not only on King's strengths, but also on his weaknesses and faults which was refreshing. A lot of biopics come across as hero worship, but that wasn't the case here. The Bad: The film does slow down considerably at times, and makes the 2:07 run time feel longer. On top of that, the overwhelming majority of the supporting cast fade into the background. They are introduced by name, but then don't have much screen time and most of their names are never used again so you forget who they are. That is what truly prevents the film from being great. The supporting cast are under-utilized and therefore become unmemorable.",

However, I really liked how the film started and finished. Plus, the marching scenes that happened during the movie were very intense.

The story's great, in fact I'd say the screenplay deserved a nod -- shame on the Academy. The lighting was often off, with actors faces cast in shadow for no particular reason, and some cuts between different shots of a scene (such as a chapel speech) were more distracting from the performance than emphasizing it. Might just be the first-time director getting the feeling for her craft. I'd personally say this, compared to last year's \"12 Years a Slave\", has a better script, but just isn't as good a film. Definitely worth checking out, though, for the story it tells and the acting performances",

Fast forward one year later, and you have Ferguson, MO.Much has been made of the historical accuracy of the depiction of certain players in this movie, not the least of which is President Johnson. Normally, I would forgive such inaccuracies provided that the tone and direction of the story were fulfilling, but the inaccuracy of Johnson's contribution and collaboration with Dr. King leads to a very jarring transformation at the end of the movie when President Johnson seems to unequivocally embrace the immediacy of voting rights legislation out of nowhere.There were times throughout this movie that the movie over-exposits, such as when we are introduced to the SCLC and SNCC. That's a good explanation of who the major players in the Civil Rights Movement are, but it can come across as unnecessary if you know your history. And there are times when it doesn't explain enough. Malcolm X makes a very brief appearance, no longer militant, without explanation, and then is never heard from again (due to his off-screen assassination) and without fanfare. Students of history know that Malcolm's spiritual transformation came about after making his Hajj to Mecca, but the lack of explanation and subsequent disappearance of his character makes his presence in the movie superfluous.More \"Glory\" than \"12 Years a Slave,\" \"Selma\" is a good film to have in American classrooms. It is such a shame to not have Dr. King's actual words in the movie, but David Oyelowo does a brilliant job as Dr. King. His lack of Academy Award nomination is a snub of the highest order and is unforgivable in the worlds of acting and history.",

    "review": "  SelmaGood acting, uneven directing, a decent script and a quality film score make for a compelling drama. The directing for Selma was pedestrian but not terrible for a first-timer. The camera work offers no surprises nor innovations and there is nothing about the blocking of scenes, whether in churches, on the streets or on the bridge, that enhances the action and drama. The upshot is that Selma is mainly by the books directing but over use of camera gimmickry didn't distract us from the story. It's average and adequate, not terrible, directing. Give credit to the writers and director for showing the flaws and foibles as well as the successes and brilliance of Dr. King in his entirety. No man is perfect, and to portray him as such would have been a discredit to his legacy. Not only are his oft presented infidelities touched upon, but his doubts about his abilities and his leadership mistakes are also part of the film. What makes King and so many leaders in the film remarkable is that they overcame their imperfections to do great things. ?David Oyelowo put in an Oscar worthy performance as Dr. King but failed to get a nomination. His character wasn't mentally or physically challenged, and let's face, not White. Yes, and his name isn't Denzel Washington. But if you play a White man who admits to killing dozens of people, that earns you an Oscar nod. I haven't seen \"Sniper\", and I am sure Mr. Cooper is great. However, this is an unfortunate slight given the difficulty of playing the historical legend and the quality of the performance. One of my favorite actresses from last year, Tessa Thompson of \"Dear White People\", plays the firebrand radical Diane Nash. She doesn't get nearly enough screen time for me. However, she probably got the time her character warranted for the story. Actors playing Andrew Young (Andre Holland) and John Lewis (Stephen James) are also excellent. Nigel Thatch in a brief appearance plays Malcolm X perfectly. And the always entertaining Tim Roth plays to his strength of portraying deranged men, this time, Gov. Wallace. One unfortunate choice was putting a rap song at the end of the movie when there are so many period songs or spirituals that would be more appropriate. I assume it was part of the deal to fund the film and get Common on board as one of the actors. \"Glory\" is a good song, and Legend is a great singer. And if it got the movie produced, fine. It is, however, out of place. As for the controversy about LBJ: Tom Wilkinson does a good job portraying the conflicted president. From what I know about Johnson, the portrait was fair and accurate. Carmen Ejogo played Coretta King with the dignity required, though her role suffered from inattentive writing and wasn't well flushed out. ??Rating: Pay Full Matinee PriceSelma is entertaining though too long in moments. Tighter editing would have helped with the pacing. A bigger budget may have given the director more opportunities to be creative with the shots. The angles, lighting and pacing didn't match the gravity of the story. The dialogue worked well for the time and place of the movie. ?Peace, Tex Shelters",

An earnest and noble portrait of Dr. King, with a terrific performance by David Oyelowo, but the film has technical errors that keep it from being as great as it wants to be. As with many other biopics of people this year, specifically Stephen Hawking in \"Theory of Everything,\" and Alan Turing in \"The Imitation Game,\" \"Selma\" also wants to not offend anyone with its selective biographical memory. All three films seem to deify their subjects, which keeps them from seeming human, ignoring flaws or unlikeable character traits, which could mar the films' intent. \"Selma\" is well written, selecting a 2 month period in King's life, instead of trying to incorporate all his accomplishments, which would need an 8 hour canvas at least. While the film is interesting and well acted, it's unwavering tone of \"historic importance\" sometimes drags and is less entertainment than historic document that wants to be a school staple for future generations to examine as good for them. King's infidelity is only hinted at for example, in an otherwise hermetically sealed portrait of harmonious marriage. What is more troublesome is the cinematography and editing, which continually jump \"the line,\" and seem low budget, almost amateurish. It's unfortunate, because so much of the film is really well done, especially the acting. \"Selma\" is as polemical by omission as \"American Sniper,\" but the technical work is far less accomplished.",

    "review": "  Built and centered on an admirable topic, Selma proves to be a surprisingly weighty historical drama in a season of underwhelming Oscar bait hopefuls. I actually always wondered what a well-made film about Martin Luther King, Jr. would look like that was NOT about the march on Washington, the Montgomery bus boycott, or his assassination. In addition to a different setting than we are used to seeing him in, we also are allowed to look at King the human being, i.e. the flawed man who used politics and arm-twisting in order to achieve his goals. The script avoids pandering hagiography in a similar manner to Lincoln. King understood, both here and in reality, that any struggle would have to be public and caught on camera for Middle America to see, and this helped steer his choice toward demonstrating in Selma, Alabama where resistance would be fierce. We also have David Oyelowo giving an underplayed King, while displaying more assertiveness than we are used to seeing. Oyelowo probably gives the best depiction of MLK we have seen to date and I must join the chorus of voices arguing that this actor was robbed by the Academy for a nomination. There are some problems with accuracy regarding the role of President Johnson, which some historians have rightfully pointed out. Namely, this version of LBJ comes off as a bit cowardly and downright obstructionist toward civil rights. He is shown yelling at King in most of his scenes, conspiring with J. Edgar Hoover to damage King's marriage by releasing evidence of his infidelities to his wife, and only pushing the Voting Rights Act to protect his legacy after it becomes clear the way the wind is blowing. I got news for ya. Johnson, like most if not all U.S. Presidents, probably hated J. Edgar and often avoided him if he could. The wiretapping of King and other Civil Rights leaders predated LBJ, and Hoover often acted unilaterally on that kind of behavior and without oversight. Furthermore, Johnson for the most part approved of King's actions, and specifically in Selma. This is not to say Johnson was an angel. He could be a gigantic asshole. But he was not a coward and he certainly didn't act to obstruct MLK, even if they disagreed on many issues. On that note, they definitely got George Wallace right. He really was a creepy, racist self-absorbed douche - largely unconcerned with the future or his legacy...until he got shot and paralyzed years later.But I digress. This is the kind of low-key, unpretentious, honest story telling I wish I saw more of. The stellar portrayal for our protagonist, competent direction, tight writing, and simple but relevant message make this a must see. Get chill bumps listening to the speeches. Cringe every time nightsticks are brandished and George Wallace opens his mouth. Easily one the best films of the year.",

Even if you know some of the history, it does a good job of telling younger people the story line of just how much was going on then and why it was so important. None of the performances are particularly impactful because you already know many of the characters but, David Oyelowo is better in Selma than Bradley Cooper is in American Sniper. Now was a good time for this movie to come out because you can see how far we've come and how far we haven't. For me the most interesting elements are kind of meta. The John Legend/Common song in the end references Ferguson but Oprah has had made comments that have undermined the protesters. The most impactful scene to me was the opening scene of $3 billion Oprah trying to pass a literacy test. That and the four little girls scene. If Oprah didn't have $3 billion though she might hear the rhyme of the themes in this story with what is happening today. Instead of the general public being allowed to kill black people's without reprisal it's just the police. And The voting rights act has been broken by the Supreme Court in the past few years. Billionaires are always insulated though, and lots of other people worked hard on this movie so appreciate it.",

    "review": "  It was an enightening movie to see. It brought tears in the scenes of brutality upon fellow human beings. Dr. Kings speeches were well done. But where it fell short for me was the scenes of LBJ (partial truths?) and some of Corretta King and her husbands interactions. I am sure she was far more passionate and likely less tearful than depicted. Had there been dates added of the key meetings with snippets from Correta's memories, it would have seemed more factual in total. It left me thinking it was a little disjointed and wondering what really happened behind the scenes. What parts are made up? I do believe the awfulness of it all ,as depicted on the bridge, and the wonderful moving speeches. The view of Dr. King was impressive and timely for the times we are living in. But while it is a very good movie, ultimately I felt it missed out on being outstanding because I am left with too many questions as to what really happened behind the scenes.",

    "review": "  It is that time of year when I go see all the Oscar-nominated films I haven't yet seen. Selma was one of those I wanted to see, but was turned off by the talk of the historical inaccuracies when it came to LBJ's portrayal. Combined with the ridiculous Al Sharpton protests because of the lack of Director and Actor nods for anyone in Selma, I wasn't entirely excited about seeing the film. However, I'm a relatively objective person though, so I'm happy to say that, while I haven't seen all of the movies yet for which actors have been nominated, I have to admit that I am stunned about the lack of a nod for David Oyelowo. His performance is outstanding. I'm all for Michael Keaton winning an Oscar, but admittedly, David's performance is right up there. His portrayal as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. has to be a Top 5 performance. If it truly isn't, then the ones who were nominated must be insanely good. While I cannot speak for the historical accuracy of LBJ's portrayal, I thought the movie treated the history I DO know, very fairly. Selma has some odd moments, such as the sudden introduction, then little-discussed disappearance, of Malcolm X, but there wasn't an over-dramatic over-portrayal of either side. I am from the deep South and saw the ridiculous behavior of white America not too far after that matched pretty well with the whites displayed in Selma. Even after 50 years, the message of Selma remains so strong, not for just black America, but for every race, culture, sexual preference, etc. It seems so ridiculous that we still struggle as a nation to admit that we have pockets of inequality. Women in the work force, continued racism and the absurd stance that some still have about gay marriage. Movies like this should be required watching.",

    "review": "  There is a scene of such astonishing power very early on in the movie \"Selma,\" where Martin Luther King calls up Mahalia Jackson in the middle of the night. He is about to go to Selma, Alabama to lead the famous march to Montgomery. He knows the road ahead is dangerous. His life is in danger. J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI have his house watched and his phones tapped. Death threats come in on a regular basis (his wife, Coretta, says at one point that she feels death hanging over her \"like a fog\"). And history is on the line with the fight for passage of the Voting Rights Act. King tells his friend that he \"needs to hear the voice of the Lord.\" Jackson, still in her nightgown, sits on the edge of her bed and sings him a gospel song over the phone. It's a beautiful, haunting moment, deep and true, and yet, we don't see this as King's Agony in the Garden: he is not reduced to the over-simplified image of a Christ figure. \"Selma\" is far too serious (I know the word is loaded) for such facile reductions of character. King is a leader, an activist. He makes difficult choices. He is tactful about how he uses his followers to influence political power. This is history made alive. The movie never feels stagnant or dull or too much like a school lesson; it never crosses into that absurd realm of syrupy inspiration that is characteristic of so many other \"serious\" historical dramas. It is electric, even thrilling. I am amazed to find out that the director, Ava DuVernay was not nominated for an Oscar for Best Director. It's an appalling snub. This is one of the year's best movies, and it deserves to be seen, recognized, and absorbed. In the context of Ferguson and the national dialogue about racial injustice, this movie comes along at an important point in time. If it doesn't break the box office or win Best Picture, I think it will still take its place in movie history.",

    "review": "  Selma arrives at a time where racial politics have reentered the American landscape and seems to have reignited creative fires in recent projects ranging from the Butler, Django Unchained, Lincoln and last years Best Picture winner 12 Years a Slave. In the case of Selma, it had been gestating for a while with Lee Butler attached to direct, which probably was what brought Oprah's attention to the project along with Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment to fast track production on this little gem which it truely is, not a major studio film even though Paramount distributes it, but a Pathe UK production. Despite all the grumbling over the lack of nominations for the 2015 Oscars with the exception of song and pic, the main thing film critics and fans should be focusing on is the arrival of David Oleyowo as Martin Luthor King Jr, who has mastered the now iconic speechifying voice and tambre, but also brings a humanity and doubt to the character to help make him a human and relatable character for the younger generation and helps you to get to know what he may have be like in the midst against the giant that is US politics and the Civil War. Having only seen him in a few supporting roles, notably the Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I am excited to see what the King Role will bring him. The rest of the cast is strong, including the ever reliable Roth and Wilkenson in key roles. But as a film, its strictly servicable compared to the aforementioned films and just acts as a study for that particular moment in US history and best viewed as a character study if anything else. In a less competitive year, David would most likely have received a Best Actor nomination for his work which is the nomination the pic should have received imho. Above average.",

Delving deeper into MLK, we find that he was a very flawed man, and it is to be applauded that director Ava DuVernay did not make this a flowery love letter to MLK and followers alike. Incredible performances from Wilkinson as President Johnson and Roth as bull-headed politician Wallace, really anchor the story, but David Oyelowo delivers a one-of-a-kind performance as MLK. This unclouded depiction of 60s life in the South, (mainly Alabama in the film), shows us how far we have come and more so, how much further we have left to go. Rated 3.75 out of 5.

The movie is a time machine back to hard times. You get to see the folks facing these times. They argue and fight amongst themselves at first. MLK knows he must have the changes now. The story changes from what is done to people of color to how they and others react to it to how people come together to stop what is truly evil.I recommend you see it this MLK holiday. It reminds me of what we, Americans, were in the 1960s, how far we have come due to the sacrifices of good men and women, and of course how far we have to go.

    "review": "  3.5/4.0There is no denying that \"Selma\" is an incredibly powerful and emotionally moving piece of work. The movie tells the story of the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches led by Martin Luther King, Jr. The key reason why the movie works is David Oyelowo who portrays King in his first major leading film role. He succeeds in portraying the immense power and (more importantly) heart of this great man. While justifiably glorifying King, the movie never attempts to portray him as a flawless man as evident from the nuances of his family life and relationship with his wife Coretta (well played by Carmen Ejogo). While far less graphic, \"Selma\" is in my opinion more powerful in depicting racial oppression than last year's Oscar winner \"12 Years a Slave\". Kudos to little known female director Ava DuVernay (\"Middle of Nowhere\") who manages to infuse the right amount of style (including some slo-mo shots) to give integral scenes the right amount of dramatic punch.The movie's sole flaw (that one forgives given its emotional strength) is that a lot of the key supporting characters particularly those who played a key part in the real-life march are underdeveloped and uninteresting including James Bevel (rap star Common who collaborates with the great John Legend on the moving theme song for the film \"Glory\"), Hosea Williams (Wendell Pierce), Amelia Boynton Robinson (Lorraine Toussaint) and SNCC's John Lewis (Stephan James). However, that is forgivable by smaller less significant roles including Oprah Winfrey (also produces) as Annie Lee Cooper who has only two key scenes including one where she tries to unsuccessfully vote and a sequence involving the death of teenager Jimmi Lee Jackson by the police. The ensuing sequence with King at the morgue with his nearly blind grandfather (Henry G. Sanders) that is followed by a speech by King at the boy's funeral alone make the film well worth seeing. One of the most difficult things to reenact on film are historic speeches especially if by a character as prolific as King and \"Selma\" is great (again thanks to Oyelowo) for depicting the grandeur of these moments - they feel real! Tom Wilkinson is good portraying President Johnson who had a somewhat of a love-hate relationship with King (the character's depiction in the film has drawn some controversy), Giovanni Ribisi as his advisor Lee C. White and Tim Roth as racist Alabama governor George Wallace. Nominated for 2 Oscars: Picture, Original Song. (It is an atrocity that the movie didn't get more nominations particularly one for Oyelowo).",

British actor who plays Martin Luther King Jr pulls it off phenomenally with a flawless southern accent. King's uncertainty in actions are engaging and this film is a reminder that inequality continues in 2015. Liberals on the left were the ones fighting for equality while the remaining southern racists/fascists found refuge in far right movements. King was a true progressive that criticized the Vietnam War, was an adamant supporter of democratic Socialism and condemned the Capitalist system which has accelerated the growing gap of inequality in the past few years.",

    "review": "  I can see why SELMA has been nominated BEST PICTURE this year. It is a story still relevant to our times... one that does indeed shows how far we have come as a nation but yet how far we still have to go. In so many aspects, we face the same turmoils of racism and inequality as we did decades ago with the Civil Rights Movement. Don't be fooled people, the movement is still happening everyday in our news! SELMA demonstrates this without ever truly being preachy, as a lot of political biopics do. Did I love the film? No. Is it something I will truly remember in a few years even, most likely not... However, it is very much worth seeing and holds a lot of power. The film raises above typical historical films by showing the different perspectives at hand and often introducing a myriad of characters that come and go quickly but leave their mark, revealing their purpose in the end. You always know who the hero is in the end, after all it is a three-month story on Martin Luther King Jr... Yet, you see the good side and bad side and convergence of both when political powers are used for the better... The film starts with a bang that dropped my jaw to the floor and from there had some terrific moments... brutal and cringe-worthy at times... to so small and silent that expression itself tells every word necessary. Is it great direction? No. I know a lot of people are saying the director was snubbed for an Oscar nomination, however I honestly feel that there are a lot of directors out there that could have made the same film once having such script, talent and budget in hand... There is not a stand-out style of direction here that is truly recognizable or \"new\", for me at least... Are performance s overlooked? Definitely. David Oyelowo does indeed deserve a Best Actor Nomination but was sadly overlooked. As Oprah, who produced and has a supporting role in the film, has said interviews, this is, as she hopes, a film that will be required viewings in school one day. I can agree to that. The film has a lot to say without being tedious... Something another recent, critically-acclaimed bio-pic, LINCOLN really failed to do. Seriously, do not even get me started on the snooze-fest called LINCOLN!!! As more films are made of past historical figures, may they please go along the venture of SELMA...",

    "review": "  The image we're greeted with at the onset of Selma, staring directly at us, is the face of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. But this is not the Dr. King we know from the sound bites and TV footage that immortalized him as a mighty orator with a famous dream. This Dr. King looks uncomfortable, restless and out of his element as he rehearses his Noble Peace Prize acceptance speech in the privacy of his hotel suite.The Dr. King he himself sees in the mirror is unfamiliar to him as well; All dressed up to accept an award for peace when he knows how much violence and struggle is yet to be endured in his campaign for civil rights. Just as he gazes at his reflection, contemplating how far he's come and how far he's still to go, so too does Selma hold a mirror up to modern America and ask its people to consider the same questions.Director Ava DuVernay (working from her largely rewritten draft of an original script by Paul Webb) has no intention of taking the easy way around the story of the protest marches King led from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, or of dampering its echoes in the troubled racial politics of today. Though set in the summer of '65, it is a film very much about the here and now, told with a verve and vitality that historical docudramas often lack.Rather than cut and paste every highlight from the pages of some textbook, DuVernay focusses solely on one single mission out of the dozens that King (David Oyelowo) took up in his 13 years of political activism: The right for black citizens to vote in the state of Alabama.With tensions between the African American community and the Jim Crow South already at a fever pitch following the Civil Rights Act, King appeals to Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) for immediate voting reform legislation, but the harried president - understandably preoccupied with a costly war in Vietnam - considers it a lower priority.This controversial depiction of Johnson has already sparked some dissent from LBJ supporters who resent that he comes off as anything less than saintly. However, Wilkinson's fine performance makes it clear that he's not the bad guy, but a shrewd pragmatist caught between a rock and a hard place, unwilling and unable to budge until one of those two sides does so first.Perhaps those LBJ complaints would bear more weight if DuVernay hadn't applied the same scrutinizing humanism to King as well, who is by no means deified in this picture. DuVernay and Oyelowo are more interested in showing that even the greatest of men are as flawed as the rest of us.Yes, King is a loving husband and father, but also an imperfect one. DuVernay evokes the marital rifts between him and his wife Coretta Scott-King (Carmen Ejogo) by editing their exchanges as a visual back-and-forth without showing both their faces together in the same shot.Yes, King is a charismatic leader, but at times is doubtful about his own cause. As effective as Oyelowo is at channeling the hair-raising timber and cadence of King's voice, he's even more impressive when grappling silently with the human cost of his crusade.It's easy for movies to play the old 'a-noble-cause-is-worth-dying-for' card, but this one truly and thoroughly explores that dilemma. One of Oyelowo's most affecting moments comes when King, locked in the Selma county jail, waxes philosophic to his fellow activist Ralph Abernathy: \"A man stands up only to be struck down. And what of the people who followed him?\"But Selma never feels preachy - even when the reverend Dr. King is literally sermonizing - because the film is as much about the practicalities and politicking behind the Selma marches as it is about the ideologies that inspired them. The manipulation and tactics employed by all camps are portrayed, from blackmail to backroom negotiations to television exposure. In some ways it's reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Lincoln, but nowhere near as reserved in its stylistic execution.DuVernay's direction is never less than gripping, using beautifully composed images and carefully selected music to make some striking juxtapositions. The brutal assault of protestors on the Edmund Pettus Bridge (the day that would be known as Bloody Sunday), for instance, is underscored by Martha Bass' rendition of \"Walk With Me\" to add ironic sting.And rising cinematography star Bradford Young uses low angles to communicate power and moral standing in dynamic ways; Close-ups of bigoted Alabama governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) are framed differently than close-ups of King for a reason.Because all this care has been taken to keep us engaged throughout, by the time the film reaches its epic finale on the steps of the State Capitol in Montgomery, it's every bit as stirring as it aims to be despite being a predictable dramatic beat. And it's here where the parallels between past and present become pointedly clear, as sung in the truthful lyrics of the end credit single \"Glory\" (by John Legend and rap artist Common):One son died, his spirit is revisitin' usTruant livin' livin' in us, resistance is usThat's why Rosa sat on the busThat's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands upWhen it go down we woman and man upThey say, \"Stay down\" and we stand upShots, we on the ground, the camera panned upKing pointed to the mountain top and we ran upSelma is so much more than an engrossing history lesson on film. Selma is a rallying cry for a movement that must keep marching, and a glorious rallying cry at that. Selma is now.",

Gripping real world looks inside looks of a place and time that can only be described as horrible. Director DuVernay nails it and should have been included in the list of nomination for Oscar consideration. The cinematographic excellence rival any other movie I seen this year. Acting, top to bottom, was outstanding as well. for me... personally... the lead actor David Oyelowo is where the fifth star falls off my rating. Having my sense filled with the real MLK, Jr. does not help him. In fact there is no one on the big screen who can reach that powerful and lasting presence and thus, he fail short as well. Lot's of upset people out there concerning his snub for the Oscar, to me he did an already job but not Oscar worthy job. I do look forward to other Oyelowo attempts in the future, I am sure they will be great.",

The performances are very good, albeit in my opinion and maybe some of the other Old Geezers Who Go To The Matinee Alone, a bit wooden and stereotypic at times. The evil southern racists are stamped out of one model and the noble civil rights workers are also one dimensional. Having said that I'd still say go because the highs are a lot higher than the lows are low. There has been a lot written about the way Lyndon Johnson, masterfully played by Tom Wilkinson, is portrayed as ambivalent or even hostile to Dr. Martin Luther King's goals for the Selma march. That is simply ahistorical and got on my nerves until the end where Johnson seemed to have some sort of 'road to Damascus' moment. The action is pretty good but the movie lags at times. All in all I was impressed and recommend it although at 2+ hours you'll need your depends. . .or is that just me?",

The saddest thing however was that I left the theater with a bad taste in my mouth. As the credit roll, a rap song plays talking about marching on Ferguson with hands up. Since the poor kid in Ferguson didn't have his hands up but was attacking the cop, apparently we have gone from defending the truth to defending a lie. Giving his teaching on the dangers of violence, Dr. King must be looking down from heaven weeping.",

Selma tries it's best to capture the raw essence of the racially motivated events at hand yet it ultimately does not live up to the task, creating at times a drawn out, slowly paced biopic that, at it's greatest fault, crafts Dr. King not as a man, but as a god. The cast does terrific jobs and the directing is to be praised beyond a doubt, as well this is an important film to be seen purely based on it's relevance and message, as well as to better understand the strides and faults we as a nation have made over the decades, however as a film, I begrudgingly say, I am not surprised at the amounts of snubs Selma received from the Academy earlier this day.

Another well represented aspect of the film was MLK himself. We all know MLK the ideal. The ideal of non-violent yet disruptive protests that many protests today try to resemble to bring awareness to issues in our society. But what you see in this film is the man. MLK laughing and enjoying a meal with his friends. MLK working on martial issues and the struggle inside himself of understanding his lasting legacy and how history would perceive him with every action he did. How David Oyelowo did not get a best actor nomination from the Academy is a travesty. This is one of the best pictures of 2014 and certainly one many people should see.",

    "review": "  Doctor Martin Luther King is rightfully one of the most prominent and revered historical figures of the twentieth century. He worked tirelessly to give his people- and all Americans- equal rights and dignity, without resorting to violence, hate or extremism, but instead through the power of words, ideals, and nonviolent resistance. So it is fitting that his life has been the subject of many film and television biopics, many of them quite good. And Selma may be the best yet. David Oyelowo was the perfect choice to play Dr. King. Beyond his strong physical resemblance, his speech and mannerisms are almost uncannily like those of the late reverend. He exudes inner strength and determination, and there's just this presence about him when he stands and raises his voice in defiance or exhortation. In scenes where he deliver some of MLK's more famous speeches it's almost like King himself were speaking directly to the audience. In terms of power and authenticity it would not be amiss to compare his performance to that of Daniel Day Lewis in Lincoln.Another similarity with Spielberg's recent biopic is that as much as Selma venerates its subject, it takes every opportunity to humanize him, going beyond the legend we know to show us Martin Luther King the man. He is a great man, a righteous man, but still a man, with fears, doubts, and emotions. He gets frustrated, even angry, and not just at white racists. He longs to be with his wife and children, but too often advancing the cause means life on the road. And like any other man he knows how to cut loose and have some fun with friends. Perhaps more than in any previous portrayal, we get to know Doctor King as a relatable and eve imperfect human being, which makes his accomplishments all the more impressive. Just as it avoids making its protagonist an unknowable icon, Selma avoids the temptation to reduce his opponents into one dimensional caricatures. Make no mistake, the movie makes no attempt to soften the segregationists and race baiters. There are plenty of scenes of snarling troopers beating protestors bloody- or worse. But neither does it reduce them all to ignorant hicks. George Wallace, the grand bigot himself, is calculating and articulate, and far more dangerous for it.Given this nuance, it is all the more baffling that the filmmakers have managed to so badly mischaracterize President Johnson. It's true that LBJ didn't always place the same urgency on civil rights efforts that King did, and that they disagreed on a number of issues such as Vietnam. It is also certainly true that FBI director Hoover was obsessed with discrediting King and used the FBI to monitor and harass him. However to portray Johnson as adversarial towards King or involving himself in Hoover's schemes is at best highly inaccurate and at worst disingenuous. Given LBJ's prominence in the film and the importance given to his interactions with Doctor King, this strikes a very sour note in an otherwise excellent production.Despite this weakness, Selma remains an outstanding film. A nuanced screenplay, strong direction, and high production values take it well beyond the level of the average biographical film, and exceptional acting together with stirring musical choices give it a power worthy of its story. Selma is a moving portrait of a truly great man and a powerful and timely reminder of what he went through so we can be where we are today.",

The monologues and even the smaller moments when he is on screen are so well directed and they really deliver that punch that you want them to. The first film in some time that made me tear up from its extremely powerful and shocking opening scene. The film is also not a from birth till death biopic of MLK's life which is often a trap for a film like this it just takes one significant event and focuses in on that and I thought that was a great choice that really worked. Another trap for a biopic like this that I thought was a great aspect and a good choice for this film is it is not a glossy look at the history it is a real look at not only the historical figure we know Dr. King to be but also the man he was. The movie is also masterfully edited with a just over two hour run time. Some of the problems that I personally had with the film is that at times it has its pacing issues and as a result felt like the story was moving at a crawl. Another problem with the film is the fact that Dr. King was the only interesting character in the whole film and when he was not on screen you did not care much. This is the first feature film biopic look at this Martin Luther King Jr and I am sure with this ones success that this will usher in more but this one has set the bar high. 4/5",

    "review": "  Biopics have a tendency to play like highlights reels. 'Selma' opens with a refreshing line. As Martin Luther King is being honored with the Nobel Peace Prize, the presenter says something like, \"Dr. King, we've heard your dream.\" By moving immediately past King's most famous moment, the audience is presented with the uncommon opportunity to explore the messy mechanics of the Civil Rights Movement. King is an imperfect man and leader, learning as he goes, who is faced with a challenge of such magnitude that his strategies are never self evident.A choppy script is masked by brilliantly intense performances all around. In particular, David Oyelowo as King, Tom Wilkinson as Lyndon Johnson, and Stephan James as a young John Lewis command every second they are on screen.A side note: For the second year in a row, I'm struck by irony of British actors staging quintessential moments in American history. Last year's '12 Years a Slave' primarily starred British actors as Americans. In this one, King, his wife, LBJ, and George Wallace are all played (very effectively) by Brits. A curious connection between the two movies - Brad Pitt is executive producer. Coincidence? Or is Pitt suggesting that Americans aren't willing to face our own history?",

Too much of the movie was about the fictitious back and forth between King and LBJ and not enough about the real antagonists Gov. George Wallace and FBI Director J.

He wrote a strong compelling, and completely real representation of the events surrounding Selma.Ava DuVernay had the audacity to direct and put this story on the big screen. She nailed it perfectly. She captured the emotion of the man, his followers, and everyone involved, including those against him. The cast also nailed every single part, every emotion, and every beat.Selma' is a good movie about a great human being. I'll admit I didn't know much about the actual events, so the movie was quite interesting. The movie focuses on a pivotal moment during the Civil Rights Movement, which focuses on Martin Luther King Jr. trying to march through Selma to Montgomery. Selma is told with with a solid amount of emotion, the events the movie portrays really gets your blood boiling because of how arrogant and hateful people could be back then. This is a powerful movie about a powerful individual who united thousands of people for one great cause and the movie itself truly captures the spirit of Dr King very well. The acting is of course phenomenal, some of the best of the year, especially when you hear David O's natural voice! But what really held 'Selma' back was the whole LBJ storyline and how they made him out as more of a bad buy more than anything else. After the movie I went and read about the events and a lot of other people out there agree (or were upset) about how the directed made him look. He was actually the one who gave MLK the idea to go to Selma and protest there, not Dr King. He also was a very strong supporter of the Civil Rights Movement and was constantly (but secretly) working on solving the situation on a legislative level. So if you are looking for a more factual movie about the events that took place, look for a documentary rather than this. Don't get me wrong, this is an eye opening movie, but it does have it's weaknesses, particularly the portrayal of LBJ and Dr King's personal life storyline, which is quite brief and doesn't really add much to the story. Outside of those complaints, the movie sends a very strong message and a great one at that. Is this movie the Best Picture of the year? No, it's a good movie with a heart at the center of the story, but it lacks to energy and gut punching ability that '12 Years a Slave' had last year to make it truly something special.",

    "review": "  After all the great reviews I was expecting a moving tale of the march from Selma to Montgomery. That is not what I got. The movie started out well...actually a masterful piece of insight and direction for the first scene. After that it went down hill. The actors playing Johnson and Wallace were ill suited for the role. The actor playing Dr. Martin Luther King, JR lacked the charisma of Dr. King. I remember Dr. King's speeches...I watched the events unfold. This movie did not do justice to either. It would have been better if the story would have been told from the point of view of a participant instead of the leader. And it would have been a hell of a lot better if Oprah Winfrey hadn't hogged scenes, bringing nothing to the story.",

    "review": "  A powerful film about the Civil Rights movement. The film goes over one of the events that took place in Selma, Alabama. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo doing a FANTASTIC job) leads protestor to non-violent protesting and marching in the wake of trying to get African Americans the right to vote without Jim Crowe Laws. The movie goes over the struggles they must overcome from MLK debating with President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson), to the Governor of Alabama (Tim Roth) having state troopers beat the protestors to death on national television. It's a film full of very powerful ideas and the people who came together for their rights. It's very well done, but one complaint was it does get a bit sluggish in the middle. I found it very interesting MLK was portrayed as here. He's much more human. You always read about him, but like any other person he's just another man with his own faults. Overall, a fantastic film that I highly recommend giving a look!",

    "review": "  Selma is deeply affecting to the point of being unsettling. Like 12 Years a Slave, the violence is visceral and whoever did the sound effects made sure we feel every bone breaking, skull fracturing blow from those batons. The movie is well acted, has particularly effective scenes involving multiple extras marching, etc.,and is both educational and artful in satisfying ways. I suspect it possible that some moviegoers may feel this is one drama too many that deals with Black history, the history of racism, and the fight for equal rights in this country given relatively recent predecessors \"12 Years a Slave\", \"Fruitvale Station\", and \"The Butler\" but I would discourage such cinematic fatigue and have to say if you saw those movies, as I did, go to this one as well: it's excellent. My one reservation is minor and purely a matter of personal opinion: when I see Oprah Winfrey in a movie I see...well, Oprah Winfrey, not as much her character. She is a good enough actress, but an overexposed presence across media in general. It's a bit like seeing Sean Penn in two too many political message movies. Any number of African-American actresses could've played her role in this movie; Octavia Spencer comes to mind' perhaps even Jill Scott or Gladys Knight. I don't blame Oprah for wanting to be in a movie she is sinking her heart, soul, and substantial money or power into, as this is her vision and sense of mission, but...you've done it and done it well. As Correta King says to her distraught husband when visiting him in jail: \"Rest.\" Or at least try something totally out of character for yourself if you can't rest. That being said, I also saw Boyhood, this movie's major competition for a Best Picture Oscar. This is, to me, the more powerful film even if it did not take 12 years to shoot. If you plan to see it don't walk out too early at the end: the song \"Glory\" by John Legend and Common at the end is a knockout.",

    "review": "  Solid, lovingly made docu-drama about MLK and the march from Selma to Montgomery boasts a plethora of powerful moments and a fantastic performance by David Oyelowo. While his speechifying moments don't completely soar (he matches Dr. King's cadence but somehow lacks the gravitas - a difficult feat, to be sure), he is at his best in the backstage scenes, where we get a glimpse into the weight of the movement on the man. He brings a remarkable humanity to this being of now-Superman-status, communicating the doubts and insecurities of a man forced into figurehead status. These intimate sequences are the highlights of the film, combined with a harrowing depiction of the first march across the bridge. The ensemble nature is quite nice, as well (although Tom Wilkinson and Tim Roth are too often cartoonish), but the film can't quite ever truly transcend the trappings of the genre. Still and all, what \"Selma\" is really about is political consciousness-raising, and at this it is very effective, reminding us of how far we've come in 50 years, and how very, very far we have to go.",

I dint know about the issue of voting rights of colored people in USA then but at least now I know what happened in the past. The brutal segregation and the reality behind the Emancipation Proclamation and about the Martin Luther King jr..  This movie is a chronicle of Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965. David Oyelowo's given amazing performance as Martin Luther King and cameo from Oprah Winfrey.What I liked about the movie was the speeches made by King in inspiring people for the march.

This film lived up to all my expectations which were very high. To call it moving, or stunning or a revelation is the understatement of the year, and virtually ALL films critics agree it MUST be seen. Even if you know the story very well, it NEEDS to be seen. As i was walking out of the theatre, i heard a woman in her 70's (it seemed) talking to her companion. She said she did the 50 mile march from Selma to Birmingham which ends the film. She was not using a cane or a walker. And that brought it all home. This was not 5 centuries ago. This was less than 50 years ago.

    "review": "  Current events involving police officers and their unarmed murder victims has everything and nothing to do with the firecracker that is Selma, Ava DuVernay's provocative, potent look at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s landmark 1965 voting-rights march from Selma, Alabama to the state capitol of Montgomery. Sadly, racial injustice is as timely as ever. Righteous fury is in the air and it's that drive to be recognized as human that's all over Selma.All the better for audiences. DuVernay, working from an amazing script from Paul Webb, makes dusty history come thrillingly alive. She finds its pulse and beating heart. Dr. King, played brilliantly by Brit actor David Oyelowo, is faced with a most strenuous situation: black citizens in the South are being intimidated, beaten and discouraged from exercising their rights to vote. Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) is a-ok with Jim Crow. In the White House, President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) would rather deal with Communists, or anything else. King had to act. He believed a non-violent march in Selma, teeming with bigotry, would generate enough of a media firestorm that the president would be forced to act himself.King was right on target, but at a price. Within the burgeoning civil rights movement King faced resentment from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. King expected fierce opposition from proponents of violent action, but a meeting with Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch, wonderful) and King's wife Coretta (a magnificent Carmen Ejogo), a surprising strategy comes about. The political stakes are raised, and DuVernay is unflinching at showing how all hands get dirty.DuVernay's film is not about hero worship, no one is gifted with a halo, not even Dr. King. Selma is no biopic, it's a salute to community action, movement building and aims to view King through the lens of one crucial event, offering a rousing, unwavering, extraordinary portrait of a born preacher who was not without his own sins. Oyelowo's stirring, incredible performance deserves the highest of praise and superlatives. His delivery of King's speeches, particularly 'How Long, Not Long' rings true with emotion and grit. But it's in the quieter moments that he really comes alive, in moments of humor, heartache and staggering self-doubt. It's a portrait of a man in full. King and his wife discuss his infidelities with gut-wrenching honesty. Ejogo is a revelation, award-caliber in every sense.It was on March 7, known as Bloody Sunday, that black and white marchers are forced to turn back on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in the face of police. Later, a judge forces a truce and the march proceeds as planned. DuVernay and cinematographer extraordinaire Bradford Young, shooting on location in Alabama, create visual poetry as we watch history forged in real flesh and blood.Talk must be had of the two women behind Selma, the film. Oprah Winfrey, a producer on the film, is outstanding as Annie Lee Cooper, a nurse who punched a white sheriff for denying her the right to vote. Lorraine Toussaint is all kinds of excellent as Amelia Boynton, brutalized by police during the march, as is Tessa Thompson as Diane Nash, one of the movement's many unsung heroes.But the woman of the hour is undoubtedly DuVernay, a former publicist for the likes of Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood. Her second film, 2012's Middle of Nowhere made her the very first black woman to win the Sundance award for directing. In Selma, her talent is in full force. The task of a film to chronicle the events leading up to the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act is immeasurable and daunting for just one film. The story is an inspiration and a tragedy considering the John Roberts Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013 and racial injustice continues to plague people of color in America. The struggle goes on.",

Seems that this a vicious circle that still present without any evident solution. Ava DuVernay explore this problem in the film Selma. The historical drama Selma recount the events in 1965 of the voting rights marches led by James Hosea Williams and Martin Luther King Jr. The film's approach is raw in some moments highlighting perfectly the levels of hate and violence that people and authorities of the south have against African Americans, but also how people were able to overcome race discrimination marching as one. Selma is not a biopic about MLK is about everyone who always wanted to be treated as an equal and the struggle civil right movement leaders, finding answers and searching for understanding. Ava DuVernay do a formidable work as a director, capturing a MLK vulnerable, thoughtful and spiritual. Selma is filled with excellent visual nuances, supported by the beautiful cinematography from Bradford Young and editing by Spencer Averick. Music selection for the film is spot on and it capture the emotions of the scenes in SELMA.Lastly David Oyelowo is outstanding as a MLK he gets deep into the character, specially when he is doing the most memorable speeches from Dr King.SELMA makes you understand that nothing have change and the work to develop better understanding about race and equality is not even half away.",

    "review": "  One extremely profound and historic moment (of many) during the film \"Selma\" occurs when viewers witness President Lyndon B. Johnson finally acquiesce to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. over his desire to conduct a protest march in Alabama. The dramatic White House scene, in which President Johnson places a call to Alabama Governor George Wallace at this insistence of Dr. King, is magnified tenfold when viewers can't help but notice a portrait of George Washington staring down at LBJ from an Oval Office wall. The symbolic message to the audience is clear. After nearly 200 years as a country--built in large part upon the backs and suffering of African-Americans--the United States was finally turning a new pageon that grim chapter of our nation's history.\"Selma\" is a powerful, must-see film on a multitude of levels. The movie seamlessly educates, inspires and shocks audiences with knowledge, faith and unfiltered images. It unapologetically documents the importance church played in American society at one of our nation's most trying times. The film denotes the vital importance religion played in spawning renewed support from all regions the country, particularly white church goers and religious leaders. No religious spirit and kind heart was touched more so by the outpouring of followers than Martin Luther King, Jr.Director Ava DuVernay's brightest achievement in \"Selma\" is the palpable intensity felt, heard and seen by moviegoers as the film marches along. \"Selma\" justifiably depicts the deadly and graphic violence which took place against blacks in the 1960s. The multiple illustrations of inhuman treatment are necessary in this movie to fully understand the ruthlessness of so many...for so long. In contrast, and perhaps more importantly, we can see and appreciate Martin Luther King's remarkable kindness towards humanity and strong conviction that peaceful protests should remain non-violent despite sustained cruelty by others.The film's most endearing quality is the growth found in the main character over its 2-hour span. We find Dr. Martin Luther King's fortitude comes primarily from three sources-faith in his religion, support from the people, and resolve from his wife Coretta Scott King. As King gains strength from each of these pillars in his life, he's able to handle confrontations and setbacks dealt from Washington DC, Alabama whites, and even some black militants-all attempting to derail his organization's movement. It's impressive in \"Selma\" to see Dr. King gain influence and power from his church podium, leading a march across an Alabama bridge, or challenge a U.S. president and its citizens into action. Aside from the obvious bond to his faith, this movie sheds light on the momentous part Coretta Scott King played in her husband's life and his Civil Rights successes.\"Selma\" is more than just a film about eliminating barriers to black voters. It's a movement about one man's place in our history--going from spiritual leader to national preacher. With steadfast determination and non-violent tactics, Dr. King used the church to gain momentum for his march between the cities of Selma and Montgomery, Alabama. In comparison to the harsh treatment from the white establishment, Martin Luther King Jr. and his non-violent ways convinced many religious organizations and whites to ultimately join his cause. The most influential of those who came around to accept Dr. King's hastened timeline, and later signed the Voter Rights Act of 1965, was the President of the United States at the time, Lyndon B. Johnson. After almost 200 years, the voices and votes of those who'd suffered the most over that period were now going to be heard and counted--finally. That's the grateful tribute of \"Selma\" to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his peaceful, non-violent means to achieve a justified end...and the real reason to see this exceptional, historic story.Grade: A",

The fact than anyone thought that performing Mistral shows where people in Blackface is the main attraction, and the merciless, careless beating and wounding, and even barbaric killing of black people was in even considered an OK thing to do, let along legal in the United States! What Martin Luther King, Jr. did was absolutely extraordinary, and should never be left to die out.As I've stated, an absolutely fantastic, immaculate picture that does every movie of this nature is supposed to do.

I probably should catch up on my contemporary American history as I know it's not only important but we seem to be regressing to problems that were solved over 50 years ago. Selma is a well acted, well written and overall strong movie. It's a bit slow at times and there are too many meandering subplots. At times it's a bit hard to follow and the immensity of characters is imposing. Half the time I was asking myself who was important and who was just a role character. This is the kind of movie critics love and much like Lincoln, I would not be surprised if it gets plenty of awards. The acting is really good and the brutality it portrays is mind boggling. It is embarrassing to think that many of these events happened a few years before my birth.While Selma is a very good movie it's not great. I think the pace is slow and there could be a bit more focus. However, this is a film that should be watched and appreciated, in particular given the current political climate.",

I was not alive during this era and I had always heard of the march from Selma Alabama to Montgomery as nothing more than a mere blurb in the history books. I had no idea how much went into this march or the personal struggles that Dr. King went through when deciding to lead it. Also liked how they were able to do this movie without being too sexual or gory which seems to be a common theme in many films today. I have no doubt that one day this will be a standard film shown in American history classes throughout our nation",

    "review": "  Now I can see why everyone hates Alabama this much. I mean gawd damn these southern white people are some vicious assholes. So we are hardly two weeks into 2015 and already I found myself a film that is worthy of a Top 10 spot for this year with something that literally took me by surprise. Normally January is the time of month where Hollywood throws out a series of bad movies that no one either cares about or dislikes because they are, more or less, like filler as we wait to see what the Summer blockbuster films have in store. However in this rare case, everyone around the internet has been praising this film about as loudly as the King himself when he would give his speech or sermon. So I walked in with an open mind about it and came out making me hate racist white Southerners even more than I normally do. Thanks movie! So any who, this film is based on the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches led by James Bevel, Hosea Williams, and Martin Luther King, Jr. of SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC. Don't know what those acronyms mean? Well Google it, because I'm sure you will find the answers there. So this civil march was a defining moment in US history as this allowed the desire of black American citizens to exercise their constitutional right to vote, in defiance of segregationist repression. In the heart of Alabama back in this point in 1965, a lot of African-Americans were unable to vote because a majority of its people who ran this state were racist white people. So with the help of Martin Luther King Jr., and many others, led a 54 mile march from Selma to Montgomery in order to make their point across the entire nation that every race had a right, not only to vote, but also not be harassed no matter where they go or where they live. I think that's about it. Anyway, let's march on to what I thought about this film.If you are watching this for the first time, let me tell you that the first five minutes of this movie WILL take you by surprise. What I like about this movie is that this takes place on a certain event in Martian Luther King Jr's life, and not depicting his entire life like from beginning to end like in some films like Lee Daniels: The Butler. Not that it is a bad thing, but those kind of movies tend to drag out from time to time. However not this movie, because it is one powerful looking film. This movie had hard tactics which had not only protests but negotiation and strategy to go along with it. The main actor who plays Martin Luther King Jr. in here, David Oyelowo, really may not look like MLK that much but I think he does a great job portraying him without doing an impression. I was happy that he did not go down that route because you really don't want your legendary civil rights leader sounding like an impression like other comedians have done in the past. You felt the emotion behind his performance along with many other actors that were in here. Tom Wilkinson did a fantastic job as Lyndon B. Johnson as well even though this actor is British, however he does put together some great dialogue in a lot of scenes. As for the worst parts in this movie, well...define \"Worst\" because my definition for worse in this film would be for anyone that is not white if they watched this in theaters. The brutality in this movie captured all of it a little too well. You see both whites and blacks from men, women, and children being beaten and murdered with no justice behind it and the president is treating this like it's just another day in the South. When I say that the brutality is filmed too well, I mean that you really do feel emotional when you watch those horrific scenes. I hunkered down into my seat hoping no black people would get angry and start cursing me out. Overall, this movie is one for the ages with every single actor being absolutely superb, capturing both the emotions & passion from these real life people, and showing the pure brutality that went on back in those days made you really feel for them and their hardships that they went through to get what they want in the end. Easily a...four and a half star movie if I ever saw one.",

    "review": "  Recently, I've overheard quite a few people comment on how they believe Hollywood is over \"the black thing.\" I was never quite sure what that meant, but I assumed it means people think Hollywood has seen enough movies revolving around race-related stories. Of course, \"12 Years a Slave\" won Best Picture last year, and maybe that's what the people I overheard were referring to. But let me ask this: How many films are there about Martin Luther King, Jr.? Can you think of one? Now, think about Abraham Lincoln. How many times has he been portrayed in film? Two years ago we had two movies about Alfred Hitchcock. And how many times has Richard Nixon been portrayed on film? And what about... you know what, you get the idea. If there's one thing to consider before watching \"Selma,\" it's this: \"Selma,\" directed by Ava DuVernay, is not a movie about Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It's about what happened in Selma, Alabama in 1964 (with Dr. King at its epicenter). The story of \"Selma\" is bigger than Dr. King, and I think he'd be proud of that. David Oyelowo portrays Dr. King as being tired - tired of fighting the same fight, and continuing to lose that fight despite gaining tiny bits of ground. Oyelowo plays Dr. King as human - with flaws, hopes, dreams, and determination. This is one of the greatest performances this year. And I think \"the black thing\" will be over when we finally judge movies and performances not by the color of their actors, but by the performances themselves. I could continue writing and praising the film and its script, direction, performances, production, but I think the film speaks loudly - and proudly - for itself. This is a movie every American should see. So, instead of continuing to write here, I'd rather challenge you to complete this sentence: I have a dream...",

    "review": "  Powerful, important, and above all else, a very good movie that doesn't get super preachy.Much like how Lincoln focused mainly on Lincoln's attempt to pass the 13th Amendment, this film focuses primarily on the period before and after events in Selma in the 1960s, where beatings of African-Americans were shown on the news to almost all of America. Also like Lincoln, the film spends a lot of time on the wheeling and dealing behind the scenes. It's not exactly an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object, but that's not too far off the mark.David Oyelowo plays Martin Luther King Jr, and does so with all the fire and brimstone one would expect, but also a little political savvy as well. He gives a very good performance, is never portrayed as Godlike or perfect, in fact, he's given a few rather human moments as well. The second best performance belongs to Tom Wilkinson, portraying Lyndon Johnson. Wilkinson gets Johnson perfectly right down to his crass vocabulary and \"zero fucks given\" attitude (LBJ was known for being intimidating during meetings and even holding some while he was sitting on the toilet), but also portrays him as a man with his hands tied in a very good scene where he says while King has one problem, he has 100.There are many other actors who get there chance to shine. This is a very ensemble like movie, but it's also very well-written, giving each side a good look at what is going on from their perspective. Does it show injustice and talk about the struggle African-Americans face? Absolutely, but it never gets too preachy or too in your face. It's worth checking out for a good look at a very chaotic period in American history.",

Yes, Oyelowo's performance as King shines through, even if it occasionally descends into the realm of caricature, but the screenplay undoes him at every term, unable to decide whether or not to focus on King the man or the events at Selma proper. It settles instead for a bizarre mixture of overwrought family drama, gratuitous violence, and ham-fisted political commentary, and none of it works at all. Though it has a handful of profoundly affecting moments, the vast majority of the film feels like it was written with a pen that somebody accidentally dropped into a sugar bowl. Characters constantly pander to the audience, speaking as if they know the future and generally behaving like the pawns of a writer more interested in scoring political points than writing believable dialogue. All-in-all, the film is the very definition of Oscar-bait: a safe, broadly-drawn drama that reveals exactly as much as a reading of the SCLC's Wikipedia page would, provided it was set to a stirring score.",

    "review": "  Unlike his contemporary -- and occasional opposition -- Malcolm X, whose legacy as a controversial Brother of Islam and Civil Rights leader provided fertile ground for Spike Lee to create his monumental and epic 1992 biopic, one of the genre's very best offerings, Martin Luther King Jr. hasn't seen the silver screen nearly as much, if not at all (save the 2001 HBO telefilm BOYCOTT with Jeffrey Wright). Since King's assassination in 1968, he's become more of a monument than a man -- his name serving as a holiday and providing the perfect introduction into the topic of civil rights for learning kids and adults. Making a film about this tremendous man that holds true to his legacy, but still encapsulates his human frailties, is a dangerous territory for any filmmaker, one that hardly guarantees any success at all. Credit should be given then to Ava DuVernay, who rightfully accepted this dubious challenge and has successfully captured a version of King's life and put it onto film. Honestly, SELMA is hardly the definitive film of King, focusing rather on several weeks in the life of the man, as Spielberg's LINCOLN did, rather than portraying his entire life, like Lee's MALCOLM X. It's also not the precise cure to the now common biopic either. It is, however, a refreshing and intense collection of gripping performances, inspiring power, and beautiful cinematography. DuVernay condenses some years of importance into one-sided expository dialogue exchanges that are used to either skim over some historical happenings or provide other points-of-view, but it sort of works here. DuVernay seems to understand King best when he's at the podium, and she uses these scenes to their full advantage, but there are smaller scenes that calculate the man as well. These sequences -- going back and forth between the public and private Martin Luther King -- are made even more resonant by David Oyelowo's incredible performance, a performance that I might just call the best of the year, maybe tying with Michael Keaton's work in BIRDMAN and Jake Gyllenhaal's in NIGHTCRAWLER. So, although Selma isn't necessarily the complete portrait of King that others were clamoring for, it still prospers in that this is a film about a man whose guidance and teachings are needed to be heard more than ever. In the awkward, tragic aftershock of the situation in Ferguson, racial tension is at a high that hasn't been seen since perhaps just the era this film focuses on. This movie is important. It's peaceful, yet inspiring and powerful voice can be heard through its echoing cries into the microphone of the great MLK and can be seen through its beautiful color palette, steeped in the warm, milky tones of the 60s. This is a gorgeous looking film that begs and deserves to be seen by everyone who cares to listen to its peaceful protest.",

There is no comparison to Selma or the desired right to vote that should be given every American. The (Only) Black Lives Matter movement really isn't marching for the rights of every citizen, as its martyr is really an anti-citizen. Moreover, the movement is advancing racism and the rights of a select ethnicity, which one could perhaps also say of MLK, though he by all means appears more a martyr than does Mike Brown or any of the other criminals that have been elevated to special status above all other citizens. This travesty has only been reinforced by Obama in his pandering elevation of African American criminals as though they could somehow also be his sons, while an elder white war hero, 88-year-old Delbert Belton, who quite literally could have been his grandfather, was beaten and murdered by African American thugs.",

It's a smart film, with strong dialogues and a message of hope, pride and dignity crucial for times. The fight our ancestors drove to eradicate segregation and racism is still much needed today and once in a while a film such as Selma comes to remind us that a lot has been done but more, so much more need to be done to end the racial hatred still unfortunately present in our modern society.",

David Oyelowo is brilliant depicting MLK, not physically looking like him but capturing his mannerisms & passion with precision, especially in his numerous speeches throughout the film. He gets able support around him, particularly Tom Wilkinson as LBJ & Tim Roth as George Wallace, who manages to bring some humanity to the former racist Democratic governor. Behind the camera, DuVernay gives a nice behind the scenes view of how the events formed, displaying King not only as a passionate civil rights activist but a cagey politician who selected Selma for a specific reason. The film also doesn't gloss over King, depicting him as a human being with real flaws, including a particular infamous one. Overall, one of the finest dramas of 2014 and sure to be seen throughout the award season.",

    "review": "  This movie isn't like every \"black\" history movie. To me it has soul and heart in it. Movies like 42 I didn't enjoy because it was too sappy and overdue on mean people on the white side. I understand that this was our world and a lot of white people were bad. Though like Selma, it shows us that there are people in the world that are good. That whites and blacks can come together and make peace. This also had great casting, David is fantastic as MLK and really shows how powerful of a man he was. Also how humane the great man was. This also doesn't force too much on the violence itself or has parts of boredom. It treats us with accurate and fair accounts of Selma Alabama and the troubles of what they went through. I would have liked a broader stroke of what MLK did and not just of one city. The ending seemed to be rushed. Though I'm glad they didn't just end it with MLK speech. That would have been cliche and boring. To me it paints a portrait of what real cinema should focus on. Not this over analyzed ideas of \"black vs. whites\" or scenes after scenes of brutality. Also of over abundance emotion that sucks the life out of the scene. Emotion is good and this movie does its share of its. Though it sticks to action and a certain code. Telling the story as well and as straight forward as possible. No fluff, no boundaries, and nothing that would distract from the story itself. It shows us that there are movies out there that can produce great cinema. Overall the story is great and the performances were the best part. 9.3Also, I love stylistic movies and this was a perfect example of a great stylistic movie.",

Malcolm X's influence on Dr. King's movement was mentioned then left out of the conversation thereafter, as well as the first tentative displays of respect between the marchers and the State police when Dr. King refused to continue his second march after the troopers withdrew were ignored in the film.

Though this is not a biography of Martin Luther King, the role he plays, it does show the man with all his strengths and many of his weaknesses. King did not plan or organize the marches the film centers on but took the lead when they happened.The film centers around 3 marches that took place in Alabama to protest the discriminatory practices that took place to stop black people from going to the polls though they did have the right to vote. The 54 mile march was to go from the town of Selma to Montgomery, the capitol of Alabama, to confront the Governor, George Wallace, played by Tim Roth.The facts of the marches were recorded and though they are the center of the film the screenplay by Paul Webb concentrates of real human beings, famous or not, who were involved. Those who lived through those violent and history making days will have their memories refreshed of what did happen and along the way learn things that took place unbeknown to them.There are some concerns about how the film portrays President Lyndon B. Johnson, played by Tom Wilkinson, showing him in private talks with Dr. King and between the President and Governor Wallace. This is a Hollywood story and there are no witnesses to the discussions that took place so depending on your thoughts you may feel one way or the other but by turning the light on individuals this becomes many personal stories.The 3 protest marches took place in March, 1967. The first ended when the State troopers and county policeman attacked the 500 marchers with billy clubs and using tear gas. A picture of Amelia Boynton, played by Lorraine Toussaint, beaten unconscious and laying on the ground, was shown all over the world with other pictures of violence, which had also been televised, with that day becoming known as 'bloody Sunday'. You may not know or remember what took place at the other 2 marches but you will see that in the film.By its nature \"Selma\" is a violent film, though none of the scenes are gratuitous, and shows just enough to make a point without turning the audience off. One of the minor faults of the film is that except for the violence that took place there is very little heft in the drama that took place away from the marches which may have been what the director wanted.The acting, minor and major roles, is of the first order whether it be Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, Andre Holland as Andrew Young, Dylan Baker as J. Edgar Hoover, Stephen Root as Al Lingo along with Trai Byers, Stephan James, Cuban Gooding, Jr., just to mention a few. Oprah Winfrey as Annie Lee Cooper blends in as one of the crowd and, like them, is her character and not star.Though this film belongs to David Oyelowo, the director Ava DuVernay owns every shot, showing what needs to be shown without overdoing it. The scenes of the dyed in the wool racism shown by Wallace, local police, white citizens of Alabama are true to life and not 'stacked' in anyone's favor. There is talk that she may become the first black female director nominated for an Oscar and it is certainly worth that recognition.\"Selma\" can be seen as a 'history lesson' but it is more of a reminder of America's past and also can be related to America's present.",

    "review": "  It amazes me that anyone would give this movie less than 5 stars; especiallly critics. Perhaps that in itself is suggestive that the true race relations struggle still persists. For all accounts - and on the merits of fine film making, riveting historical accounts and superb acting - this film is one of the most important and beautiful art pieces of our time. This is the first feature film ever made about the monumental and life altering events at Selma that set the course for historic legislation. While telling that story we are privileged to peek into the more human, more fallible life of Dr. King, his family and his most trusted advisors and fellow freedom fighters. Striking the balance between these realities is certainly not easy, but DuVernay is brilliant and the cast is extraordinary. Something I hope is not lost on any audience member is the question of what do we want our own legacy to be. If people missed this core tenant from the film, they were not paying close enough attention.",

The director made some odd choices also; she devotes almost four minutes to a conversation between King and a father whose son was killed by cops and totally ignores any of Malcolm X's talk with a black Selma church congregation. I would have thought that the effort by America's most notorious black militant to reach out to King' pacific movement would have been worth a few words at least. Her attempt to introduce Hoover and LBJ's evil machinations seems scattershot also, at the price of diluting the passions and emotions generated by the march from Selma to Montgomery. The movie is getting a lot of praise and hype more for the subject than quality, I suspect.",

The movie is not for you if you want to hide from the world and deny that there's an \"issue\" and that there has been an \"issue\" for our whole history. The movie IS for you if you want to be ignorant because . . . well, you should not be. Pure and simple. The movie is spectacularly acted and wonderfully directed. It goes places that you wouldn't expect and is about King's struggle within himself, as well as the movement and, of course, the march from Selma. It's painfully sad to see so many parallels between what happened 40 years and today . . . and I hate that what was fought for with so much blood, sweat, tears and death so many years ago has not been won. But this movie will force us to look in the mirror, as well as at our history, and perhaps film/art will bring discussions of race and a new civil rights movement back to the forefront. One can only hope. I know that I will be having my own conversations.",

It's always better late than to never see these kind of movies at the beginning of the new year where they already had a limited release in US last year. As I sat through this film, I felt that the actors are not acting here, they all portrayed exceptionally well without any imitations or mimickery. I also felt that the direction of the film is without any doubt a docudrama feel and at the same time true to its facts and lets the audiences know how it is to live back in the 60s being discriminated and prejudiced as the film shows here, even white folks area also being abused. This actually doesn't have an ending to it, this country still faces the prejudicial and segregation that people faced 50 years ago, and the people in the White House try their best to stop and end this, even the president is now African-American and still doesn't change a thing to it. I haven't even mention if this movie would be a top contender for this coming Oscars this year, I'm pretty sure it is, and sure to be as well a top choice to win Best Picture along with other films like Boyhood and Birdman, also two great American movies. US history teachers should see this movie, not also them, but also all Americans and every other citizens in this country who feel that they are being treated unequal and inhuman, go support this movie!",

This isn't a trivial point because the tension between the two is a key source of drama in the movie. Additionally, Selma had a certain tendency to rely on King speaking to add dramatic effect, rather than the actual events, which is ironic because the speeches made weren't even King's to begin with.

    "review": "  Selma feels more like a civil rights film than a Martin Luther King film. It takes us on a journey with the activists of the movement, and makes us understand what it means to be a part of it all. With this portrait of the civil rights era, DuVernay is concerned with stirring our emotions during stunningly well-made scenes of brutality and giving us the feeling of being among these people. There are many vehicles through which we witness the movement and they create a whole that is detailed with the many personal and societal values that the movement embodied. Of course, the main attraction here looks to be MLK, and yet it doesn't quite feel like that is the best attraction. Oyelowo is great as King, physically and emotionally he seems to embody the man who we've heard so much about but have never seen up close. His portrayal is all about the up-close. While Oyelowo's portrayal of King is magnificent, the film doesn't put him at the center of our focus and we don't really get inside of his head. Instead there are an abundance of supporting players that give us the experience of the movement, but at the expense of what could have been a truly great character study. For sure, we get moments where King grapples with his responsibilities and flaws, moments that I appreciated, but it's muted by the feeling of the movement and the weight of characters around him.  Selma is at its most successful when it goes big and broad, speaking for MLK's movement and appealing to the emotions of those involved. Scenes like the one on the bridge are phenomenal, and some of the most riveting and emotionally stirring moments that I've seen on screen all year. While DuVernay's style didn't work for me all the time, it is during these scenes where everything was absolutely perfect, and her talent glows. The film attaches itself to the humanity and emotion of these moments through DuVernay's rushing camera and some sharp editing and cinematography. DuVernay attaches us to many different characters throughout, all of whom feel unified by the motivation of the movement, allowing the switch of perspective to not only feel appropriate, but to highlight the unity that the activists felt towards one other. We get close to just about everybody: the activists, the historical figures, the opposers, the political figures. A sense of the entirely of the era is established, but in return the film doesn't dig in deeply as I would have liked it to into one area or one character. It speaks very well for the history but less well for the individuals. The cinematography from the talented Bradford Young always looks nice and when the movie is at its best, it's fantastic, but it sometimes felt unmotivated. There are a lot of lens flares and glows that don't seem to do anything for the film itself. The colors are great though, and overall it succeeds in capturing the feel of the time. I felt the same about the editing, where in talky scenes the choices feel random and overcomplicated, but in most scenes it's very affective in juggling the abundance of characters and letting the emotions speak. Like the movie as a whole, these elements work much better, in fact extremely well, in scenes that capture a lot of action and tension, and less in intimate character moments.  For all the criticism I sound like I'm giving the movie, yes, it could have been better, but what it does well it does WELL. In movies where the general consensus is above my opinion I'm more wordy with my dislikes. Selma does a lot, and overall it speaks deeply and intelligently for the civil rights movement, and it's well worth seeing for that. In the brief moment that this film captures, it says a lot about what it means to fight for one's rights. And boy is it timely right now. You can't watch the film and not think about the marches that have been going on recently, and the movie speaks very well for those, too. Unfortunately what keeps this movie from being great for me is the lack of memorable character moments from King and others.",

    "review": "  Best movie of the year. Fantastic. Nuanced, intelligent, and extremely powerful. I cried through most of it simply because of the sheer overwhelming powerful emotions that emanated from inside watching the strength and courage of the people involved in these marches. David Oyelowo is brilliant as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr displaying his eloquence, strength and thoughtful approach to what he was working to accomplish. I was so ashamed of my country watching this. These events did not occur that long ago and they are inexcusable. And, now we see some people trying to put restrictions on voting rights again now, in our day - we are treading dangerous waters here. How far is too far. Watch Selma and consider carefully where we are headed. Okay - rant over on current events. As a film, this is just so excellent. I was in an audience with mostly African-American women who had lived during the time of these events and we all agreed that high school history teachers should have their students watch this and then discuss. There have been some issues with how President Johnson was portrayed in this because he was in favor of Civil Rights, although the movie indicates his hesitancy regarding King's movement. Johnson was, truly, in favor of Civil Rights, he was just trying to focus on poverty issues rather than voting rights, not fully understanding the necessity of how voting rights were intertwined so intimately with poverty issues. Hats off to Ava DuVernay who directed this with the perfect touch, fantastic shots, appropriate indications of the violence faced by the protestors without it being too graphic for viewers so that viewers could truly see the brutality without having to turn away from it - unlike some directors who might have used shots of gratuitous violence simply because that is how they direct. Carmen Ejogo was stunning as strong, yet understandably frightened for her family, Coretta Scott King. Oprah Winfrey portrays a woman who persists in efforts to vote, although you can clearly see the hopelessness on her face, in her posture, yet she doesn't give up. But, of course, Oprah is always wonderful. To sum up for Oscar purposes, which is what my little entertainment world revolves around, PLEASE nominations (and I'm saying wins) for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Leading Actor. That is my call at this time, though I have yet to see some of the other contenders out there, but I don't see those three choices changing. Pure excellence.",

David Oyelowo gives a career making performance that's easily one of the best performances of the year. His performance soars every time he gives a speech, just like the real Martin Luther King. Ava Duvernay succeeds at delivering the urgency and the tension that the era that the movie takes place in had with a terrific pace and a confident style, and showcased how charismatic, bold, and even flawed King was, in a very relatable manner.",

It forgoes the hagiographic content of other historical films, and instead finds it's emotional edge through depicting harrowing events, and raw human emotion. Lifted by an all-star cast (and I don't use that term lightly) Selma is clearly one of the best Oscar hopefuls this season, and it couldn't have been released in theater at a better time too.",
