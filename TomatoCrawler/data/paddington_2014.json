    "review": "  In a lot of ways, Paddington is the epitome of the PG family-feel-good genre. Despite a very basic plot and several familiar archetypes following tried and true formulas its never a dull affair.Through masterful direction, an exceedingly clever script, imaginative set pieces and a colorful cast it quickly unravels as an undeniably entertaining experience. But it's more than that, it's friendly and wholesome without being overly sentimental. It's childish, without treating it's viewers like children. Paddington simply wins you over with smiles, laughs, warmth and ultimately, a whole lot of wit.",

    "review": "  Not having grew up with the original children's television show, I went into this film with fresh eyes, and I must say, you definitely do not have to be familiar with this story to enjoy it. Out of nowhere we receive a January film that jumps right from the screen and puts a smile on your face. Once a bear loses his father and is abandoned by his mother, he but fend for himself and find a new home in London. Meeting a family whom he begins to love, this picture deals with family loves and hardships throughout, while still managing to keep a consistently humorous tone. I must say, for most of this film, I was loving every second, until Nicole Kidman \"kidded\" it up a bit too much. She was fun to watch in the film, but her storyline felt the most tired and boring. Overall, \"Paddington\" is probably the best January film you will see this month and I highly recommend it. What a pleasant surprise!",

When his home in Peru is destroyed a young bear cub is sent to London to find a new home, and is taken in by a human family. Unfortunately the writing is rather poor, and relies mostly on stereotypes and clich�s. And the comedy is pretty rote; using a lot of standard jokes and slapstick gags. However, Paddington isn't bad really; it just uninspired and settles for being a formulaic family comedy.",

    "review": "  A kindly and laugh-filled bear hug of fun family entertainment, this British production Pads a classic children's book with a generous amount of mirth, merriment, and - yes - marmalade--just not to excess. In fact, the movie gets just about everything very right, serving the storied stories for all-ages exceedingly well. Notice the words \"all-ages,\" as this is something that the movie gets right as well. From script to cast to CGI execution, this bear boasts a bite that kids AND adults will enjoy.In this PG-rated family flick, a family befriends a talking bear (voice of Ben Whishaw) at a London train station. Oh, it assumes a lot of the same attributes that plague other half-animated kid flicks...only doesn't lose its stuffing as a result. Perhaps, the production learned what NOT to do from three failed attempt at achieving the warm 'n' fuzzies. Like Alvin & the Chipmunks and The Smurfs, it uses some juvenile potty humor but - unlike them - not to the same overbearingly sickening degree (save for one scene involving toothbrushes and ear wax...ew). For the most part, Paddington keeps it classy. Like Beverly Hills Chihuahua and Marmaduke, it uses celebrity pipes and celebrity live action performances but - unlike them - not just as gratuitous sales-over-substance selling points. Rather, Paddington's beautifully chosen talent roster services the characters letter perfectly (especially Nicole Kidman playing up the big bad to a delicious degree). Like Garfield and Yogi Bear, it keeps the action modern but - unlike them - never roots itself in disposable pop culture references. Instead, Paddington assumes a classic feel, successfully positioning itself for longevity (they even recast Ben Winshaw as Paddington after Colin Firth reportedly wasn't working in the roll, which shows its dedication to quality--not marquee quantity). A lot of the credit goes to producer David Heyman, who likewise shepherded the Harry Potter series to a beloved status in moviegoers' hearts.Bottom line: Bear Neccesity",

    "review": "  Lovely film that is touching and also at times very funny. It has something for youngsters and adults alike with some good action sequences.Paddington is forced to flee his home in Peru after what is probably the result of deforestation. A relative puts him on a boat to London after a visit many decades before from a British explorer who regaled them with stories of how welcoming and friendly it was. Upon his arrival he discovers that life in a big city can be distant and cold. That's until he meets the Browns who whilst suspicious of him in the beginning learn to accept him as a part of the family. I'm of an age and nationality that grew up with Paddington Bear and have always been a fan. This film certainly does it justice but I don't think that you have to be aware of the series to enjoy it. The cast is very good and I'm beginning to like Sally Hawkins in almost everything she turns her hand to. It has a good villain in Nicole Kidman (obvious comparisons to Cruella deVille) but one minor criticism is that I didn't think that there was enough of her.",

When the movie started, it reinforced my doubts about it being a good movie, but as soon as he gets to London (which doesn't take long, it just feels like it), Paddington takes off. They kept the run-time short and used an entertaining cast to keep me involved in the movie.",

The London in the film isn't the one I'm familiar with but that's not surprising as it's made by the same team that made Harry Potter so the film has the same sheen. Bonneville is great as Mr Brown and is ably supported by Hawkins as his kooky spouse. The only sour note comes from Kidman as Paddington's nemesis and her story seems at odds with the charm of the rest of the film. Besides that I think Paddington is a bit of a triumph and I wouldn't be surprised to see a sequel in the pipeline soon.",

He journeys to the United Kingdom in search of an explorer and finds himself in all sorts of comic misadventures. His adopted family does their best to keep the troublesome young bear at ease as they search for him to have a new family. If things were not bad enough, a villain (Nicole Kidman) is out to have him killed and stuffed. Paddington was excellent, and he was designed perfectly. The comic mishaps and film is without a doubt enjoyable for all ages and I highly recommend this film.",

At least, it wouldn't be garbage. AND BOYYYY was I right!If you're an asshole, don't go see this movie. You probably don't want to anyways. And good on you for being honest with yourself. But seriously, if you have an appreciation for really good characterization, lighthearted and silly humor, a little adventure, and some pretty quality bear animation you've gotta check this movie out. The theater I saw it in was packed with parent and their kids, and it was just really great sitting and watching with kids who were thoroughly enjoying themselves, and I was too! the movie is really quaint and doesn't pull it's punches. there's humor snuck in here and there all throughout and it's good for kids and adults. the cinematography wasn't your pretentious beautiful film ala a PTA film or other 'good' movie but it was still interesting and told a really unique story - a story of a Darkest Peruvian bear forced to head off to London and look for a home, all while avoiding being stuffed for the Natural History Museum. the real strength lies in Paddington's animation: his face is so humanly effectual, but also characteristically stoic at times. it really is something.if you find the time, go give it a chance! you'll have fun! it's cute and nice and filled with marmalade!",

Most of the gags were things like watching the bear get tangled up in sticky tape or misusing a toothbrush as an ear cleaner. Perfectly funny to a kid, but too simple for adults.For what it was though, it was oddly enjoyable. There was enough of a character arch in the family for you to actually care to see how it ended. And the villain (a taxidermist who wanted to stuff Paddington) was actually kinda evil, which made it all the more interesting. It's short and sweet (90 mins).

    "review": "  Paddington, a small little Peruvian bear with a big heart and an extremely fuzzy face. Paddington the movie is the big screen film all about well Paddington the bear whose quest to live in London is both heart warming and pretty funny, I do though find some parts of this not that great. Featuring a cast with the likes of Hugh Bonneville, Nicole Kidman and Julie Walters the film you would think and many do that this is a great old romp and one for the ages, for all ages yes very true but I did feel this a little basic, don't get me wrong it is perfectly OK and I would recommend it but I still expected more from a movie with such high praise.Basically Paddington is a bear going to seek a home in London because his auntie told him to; we then follow him as he becomes a stowaway on a long trip to stereotypically rainy London where he comes across a family of various personalities. Hugh Bonneville's character Henry Brown is the dad and is very stuck up, works in risk assessment and his work follows him everywhere he goes. The mum Mary (Sally Hawkins) is really quite free and not like her husband at all for that matter, she is really the one who welcomes Paddington with open arms. We then have the children Judy and Jonathan with Judy being a teenager completely embarrassed by her family and not exactly happy by the furry arrival.Paul King directs and brings a very fast tone, the movie speeds along like a bullet and every scene seems to suddenly become an adventure in itself. I think a lot of the things I did like about this come from the writing also from King, it is funny and every joke is set up in a way that not only the kids will laugh at. On that previous point I think one massive part of the appeal of this movie is the point that this is for adults too and charming and humorous enough to be enjoyed truly by all the family. Like I said at the beginning this movie does feel pretty basic, I mean the story plays out pretty normally, the main characters all go in the exact direction you'd predict, but I think what made people like this was the heart to it. This is one movie where I think the trailer truly made peoples expectations a lot lower so when they came round to watching it they found it a pleasant surprise. Now don't get me wrong it is fun all the way through but still I feel this nowhere near as excellent as some proclaim, but take nothing away from it, this is still a satisfactory experience.Overall Paddington is a movie I would say go and watch, and if you have kids then even more so because not only you might enjoy it but the young one's will too. I also want to add some more on the acting, basically from a concluding point Peter Capaldi is the best of the cast in his role as the always complaining Mr Curry, Nicole Kidman is not good in her role as Millicent the museum taxidermist, she felt too dull in her role and very atypical of the kind of character she is playing, I'm not saying she is completely to blame, the character is just not a good one.",

A few decades later the bears' home is destroyed and the child of the bears goes to London to find the explorer...Wonderful movie, suitable for all ages. Decent plot that, unlike many children's stories, isn't random or full of holes. Very funny too - has many laugh-out-loud moments. There's an English quirkiness and whimsicalness that carries the whole movie and provides many of the best comedic moments.Great performances by an all-star cast: Sally Hawkins, Hugh Bonneville, Peter Capaldi (of The Thick of It fame - here he is in a rare non-swearing role...), Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters. Ben Wishaw is great as the voice of Paddington as are Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon as his (bear) parents. Nicole Kidman is convincing as the villain. Even the minor parts include some big names: Matt Lucas (of Little Britain fame) appears as a cabbie and Kayvan Novak (Facejacker) also has a small part.A great movie and not just for children.",

    "review": "  Well, when you sign up for a movie with a bear, you usually know what you expect to see. It was all that and even more. We did not see it with kids or for them, but it is a movie that will be enjoyed more by people less than 10-12 years of age. Apart from that, it was nicely done with nice scenery and nice photography altogether. Acting was really really decent from the entire crew and the addition of Nicole Kidman really helped the movie a lot. Although we did not expect it, although we knew that the bear was \"fake\", we laughed a lot and it also reminded us of expressions that our dogs do. I think it was kind of purposeful from the movie- makers, which was brilliant thinking actually. If you want to spend a couple of relaxed hours watching a family movie that will bring some laughs along the way, Paddington is the choice you should make.",

For every kids' film clich� there are several good jokes to more than compensate and the eponymous hero's sense of fun and adventure carries the day. Roll on the sequels.",

It was, quite possibly, the first cinema film that my four year old did not grow bored of and fidget through. We were all captivated.Paddington has always been a well-loved tale, and we all grow a bit anxious when our beloved treasures are given a make-over. Sometimes these new adaptations fall unbearably flat (Garfield in CGI upon the silver-screen comes o mind); but just once in awhile, the film studios get it right, and a little bit of magic is created.The Paddington film is magic. It's the perfect blend of comedy and seriousness. It's fun, it's heartwarming. It has Hugh Bonneville and an adorable CGI bear with the most perfect voice. Sure, Nicole Kidman is a vicious, lunatic taxidermist, but there had to be some form of mischief and mayhem to conjure up suspense.We loved \"Paddington\" so much that we gave him a permanent home on our family film shelf. Along with \"The Lego Movie\", it's one I would have bought even if I didn't have kids.",

    "review": "  As a fan of the Paddington books and the uniquely animated television series in the 1970s and 80s (Paddington was a stop-motion puppet while he interacted with drawings of the other characters), I should have been the target audience for this film, along with my children, assuming I had any young enough to be interested in the film. The days I spent watching Paddington on \"Calliope,\" which, in turn, made me want to send the show a letter and my picture, which they aired, are sweet childhood memories I have. So to say I was excited about this film is an understatement. While the trailers made the movie look awful, it does redeem itself a bit by retaining some of the serious tone of its original content, which I always loved. However, for the most part, this is a remake of \"Stuart Little\" in the vein of \"Home Alone,\" and thus, ridiculous for Paddington fans. Yes, Paddington always had misadventures, but the idea of a villainous character, played by Nicole Kidman, being a part of the misadventures just loses the magic for me. Paddington still comes across as a child-like bear who makes honest child-like mistakes, I simply cannot shake the dumb villain element. Maybe this element was needed to create a movie-length story, but that's why it was so hard to tell a story of Paddington in film and why it's taken so long to do so.",

    "review": "  This is a great, warm-hearted, laugh-out-loud comedy which brings to the big screen the story of one of the most charming of childhood characters. Paddington, the little bear from darkest Peru, found at a railway station is such an adorable character with his hat and duffle coat and obsession with marmalade sandwiches. In the past, he's been seen in books, comic strips and a much loved TV series and quite why it has taken so long for him to have his very own movie is a bit of a mystery. The track record of such characters in the cinema is not good with many being poorly served in the past. I'm pleased to say that Paul King has managed to update the setting and yet retain the magic. Paddington was always a gentle soul, polite and innocent who got into scrapes and mischief through trying to be good and do the right thing. This aspect has been retained and the result is delightful. Nicole Kidman is given the role of a somewhat unhinged taxidermist, bent on stuffing our hero for an exhibit at the Natural History Museum. I wasn't sure about the need for this aspect of the plot at first but it does actually work well and provides some of the movie's stand out comedy moments. However, the realisation of the little bear is the thing that really impresses. The interaction between him and others in the cast, notably Hugh Bonneville is simply brilliant and what we end up with is a delightful movie that will entertain people of all ages whether the character is new to them or not.",

It is a family film that will make the adults feel again like children because of the mixture of innocent and dubious humor. One of the reasons as to why the film is so well received is because of the way it respects the intelligence of its audience. Those that are not familiar with Michael Bond's books will be granted the blessing of childish curiosity and amazement, and those that hold a firm nostalgic grip of the source material will be utmost pleased of how well the story is presented.One of the great forces of the film is the comedy. It is quite colorful and at times challenging to fully appreciate but collaborates perfectly with the pacing and feel.Paddington embodies the beauty of innocents, the holiday spirit, and how a bear can display good manners and humanity to the humans that surround him.",

    "review": "  You don't get many family oriented films these days that are as fun and good-spirited as Paddington. In a time where movies are overly fluffed, Paddington deals with a genuinely good story of a bear from Peru that tries to find his place in London after losing his home to an earthquake. It's emotionally charged and though the film does deal with a cliche family dynamic where everyone is dysfunctional until that \"someone\" pops into their life, it's the character of Paddington that is made loveable in how his curiosity causes mischief, yet has a kind heart and well-intended manners that make him very likeable. We do get that villain plot that serves for the film's obstacles, and it's done in a silly, but well done fashion that is justified within the roots of the story rather than just thrown in as filler to move the story. Paddington is nothing much beyond be a simple, light family film, but it's harmless and its charms work effectively.",

    "review": "  Paddington is a great example of old fashioned storytelling and character meeting highly technical modern filmmaking. In fact, it is easy to overlook the visual feat of bringing to life a talking bear in the middle of London, a testimony to how seamless it really is. This allows us to become immersed in the world of Paddington itself, which is a delight. The plot line itself is basic. On a personal note, I watched this film about a bear who is left without any family or a home and ends up in London searching for a forever home. It's a simple tale with a simple message: Home, or family, is wherever you find yourself accepted unconditionally, no matter your past (or whether you are worlds apart) and no matter who you are (where even a bear can find a home with humans). The basic plot line is underscored by a script that is full of wit and humour, and a deft hand for recognizing when to pause for meaningful/touching moments. The film moves at a decent pace, but it gives a lot of space to breathe at the same time. Most of this centres around Paddington, a symbol of innocence and pure human longing (to simply want to belong) and whose antics revolve around a certain naiveness to the world around him. This is what makes him (and the film) so charming. And Nicole Kidman shows up as a bit of surprise as the villain of the story who is not so much memorable as she is a counter to Paddington's own innocence. It infuses the film with just enough contrast to work. I very much enjoyed this film. It reminded me of the more recent full length feature of Winnie the Pooh. Simple yet complex, old school yet modern, and a sweet story.",

All the stuff with the family and the search for the explorer was so strong, but the villainous taxidermist stuff just sucked me right out of it. This film have been so much stronger without it. The Browns had a wonderful family dynamic, the interactions between them and Paddington was on par with the book and the cartoon series. But the villain subplot just felt forced and contrived and ruined my enjoyment of the final third of the movie. Hell I groaned the moment she appeared. And its a real shame because there is a good, intelligent movie in here, it just got a little spoiled with an unnecessary plot element.",

Paddington is: Funny (the film has humour for kids but has some humour for the older viewers too)Well Written (the screenplay for Paddington is brilliantly written and constructed by Paul King, Hamish McColl and Emma Thompson) Well Produced (by David Heyman)Well Directed (by Paul King)Brilliantly Acted (Julie Walters, Hugh Bonneville and Ben Whishaw really stood out for me the most amongst all the cast)and, Wonderful Visually (the CGI for Paddington is very very well done. He looks and feels like he is real, and just as real as all the other human characters in the film. You also really fall in love with the bear)Paddington is a holiday treat for all ages that is lots of fun and full of heart; one of the best family films of recent. You leave the theatre with a smile on your face. I recommend Paddington to all. (Paddington is an almost perfect 5 star film, I only have one small problem with the film: Nicole Kidman. Her acting can't nearly match up to the talent of all the other very talented cast members that were apart of this film. The character she portrays though, is great. I think if you like Kidman as an actress, then she won't be a problem for you. This is, I'll admit one of her better performances in her career. But other than Kidman, Paddington is a perfect film. Paddington is, as I said above: \"A holiday treat for all ages that is lots of fun and full of heart; one of the best family films of recent. You leave the theatre with a smile on your face. I recommend Paddington to all.\")Go and see Paddington! :-)",

    "review": "  Much like when you were a child and your mum cuddled you up tight in bed on a cold night to tell you the story, it's easy to fall in love with Paddington. Adapted from Michael Bond's universally beloved books, this story about the world's most adorably well-mannered bear from darkest Peru, who wears a tattered pink hat, an oversize duffle coat and lives of marmalade sandwiches, all the makings for a genuinely happy and well-timed cheery film. After an earthquake destroys his home, a young bear sets off on a journey in search of a new home and family in London. Acceptance however is not as forthcoming as he was lead to believe. But by remaining ever optimistic and polite, he finally meets the Brown Family. Contrary to the pragmatic Mr. Brown's (Hugh Bonneville) protests, the warm-hearted Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins) invites the displaced bear, now aptly named Paddington, to stay with them for the evening. Little did she realise how much comic mayhem and downright chaos one little bear's antics could bring to their everyday family life. But things only really start to get sticky when he attracts the unwanted attention of Millicent (Nicole Kidman), the British Museums taxidermy specialist, who has a connection of her own to the visitor. Surprisingly simple in this age of CGI/SFX, the morals narrative is glaringly contrived. Heavy with themes of family, belonging and dealing with life's every day issues it's a little boggy, it does however beautifully preserve the essence of the characters' 'Englishness' and wonderfully pays almost not attention to the fact that he's a talking bear.The verdict: Although it can't be said this film is schmaltz-free, it is wonderfully whimsical and would make a sweet pre-Christmas outing all the more palatable.

    "review": "  Paddington is the long-awaited big-screen adaptation of the beloved British book series about a humanoid bear who has an infatuation with marmalade and is one of the best family films I've seen in quite some time that isn't animated! Wow, this was a feel-good movie with tons of heart, a stellar cast, and an endearing quality I couldn't help not smiling at. Ben Whishaw famously replaced Colin Firth as the voice of Paddington once they realized it didn't fit, and Whishaw's soft tone and innocent delivery made me believe 100% that Paddington was a real character. The supporting cast is rounded out by Sally Hawkins, Hugh Bonneville (who is one of the best parts of it) and even Nicole Kidman who plays the villain as a type of uber-Cruella de Vil that just works! I had a smile on my face throughout with the many great visual gags, subtle British wit, and a truly hilarious scene where Hugh Bonneville has to dress up as a maid that killed me! Paddington is a total surprise to me and after it's release date was pushed to an unsavory month and the trailers not doing it any justice, I thoroughly enjoyed it and it's the perfect family film!",

    "review": "  I was a child of a British mum, and as such a fan of Paddington amongst a horde of Caillou-lovers (for the record, you don't have half the personality of Paddington's hat, you bald bland baby). But that was in early childhood, and decades have passed since then. I was nervous about the film - relieved when I saw the good rating, briefly. What if the film was terrible and marred my memories of the bear? What if it was accurate and showed me that my love had been misplaced all along? I hope it was the former, and not the later, that was the issue. I am honestly flabbergasted that this was so well received. While the beginning is strong, offbeat and charming, the moment it switches from being an animated film to a live action one spelled the defeat the charm. This feels more like a dull tread through the 90s kid films I despised as a kid in the 90s. The kids are given hobbies instead of personalities, the mother is forgettably benign, the father is made the main character and given the largest, dullest arc of learning to pay attention to his kids and value family...excuse me while I vomit up my flashbacks of bad G-rated films. Through this well-trodden muck shines Paddington, whose personality is just as I remembered. Well animated and voiced, he is that rare character in children's films that does not spend the entire time on a sugar high, but possesses a honestly good heart, in action, emotion, and thought. While the slapstick amused my family, perhaps I've been too spoiled by the excellent timing of Chuck Jones to appreciate the bigger-is-funnier hijinks of this film. The villain, alas, would be a stand-out, if her relation to the protagonist wasn't saved as an entirely predictable twist and her entire schtick done so much better by Chantel du Rochefort in Madagascar 3. Chantel is ultimately the better and funnier cartoon performance. A lesson for the whole film, really - this would have been better off as an animated production a la Ernest and Celestine, which managed to have quiet charm and character development instead of the parody this is. Nod to Capaldi, by the way, for being my favourite character in the piece, making amusing the horrible stock character thrown his way and being a bright spot when the camera had to leave Paddington for a moment. All in all, I hope the inevitable sequel learns to cherish the quieter moments of Paddington, the expressions and acting that were touching and charming and honestly funny, instead of re-watching their library of Disney knock-off films from the decade no one can remember had terrible taste in family film-making. In the end, the best I can say about this film comes from the mouth of a Brit. It's 'Mostly Harmless'.",

    "review": "  Paddington is as cuddly, charming and imaginative as I remember. In fact, watching the film evoked memories long thought passed; of reading the books and wearing his coat. So well executed is this film, so utterly delightful that the magic of the original stories stays right in tact.Paddington, voiced so beautifully by Ben Wishaw, is such an engaging and funny character that this antics are able to carry this film with ease. However, the human stars, especially Kidman and Capaldi are also excellent.The screenplay is British perfection and the wondrous world created at the film's start grabs your attention effortlessly. In fact, the whole film does this. I absolutely adore this film, much like the title character.Interestingly, there aren't many, if any, criticisms I can find. Perhaps that film has no direct focus other than to introduce the bear and there are no complexities to be found in the plot. Other actors including Sally Hawkins and Hugh Bonneville are brilliant as the Browns and Julie Walters is as good as she's ever been. Every actor brings a sense of belief and wonder and delight to their roles. It's quite reflective of the type of film this aims to be, and is.What Paddington is, is a deliciously adorable, meticulously crafted and wonderfully imaginative film that both delights, saddens and above all entertains. But the best part of Paddington? The self aware cynicism of its marmalade addiction.",

The whole cast did a pretty remarkable job and Nicole Kidman's role was the most exciting of them all, for all good reasons! A must watch adventure movie from this year.",

Being a British film and not from Disney or Dreamworks and distrbuted in the USA by Dimension Films of the Weinstein Company. So, no huge promotion here in the States. I understand that Paddington Bear is a much-beloved series of books in England and thus there was great care to make an excellent live-action rendition. And that they did. Not only is the bear cute and funny and whimsical, but every character is unique and delightful, full of life and nuance, acted to perfection by some fantastic British actors, including Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Julie Walters, Nicole Kidman, and Peter Capaldi.The humor is never over-the-top, it is that great sly and dry British humor where absolutely hilarious phrases are just so nonchalantly stated. Sure this is a great kids movie. But I think every one of my friends would love it too. Well done, Paul King!",

    "review": "  Rarely is a live-action family film this well-polished and lacking in stupid.Indeed, Paddington somehow manages to rise above the dreadful glut of family-oriented schlock pushed on audiences year after year and present itself as a witty, well-acted, British romp. Though not without its brief moments of corny sappiness, this film does its job far better than most in this particular genre, recalling such greats as Babe and the earlier, more kid-friendly Harry Potter films. It has a great British cast with impeccable comic timing, and a sense of humor that often aims at adults without venturing into the crude and tasteless as its peers are so quick to do.I certainly wasn't sure if this film was my cup of tea at first. As the story progressed, however, I was continually surprised by its ability to make me laugh, as well as by the care and respect the filmmakers seemed to have for their audience and the movie's source material.",

    "review": "  Heart-warming plus hilarious!Paddington is an endearing and heartwarming fun for all ages. The story and the premise may feel simplistic and childish. Yet it offers enough excitement with a beautiful mix of slapstick humor and analogy on modern society. The main character, the marmalade-loving Peruvian bear 'Paddington' is sent to London by his Aunt after an earthquake hits their home. There is something more to these bears - they talk! These bears were discovered by an British explorer many years ago who told them they were always welcome in London. But now in the modern day when Paddington finally arrives in London hardly finds anyone welcoming him at a busy train station. Finally, some kind generous family (Browns) help talking him to their home temporarily so that they can find an appropriate place for him later. As expected, the humor is composed of how Paddington, a bear tries to fit in the modern human setting and the end is obviously going to be predictable. Still the charm and innocence of the CGI- bear keeps you hooked. The set-design was splendid and well-detailed reminding of Wes Anderson's work. The subtle take on human behavior is clearly evident. I really loved the sequence where Paddington gauges the characters in the Brown family one by one. You could easily relate to the life-like characterization. It would have been great if the story had not followed the conventional path in the second half (which is quite weak compared to the fresh first-half). The predictable goofy-action climax was quite disappointing. But, overall Paddington was great fun and entertainment. Not only that, you will learn a thing or two from the extremely adorable bear.

    "review": "  A charming, family-friendly adventure, Paddington is an amusing and classy movie for which you do not need know the character or to be a child in order to fully enjoy it. Stuffed with charm and marmalade this is an optimistic story of finding a new home and a new family.The movie tells the story of a young and naive Peruvian bear which decides to go to London and search for an old friend of his family. With completely wrong expectations of London, he soon realizes that the city could be a very dark, unfriendly and lonely place. Without knowing anyone and with no home he meets the Brown family from which he receives his British name - Paddington. The Browns offer him a temporary home until he finds the friend of his family. Paddington's stay in London and his first experience of \"civilization\", combines with his complete cuteness make Paul King's delivery a mildly funny one with humor suitable for both kids and adults. When Paddington becomes an object of \"hunting\" by Nicole Kidman (who is simply superb as the villain in the movie) the stake get higher and a little adventurous content is added to the story. As a whole, there are very few flaws that one could find in Paddington. Even with the danger of getting an overdose of cuteness one cannot resist the British charm of this Peruvian bear. It may not have the emotional punch of some other recent family-friendly deliveries, but its charming leading character, heart-warming content and classy humor make this movie a formidable family entertainment.",

He really helped this family out a lot with everything that he knows. He helped this family out and then the family helped saved his life at the end of the movie. Paddington movie was a very good. I loved this movie a lot and a lot. Paddington brings a beloved children's character into the 21st century without sacrificing his essential charm, delivering a family-friendly adventure as irresistibly cuddly as its star. Marmaladen with gloriously silly jokes, pitch-perfect performances and incidental detail, this is a warm, witty and wondrously inventive great big bear-hug of a movie. The filmmakers behind Paddington successfully bring the lovable bear into the future and strike a balance between honoring the spirit of the original books and updating the story for today's young audiences. This is a charming film whose underlying message of tolerance and acceptance strikes a palpable chord in today's world - both for children and adults. Consistently funny, surprising and with a heart as big as its hero's appetite, it deserves to be the start of a new franchise, and can proudly go paw-to-paw alongside the cream of the kids' movie crop. Artfully and cleverly, the sweet spirit of that young bear from darkest Peru and his many London misadventures materializes brilliantly on screen in the very good hands of writer-director-conjurer Paul King. Paddington is fast-paced yet unhurried, serving up surprisingly subtle ideas on melting-pot urban diversity-Paddington is a stranger in a strange land, after all-and rich visual tableaux, including a gorgeous recurring shot of the Brown home as a living dollhouse too.

Technical difficulties aside, I found it enjoyable, if geared a bit too much towards kids...or people who find awkward physical humor where people fall over themselves funny. I don't, but I was able to overlook those moments because the characters won me over. Yes, each one had the SET UP ISSUE THAT WILL BE RESOLVED BY MOVIE'S END, but the actors did a good job being quirky and not annoying. It's not a deep examination of England's attitude towards immigrants...it's not even really a very shallow one, unless one digs in. I'm torn between wishing Paddington didn't speak perfect English-English, and dreading the stereotypical accent they would have given him. Instead of an accent Paddington wears his foreignness by being a bear, which few people in the film question. Only the villain really brings it up, using coded, xenophobic language of \"their kind moving into the neighborhood with their disruptive, foreign habits.\" She is also the only one who sees Paddington as an animal, not a \"person.\" I don't know what would stop her from coming after Paddington after she gets done with community service. Or what's to stop Paddington from being deported.",

    "review": "  It's easy these days to be cynical about children's entertainment, or really entertainment in general. What, with sequels, remakes, reboots, etc., it seems like money is all people think about and we don't help them when we just go and see whatever they vomit up for us to watch. And then there's PADDINGTON. Yes, it's based on preexisting source material, but there's an affection for its central character that comes across despite leaning on common narrative tropes. It also helps that the film has a great message that will speak to adults and children alike. For those uninitiated (like myself, before watching this), PADDINGTON is about the titular bear who hails from \"Darkest Peru\" and travels to London to find himself a home. He ends up staying with a family who finds him at the train station, initially on a temporary basis, but the family grows to love and appreciate him. There's also an evil taxidermist (Nicole Kidman) who's trying to get her hands on him, and with whom he shares an interesting connection. That's all you really need to know going in, especially if you've seen the trailer already. Far and away the best thing about the film is Ben Whishaw, who provides the voice-over for Paddington. He did a great job conveying the innocence and politeness that are a huge part of the character. Of course, the animators did a bang-up job as well, and this is some of the best CGI/live-action integration I've ever seen. The rest of the cast does quite well for themselves, too, even if their characters are a bit \"stock\" in nature and go through typical transformations over the course of the film. Nicole Kidman was good too, but her character really isn't given much screen time, or much to do at all for that matter. She gets one big scene in which she reveals something I won't spoil here, but I called the twist when she was first introduced and its revelation left me wondering \"That's it?\" However, villain underdevelopment and narrative tropes aside, this was a very pleasant and funny film to watch. There are a number of scenes with some absolutely hysterical physical comedy, and some small details which end up getting satisfactory payoffs later. And most of all, I liked the messages about treating people with kindness and the nature of family. There's even a bit of subtext about immigration that might go over children's heads, but that parents will hopefully pick up on. Overall, I don't think is some masterpiece. The plot bears (no pun intended) a slight resemblance in some respects to Beethoven, although it's arguably done better here. What is true is that PADDINGTON is a refreshingly positive and heartwarming experience that should appeal to all ages, and that's something to be proud of.",

    "review": "  Paddington (now out on DVD/Blu-ray) is a great adventure, with lots of twists and turns. This film is playful, comedic, enjoyable and definitely a great film for friends and family.Paddington (Ben Whishaw, voice) is a rare breed of bear that travels all alone to London. He wants to find a home after his is destroyed. While there, he discovers that it's not what he expects, but finds a family that's willing to take him in and look after him for just a little while. This is when everyone's adventure begins.Paddington is so outgoing and adorable. You can't help but love this bear. He has an innocent way about him, but still is a little mischievous and gets into trouble. His visual effects and fur looks very real and life-like. Nicole Kidman's character (Millicent) is very determined to add Paddington to her collection of stuffed animals. She will stop at nothing to get him. She's fierce, frightening and intimidating. I love the story line, humor, and definitely the action. I liked that the climax of this film is very unpredictable and shocks the audience. My favorite character would have to be Paddington. He truly thinks of the wellbeing of others and his curiosity is adorable. He reminds you of a child learning new things. A scene that I would call my favorite is when Paddington tries to return a wallet to a man that dropped out of his packet while walking out of an antique shop. Paddington chases him, trying to get the wallet to him. Finally he catches up with the man by falling on him from the air. When he falls on the man they both tumble down and about 30 wallets fall out of the man's coat. Paddington catches a pickpocket and ends up in the paper on his first day in London. It's a very comical scene that makes the audience crack up.  One of the messages of this film is that families are not just made up by the people who are related to us, but friends and even animals can be a part of our family.I recommend Paddington for ages 8 to 16. However it's great for the whole family and anyone who loves Bears. It's rated PG and there's nothing really you would need to look out for.I give it 5 out of 5 stars. It's a great film that makes you feel good. Reviewed by Brianna Hope B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more film reviews by kids, go to kidsfirst dot org.",

Occasionally the humor does feel cheesy and over-the-top, but there are far more genuinely funny moments, as well as emotional, touching and charming ones.",

    "review": "  Beautifully made and wonderfully written movie :- \"Paddington\" brings warmth that movie goers can embrace. The story-line is very simple as often the children movies go and although a similar type of film \"Ted\" was made this one is different. It has the strong british feel to it and as the plot unveils one can understand how nicely is the story told and one gets the feel that this is an allegorical narrative reminding us a bit of \"A Little Princess\" and walks on a similar. Another thing that bolstered the movie is the way it is shot and it pulls off the classic stereotypical cliches in a endearing silly manner ; something that actually goes for the heart rather than being overly complicated. The simple moments often get the response of the audience and in the simplicity lies the magic. Throughout the narration there is a sense of hitting the moments mostly. As for the negatives there are few and far between . There is enough comedy , action and emotion ,that is nicely paced and devoid of cheap gags, to make it a nice family movie that will keep both children and adults interested.",

So many British TV actors were in this movie and I was laughing so hard! Dr. Who, As Time Goes By, Spoons, Little Britain and of course Downtown Abbey! First part was very fun family fantasy comedy, but climax was heart pounding suspense! Story was good and smart, lots of jokes were really funny! Absolutely British style jokes and I loved it!

So I was expecting a childish and corny movie to the point of unbearable but what we actually got was a smart, delightful and genuinely funny family movie. This movie made me laugh a lot, its jokes are perfectly crafted and are genius. Its plot is a little basic but the story is not all thats on offer. The animation is breathtaking too, together with a solid mostly british cast. The script is so clever and his paws so clumsy that I can recommend this movie to absolutely anyone.",

Paddington's story is very endearing and the strong hints of social commentary are nice. The commentary is direct and straightforward without being too obvious or heavy-handed. For the most part, it's just a very sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy. It was decently funny; I never really got tired of seeing the many ways Paddington failed at trying to adapt to modern society because he's such a quirky, innocent character and manages to be more civilized than anyone else in some respects. The editing is creative and masterfully executed. No major flaws to be found.",

The cast is good and the digital effects are generally top-notch. Altogether, this is one of the finest live action-meets-digital character Family films in recent years and one that families will want on their home video shelves.",

I absolutely love the cinematography, the wonderfully bright, warm colours and the crispness. The technical aspect of creating Paddington's movements, especially his hair, is truly impressive. It's funny without being ridiculous, I laughed out loud a few times which is unusual. In these times of artsy open or unhappy endings, the happy end was very welcome.

    "review": "  Surprising. So this is about a bear from Darkest, Peru, making his way to London, trying to find a family to take him in as one of their own. I did not grow up with this bear, so this movie served as my introduction to the character. All I knew was that he has been the subject of a number of children's books since the 50's. I've listened to a number of people peripherally about this, so I know what this childhood character means to people, which explains why so many were unexpectedly excited about this. Having sat down and watched this, I would say this film has done this character justice. The biggest component to why this works is the same element that I am usually highly critical of in other films: the physical comedy. I'm not usually a fan, and the only other example I can think of this succeeding off the top of my head as far as being featured this prominently is the Three Stooges remake. It's rare to see this be so successful, and even rarer when it connects with me, but here, it is just so surreal and bizarre that it does work. This is very good-natured, and Paddington himself so polite and cute that it is really difficult not to love him. He's a very smooth special effect that is never at any point creepy (which is something that I was worried about from looking at stills), and they make the intelligent decision in the script to not overexplain everything. This is just a universe where talking bears are an endangered species, but they do exist. If they spent twenty minutes explaining how they learned how to talk, it would have slowed everything down, and unnecessarily so. This may sound like a backhanded compliment, but this is like a smarter version of Marmaduke. You've got a talking animal, wreaking havoc upon this poor family's house, only Paddington manages to do this while sidestepping the vast majority of the lowbrow humor; it's always nice when more effort is placed, and you don't fall back on picking the low hanging fruit. The entire time this moves very quickly, and it is always on to the next thing. I also appreciated Nicole Kidman, who has fun as the scenery chewing villain. Also, the thing that is Paddington's saving grace is that it's funny, and the punchlines hit. Paddington the movie is similar to Paddington the bear: charming.",

They finally got the tools and director Paul King has done it. It is basically the british version of Snoopy. The story follows Paddington, who goes to London is search of finding a home after his in Peru was destroyed. The voice was incredible, the performances was great, and I still can't get over that 'The Smurfs' made WAY more than poor box-office-crushed Paddington did. Great way of bringing the character into the 21st century.Overall: A heart warming story that puts out the guidelines of how a live-action version of a cartoon should be.

Com uma dire��o muito boa, um ritmo legal, fotografias perfeitas, e uma anima��o do personagem principal muito linda, o filme com certeza foi para mim uma das grandes surpresas de 2014. O filme tem um humor leve, nada apelativo, com algumas pequenas pitadas de nonsense e com um forte apelo ao p�blico infantil. � um filme perfeito para se assistir em fam�lia, pois conquista tanto adultos como crian�as. O filme funciona muito bem na intera��o anima��o/seres humanos, lembrando os recentes Smurf e Smurf 2. E claro, � imposs�vel assistir e n�o lembrar, por exemplo, de \"O Pequeno Stuart Little\".

    "review": "  When I initially saw the short version of the trailer for this I was worried that this would just be like most other adaptations of its type, it featured Paddington in a bathroom with a gag joke and then a loud scene with a bath. At that point I had already accepted what I thought this was going to be but I'm so glad that I was wrong because 'Paddington' is a prime example of how to do something like this the perfect way, and seeing that bathroom scene in the film is a lot of fun. Placing Paddington in the real world isn't just a gimmick that other films like this do when they have no idea of what to do with their characters, Paddington was always set in 'the real world'. When Paddington gets to London, he gets ignored at the train station and that's exactly how London would be and this film gets so many more little details like that about England really well done and they're so funny, as is the overall film. The film also has smart film references and a really well done soundtrack. Even though I grew up with the character, seeing it all in live action, I will admit when the film started I did have a little trouble accepting the fact that everyone just accepted a talking bear with a hat, and later his classic coat, but as the story went on that went away- but I mean really, he would be in Area 51 so fast. I really did like the story in this and everything really comes full circle and wraps up so well in a really satisfying package that it'd be hard for anyone to resist. The bad guy in the film has a reason to be the way they are and it fits in with what happens early on and it's just nice to see a really well written story with no coincidences, everything fits and everything works. The character of the disapproving father isn't particularly new but it works here because they're dealing with a talking bear! The cast of the film was well chosen and they all really commit to this film to make it as fun as it could possibly be, there are quite a few cameos throughout with actors that are fun to see in this but I won't spoil them. It was fun to see Hugh Bonneville in this, seeing him go from 'Downton Abbey' to making bear noises and wearing a dress is just really funny. Ben Whishaw as Paddington was perfect casting and seeing as how he had so little time to re-record all of Firth's dialogue, because they could no longer see him in the role, it's just great. I wonder what he would have been like, it's certainly odd to imagine, especially after Whishaw's excellent portrayal. Nicole Kidman was great, even if was kind of odd to just randomly see her in this; the age rating controversy that her character brought is a little silly, really, you're going to change it from a U to a PG because the head of the board was scared of characters like her when he was a child? What is this? Not everyone is as much of a baby as you were. Nicole Kidman's character is reminiscent of Cruella de Vil, which is funnily enough one of the examples he used, but really? This film is absolutely harmless, just like that one and all the other films like this. Not like it matters much, the young audience that would want to see this anyway would need to have been taken to the cinema by an adult anyway. The CGI in this film is fantastic and excellently done; you quickly forget that all of the actors are interacting with something that isn't there, Paddington is just so cute! There were just a few things that I was thinking through the film; that one of oranges he drops at the start should have been the 'o' in his name. The shelter should have been a little bit closer to their home in the jungle. It was fun to see the empty jars in the boat, even if no way did he have all of those in his bag, but it was a nice sight gag. I don't really know how the shower turned on in the bathroom; I think it was an accident. I thought Julie Walters character was going to hit that character with her handbag instead of getting them drunk, as funny as that scene was, no way would that happen! Haha. And I know she said she was too old to travel but I felt sad at the end knowing that she couldn't come to visit. The whole film just emits a very warm innocence that really has been lost in these kind of films and overall it's just short, sweet and full of whimsy.",

    "review": "  i'll start my review off by saying that yes like the critics have said Paddington is a really good movie but is it 98 percent good. not really no but it surprisingly isin't great it's just really cute. I think I read one of the books when I was a child but I can't be sure yet. so let's start with the stuff I liked about this movie. First of all thank god they got rid of Colin Farrell as the voice of Paddington because ben winshaw the voice they got to replace him does a great job voicing the character of Paddington. I can really see no other person doing the voice of this character if they did then it would probably be mediocre. I really also liked the supporting cast to this movie too,espically the character of the dad. At first I thought the dad character would be a strict and lame dad but then I found out his backstory and then it all changed. The kids of him and his wife really didn't do too bad(although the daughters character was at times one-dimensional but she had her moments). Then I thought the mother did an o.k. job. she wasn't as great as the dad but she did all right for what was givin. But there are also some dumb scenes from the trailer ad advertising that happened here(like the toothbrushes, the ketchup, Paddington's name being made up by the wife all that stuff) this is a movie the parents and kids can enjoy together so I highly recommend when this comes on dvd go out and buy it. Then there's the villain played by Nicole Kidman which at first I thought I was gonna laugh at her character because the entrance was stupid but her character has no motivations,the other characters have motivations for what they do but not her character it's just because she's evil. Her character was just dumb and dull. but that's pretty much it I really liked this movie. I feel it's a bit overrated but I liked the movies message of family should stick together and there wasn't really many jokes in this besides the first two halves while the last act focuses on the family which I liked(while there is this drinking scene with the grandma and a guard that I liked but other then that that's it. I think this is a definite check out for families and don't put this one as background noise. I hope they don't make a sequel because this movie is as good as it is.",

    "review": "  Lovely film that is touching and also at times very funny. It has something for youngsters and adults alike with some good action sequences.Paddington is forced to flee his home in Peru after what is probably the result of deforestation. A relative puts him on a boat to London after a visit many decades before from a British explorer who regaled them with stories of how welcoming and friendly it was. Upon his arrival he discovers that life in a big city can be distant and cold. That's until he meets the Browns who whilst suspicious of him in the beginning learn to accept him as a part of the family. I'm of an age and nationality that grew up with Paddington Bear and have always been a fan. This film certainly does it justice but I don't think that you have to be aware of the series to enjoy it. The cast is very good and I'm beginning to like Sally Hawkins in almost everything she turns her hand to. It has a good villain in Nicole Kidman (obvious comparisons to Cruella deVille) but one minor criticism is that I didn't think that there was enough of her.",

    "review": "  Beautifully designed, with lush, creative sets and production values, PADDINGTON aims for true greatness, but can't help but stumble over its own self-congratulatory tone. With so much charm and creativity placed onits technical side, its nothing short of frustrating that the film reduces itself to (almost exclusively) slapstick humor and visual gags. This might work if the title character wasn't the weakest visual component in an otherwise visual masterpiece; a CG Mr. Bean with half the wit and almost none of the charm. Shoe-horn Kidman into a unnecessary/cliche villain and what starts out as fresh and engaging becomes exactly what you think it will be. The high points are the wonderful Sally Hawkins and Hugh Bonneville; the latter giving a joyful, vanity-free performance that's worth seeing the film for alone. Regardless of these two stand-out performances, the script never really allows itself to develop the so-called relationships by which the entire climax hinges on; its too busy wrapping its CG character in scotch tape or swimming in a bathroom full of water...far more interested in the cheap laughs than the honest ones.",

    "review": "  It takes guts to bring a much beloved children's book series to the big screen and it's tough to do it well. It's especially difficult when those books have been translated into 30 languages, each representing a different culture with its own set of expectations for any movie adaptation. Those were the challenges the filmmakers faced in making a live action version of the Paddington Bear character that Michael Bond launched in his 1958 book, but the British film \"Paddington\" (PG, 1:35) does the character proud.As in the books, Paddington is an orphaned brown bear, raised in \"deepest, darkest Peru\" by his aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo. The couple was given those names by an English explorer they encountered many years ago. He also taught them to speak English and introduced them to the deliciousness of marmalade, two things they passed down to their nephew. When a massive earthquake kills Pastuzo, Lucy decides to move into a retirement home for bears and sends her nephew to London to find the old explorer and, hopefully, a new, loving home. But the young bear doesn't exactly know how to get around in a human city, so he sits on his suitcase in a train station, wearing the floppy red hat that his uncle got from the explorer and, around his neck, a note from his aunt asking some kind Londoner to \"take care of this bear\". Apparently, in London, a bear walking around is no cause for alarm and a talking bear is only seen as slightly unusual. When the Brown family happens along, not only are they not scared, but Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins) stops to talk to Paddington. Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville) wants nothing to do with the bear, but his wife convinces him to give the bear a place to stay for \"just one night\". She names him after the train station where he was found, and home they go.If you're familiar with the book series, you've probably noticed that Paddington's basic background story remains intact, but the screenplay does take some liberties to make the film version more viable for the big screen. While Paddington's other well-known characteristics are here (including the blue coat, which he gets from the Browns, his customary politeness, his \"hard stare\" when he gets annoyed and, of course, his talent for getting into trouble and making a mess of things, despite his best intentions), other characters and situations have been added. As the Browns help Paddington try to find the old explorer, the little brown bear is being pursued by a woman named Millicent (Nicole Kidman). She wants to stuff Paddington, and I don't mean by giving him a pile of marmalade sandwiches. She's a taxidermist, who, for very personal reasons, would consider mounting Paddington's carcass to be her most important work. She's a younger Cruella DeVil with neater hair, and she adds an extra element of danger to the story that wasn't present in the books. But worry not, families with small children. The danger isn't portrayed in a way that would frighten the kiddos and the youngest of them wouldn't understand what's going on anyway.\"Paddington\" is everything you would expect from this big screen adaptation - and more. The titular bear (as voiced by 30-something British actor Ben Whishaw) is charming and adorable and the visual effects that bring him to life are superb. Although I wasn't impressed with the kids playing the children in the Brown family, the adult cast was great. Hawkins is a recent Oscar nominee and Bonneville is a Golden Globe and Emmy nominee for his ongoing residence at \"Downton Abbey\". It was fun seeing the stoic and proper Lord Grantham, at various points in the film, sport a beard, wear a woman's house coat and scoot across a narrow window ledge. Kidman's character in the movie is very lithe too. Watching her sinister activities made me wonder if she was doing her own stunts. Either way, the adult characters' antics just added to the fun. And that's what this movie is - fun. Although it feels a tad dull at times, overall, it's a delightful film that should be enjoyed by the whole family. \"B+\"",

    "review": "  A fairly refreshing and cute interpreation regarding this beloved childhood literature icon, i didnt have high hopes given that a lot of these types of films especially in this day and age tend to be more cynical and out for the buck rather than have that idealistic and almost whimsical touch to their proceedings. But the filmmakers seems to have tapped into something with a slight almost Wes Anderson approach in some sequences in terms of the story telling paramaters and art direction, and a fairly naive approach to how Paddington sees the world which is all the more intoxicating. Also the fact that a lot of the characters involved don't seem too offput by the idea o fa walking talking bear which is also a joy, they just run with it. A lot of fun and pretty too look at. Good counter programming for the douldrums of February in the theatres.",

    "review": "  Paddington is a very good and rare film you see everyday, while normal humans are living in cities or capital cities with technology and all 21st Century things, bear 'Paddington' (named after underground station Paddington) is learning all about London and he doesn't understand at all ordinary human life, he finds it difficult to understand what's going around him, but, later, he knows what is good and bad. When things are changing, it seems someone wants to hunt an Innocent, cuddly bear and stuff him as an attraction to the museum!",

    "review": "  Even I wasn't expecting for a big screen version of Paddington to be, well, good. Paddington is a family movie, but it's also for everyone, which means neither kids or the adults will hate on it. Taken from a series of book begun in 1958 by author Michael Bond and illustrated by Peggy Fortnum, the movie likewise tells the story of a Peruvian bear, clad in duffel coat and floppy red hat, adopted by a family from London. It's pure pleasure that the big-screen Paddington is so irresistibly charming and springs sweet surprises.Credit that to writer-director Paul king and Harry Potter producer David Heyman who bring to the screen this sweet fable that is thankfully light on the special effects overkill and sentimental goop. Paddingtona himself, voiced wonderfully by Ben Whishaw, is first seen living it up in the rainforest. Then, bam, earthquake hits and Paddington is suddenly on a cargo ship to London where he arrives at Paddington Station and is quickly adopted, temporarily, by the Brown family; dad Henry (Hugh Bonneville of tv's Downton Abbey), sweet wife Mary (the always lovely Sally Hawkins) and their two scrappy children Judy and Jonathan. It's not long before Paddington is speaking in British tones.Enter Nicole Kidman, channeling her inner Cruella De Vil as Millicent Clyde, a taxidermist who's looking to add Paddington to her stuffed collection. All of that serves as impetus for chase scenes and physical comedy that are almost Wes Anderson-like in their tone. The human actors interact convincingly with the computer-generated bear. There are even subtle references to subject like immigration. And even though Paddington does fly over London, he has no super powers, just innocent charms. It's drolly dazzling. 'Please Look After This Bear' read the words on a tag around Paddington's neck. Good advice.",

I thought this was just going to be a trashy ripoff of \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\". Luckily, this film turned out to be better then it by a lot. Sure, the script is a little over sentimental at times but for the most part, it's pretty entertaining. The movie has Nicole Kidman as the villain who is a museum taxidermist. She wants Paddington's fur and she wants to mount it on her wall. She adds enough suspense to the film to help it get away from \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" which was too cute all the time. This movie has a few problems but the good far outweighs the bad and it delivers on its promise. It's a great example of how good family films should be and hopefully more family movies will learn off this one and maybe improve off of it. It's a great start to 2015.",

As surprising as this may sound the Michael Bond books adaptation is a hard one to grasp. I want to say what my experience of the movie was like but it's hard for me to do so but I'll try.I am probably not the target audience for Paddington but the three foot six bear has something extremely appealing about him. Paddington is charming, respectful and funny. I couldn't help but have a smile on my face when he was on screen. The little C.G.I Bear is so lovable that he feels very much alive. Thanks to the seamless special effects, the good live acting from the cast, and the great job Ben Whishaw did voice acting that character - as if I needed another reason to admire this actor.The movie is endearing and warms your heart, it has this classical witty British humour that adults will responds to and children will enjoy. It's also a smart movie with a positive message, acceptance. Watching Paddington feels very much like reading book, I mean each sequences has a beginning and an end, it feels a like turning the page of a book each page a little more amazing than the next. Paddington will surprise you and put a smile on your face, it embodies the family film genre very well. @wornoutspines",

This very family-friendly film is centred around an adventure of Paddington, the beloved children's toy that has spanned many generations. This film was very entertaining, for the most part of the film i was very entertained, the main plot was basic enough for children to understand but interesting enough so that anyone older could still have a good time. A main factor in having a good time during this film were the jokes, there were many jokes, a few didn't quite have the effect they were supposed to but for the most part they were pretty funny for some family-friendly humour. The only issue i had with the jokes is that they could have been a little more spread out, i felt that the bulk of the funny moments were during the middle portion of the film and the beginning and ending didn't really have a whole lot, as those sections were more plot focused. A more even spread of funny moments would have made for even more enjoyment over the course of the whole movie, that doesn't mean i didn't enjoy it but it could have been better. As for the performances, all of the cast did a good job, no-one really stood out as being fantastic but for the most part they were all solid performances, even the voice actor for Paddington was good. This movie is a fun time for the whole family that all can enjoy and moves at a quick enough pace so you don't lose interest - 7.6",

    "review": "  Once in a while, there comes a family film that does not rely on pop culture or toilet humor to sell itself. This is one of those movies. With \"Paddington\", based the character of Paddington Bear by Michael Bond, is one of those rare movies that can entertain both kids and adults alike. There are some moments that do tend to be a bit on the crude side, but in all honesty, the movie is definitely a treat. \"Paddington\" is a real nice surprise from a market where bathroom humor and pop culture references are the main attraction.The story involves a bear from Peru named Paddington (Ben Whishaw) whose home is destroyed in an earthquake, and now must go to London in order to find a new home. He then meets the Browns, and at first they seem a bit uncomfortable with him living with them. Yet, as more of his origin story is revealed, the Browns soon accept him as part of the family.\"Paddington\" is definitely a surprising film to watch. The story is simple and the lesson learned by our main characters is one that is totally relatable. Speaking of, the main cast for this movie id a very good job in their roles. Heck, even Peter Capaldi, the 12th Doctor for all you Doctor Who fans, turns an over-the-top performance into someone who is very likable in the film. The visual and special effects are pretty cool and enjoyable; though one can clearly see that some of the camera effects were done in 3D, even if being shown in 2D is still a nice option. The comedy for this film ranges from witty dialogue to mostly slapstick which works within the context presented in the film. Yet the biggest strength that the movie has is its appeal. Generating an audience of families, the movie works well within its constraints in that the movie can appeal to pretty much everyone of any age group. \"Paddington\" is a good movie that families will most definitely enjoy.However, there are some minor problems with emphasis on the word minor. There is a scene that has been used in pretty much all of the trailers where Paddington uses toothbrushes to clean out his ears, and everybody in the audience groaned at this particular moment. Yes, this scene does explain our main character's curiosity, but it didn't need to go into such graphic detail. Finally, Nicole Kidman, who plays our villain in the movie, just did not seem that threatening. If the character had a more villainous purpose, then she would have been likable.In conclusion, \"Paddington\" is a movie that will surprise some, will more than likely entertain families of all sorts for years to come.",

    "review": "  \"I LIKE THE BEAR,\" a little girl exclaimed behind me during the first few minutes of \"Paddington.\" The delighted reaction took me by surprise, and then it turned into a reminder. The farther I drift away from childhood, the longer I avoid interacting with elementary-aged children, there is a tendency to forget that there is such a thing as kids movies and family movies. I saw \"The LEGO Movie\" with my dad, but even then, it felt like I was watching a slightly sanitized version of \"The Simpsons\" instead of a reprehensible Pixar knockoff. These days, family movies try as hard as they can to appeal to the kiddos and their parents; maybe executives know how excruciating it can be to sit through a particularly painful foray into baby-talk and recycled jokes. Though it isn't my personal favorite genre, it is undeniable that family films please more routinely than any other category in film. So much emphasis is put onto each project that it's rare to find a stinker among the handful. But most children's films are only good, entertaining for the time being but not packed with enough quality to have an impact for more than a few months. Imagine my surprise when \"Paddington\" went from 0 to 60, straight into my cynical heart. \"Paddington\" is much too marvelous to throw around the effective clich� that it has something for the kids and something for the adults; like \"Babe,\" \"The Muppets,\" and yes, even \"Frozen,\" it transcends our prejudiced assumptions and takes us inside a fairy tale where anything can happen. It doesn't matter what age we are; it is as if you could throw dust into the air, only to find it fall in a golden flurry. \"Paddington\" shouldn't work, but it does. It does so well, in fact, that I can say with full confidence that it is one of the best genre films of the decade. Paddington the Bear is already a beloved literary figure, of course, but when we first meet him in his own star vehicle, it is as though he is new again. As the film begins, we find him living in Darkest, Peru with his aunt and uncle (Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon), both of whom are marmalade obsessed and intelligent enough to speak in cultured British accents. The film explains this noteworthy phenomenon: decades earlier, an explorer arrived in Peru, and, smitten with the bears otherworldly craftiness, taught them how to act as if they were civilized human beings. After tragedy strikes, Paddington's aunt decides that it would be best if her nephew went to find a home in London. When he arrives at a train station, most disregard his exuberant politeness, but not Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins). Her family looks at him with differing levels of judgment, especially her husband (Hugh Bonneville), but the Brown's pity him, eventually deciding to take him in. Paddington may have inimitable manners, but he surely isn't gifted when it comes to gracefulness (in a hilariously mounted comedic sequence, Paddington discovers the joys of the family bathroom, only to flood the entire house). Most would give him up, but with his considerable charm to make up for his klutziness, he even wins over Mr. Brown. But just as things begin to look up into storybook heaven, Millicent Clyde (a scene-stealing Nicole Kidman) enters the scene, a blood-thirsty taxidermist who wants nothing more than to stuff Paddington for her latest exhibit. With its candy-colored imagery and bouncy humor, \"Paddington\" is impossible to resist, a feature that really and truly makes you relive the glorious innocence of childhood. Voiced by the genial Ben Whishaw, Paddington is a fluffy friend for the ages, more cuddly and comical than \"Despicable Me\"'s famed Minions. The CGI used to flesh him out is so convincing that every single strand of fur sticks out with remarkable detail; there were times I forgot that Paddington is an outright miracle of animation, not a real-life talent I could meet on the red carpet.  There you have it. \"Paddington\" doesn't need an analysis, nor does it need a critic to highlight how much of a wonder it is. It is an unusually magical and unusually well-crafted family movie that needs to be watched immediately. Take you mom, take your dad, take your sister, take your brother - take anybody. Because, like the little girl who sat behind me during its extraordinary 95 minutes, I like the bear.",

This is a story based on books for children. Why is it necessary to include a truly unlikeable and creepy \"bad guy\"? My four year old was genuinely scared by the taxidermist, played by Nicole Kidman, and I don't blame her. Her entire storyline was attempting to kidnap, kill and stuff Paddington in order to display him at the natural history museum! That's pretty dark! It even showed scenes with her eagerly preparing her tools of the trade and donning rubber gloves. I genuinely wish someone had made the decision to omit the villain entirely and stick with the quirky and funny story about a silly bear who gets into mischief in the lovely city of London.",

I clearly had very fond memories of the little hooded bear and I was somewhat concerned the movie would be unabashedly stupid catering to contemporary younglings raised with shit TV.Paddington was not only a delight to watch but it was testament that you can make a movie for young people without being idiotic, overdoing computer animation and having to include too many trips and falls. This movie is wholesome, heartwarming and funny. You are glued to the screen for over 90 minutes and you have a grin from beginning to end. Paddington is also a reminder that the British really do have a unique talent for children's books and animation. The content is always well thought out, charming and totally British.I do have two complaints. Why on earth did Padingtun not have his yellow wellies? Also, I think the bear could have been a been fuzzier and warmer.Nit picking. Awesome movie through and through.",

    "review": "  A kindly and laugh-filled bear hug of fun family entertainment, this British production Pads a classic children's book with a generous amount of mirth, merriment, and - yes - marmalade--just not to excess. In fact, the movie gets just about everything very right, serving the storied stories for all-ages exceedingly well. Notice the words \"all-ages,\" as this is something that the movie gets right as well. From script to cast to CGI execution, this bear boasts a bite that kids AND adults will enjoy.In this PG-rated family flick, a family befriends a talking bear (voice of Ben Whishaw) at a London train station. Oh, it assumes a lot of the same attributes that plague other half-animated kid flicks...only doesn't lose its stuffing as a result. Perhaps, the production learned what NOT to do from three failed attempt at achieving the warm 'n' fuzzies. Like Alvin & the Chipmunks and The Smurfs, it uses some juvenile potty humor but - unlike them - not to the same overbearingly sickening degree (save for one scene involving toothbrushes and ear wax...ew). For the most part, Paddington keeps it classy. Like Beverly Hills Chihuahua and Marmaduke, it uses celebrity pipes and celebrity live action performances but - unlike them - not just as gratuitous sales-over-substance selling points. Rather, Paddington's beautifully chosen talent roster services the characters letter perfectly (especially Nicole Kidman playing up the big bad to a delicious degree). Like Garfield and Yogi Bear, it keeps the action modern but - unlike them - never roots itself in disposable pop culture references. Instead, Paddington assumes a classic feel, successfully positioning itself for longevity (they even recast Ben Winshaw as Paddington after Colin Firth reportedly wasn't working in the roll, which shows its dedication to quality--not marquee quantity). A lot of the credit goes to producer David Heyman, who likewise shepherded the Harry Potter series to a beloved status in moviegoers' hearts.Bottom line: Bear Neccesity",

He gets visited by a group of explorers who have a good impact on him. But his life gets turned upside down when an earthquake displaces him from his home, and he has to find a new one - in London. He's given a note, hoping that a family would take him in. Enter the Brown family - an average British family that takes him in only so they could find out what happened to the explorers that visited Paddington's family so long ago. But things get murky when a taxidermist has her eye out for the bear (and not just because of the money.)SCORING Main Characters Paddington is one great bear - he's just trying to find a new home in a strange land. SCORE: 9 Supporting Cast The Brown family is also well done - as a loving family that has problems that threaten to tear them apart. Each member has a nice quirk to him or her, and that quirk is used very well in the plot. SCORE: 9 Plot The beginning of the film has some hard to believe moments, but once Paddington gets to London, the plot really takes off. And I liked that they put some thought into the villain - she's not there just to push the plot. SCORE: 9 Originality The \"stranger in a strange land\" plot has been done before, and there might have been other recent films where a total alien (or oddball) has to join up with a human family. But this one has a lot of heart and imagination in it. SCORE: 7 Violence Factor There are a few confrontations between Paddington and the taxidermist, but it's not too scary. Maybe a little too contri9ved, but not too scary. SCORE: 8 Other Moral Issues This film does a good job on showing just how one creature can make all the difference to a family - and how a family can make all the difference to an individual. SCORE: 9Final Score (out of 60): 51 % Score: 85% It may have some ridiculous parts, but its still fun to watch.",

    "review": "  The Bear necessitiesPaddington bear is more than just a story or a toy in British society, he is an icon, he is a hallmark of England and everything it means to live in this country, so with this in mind the reel question is will this new live action animation just panda to the masses?As a child I can't really remember Paddington being a big part of my life, I remember the animated show on T.V. from somewhere and that's about it, I know for some people it was an entirely different manner, I know that for some Paddington was so important, and truly? I believe this movie has done them proud.In its essence Paddington is about a very clumsy, lovable bear and the family he lives with. It's the adventures that Paddington gets up to that really make the story come alive. He is so very clumsy and it is beautiful to watch on screen. To watch Paddington reminds me of how it must have felt to watch an incredible physical comedy actor perform like Norman Wisdom or Charlie Chaplin, to watch a master at work is always captivating. It's more than that though, Paddington appeals to us as a nation because he represents what it is to be British. The chase sequence in the film shows this best.The film is also incredibly smart and funny, it has moments of shear brilliance mixed in with all the other kinds of comedy you would imagine from a strong family event. This comes mostly from the writer Paul King (who also directs the work), he is famous for directing The Mighty Boosh. I truly believe it is only from a mind so Macabre that you could get a work as eloquent as Paddington.The other thing that Paddington has going for it is that he is so sweet as a character and Ben Whishaw presents him perfectly. Whishaw is a man who has unlimited potential, from his early beginnings here is a man who watch in the future. I know that Paddington the character is a two pronged attack, not only is it his voice but also his presence that works in tandem to create the charming young bear. The animation for Paddington is incredible, every follicle of hair is accounted for and perfect.Paddington is the sort of movie you will take your children to see when they are tiny and they will laugh and enjoy the bear, then you will watch it again with them when they are a little older, and they will laugh at the jokes and love the silliness of the bear, then again you'll watch it in their teens and they will understand the love dynamic of the family and then you'll watch it with them as adults and they will see the film for the piece of cinema it really is. This is a film that is built to last and for generations.Paddington is a family film for the entire family, it is upbeat, touching, funny and British to it's very soul.",

    "review": "  Family films which feature an adorable, computer generated character have often had mixed results. And considering the almost universal brand of the Paddington books, it would've been easy for the movie to turn out as any number of adjectives. Instead, the film we're left with is funny, sweet and pays total justice to the books that they're drawn from.When a bear from Darkest Peru embarks on a journey to the fabled city of London, he must try to find the explorer that found them in the first place.It's not an entirely new concept, pretty much the definition of a fish-out-of-water story, but that's not a detractor for the most part. For a family film, it's not like you should be trying to reinvent the wheel. What's new is the way the story is put together. Paul King displays a directorial flourish that elevates the material beyond what it could have been on the page. Beginning with a black and white documentary on the explorer finding a family of bears in Darkest Peru, King continues to find new and interesting ways to explore the ideas that the script brings up. From surreal moments when Paddington steps through a projection screen and into his homeland, to doll houses becoming the model for the building they're currently standing in. It's amazing stuff and it imbues the film with the same sense of wonder that Paddington himself exhibits. What's even more impressive is the fact that just shooting what was on the page would've been enough, and yet King constantly pushes past what's expected of him and the movie itself. King has impeccable comic timing as well, wringing every laugh he can out of the more wholly comic scenes by staging them perfectly and putting them together in a way that makes them even funnier. That's what a good director does and King's work here should instantly put him head and shoulders above his contemporaries. But Paddington is about more than gags. For the most part it's about sweetness and putting a smile on your face, and King nails these sections too. It's more than just focussing on Paddington's big brown eyes, it's the human moments that King allows to shine through. There are some action beats and they work just fine, but King is far more concerned with just making you feel the same sense of wonder that we can see in Paddington.The script seems to get that too, and with King in double-duty as writer and director, the whole thing works together to achieve that feeling. The story isn't anything new as Paddington goes around following leads in his search for the explorer from all those years ago. The unique moments stem from the set-pieces that King creates within that broader story. It's clever in the way that it takes something rote and familiar and brings new life to it through execution. Kids will be able to follow along with the story, adults will appreciate the fact that they haven't seen it thirty times already. The most daring part of the story probably comes at the start, with Darkest Peru living up to its name, but the repercussions don't overwhelm the film in the way that they threaten to early on. It's a difficult balance to keep, especially with the fact that it drives most of the story, but King gives Paddington such a warmth and childlike ability to see the good in every situation that it keeps the darkness at bay. The writing also keeps the broader segments of the film from feeling like contrivances specifically to arrive at the gag. And thankfully there are plenty of gags. As much as King focusses on the emotion of the movie, he also crams in as many jokes as he can. It keeps the film zipping along even when the story beats are getting familiar.The cast also have something to do with this, as our four family members each display their own specific characteristics and sell their gags in their own specific way. They're not an incredibly layered bunch, and nor should they be considering the target audience. But the level of detail that's been put into the group of them gives the film a depth that helps to sell the more ridiculous moments that come along. There's no bad character of the group, but the film spends a lot of time with Hugh Bonneville's Henry Brown and as a result he gets the most development of the lot. Seeing him transform from sceptically dismissive to risk-taking man of action is one of the highlights of the film, but Sally Hawkins' Mary, Madeleine Harris' Judy and Samuel Joslin's Jonathan are all given some great character beats to work with. On the fringes are the purely comic characters with Peter Capaldi's Mr. Curry and Julie Walters' Mrs. Bird as the main offenders, and they work well within the context of the film and within their specific scenes. King also manages not to overuse them, preferring to put the emphasis on the more grounded characters rather than focussing on the broader end of the spectrum. The villain of the piece is Nicole Kidman, and yes she functions well in the role, but there's nothing overtly amazing about her performance or the role itself. And then of course there's Paddington. He's a difficult character to get right, due to the huge number of books and the hugely recognisable face on the cover of them. Thankfully, King has nailed the tone and the character of his title. Paddington is funny, wistful, optimistic, well-intentioned and completely loveable, all with the classic confusion that the film's premise brings. The unaccustomed traveller in a new town brings along a number of built-in gags, but again King manages to defy expectations by not being overly reliant on them. Paddington would've been an easy cash-in for a bunch of merchandising opportunities, but instead King shapes him to be a quirky, individual creation which will connect with all members of the audience, regardless of their age.And that's really the main achievement of the film; an individual creation which will connect with all members of the audience. There are so many ways that Paddington could have been boring or overly familiar. Instead, the film is clever, funny and entirely entertaining, a heck of an achievement from the director of the Mighty Boosh. Defining Scene:The pickpocket scene was, for my money, the funniest and most inventive scene in a funny and inventive movie.",

    "review": "  What a novel concept, to make a family film that has humor for kids AND adults without being overly pandering or unnecessarily innuendo-filled. Hollywood filmmakers often think these two things are mutually exclusive (even in stuff I liked like this year's Penguins of Madagascar), but Paddington has the scent of the best of Pixar, wearing its heart and its humor on its sleeve, often simultaneously. Skillfully directed and impossibly enjoyable, it will leave you grinning from ear to ear.The story is fairly rudimentary: an uptight but well-meaning family welcomes in an eccentric guest (the form of a bear cub) and all their lives are turned upside down. You don't go to this movie for surprising story beats or unpredictable twists; instead, go for the bright colors and immense fun. Lead human adults Bonneville and Hawkins are fantastic, treating their roles with as much care as they might for any prestige job they may get. Antagonists Kidman and Capaldi are hilarious adversaries, cartooning-up their performances to wonderful pitches. Even the musical score is filled with oodles of charm.The film infamously had a fairly troubled production, with a revolving door of cast and crew members. Luckily, you would never know this by the film itself, a fantastic little nostalgia trip that harkens some of the best elements of Steven Spielberg, Chris Columbus, and Wes Anderson. Made with more style and care than most child-geared films, the sweet hilarity stems from inventive comedic-action and some spectacularly well-drawn characters. Tasteful, distinctive, and completely entertaining, Paddington is a family comedy that the WHOLE family can, not just endure but, really enjoy.",

I say all-age advisedly; this is not a children't film. A children's film will only be enjoyed by children. Paddington will be richly enjoyed by anyone with a heart, a soul and a sense of humour. We laughed a lot throughout the film; and the film's message of welcoming the different and challenging 'other' person into your heart and home community is unmistakably presented without ever ramming it down the throat. The performances are whole-hearted and engaging; the bear himself us hypnotically funny and perfectly presented. Just see it and love it.",

But the cartoon turned out to be just a kid story.The story begins in South American jungle, where a British adventurer meets a couple of talking bears. At once they become friends. Many years later the bears' nephew launches upon a journey to London (because his uncle dies and his aunt is going to home of elderly bears) in a quest to find the adventurer. The little bear gets lost on the Paddington station (That is why later he was given the name Paddington), but a nice-looking family picks him up and helps him in his mission. Turns out, that the adventurer had been expelled from the geographical community when he returned from the jungle because he did not bring any trofeys from his journey (like stuffed bears) and that his daughter is now on a quest to correct her father's mistake by killing the little bear. Of course, the good prevails in the end.I personally enjoyed the plot though. It is thought-through and is suprisingly original for such cartoons. I would really recommend you to watch it with your kid, for all the kids around us were amazed. They were laughing and yelling etc. Beautifully-drawn, this cartoon is only of interest to kids of age 12 and younger.",

    "review": "  [slight spoilers] Paddington is a really beautiful film. Taking a lot of inspiration from successful modern classics (several shots are humorous recreations of recognizable film moments), Paddington is light, friendly, and fun.The movie takes several opportunities to show off London as a modern metropolis where the white people are as busy and eccentric as you'd expect from any Brit, while the colored people are free to smile and play music! Stereotypes aside, Paddington demonstrates the stunning modernity that's tucked in with London's tidy, elegant past. It's very much an advertisement for your tourist dollars. This is all fine and dandy, however, because the movie is brilliantly shot. The cinematography is continuously exciting while the editing moves the film at a brisk pace the whole way through. Add this to the beautiful score and you have a very well produced film.All in all, I walked away happy, but not entirely satisfied. I still felt bad for Paddington - he still had his aunt to write and he had found a home in London, but surely something more than marmalade is needed for closure. This bear experienced a lot of loss. I'm hoping for more adventures with Paddington in the future, but I'm not holding my breath. For now, it's good to see that London can still find love for strangers, even if they are bears. :)",

That's what a good director does and King's work here should instantly put him head and shoulders above his contemporaries. But Paddington is about more than gags. For the most part it's about sweetness and putting a smile on your face, and King nails these sections too. It's more than just focussing on Paddington's big brown eyes, it's the human moments that King allows to shine through. There are some action beats and they work just fine, but King is far more concerned with just making you feel the same sense of wonder that we can see in Paddington.The script seems to get that too, and with King in double-duty as writer and director, the whole thing works together to achieve that feeling. The story isn't anything new as Paddington goes around following leads in his search for the explorer from all those years ago. The unique moments stem from the set-pieces that King creates within that broader story. It's clever in the way that it takes something rote and familiar and brings new life to it through execution. Kids will be able to follow along with the story, adults will appreciate the fact that they haven't seen it thirty times already. The most daring part of the story probably comes at the start, with Darkest Peru living up to its name, but the repercussions don't overwhelm the film in the way that they threaten to early on. It's a difficult balance to keep, especially with the fact that it drives most of the story, but King gives Paddington such a warmth and childlike ability to see the good in every situation that it keeps the darkness at bay. The writing also keeps the broader segments of the film from feeling like contrivances specifically to arrive at the gag. And thankfully there are plenty of gags. As much as King focusses on the emotion of the movie, he also crams in as many jokes as he can. It keeps the film zipping along even when the story beats are getting familiar.The cast also have something to do with this, as our four family members each display their own specific characteristics and sell their gags in their own specific way. They're not an incredibly layered bunch, and nor should they be considering the target audience. But the level of detail that's been put into the group of them gives the film a depth that helps to sell the more ridiculous moments that come along. There's no bad character of the group, but the film spends a lot of time with Hugh Bonneville's Henry Brown and as a result he gets the most development of the lot. Seeing him transform from sceptically dismissive to risk-taking man of action is one of the highlights of the film, but Sally Hawkins' Mary, Madeleine Harris' Judy and Samuel Joslin's Jonathan are all given some great character beats to work with. On the fringes are the purely comic characters with Peter Capaldi's Mr. Curry and Julie Walters' Mrs. Bird as the main offenders, and they work well within the context of the film and within their specific scenes. King also manages not to overuse them, preferring to put the emphasis on the more grounded characters rather than focussing on the broader end of the spectrum. The villain of the piece is Nicole Kidman, and yes she functions well in the role, but there's nothing overtly amazing about her performance or the role itself. And then of course there's Paddington. He's a difficult character to get right, due to the huge number of books and the hugely recognisable face on the cover of them. Thankfully, King has nailed the tone and the character of his title. Paddington is funny, wistful, optimistic, well-intentioned and completely loveable, all with the classic confusion that the film's premise brings. The unaccustomed traveller in a new town brings along a number of built-in gags, but again King manages to defy expectations by not being overly reliant on them. Paddington would've been an easy cash-in for a bunch of merchandising opportunities, but instead King shapes him to be a quirky, individual creation which will connect with all members of the audience, regardless of their age.And that's really the main achievement of the film; an individual creation which will connect with all members of the audience. There are so many ways that Paddington could have been boring or overly familiar. Instead, the film is clever, funny and entirely entertaining, a heck of an achievement from the director of the Mighty Boosh. Defining Scene:The pickpocket scene was, for my money, the funniest and most inventive scene in a funny and inventive movie.",

    "review": "  I loved this movie! The character animation is wonderful, and the story is cute and childlike. I was actually surprised to see Nicole Kidman up on the screen - I admit I hadn't really looked that closely at the cast before seeing the movie. She does a great job as her character, but to me she stuck out as the very recognizable face in a cast of characters played by actors I was not familiar with from other movies. It's not her fault, of course, if I've seen her other work; she's terrific in this movie.The other human characters, all played by actors I didn't immediately recognize, all manage to be individually interesting, which is a great thing to say for a movie. You would almost like to follow each of the children, their parents, even their slightly weird bachelor next-door neighbor around for a day to see what they do with themselves. It would have been easy enough to just have the cute CGI bear in there and leave the human characters as not much more than furniture so the sets don't look bare - this movie does not suffer that problem.Some adults might take issue with a few parts which have dreamy, imaginative qualities to them - for example, Paddington steps right through a screen showing a film of his home in Darkest Peru and it's like he's home again. In another part, some decorative trees painted on a wall first lose the (painted-on) flowers blooming on them, and then the flowers sprout again. I don't think kids are confused by this kind of stuff; I think this sort of subtle imaginative flourish is something they can both understand and embrace. I asked my first-grader about those two specific parts, and she had exactly the same reaction to Paddington walking through the screen that I had - at first, we thought Paddington actually had walked through the screen, then we realized he was thinking about his home. (The flowers on the tree went over her head, but she seems to have just let it slide.)There aren't a huge number of movies I would pay to see again - this one, given a good reason (like to share it with another child or someone else who would appreciate it) I would pay again to see this one.",

    "review": "  Exactly what it needs to be, Paddington bear is earnest, kind-hearted, charming, and - I'm man enough to say it - adorable. In fact, I'll go as far as saying the film is \"totes adorbs\". Endlessly creative in form, writer/director Paul King finds fascinating and inventive ways to show this old story in a new and fresh way. It looks absolutely fantastic, and the bears look so life like you'll find yourself second guessing whether there really was a talking bear on set.But what King does so well in modernizing this story is that he never loses the heart of the film. With a great performance from Ben Whishaw, King is able to portray Paddington as a sweet character who is just looking for his place in the world. Instead of undercutting the charm and wit of the film by poking fun at its own concept of a talking bear, King embraces the storybook nature of the film, and it pays off for him in spades. The film's unique look will transport children to the world of Paddington bear in a way that will feel like its ripped from a bedtime story.King is so perfect at dealing with every aspect of the film that nothing seems to go unnoticed. Every character is fleshed out and has a rewarding sub plot, and the supporting cast is just perfect. From Nicole Kidman's deliciously evil villain to Sally Hawkins loveable mother trying her best to keep her family together to Hugh Bonneville as the helicopter parent who learns to embrace a little bit of chaos, every performance hits every note perfectly. They're well-equipped to handle the physical comedy, the one-liners, and the emotional moments, and so these people feel like family that you grow to love.There's even some great subtext throughout the film about accepting strangers to your country and allowing them to find a place of their own. There are a few jokes about colonialism/imperialism that I found absolutely wonderful and subversive for a children's film. It's a movie that is much smarter than it needs to be, and I'm so thankful that it is. Because Paddington doesn't just tug on your heart strings, but it also engages with your mind in a way not many children's films can. If you have young children please do not miss out on this, you'll enjoy it just as much as they will.",

    "review": "  Paddington is a very old school family film, which is a good thing. It doesn't meddle with juvenile humor or cheap gags--save for maybe a brief wall-scaling incident. But it remains honest to its purpose of bringing the beloved book series to life on the big screen without sacrificing its integrity for a \"21st century touch\".Yeah, sure, it's completely predictable, but we really don't care. Paddington is just too lovable and this story is just so sweet and innocent. And there aren't really any concerning plot holes, which are common in films of this nature. I did notice that it borrows heavily--whether intentionally or not--from 1992's Beethoven. However, that film was so long ago that Paddington still receives it's own identity from having such a great backstory and a charming lead. Most of all, the movie never tries to be anything that it's not. It's classy and refreshing.Twizard Rating: 96",

    "review": "  I rarely give a full-throated approval (in the form of five stars), but this one definitely fits the bill. Not only is it a charming story with some great use of CG and a truly \"human\" looking family (not every one of us has perfect bodies or teeth, ya know), but the story presented is perfect for both its target audience (young children) and its \"captive\" audience (their parents).For the adults, it is a trip back in time to the sort of slapstick comedy of the Three Stooges, the Marx Brothers, or Laurel and Hardy. For the kids, it is an ideal blend of comedy, drama, and action that is suited to their level. Very well done.",

I really didn't know anything about the source material but the trailer was funny and Akia wanted to see it so we figured we would give it a shot. At times I laughed a lot but others I rolled my eyes at the silliness. There is some weird British humor throughout and some may enjoy that but it really isn't my cup of tea.

I always found them to be rather boring and lifeless.This movie, on the other hand, is truly witty and charming. A movie that has elements that appeal to kids and adults alike. Nicole Kidman deserves a special mention as she is simply delightful here. The animation is top notch and impressive.:ttle comments here and there about how modernity has made Britain (and other metropolis) less welcoming to foreigners is a nice touch. A very nice mix of drama, comedy and social commentary all in one told in an approachable, fun and heart warming manner that disarms and charms all.",

    "review": "  A cute and surprisingly touching family movie that attempts to overreach the capabilities of its script to become an instant classic.\"Paddington\" is the latest in a long line of adaptations based on the lovable little bear from the Children's book series that began in the 1950s. This one stars the likes of Sally Hawkins, Hugh Bonneville, Peter Capaldi, Nicole Kidman, and Ben Whishaw as Paddington and tells the story of the childhood favorite bear who, after being forced out of his homelands of darkest Peru, heads to the city of London in search of an explorer that had discovered and taught his aunt and uncle years earlier. Upon arriving in the city he meets the Brown family who take him in much to the chagrin of Mr. Brown (Bonneville), a well meaning yet over protective risk assessment specialist. The family all eventually warm up to him and help him search for the explorer in hopes of finding closure for him, meanwhile however there is a vindictive female taxidermist searching for Paddington for unknown reasons.Going into this film I knew little more about the property than there was a television show from the 80s about it and I hadn't followed much of the films production. I was however aware of the recent last minute voice casting switch (Colin Firth out in favor of Whishaw) made within the last six months and that didn't really give me much hope. Nonetheless I went in with an open mind and I have to admit....I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not going to say it was an amazing movie, I can't even say it was anything that I will ever have the desire to see again (though I wouldn't be opposed), but it was a cute and enjoyable way to spend 95 minutes of my day. Through the utilization of beautiful transitions and movements director Paul King directs the movie in a way that greatly spotlights the magic in the world and goes a long way in making the film what it is. However, it is this style of attempting to create a magical instant classic that goes furthest in exposing the formulaic script riddled with cliches. From the typical 4 member family where the wife and youngest child take an instant liking to the outsider protagonist while the father and elder child are slower to come around to the outsider, to the vengeful villainous plot it is hard to call this films core script anything more than template B in structure. The film does feature a high amount of both clean adult and clean family humor in it and unlike many family films released in the modern era, and I would be lying if I said I didn't find myself laughing and smiling through out the film. Overall, while successfully overcoming what seemed to be countless things working against it and providing a thoroughly enjoyable experience Paddington suffers from a cliche script and fails to become the classic it so desperately attempts to be.",

That was what I thought when I saw them for the first time, but here me out. After seeing it get a whopping 98% rating on Rottentomatoes,com and reading some reviews of some critics I respect, I thought this would be a good one to take Owen to since we went to Spokane over the weekend and what is there to do in the big city when the weather is $hity and you want to drop 29 bucks on a movie. I actually found myself liking the movie despite myself. It has the charm and heart and the bear looks real. I would be interested to see how they did that. In the end, I think Jenni and I liked it more than Owen. Sometimes surprises are good.",

Great humor and a wonderful turn by Downton's Hugh Bonneville solidify it as a modern day classic. I only had a few reservations about how a message could be interpreted towards the end.",

Out of nowhere we receive a January film that jumps right from the screen and puts a smile on your face. Once a bear loses his father and is abandoned by his mother, he but fend for himself and find a new home in London. Meeting a family whom he begins to love, this picture deals with family loves and hardships throughout, while still managing to keep a consistently humorous tone. I must say, for most of this film, I was loving every second, until Nicole Kidman \"kidded\" it up a bit too much. She was fun to watch in the film, but her storyline felt the most tired and boring. Overall, \"Paddington\" is probably the best January film you will see this month and I highly recommend it. What a pleasant surprise!",

While the plot had its formulaic aspect, the expressiveness of the bear's eyes and voice and the watchableness of the bear's human \"mother\" provided total enjoyment. I loved the aesthetic and loving fantasy element all the way through that reminded you to suspend belief when watching a child-bear speak English and have a series of unlikely adventures. This is most enjoyable children's movie that I've seen in a long time. If your children are younger than 5, they might be scared by the villain. I myself was feeling strong anxiety for the child-bear at many moments, making the happy ending all the more rewarding.",

    "review": "  I truly believe that the British sometimes do things better and with class. Case in point: PADDINGTON. I read the books as a child and was excited for this live action adaptation. One the surface, the movie looks like your average family film with a cute CGI bear getting into trouble. While the movie has some comedic moments, it is hardly slapstick. Paddington himself is a cute, charming, and polite bear that is very likable the moment you see him. The CGI is amazing and as far as talking bears from Peru go, he is the most realistic bear to be put on screen. The story is surprisingly sweet with the human cast doing a fine job. Nicole Kidman plays the villain, but you never feel like she is just another villain. There is backstory and her motives make sense for her character. Paddington's adopted family are also have their quirks. Each member has their own problems and I like how they are not shown as a perfect family. Paddington himself is well-voiced by Ben Whishaw, who gives the bear a curious, yet respectable voice. The movie doesn't shy away from some serious moments and when you realize how it relates to Paddington, it makes you engross in this little bear's journey to find a home. I enjoyed this movie very much. It has a little something for the kids and the adults and it is one of those films that the whole family can watch. Along with the witty one-liners, creative direction and a title character who is just darn charming, I had a smile on my face from start to finish. This is the type of children's film that doesn't have to rely on fart jokes, slapstick, and crude humor to be entertaining.Grade: A",

I was afraid the filmmakers would potentially sacrifice the more timeless elements of Paddington's story by making a film that focuses on how a naive bear faces \"novel\" new technologies that will be quickly outdated. This would follow suit with many fish out of water stories concerning anthropomorphized animals in modern cities. I was pleased to find this is not the case with \"Paddington,\" as it crafts an immensely satisfying narrative with clever humour and an elegantly English whimsy.",

Ben Whinshaw gives a great vocal performance as Paddington as well as the other bear characters Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon. The cast is just well put together with some of the very best brits that aren't Benedict Cumberbatch like Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins that I usually don't like but she impressed me here. Nicole Kidman is fun as a villain for a change I hope she takes more fun villain roles. If you put Jim Broadbent on screen and give him anything to say, i'll enjoy something out of your movie, he is just so delightful. Peter Capaldi is also very good and Julie Walters in Julie Walters fashion steals the show. Paddington is beautifully animated and the animators get to show off during a montage of taking a bath and his hair styles changing and also the scene that is in the trailer when Paddington floods that house. The score was fun, the production design and art direction were colorful and fun, and even the cinematography shined. It does a similar shot from The Life Aquatic where the camera does a tracking shot of each room of the house as if they lived in a doll house and they did it really well. I think kids will love it as well as adults and I would not complain if we see a franchise out of this",

    "review": "  \"Paddington\" is the newest cinematic adaptation of the book about the cute, loveable, talking bear who stows away on a cargo ship from Peru to find a family and a new life in jolly old England. A woman (Sally Hawkins) sees him at the train station and agrees to take him in until they can find a suitable home for him. In the meantime, a taxidermist for the Natural History museum (Nicole Kidman) is hunting Paddington down to try to turn him into a stuffed exhibit. The movie is very wholesome and heartfelt on the whole. It feels like a complete movie with natural-flowing humor that doesn't force slapstick, punchy one-liners or sell out for cheap laughs. It has a very old-fashioned approach to moviemaking, but many of Paddington's shenanigans will still elicit laughs from the audience. This is a cute family film that people of all ages can enjoy in every sense of the word. Even though the movie is somewhat predictable and formulaic, I did not feel this approach detracted from the film's execution. Though I feel the relationship between Paddington and the Brown family progressed unusually fast, I think it had the right amount of authenticity to show the positive impact the bear had on their lives, and how they managed to soften the uptight father. Paddington is a very likeable character, and the fact that he is freaking adorable doesn't hurt his case with audiences either. It is surprising to see a film of this caliber in January, and I hope the rest of the year brings successes like this film ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- A-",

Perfectly paced, brilliantly cast and acted and cleverly written, it's not just great family entertainment, it's great entertainment, period.

    "review": "  In spite of enjoying myself thoroughly during the screening, I cannot quite sign on to a full-throated endorsement. My reservations are quite specific, and may not bother other people (though I wish they would). Namely, I find it inexcusable, in 2015, even if adapting a book written in 1958, when cultural attitudes were different, that one should continually - especially if one belongs to a former colonial power like Great Britain - use the phrase \"darkest Peru\" over and over again, without irony, to describe the country of origin of the titular main character. And secondly - and again in 2015 - to make a movie set in London an extremely ethnically diverse city, where the only people who are not white and English are the members of a calypso band that appears occasionally as both soundtrack and Greek chorus is, to my mind, worse than inexcusable. But hey, other than that, the movie is charming.It's also, however, a bit derivative, as it opens with a cute historical scratched-print black & white documentary movie of the exploits of the (white, British) explorer who first discovers the intelligent bears of \"darkest Peru,\" recalling the equally charming opener of Pixar's 2009 \"Up.\" Once that intro established, we find ourselves in the jungle, years later and now in color, where those same bears - a childless male and female, who live with a young nephew - have learned to speak English (and enjoy marmalade) thanks to books and other items left behind by the aforementioned explorer. They live an idyllic (and beautifully designed) existence in a lovely tree house where they can make marmalade to their heart's content, and where their nephew (soon to be renamed Paddington) runs free and joyful. Soon, however, disaster strikes, the idyll is shattered, and the young nephew takes off for England, where, the explorer had told his aunt and uncle, the bears would always be welcome.And so our hero (voiced with perfect diction and oodles of charisma by Ben Whishaw - Q in \"Skyfall\") finds himself adrift in London, but not for long. A returning family of vacationers - with the wonderful Hugh Bonneville (Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham, on \"Downton Abbey\") and Sally Hawkins (\"Blue Jasmine\") its patriarch and matriarch - finds the bear in Paddington Station, give him his new name, and take him home (ostensibly temporarily). Soon, thanks to the nefarious machinations of a mysterious villain played with great relish by a remarkably game Nicole Kidman (\"Stoker\"), both family and bear find themselves embroiled in a dangerous adventure. Will they survive? Well, it's a kids' movie. What do you expect?Well choreographed and with remarkable CGI effects for the bears (Paddington's fur, in particular, continued to amaze me, especially as it moved in the wind), the movie should be fun and exciting for most audiences. And if you don't mind the (probably unconscious, but no less palatable) colonial attitudes of the filmmakers, then you'll have an even better time than I did. Be sure to bring some marmalade for the little ones.",

    "review": "  Who'd of thunk that walking, talking bears would be more civilized and less murderous than walking, talking apes? It's just one of the questions that come up during \"Paddington\", a movie you kinda half-watch while you're delighted that your kids have found something to distract themselves from karaoke-ing \"Let it Go\" from Frozen for the thousandth time. Basically it's harmless, kinda funny, and very charming. The title character is a descendant of a line of \"special bears\" living in a Peruvian forest, taught to talk and have a love of marmalade by a London explorer on safari. He leaves, but says that if any of the bears ever want to visit him in London, they can expect a warm welcome. Many years later when their tree-house style homes are destroyed (we expect some moralizing on deforestation but it never comes), the title character is sent away by boat to London to try and find a new one, where he meets the Brown family at Paddington station.  No one in the bustling city seems particularly baffled to see a walking, talking bear nor does anyone question it when the title character says his aunt (voiced by Imelda Staunton) and Uncle (voiced by Michael Gambon) have regular names while he has a bear name sounding something like a roar and a belch. What's it matter if it could get a quick laugh out of the kids. It's more funny than the human name he's given, Paddington (voiced by Ben Whishaw in a very gentle, genial way that makes it hard to see how originally cast Colin Firth could have possibly done the same).  The Brown family is one like many others. Mr. Brown (Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville, getting the best jokes and telling them with stodgy perfection) is an overprotective risk assessor whose job and worry for his children have turned him dull. His wife (Sally Hawkins) is a much more nurturing sort who convinces him to take Paddington in, despite Mr. Brown's continued reluctance. And the kids (Samuel Joslin, Madeleine Harris) are in the pre-teen stages where parents hanging around is embarrassing but having a bear around is kinda cool.  Nicole Kidman shows up here as a \"Cruella DeVille\" style villain after Paddington. That's about it for plot. Expect quite a bit of physical comedy (a scene where Paddington creates havoc in the Brown's bathroom is something right out of Mr. Bean), some that just feels lazy (Paddington gets wrapped up in tape), some gross stuff for the kids, and some cheesy gags like a GPS telling a driver to bare left and then...hey, there's Paddington. It's pretty sanitized comedy, thankfully stripped of any pop culture jokes or dumbed down characters.  And it's a charmer too. In one scene a character, played by James Broadbent, eloquently says that the body reaches the home quick, but \"the heart takes a little longer.\" It's a beautiful sentiment that's easy to understand and describes the driving soul behind pretty much all of \"Paddington\". It might be aimed more toward kids, but it has universal themes, and it earns its lovability too much to judge it too harshly for its flaws.",

    "review": "  began to build earlier this week when the British Board of Film Classification announced that Paddington, the new film based on Michael Bond's much-loved series of children's books, had been rated PG for \"dangerous behaviour, mild threat, mild sex references and mild bad language\".What on earth had happened, we wondered, to this fuzzy emblem of childhood? Had movie-stardom gone to his marmalade-tousled head? Had the grizzly turned a bit . . . well, grisly? Were we about to see Paddington bare?Call off the riots and hashtag campaigns. Here's the good news: the new version of Paddington, brought beautifully to life by Ben Whishaw and the digital artists at the visual effects house Framestore, is every bit as sweet and charming as Bond's original creation. (With respect to Colin Firth, who left the role in June after it was decided he wasn't quite right for it, Whishaw's hot-tea-and-honey voice is so ideal that it's impossible to imagine anyone else ever being considered.)Related ArticlesWATCH Paddington on the red carpet at the world premiere 19 Nov 2014Paddington Bear: picture special 10 Jun 2014Paddington producer David Heyman: 'I still have my teddy bear' 23 Nov 2014Paddington: bearing all 19 Nov 2014And now, the even better news: the film around him is a total delight, as warm and welcome as a hot pair of socks on a winter morning. It's also enormously funny in an unmistakably British way: the overall effect is something like a Children's Film Foundation adventure styled by Wes Anderson and written by Peter Cook.Because this is 2014, there's also a back-story. Paddington opens with crackling newsreel footage of an expedition to Darkest Peru, in which an explorer with a reassuring moustache, played by Tim Downie, happens on a family of bears with a liking for fruit preserves and an unexpected flair for languages. Flash forward many years, and Paddington is collecting oranges for his Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo (voiced by Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon) to make a new batch of marmalade, when an earthquake - mild threat! - destroys the family nest.It's the nudge that our ursine hero needs to strike out on his own, and he heads via cargo ship for London: a place the explorer had promised his aunt and uncle would always extend a warm welcome to bears.The first Paddington book was published in 1958, when the image of young evacuees standing on railway platforms with a suitcase each and labels around their necks was still fresh in the British collective consciousness, and director Paul King and his co-writer Hamish McColl make sure that resonance isn't lost. It's there when Paddington first encounters the Brown family, and even more so, with an unexpected pang of sadness, when he meets the antique shop owner Mr Gruber (Jim Broadbent), a refugee of Hitler's Germany in Bond's original books, who reflects here on his own fateful journey to London that began at a railway station.It's a flash of seriousness in the middle of a typical sequence of chocolate-box fun - we've just watched a model train pop out of Mr Gruber's grandfather clock, chug its way around the parlour, then pull up on the coffee table with a boiler full of freshly brewed tea and a tender piled with sugar. But it shows how sincerely King's film has engaged with Bond's creation, and how committed it is to leaving behind a sprinkling of ideas once the hi jinks have ended.Savour, too, the film's ingenious use of Notting Hill as a setting: far from the stylishly tatty, white-upper-middle-class game preserve of Richard Curtis's frenzied imaginings, Paddington embraces the area's famous melting-pot vibrancy, which allows even a bear from a few hundred miles outside Lima to feel at home. While Paddington pads around the neighbourhood, he often crosses paths with a Cuban son band, whose music, at once brilliantly idiosyncratic and perfectly in place, chimes with the mood. \"In London nobody's alike, which means everyone fits in,\" he muses later on, and there are worse lessons for children to learn from a film than that.But serious as Paddington is about meaning something, it's even more serious about the business of having fun. King's background in television comedy (he directed The Mighty Boosh and Come Fly With Me) clearly pays off in many sequences of precision-timed slapstick, some of which involve a very game Nicole Kidman as a fanatical taxidermist - even milder threat! - with a rare specimen in her crosshairs.Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins, meanwhile, light up the whole production as Mr and Mrs Brown, two imperfect parents with transparently good intentions, and light-years removed from the annoying, uncool mother/father stereotype. They're also both very amusing: a sequence in which Bonneville infiltrates a library while dressed as a cleaning lady, and is forced to make small talk with fuckin hilarious Simon Farnaby's affectionate desk clerk (cue the gentler-than-gentle sex references, wisely downgraded last night by the BBFC to \"innuendo\") is pure Peter Cook, and one of the funniest things I've seen this year.The film's big finish at the Natural History Museum is perhaps a little schematic, and you long for even more Peter Capaldi as the Browns' miserable neighbour Mr Curry, but these are quibbles, not problems, and hardly take the shine off. At best, I'd hoped a Paddington film would leave me with a smile and a nostalgic tingle. I didn't expect to laugh myself half-silly and feel a renewed ache of love for the city I call home. The instruction \"please look after this bear\" has been heeded.

    "review": "  Serving as one of the most critically acclaimed children's films of 2014, Paddington sounded like a delightful romp.The thing about Paddington is that it is a British film and so it's humour falls into that category. Normally I love British humour, but British children's humour is something I am new to and I didn't find it as funny as i might have hoped it would be. Part of it is that I was not familiar with the Paddington books prior to seeing the film and therefore didn't grow up with it which means that it didn't have the same relevance to me that it did to its English viewers. To put it blankly, due to unfamiliarity I was not a fan of Paddington and so the film was all new to me. I admit that I enjoyed it, but the children's book style of he film was one that took some adjusting too. Paddington handles its material like a cartoon to stay true to the storybook fashion of the source material which is impressive in some ways, but it makes the film very cheesy as well which not everyone would be able to grasp. Those who can will love the film, but it is a very child oriented feature which didn't exactly hit all the marks for me. What was weird for me was the tone of the film. Paddington is a film which tries not to take itself seriously and remain a child friendly romp, yet so much of the story seems rather serious with some dark connotations along the line. The film is the journey of a friendly talking bear as he searches for a home and deals with all kinds of strange situations along the way, and I'll admit that the nature of the storytelling was very effective. It went through the same generic sentimentality that viewers will have seen countless times before and was entertaining more when it found ways to have fun with the story instead of trying to jerk tears out of its viewers. But it all felt somewhat strange to me because I didn't know whether to take the story seriously or see it all for comic value. The inconsistent tone of the film made it a rather strange experience in some ways, and although as a whole I had appreciation for the general style and the humour, it was mostly at a sporadic rate. All I can say is that people unfamiliar with the Paddington books or who aren't accustomed to British family humour will find an all new experience in Paul King's adaptation of the 1958 character's story. Whether or not they will like it is the question.For me, Paddington was mostly a good film because of its general style. Paul King's directorial work on the film was strong because he managed to make the venture a lighthearted one, even if it went into dark territory at times. The entire time it felt like imagery coming straight out of a storybook which gave the film an effective style and a sense of life and colour. I'll admit I wasn't as amazed as I might have been if I were a child, but Paddington doesn't try to be breakthrough. It just tries to be good, and more often than not it is able to succeed. Paddington is a very good looking film with a lot of creative cinematography put in play to capture the versatile collection of scenery in the background. And imposed over the screen is strong animation used to depict the titular character Paddington with visual effects all very strong, giving the character his own organic movements and maintaining his naturally cute demeanour. The general manner in which Paddington characterises its titular character is nice because it is so gentle in its approach, ensuring that he remains a well-meaning character who succumbs to his animal tendencies occasionally as part of the film's humour. Granted, it may not always be funny, but Paddington is in fact a good character who is really lovable and has the ability to appeal to young viewers in a Winnie the Pooh type manner. Ben Whishaw manages to do a strong job voicing the character by grasping the gentle tone of voice which makes Paddington the sweet young bear that he is famous for, and he is able to get the humour and the sentimentality correct in his articulation.Although it takes a while to get into the character, Hugh Bonneville eventually makes a welcome lead for Paddington. As the main human character in the film, he makes a duo with Paddington and the two share a strong chemistry. Hugh Bonneville acts alongside Paddington as if he is more than just a creation of visual effects which is impressive, and through that any the many comic situations of the film, Hugh Bonneville manages to keep up with them very nicely. Hugh Bonneville makes a capable comic foil in Paddington.Nicole Kidman is surprisingly perfect for the role of antagonist Millicent Clyde. Though the actress has drifted in recent years, she finds a lot of energy in her role in Paddington and fits the role perfectly. As the cheesy villain of the film, Nicole Kidman uses her blank face and dead cold stare to project a sense of evil in the role. She fits the profile immaculately, remaining confident in her physical movements and delivering her lines with strong voice articulation. Nicole Kidman is able to embrace the childish style of Paddington and just go with it, making it one of her finer performances from recent years.Sally Hawkins projects a likable presence, and Matt Lucas' cameo was a nice touch, though I say that as a fan of Little Britain.So although Paddington is a bit much on the sentimentality and inconsistent in terms of tone, it is a stylish film which is funny enough to entertain and features strong visual effects as well as a talented array of cast members lined up to perform.",

    "review": "  Good natured and clumsy bear from Darkest Peru lands himself in London after an earthquake kills his uncle; his ageing auntie sends him there to look for relatives of the explorer that visited the area and befriended them both years ago. The Browns, a family of Londoners, find him alone and vulnerable in Paddington and \"adopt him\" and rename him after the popular station. He brings with him disorganization, kindness and love to marmalade and everything British. The crash with the tidy lives of the Browns is remarkable and comic. But somebody else in London is looking for him, taxidermist Millicent wants to find extraordinary obscure new species of animals to stuff and display at the Natural History Museum...An engaging film for the young ones with funny slapstick scenes of utter chaos and destruction and tender and heart-warming dialogues full of charm; children are going to love it and adults will too just as soon as they get past the talking bear that doesn't need a Visa to reside in Britain. The story is well concocted and entertaining but simple enough for the kids to follow. Don't miss it in the cinema.",

    "review": "  Paddington is a hugely cherised character, so making a live-action film of the most adorable bear in the world has been quite a risk. Forunately director Paul King has clearly an immense amount of reverence for the furball, and in terms of the character itself the film succeeds admirably. The animation is lively and beautiful, and Ben Whishaw's vocal performance is wonderful. But everything else around the character is amiss, like Sally Hawkins' annoying performance, Nicole Kidman's cartoonish villain, Jim Broadbent's awfully goofy accent, and the excessive mawkishness. There are only a couple truly funny jokes, but mostly the humor is uninspired and the old lessons about taking care of outcasts and learning to accept different people as who they are all too familiar. Paddington is one of those family comedies that will certainly appeal to children, but grown-up audiences will find disappointment. Nostalgia won't help either.",

So off I went, still with some trepidation as, let's face it, I nor my companions are the target audience for this film... and I was proven right. While the film is a very decent adaptation of the beloved book/TV series, retaining and winking knowingly at all the details that made the original so endearing; even with an above average stab at the CGI bear, it never transcends being a nice British film for the kids. It is sweet and polite with a decent cast of British thesps and comedians doing respectable turns and a mild menace in the form of a gamed Nicole Kidman playing a second-hand Cruella de Vil. The drama is never too engaging and the comedy is more slapstick and clumsy tomfoolery. The best thing here is the imaginative and colourful art and set designs and while Ben Whishaw doing the voice of Paddington is probably a prudent last minute change (I simply cannot imagine what the Colin Firth version would sound like) but at times it does feel like I'm listening to Q narrating the film.",

    "review": "  With the Christmas holidays upon us, so too is an array of kiddie-friendly flicks, beginning with this very British adventure designed to adore the socks off kids and adults alike. Based on the immensely popular talking bear of the title, this modern update could have been saccharine, morally burdensome and unbearable for anyone older than 8. But in striking a fantastic balance between old-fashioned innocence and contemporary sensibilities, writer-director Paul King has dished up a motion picture that is fun, light-hearted and just plain sweet. He's helped by a game cast: be it the affable pair of Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins as Paddington's adopted guardians, the gleefully menacing Nicole Kidman as a malevolent taxidermist, or amusing old- timers Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent who light up the screen with their eclectic supporting characters. Yet nobody can outshine the cute little fur-ball at the centre of proceedings. Voiced by Ben Whishaw (after an 11th hour change from Colin Firth) and carefully crafted with CGI, ol' Paddy is utterly delightful and a wonderful companion for 95 minutes. There are flaws to be found and the laughs may not come thick and fast, but Paddington will melt the heart of even the toughest cynic.",

    "review": "  As a growing up kid with the love for reading (staying near a library helped alot), I did stumble upon this talking bear who wears a red hat & blue coat about twice or thrice, mainly the upon insistence of my dad, in order to prevent me from the usual DC/Marvel comic books I use to pick up. Back in 2007, when the film was first announced, I was generally confused about the direction the film would take, & having seen other animated kid friendly characters turning into live action disasters such as Alvin & The Chipmunks series (Even though the 1st wasn't all that bad, the sequels oh god no!), The Smurfs, Marmaduke, Garfield etc, made me more reluctant and hesitant as to what I was due to view; Colin Firth's dropping from the project added to my concerns. To my joy, the film was very far from a disaster! Indeed, its one of the most delightful family films I have seen in a while. The story begins in Darkest Peru, where a young bear (voiced perfectly by Ben Whishaw) lives happily with his Aunt Lucy (Imelda Staunton) and Uncle Pastuzo (Michael Gambon). He inherits from them a healthy love for marmalade and London, as well as a floppy, red felt hat left behind decades ago by English explorer Montgomery Clyde. When an earthquake destroys their idyllic home, Aunt Lucy urges her nephew to strike out to London. Many jars of marmalade later, he finds himself in the iconic train station that gives him his name. He meets the Brown family: risk- averse Henry (Hugh Bonneville), lovely Mary (Sally Hawkins) and their children, Judy (Madeleine Harris) and Jonathan (Samuel Joslin). With Henry insisting that Paddington can only stay while he looks for a more permanent home, the bear begins investigations in London - unaware that Millicent, an obsessive, crazy taxidermist (Nicole Kidman), has very specific reasons for wanting him to visit her museum while enlisting help of the Brown family's weird neighbor Mr Curry (Peter Capaldi). The CGI representation of our titular bear is wonderfully delightful. His expressions and mannerisms are spot on. Strictly speaking, there isn't anything all that new or original about Paddington. We've seen the trope many times before - in trying to find a new home, a misfit changes the hearts and minds of the people who will eventually become his family. The narrative of the film is also little more than a patchwork of wacky accidents: the bathroom flooding scene; apprehension of a pick pocket; the infiltrate the top-secret Geographers' Guild. And yet, King has crafted something quite charming and magical around the bare bones of his story. He has updated and deepened the story to give the elder Browns their own emotional arc rather than just focusing on the bear. Most importantly, King has infused the entire film with joyous strains of comedy, slight gags, wit & parodies of other works. The sharp script and stunning visuals would mean little without an accomplished cast - Hugh Bonneville & Sally Hawkins are the soul of the film, its pretty clear they were enjoying themselves enormously. However, Nicole Kidman is the ultimate scene stealer. Her good looks & maniac performance reminds us how an actress can still remain wonderful even after so many years despite a string of flops. Peter Capaldi (Doctor Who) gets his own hilarious moments as well. Director Paul King has given us a story that is simple and easy to follow, but full of momentum. The characters are all well-drawn, sympathetic, and well played. On the whole 'Paddington' is a very well-executed adaptation of the titular bear for a 21st century audience. Its a perfect family friendly film which is heart-warming and humorous without being too over-sentimental. It doesn't matter whether you're a fan of the books, or someone who knew only the cuddly soft toy or the animated escapades, Paddington is a big, warm bear hug of a film, that will surely delight fans of all ages.",

    "review": "  \"It doesn't matter that he's a different species, or that he has a worrying marmalade problem; Paddington is family.\"Perhaps the most surprising cinematic endeavour this year was Paul King's entertaining adaptation of the classic Michael Bond character named Paddington; a talking bear who has an unusual taste for marmalade and is taken in by a human family (the Browns) at Paddington station in London. Whilst somewhat conventional in its premise and plot, the film contains heart and charm to spare, the titular character particularly likable in all instances. This is what separates Paddington from many of this years distasteful and unsatisfactory kids films; not only is their humour utterly juvenile, but the characters are not full of heart or humanity. Perhaps Paddington's best asset is the fact that the entire film is filled to the brim with heart and warmth, the primary protagonist and his foster family having a suitable and enjoyable progression throughout the film, that whilst undeniably cliched, is still wholly entertaining.The film centres around Paddington and how after an earthquake in his home of darkest Peru, one which unfortunately kills his uncle, he is sent to live in London by his auntie. The talking bear travels to the capital of Britain, and is taken in by the initially reluctant but somewhat welcoming Brown family, who seek to acquaint Paddington with the explorer who originally taught his auntie and uncle how to speak English, and promised them that they would be welcome in his home country. Meanwhile, a villainous taxidermist seeks to stuff Paddington and receive acclaim for showcasing the intelligent bear to the world.Perhaps the biggest issue going against Paddington from the onset is that the central story is nothing overtly new for a kids film; a foreigner entering a new landscape and finding numerous cultural differences from what he'd been led to believe were accepted is nothing that we haven't seen before. The atrocious Garfield 2, to a certain degree, possessed a relatively similar plot line, and that movie was condemned by the vast majority who saw it. The difference between Paddington and that children's picture is that the former possesses not only far more accessible and enjoyable jokes, but provides a stronger and more sympathetic central character, as well as side characters who possess stereotypical attributes which are nevertheless entertaining to watch play out. We can't help but feel for Paddington within the first few minutes of the film as his uncle is killed; our heart goes out to this poor and innocent creature who has to suddenly move away from his home and go into a foreign country where no one, at first, appears to sport any concern for his well-being. His naivety is a stark contrast to many kids films which possess self-centred or overly-confident characters; often these characters are unlikable or faulted to a major point. Paddington's best asset is his naive and childlike sense of adventure; not only does it provide material for numerous hilarious sequences, but it allows his character to become far more accessible and sympathetic.The Brown family are no less enjoyable to watch, their fumbling and awkward ways undeniably entertaining, even considering the idea that they conform to numerous genericisms throughout. The mother of the family, played by Sally Hawkins, is the sympathetic, helpless but caring individual who is required to convince the family of the necessity of taking home Paddington when they find him at the train station; the father, played by Hugh Bonneville, is the stern and initially insensitive man who eventually comes round to Paddington, and learns to have fun with those around him; the daughter, played by Madeleine Harris, is the easily embarrassed girl who feels a need to fit in at any cost; the son, played by Samuel Joslin, is the adventurous and incautious boy who enjoys running around and playing with Paddington, and finally, the elder of the household, played by Julie Brown, is the unusually fun and amusing older individual who acts more like a child than any of the children. None of these characters are particularly new, fresh or invigorating. They continually appeal to conventions that are both irritable and boring. Yet still, it's their relationship with Paddington, the actors and actresses behind the characters and their eventual character arc that sees them inviting laughs and approval from the audience; even one that includes numerous cynical teenagers, such as the group that I was accompanied to the film with.The humour itself is absolutely fantastic; whilst there are brief instances of slapstick humour, the picture as a whole features jokes which are practical, ironic and unexpectedly mature for the film and its rating. The comeuppance against Nicole Kidman's evil character Millicent not only rendered reduced my friends and I to boisterous laughter, but proved undeniably testing of the 'G' rating the film had earned. Very few of the film's central pieces of humour are unforeshadowed or entirely sudden in nature, the screenwriters taking care to build up each individual joke or moment to pay off more for the viewer. Paddington himself is perhaps the funniest component of the film, his attempts to adapt to the modern British way of life both hapless, sympathetic and often incredibly amusing, but never tiresome. None of the jokes feel re-hashed, and when a previously used piece of humour returns to the forefront, it is not blatantly recycled. The diversity and range of the humour installed within this film is undoubtedly its most crowd-pleasing feature.The film's cinematography, visuals and music are all undeniably effective in instilling a warmness that the film was beckoning for. The unique visuals and clever techniques to make the film stand out among the general mish-mash of cinematic drivel within this genre are engaging and applaudable, cinematographer Erik Wilson (responsible for the unique visual style of another popular British 2014 picture; Richard Ayoade's The Double) giving the film an intimate feel. His beautiful camera work within the initial scenes in darkest Peru, which feature the gorgeous bears and their environment in the most stunning ways possible. When Paddington comes to London, the film becomes far more intimate and low-angled, accenting Paddington's size in comparison to the rest of the city. Paddington is brought to life thanks to competent computer generated imagery from Framestore and animatronics, by Nick Dudman. Whilst the CGI showcased within the film is most certainly not as impressive as that which was shown within pictures like Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or Interstellar earlier in the year, the CGI is strong enough to allow the audience member to get caught up in the character and his plights, and very rarely takes the audience member out from the immediate danger or event. Considering this is one of the goals of CGI, acclamation is deserved by those who undertook the challenging process of bringing the cuddly, adorable titular character to life.The score, composed by Nick Urata, is docile, orthodox and nothing unique, but what it does contain, like the rest of the film, is a warmth and homeliness that is highly appreciated. Utilizing instrumentation and thematic material which lacks subtlety but preserves the emotion and basic characterisation of those who litter the film, Urata is part of the formula for Paddington which makes it so damn enjoyable. The film isn't as intelligent or energetic as some of the best animations or kids films released within this year of cinema, such as How To Train Your Dragon 2, The Lego Movie or The Boxtrolls, but what it lacks in originality and distinctness it makes up for in plain fun and humour. Paddington is one of the more entertaining pictures I've seen this year, and speaking with those who were with me during our screening, should be universally appreciated. I can only anticipate that the most cynical, cold and disdainful of viewers could possibly loathe or even dislike this enjoyable picture. I can't wait to revisit this fantastic film!\"What this family needed was a pinch of chaos!\"",

    "review": "  With the Christmas holidays upon us, so too is an array of kiddie-friendly flicks, beginning with this very British adventure designed to adore the socks off kids and adults alike. Based on the immensely popular talking bear of the title, this modern update could have been saccharine, morally burdensome and unbearable for anyone older than 8. But in striking a fantastic balance between old-fashioned innocence and contemporary sensibilities, writer-director Paul King has dished up a motion picture that is fun, light-hearted and just plain sweet. He's helped by a game cast: be it the affable pair of Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins as Paddington's adopted guardians, the gleefully menacing Nicole Kidman as a malevolent taxidermist, or amusing old-timers Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent who light up the screen with their eclectic supporting characters. Yet nobody can outshine the cute little fur-ball at the centre of proceedings. Voiced by Ben Whishaw (after an 11th hour change from Colin Firth) and carefully crafted with CGI, ol' Paddy is utterly delightful and a wonderful companion for 95 minutes. There are flaws to be found and the laughs may not come thick and fast, but Paddington will melt the heart of even the toughest cynic.",

How the animators achieved such a wonderful and memorable 'Paddington' is a minor miracle.

It is obvious that a great deal of love and affection has been injected into the making of this film; the acting, graphics, editing, sets and storyline are all virtually flawless, and you must surely be a soul with no heart not to find some modicum of pleasure from this 90 minute magical movie experience.I have deducted one star, which may seem a tad mean after such a glowing review, but that is simply because my family and I wanted the film to go on longer.

The animation of PADDINGTON is brilliant - just how I imagined him to look. And the casting of Ben Wishaw as the voice of Paddington is spot on. Even Nicole Kidman puts in a good turn as the nasty taxidermist who wants to stuff Paddington - it would have been good to have her character more central to the story.

After growing up hearing the stories and watching the animated tales of Paddington Bear, I was unsure as to whether a CGI-heavy live-action tale could really establish a story that portrays the bear in all his charm, well my predictions were woefully inaccurate. 'Paddington' is a very well-executed adaptation of the titular bear for a 21st century audience. From the producers of Harry Potter, 'Paddington' delivers a family-friendly and charming atmosphere whilst conveying an endearing and gloriously comedic tale about a bear and his adventures in London. One of the late and great films of the year, Paul King's irresistibly warm story creates a sense of nostalgia whilst boasting a quintessentially British feel and pitch-perfect humour that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.",

    "review": "  Do you just hate it when a trailer or a movie poster can false advertise a movie like: Edge of tomorrow, Dredd 3-D, Warm Bodies and now this movie.The story to Paddington is about a Peruvian bear who loves all things British, travels to London only to find himself overwhelmed at Paddington station. Lucky for him, the Brown family discovers him and offers a temporary haven. But he also catches the eye of a museum taxidermist, who is determined to add the rare bear to his collection.The first teaser trailer for this movie was in my opinion god-awful, you know when he's in the bathroom and he puts the two tooth brushes in his ears and gives it a little bit of a twist and turn, then he pulls it out and you can clearly see a giant peace of ear wax and then he licks it; that right they is just stupid kids humor and I wasn't looking forward to film at all. But when I look at some of the reviews for the film it actually got good feed back from critics. Empire give the film a five out of five star's and IGN give the film a 7.9/10, I couldn't believe it, I had to check twice to make sure that what I'm seeing is true, but I still wasn't hooked until I got a chance to see the film and to my surprise the movie isn't as bad as I thought it was and I actually found the movie to be funny. Ben Whishaw did the voice for the marmalade loving bear himself Paddington, and Ben Whishaw did a outstanding job of playing Paddington. He had that voice of a young, friendly and kind person (or bear if you must). Now originally Colin Firth was suppose to play this role but at the last minute he turned the role down by saying, \"The voice didn't match the character \", and to be honest I think he did the right thing, because I don't Firth's voice will match the character at all he just sound like Colin Firth.The movie has beautiful cinematography with some breathtaking shots of London, and the film had the Christmas feeling to it and it actually got the tone right.Now the visual effect's for the bear I have to be honest was the most realistic thing I've seen since this years movie Dawn Of the planet of the Apes. His fur looks like real fur that I can just go up to the screen a feel it, then I get kicked out the cinema for being a weirdo, but as I said realistic.If I had to pick a thing that I didn't like about the film I would say the character's and some of the jokes sometimes hit and sometimes miss. The character's in the movie are not all that interesting and they pretty dull to watch, Paddington, Nicole Kidman and Peter Capaldi are the only character's that I actually liked, and yes even the villain I enjoyed watching more then the family. Some of the jokes at times mash really well and didn't but when I think that's a small complain.Overall Paddinton was the biggest surprise of the year for me with it's cute bear, nice story and overall a good family film.",

    "review": "  Based on the beloved character from novels by Michael Bond, Paddington tells the story of the young Peruvian bear who travels to London in search of a new home. The eponymous bear's adventure begins in darkest Peru where an explorer promises the native talking bears a warm welcome if they ever visit London. However, by the time an earthquake forces one of them to embark on this journey, many years have passed and the city is not what he had imagined.Producer David Heyman is no stranger to bringing beloved characters from pages to the big screen after being involved in the Harry Potter franchise, and Paddington may jolly well become a start of a new franchise. Everywhere Paddington goes, chaos follows. From bathroom flooding, escalator and skate board riding to sticky tape, the cuddly bear cannot do anything right at the start. Scenes filled with witty gags (and action inspired by Mission Impossible) are plenty. The clever script is executed to perfection by the cast. In particular, Hugh Bonneville as Mr. Brown, an uptight risk analyst to unlikely hero, is a delight in every scene he is in. Nicole Kidman, channeling Cruella De Vil to a glorious performance, is the taxidermist Millicent Clyde determined to add stuffed Paddington to her collection. Best of them all, Ben Whishaw gives Paddington a voice that is innocent, wistful and yet determined that allows the bear to stay in the limelight.In all, very much like Stuart Little, Paddington touches on the theme of fitting in without sacrificing the essential charms of a family-friendly movie. As sweet as a marmalade sandwich for dire emergency, this film is the very definition of a pleasant surprise and will no doubt, enchant children of all ages. Please go watch this bear. Thank you.",

    "review": "  \"Always keep a Marmalade sandwich under your hat for emergencies.\"Re-introducing a beloved children's character is difficult. As we've seen recently with train-wrecks like 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' and past miss-steps like 'Garfield' it can be hard to make it relevant and in the former's case even competent. 'Paddington' is one I'd been watching for a while now and despite a solid trailer I still held a certain amount of scepticism towards it. Having been burned so many times in the past with classic characters I prepared for teh worst. I needn't worry as 'Paddington' is a truly worthy entry in the character's long history. A universal story of finding somewhere to fit and the stranger in a foreign land coming to grips with the way of the world in their new home. Starting in the darkest Peru 'Paddington' (Ben Wishaw) get's a nice small (and needed) back-story to his reasons for coming to London. It immediately establishes a tone that told me \"No this isn't pandering to the dimmest bulb in the room' - with some surprising wit. It's an easy going movie with a nice steady pace that suites it to a tea. The film seems to serve (at least to me) as an introduction to the character, giving the impression that this isn't the last we'll see of him. He still has the marmalade obsession as well as the iconic hat and later on the blue coat. He's very much teh same character something other re-introductions of past characters seemed to have neglected. Opting instead for a new personality when the character being the character is why he's so beloved - something the writer clearly knows here. Paddington's story is still has endearing an heart-warming as ever without the cringyness that can usually come attached. Updating the setting to the London of today while keeping the essence, there's also a cartoon-esque feel to some of the scenes that is very welcome and an equally cartoon villain - that doesn't show up or stay long but still makes a decent impact. It's not a laugh riot and some of the jokes fall flat to me - as well as 'Mrs.Bird' who comes of as an irritant to me as well as the films only source of cringe.Bringing the message of fitting in, into a modern London and bringing 'Paddington' as a character with it as well - while still keeping the core of what makes him some loved. 'Paddington' is a certain success and a rare good even great Christmas movie. Directed with a whimsical style and written with a wit not usually seen in children movies, this certainly isn't part of the horrible classic character updates. Paddington' is a certain success and possible future children's classic.",

Great performances from Hugh Bonneville, his screen wife and the two kids are undermined by shallow efforts from julie Walters and Nicole Kidman. Some very good moments, although if you have seen the trailer you've seen most of them but some leaden bits as well.",

    "review": "  OK it's made for kids but adults will enjoy the humour in this too and they've done an amazing job creating a believable Paddington Bear. The London in the film isn't the one I'm familiar with but that's not surprising as it's made by the same team that made Harry Potter so the film has the same sheen. Bonneville is great as Mr Brown and is ably supported by Hawkins as his kooky spouse. The only sour note comes from Kidman as Paddington's nemesis and her story seems at odds with the charm of the rest of the film. Besides that I think Paddington is a bit of a triumph and I wouldn't be surprised to see a sequel in the pipeline soon.",

Adapting Paddington's domestic escapades to the big screen was always going to be a risk, but its been achieved brilliantly! All the quirks and charms Britain fell in love with all those years ago remain and, as some may fear, aren't lost in the special effects of the film. In fact, they are amplified by these very effects which are woven into the story in ways that transport you back to your childhood to give it that heart-warmingly nostalgic boost! I already want to see it again!",
