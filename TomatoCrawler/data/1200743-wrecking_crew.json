    "review": "  ALL ABOUT THAT BASS - My Review of THE WRECKING CREW (4 Stars)Whether you grew up in the 60s/70s or if you're a fan of the classic music from that period, it's likely you'll treasure Denny Tedesco's loving, passionate, bittersweet documentary about the unsung heroes behind such recordings as \"California Dreaming\", \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelng\", and \"Be My Baby\". Somewhat of a cousin to the Oscar-winning, \"20 Feet From Stardom\", Tedesco has been making this film since 1996 as a tribute to his late father, Tommy Tedesco, a guitarist with the group of West Coast session musicians who played on a jaw-dropping number of rock hits, movie and tv themes.  Finally getting their due, the musicians reveal that they, and not the original members of such bands as The Beach Boys, did the lion's share of the playing. The list of songs is staggering and I spent most of my time viewing the film with my jaw decisively dropped and my toes tapping. More important than uncovering these music industry secrets, however, is the true passion for music on display here. These are musicians who loved to play, to discuss it, and in one extremely potent moment, Tommy says to his reunited group, \"They put notes on paper. That's not music. You make the music\". ...And what incredible music it is. The film dives in and out of the lives of some key players, interweaving a reunion roundtable with rare footage from the era and vibrant photos. I loved watching a very young Sonny and Cher make their way around the studios, these newbies facing a group of old pros. Brian Wilson looked truly inspired to record with the Crew, who unanimously loved working with this genius. Tommy is a great main character. He's energetic and hilarious in footage where he's talking to students or reminiscing with his old pals. Drummer Hal Blaine carries a lot of the pathos in the film with a heartbreaking riches to rags story. A couple of the members broke out into solo stardom, chief among them, Glen Campbell and Leon Russell. The lone female in the group, Carol Kaye, steals every moment she's on screen. Clearly a warm person who suffers no fools, she never once played the victim, assimilating herself into this boy's club because of her undisputed talent as a bass player. A highlight of the film is watching Carol show us the original, too-spare bass line to \"The Beat Goes On\" and then demonstrating how she added her own touches to make it unforgettable. Every so often we'll hear a musician play, for example, \"The Pink Panther Theme\" and then Tedesco will lay the finished track on top of that footage. It's a terrific way to show us their artistry and bring these invisible talents front and center with the songs that shaped so many lives. This isn't a perfect film, but it's a perfect experience. At times, the storytelling can duck down a few too many corridors, but it's an extremely minor complaint. The shaggy style constantly brings us gem after gem of music and lively reminiscences. Imagine turning a radio dial over and over and only hearing masterpieces and that describes the viewing pleasure of this film.The journey to get this film released has been arduous. I met Denny back in the 80s as we both worked in film production. Years later, he started talking about a documentary he was making to honor his father who was starting to get ill. Tommy, and many others, did not live to see the final product, which, after a successful film festival run, has been held up for years dues to music rights. We see many people who are either gone (Dick Clark is among them) or have mentally slipped away (Campbell), making this film that much more essential as a time capsule. There were times, however, that it looked like this film would never get the proper release it so richly deserves. But Tedesco persevered, raised the hundred of thousands of dollars needed to pay off the endless list of musicians, and 19 years later we have THE WRECKING CREW. His passion to tell this story about a group of very passionate people was well worth the wait and is a glorious homage to REAL talent.",

My hat off to Denny Tedesco for his unwavering tenacity, financial struggle and focus in order to bring this endearing true story to the big screen. Having worked alongside a number of the wrecking crew musicians in the 1960's, I can attest first hand to their expertise as players, their incredible ability to create new and exciting sounds and their warm demeanor as fellow musicians. The wrecking crew were my hero's then and now. This is a not to be missed film if you loved the music of the 1960's.",

    "review": "  \"The Wrecking Crew\" is Well PlayedIf you have ever heard \"Happy Together\" by the Turtles, The Byrds \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", \"Day Dream Believer\" song by the Monkees, or \"Close to You\" by the Carpenters, you have heard the group of studio musicians called \"The Wrecking Crew.\" They were regular contributors to hit songs in Los Angeles from about 1958 to 1965. The composition of the Crew varied, but if you lived in Los Angeles and needed bass, drums, guitar, horns or other instruments for your recording, you called on the in The Wrecking Crew. According to the film, the musicians got the name \"Wrecking Crew\" from jazz musicians who felt they were \"wrecking\" music with their rock and pop stylings. Whatever they case, this group of musicians were called if you wanted to record a hit song. The film features interviews with the players, old footage of them performing together and interviews with musical luminaries such as Cher and Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. Wilson used The Crew for most of the backing tracks on the seminal album, \"Pet Sounds.\" The crew could read musical scales, take direction, and write parts for the songs if needed. They were flexible and served the client first even if they talked about them behind their back after the session and on camera during the film. And as the film implies, the Crew was responsible for more than one song becoming a hit. The footage and interviews in the film proves how important these musicians were to popular music of the late 50s and early 60s. In the 60s, bands such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Doors, and so forth, left the Wrecking Crew with fewer jobs, for they had the talent to play their own instruments. Some of the musicians from the Crew, notably father of the director, guitarist Tommy Tedesco, got jobs playing for film soundtracks other records after the studio jobs dried up. Other members went on to record their own records, some even becoming big stars on their own such as Leon Russell and Glen Campbell. Yes, those stars were part of the Crew. The film shares a unique time of music and a unique set of musicians with us. Watching the film gives us a view of the inner workings of one of the greatest groups of studio musicians in the history of popular music. And it entertains us all the way. The set and filming is nothing scream and shout about, but the music leaves us with Good Vibrations. Rating: Pay Full Price. People who play or like music will enjoy by this film.Peace, Tex Shelters",

    "review": "  In the same vein as \"20 Feet From Stardom\", \"Muscle Shoals\" and \"Standing In The Shadows\", the adoring bright lights are \"shined on the star maker machinery behind the popular song\" in the most flattering and heartfelt way. If you are a fan of rock-n-roll, this film is not to be missed.",

    "review": "  Loved every second of it. If you grew up in the sixties you need to see this movie. You will be blown away how our music (the sixties) music was made. I hate that the real musicians did not the credit when they were making it. If you have seen the stories about Muscle Shoals, 20 feet from Stardom and The Funk Brothers you most certainly need to see this movie as well. I could have watched a 4 hour version of this story.",

    "review": "  ALL ABOUT THAT BASS - My Review of THE WRECKING CREW (4 Stars)Whether you grew up in the 60s/70s or if you're a fan of the classic music from that period, it's likely you'll treasure Denny Tedesco's loving, passionate, bittersweet documentary about the unsung heroes behind such recordings as \"California Dreaming\", \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelng\", and \"Be My Baby\". Somewhat of a cousin to the Oscar-winning, \"20 Feet From Stardom\", Tedesco has been making this film since 1996 as a tribute to his late father, Tommy Tedesco, a guitarist with the group of West Coast session musicians who played on a jaw-dropping number of rock hits, movie and tv themes.  Finally getting their due, the musicians reveal that they, and not the original members of such bands as The Beach Boys, did the lion's share of the playing. The list of songs is staggering and I spent most of my time viewing the film with my jaw decisively dropped and my toes tapping. More important than uncovering these music industry secrets, however, is the true passion for music on display here. These are musicians who loved to play, to discuss it, and in one extremely potent moment, Tommy says to his reunited group, \"They put notes on paper. That's not music. You make the music\". ...And what incredible music it is. The film dives in and out of the lives of some key players, interweaving a reunion roundtable with rare footage from the era and vibrant photos. I loved watching a very young Sonny and Cher make their way around the studios, these newbies facing a group of old pros. Brian Wilson looked truly inspired to record with the Crew, who unanimously loved working with this genius. Tommy is a great main character. He's energetic and hilarious in footage where he's talking to students or reminiscing with his old pals. Drummer Hal Blaine carries a lot of the pathos in the film with a heartbreaking riches to rags story. A couple of the members broke out into solo stardom, chief among them, Glen Campbell and Leon Russell. The lone female in the group, Carol Kaye, steals every moment she's on screen. Clearly a warm person who suffers no fools, she never once played the victim, assimilating herself into this boy's club because of her undisputed talent as a bass player. A highlight of the film is watching Carol show us the original, too-spare bass line to \"The Beat Goes On\" and then demonstrating how she added her own touches to make it unforgettable. Every so often we'll hear a musician play, for example, \"The Pink Panther Theme\" and then Tedesco will lay the finished track on top of that footage. It's a terrific way to show us their artistry and bring these invisible talents front and center with the songs that shaped so many lives. This isn't a perfect film, but it's a perfect experience. At times, the storytelling can duck down a few too many corridors, but it's an extremely minor complaint. The shaggy style constantly brings us gem after gem of music and lively reminiscences. Imagine turning a radio dial over and over and only hearing masterpieces and that describes the viewing pleasure of this film.The journey to get this film released has been arduous. I met Denny back in the 80s as we both worked in film production. Years later, he started talking about a documentary he was making to honor his father who was starting to get ill. Tommy, and many others, did not live to see the final product, which, after a successful film festival run, has been held up for years dues to music rights. We see many people who are either gone (Dick Clark is among them) or have mentally slipped away (Campbell), making this film that much more essential as a time capsule. There were times, however, that it looked like this film would never get the proper release it so richly deserves. But Tedesco persevered, raised the hundred of thousands of dollars needed to pay off the endless list of musicians, and 19 years later we have THE WRECKING CREW. His passion to tell this story about a group of very passionate people was well worth the wait and is a glorious homage to REAL talent.",
