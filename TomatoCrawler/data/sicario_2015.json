It is 2015's perfect film--perfect pace, perfect length, brilliant climax and ending; a deft combination of the thrills of Homeland with the style of Zero Dark Thirty.",

    "review": "  It is not very often you get a false film about soldiers that feels so real. \"Sicario\" is one of those films. The base story is a team of soldiers hunting down the drug cartel. There are more complexities that come from the lawyers and head hunters, but that is the least interesting portion of the story in my opinion. We follow Emily Blunt's character who is not used to this kind of field work, but the team she works for interested me much more. \"Sicario\" benefits from a very solid script, a tension-filled story, and terrific performances. I do think this film is slightly overrated, but it's concept is worth the price of admission alone. In the end, I really enjoyed watching this film. I did not buy into everything that happened, but in the end, it became one of the more interesting films of 2015.",

    "review": "  Blunt plays a taking-no-shit government operative called on to assist an investigation to nail a drug lord. She our doppelganger, our stand-in, who ushers us in into the horror of real life, the horror that horror is necessary. Once we are assured of her street worthiness and credibility - and she's plenty badass - we are then introduced to the real star of the film and the subject of its focus. The movies and their audiences (hey, that's us!) love the Myth Of The Double O's: sauve, debonair, lady killers who can handle themselves in a fight, in a car chase, in other countries, in other languages, with any weapon. Center stage in every scene. \"Bond. James Bond.\" But what might such individuals be like in the real world, not in the movies, but in the world we live in and know? When we meet Del Toro as the secret agent he is most noticeable for his deliberate efforts not to be noticed. \"I'm just sitting here. I'm just a regular joe. I'm just like you. Don't look at me.\" By the film's end we know that this MF is the MF other MFs have nightmares about, and if you notice him, if he is center stage then its already too late for you. A really good film, and with my highest recommendation: worth more than one viewing.",

The action sequences create a lot of tension and the directing is very good, I particularly liked the use of infrared and night vision in the final action sequence. Some bits of the movie are overplayed and unoriginal, like the annoyingly coy police character Brolin plays, but some people may like it. This isn't a unforgettable movie, but it is certainly a little better than an average action picture.",

    "review": "  The word \"sicario\" is Spanish for hitman, we're told in a helpful opening text. It's a term that has greater meaning in the landscape of the war on drugs, a war that has ravaged the Mexico and its citizens. Sicario, the film, is a grim and gripping and director Denis Villeneuve doesn't hold back from the brutality of its reality. Sicario is a flat-out tremendous film. It's the most intense film I've sat through since 2012's Zero Dark Thirty, so much so that for long stretches of the 121-minute film I was literally tearing my hair out with delicious anxiety.Kate Mercer (Emily Blunt) is a Phoenix FBI Agent called in by her superiors with a very special offer. Matt (Josh Brolin), a government agent whose affiliation is classified, has a task force that he would like Kate to join. She'll be taking it to the drug cartels by destabilizing their chain of power. Kate accepts the job. Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) is a foreign agent in alliance with Matt, and he seems to be deeply knowledgeable of the cartel and their practices. As the chaos swirls and the team gets closer to the cartel bosses, Kate has to reckon with what she is part of. Let Sicario be a blueprint for how to brilliantly develop suspense sequences in mainstream cinema. I've written about it before but the key to suspense and horror is simply characters we care about and the worry of what will happen next. Sicario places our characters in the middle of an ongoing battle and serves them up as the change agent, the proverbial stick rattling the hornet's nest of deadly cartels. There's a wonderful sequence when Kate joins up with the team for her first mission. She's been told she'll be based in El Paso but in reality she and a team of Army Rangers are venturing across the Mexican border into Juarez. They're picking up a high-level cartel informant and transporting him back to American soil. The ride into the country sets the stage as the caravan of black SUVs tears through the streets of Jaurez, bracketed by Mexican state police vehicles. We've previously been told at what points a likely trap might be staged, and so we wait, taking in the terrain, the distance, the exits, the personnel. We're already sizing up the Mexican state police cars; is that one on the take? It's at the end that the scene coalesces into an even stronger whole, as we literally have a climax in traffic. The border entrance is backed up, and so Kate and our team wait, all the while identifying some suspicious armed men in traffic lanes parallel to their vehicles. They're told they cannot fire until deadly force is used, and so they wait and we wait. It's a top-notch sequence where you're nervously waiting for the boil, waiting for the explosion. Writer Taylor Sheridan (best known as Deputy Chief Hale on Sons of Anarchy) has taken what could have been an empty Michael Bay-styled drug war thriller and given it a soul. Sheridan's structure is ingeniously tied into his larger message about the moral futility of the escalating war on drugs. As Kate becomes more immersed into the costs of her new role, of the mounting ethical compromises and legal loopholes, she becomes a background player and Alejandro takes center stage. Rather than simply harden up and sacrifice her ideals for the sake of her mission, Kate holds true to her principles, even if she might be the only one continuing to stick to the rules and a need for oversight. It makes her a far more interesting character and it all comes to a terrific climactic scene that hinges upon two characters at a forceful crossroads, each with diametrically opposed viewpoints. For all the action, Sheridan has found a great way for his story to have a character-based climax that hits harder than simply killing the Worst Bad Guy. As we learn more about the reasons Kate was selected, her literal marginalization in the story makes thematic sense, especially as she's unwilling to become a \"wolf\" in a \"game of wolves.\" Alejandro is that wolf, and in the last act he becomes the film's focus as the pieces of their destabilization plan fall into place. There's a scene with Alejandro that is so cold-blooded yet badass that it made my audience gasp. As the bodies drop and blood is shed, Sicario doesn't lose sight of its characters even to the very end.Sheridan's script tackles its subject with a propensity for acknowledging the messy reality. There are no easy solutions and perhaps the best solution is really one that is at odds with conventional legality. The United States is losing the war on drugs, and innocents are suffering in droves. Matt's cavalier attitude is in response to the overwhelming evidence that the war on drugs has done little except to enshrine certain violent elements into power. He's trying to clear a path for Alejandro, but for what aim afterward is ethically questionable. When you've got nothing but bad solutions, perhaps the best option is still one that's a step too far. Sicario tackles the harsh realities of the war on drugs without ever dragging out a soapbox. The messages and debates are suffused in every frame, every taut sequence, even pained expression. It's a message movie where the morality and the escalating action go hand-in-hand.With Prisoners and now Sicario, Villeneuve has proven to be one of our finest directors when it comes to making adult movies that get your palms sweaty. The execution of these suspense sequences left me breathless. Villeneuve uses long takes of aerial photography hovering over the topography of Mexico and the American southwest. It has the effect of feeling like you're surveying an alien planet. Added with the ominous score by Johann Johannsson (The Theory of Everything), the tension can feel overwhelming at times. The menacing and percussion-heavy score makes it feel like an army is approaching. The movie also looks absolutely beautiful thanks to the cinematography from Roger Deakens. There are several lovely shots lit with the dying rays of sunlight, which I would admire further if my heart weren't in my throat while watching. Villeneuve also knows when to pump the brakes, letting his film breathe, and letting his actors take center stage. There are several moments of restraint that allow the actors to flourish. From top to bottom, Sicario is a technical marvel that impresses as it continues to horrify. Blunt as a badass is nothing new after her killer turn in last year's epically underrated Edge of Tomorrow, but there's way more to her than being a superhero with a gun. She's the moral conscience of the movie and you may discover, as she does, how irrelevant such a stance may be in this underground world. She's trying to make sense of it all, trying to go along with what she thinks is right, or at least making a difference, and swallowing her frustrations. She saves the best for last in a finale scene that pushes her character to the breaking point of her ethics, and Blunt floors you. While Blunt is our entry point into this world, and Brolin is amusing as a cavalier rogue agent, this is very much Del Toro's movie. Alejandro could easily be the slick movie-cool hitman, a soulless killing-machine, but he's a haunted man who knows he's damned and goes about his business with steely resolve. Benicio Del Toro can often be confused for doing little acting because he so naturally underplays his characters, but keep watch and you'll see a man who inherently knows his character. There are subtle shifts and small reveals that open up his character, who is so hardened that this will be all you get. There have been some complaints citing the film's lack of perspective from the Mexican side of the border, which is fair but also overlooking Sicario's complexity. With its fear of cartel war violence spilling over into American neighborhoods, it's not hard to see this film becoming supposed evidence in a xenophobic political campaign. Surely Donald Trump will be talking about Sicario. There is a small degree of representation with a minor character involved in the drug trade. The movie flashes back to him and his family a few times, setting us up to expect he'll return at a pivotal moment later. He's a completely unremarkable character and the brief scenes we spend with him made me anxious to get back to Kate and the main story. I didn't care, and then he did reappear and I was quite surprised to find myself actively caring for this minor character's well being. In a scenario where it seems like there's a lack of vulnerability, this character provides it. He's not a bad person per se as just another cog in a corrupt machine trying to provide for his loved ones. It's a window into the larger ramifications of Kate and Matt's actions. The very last bittersweet image doesn't feel like victory, more like a warning of impending consequences that will befall innocents, and they aren't Americans.It's rare to get a Hollywood thriller that excels at what it does and exceeds lofty expectations, but Sicario is that movie. Here is a thriller that excites, unnerves, provokes thought as well as terrible anxiety that you sweat in buckets over. The general feeling while watching Sicario is one of disquieting dread. The challenging and disturbing reality of the war on drugs blends with the brilliantly executed suspense sequences. The characters don't get lost amidst the clatter of violence, the direction enhances the actors and allows them to better inhabit their engaging characters, and the overall orchestration of all the many moving parts is so polished, so in tune, so electric that Sicario often does more than just entertain, it forces you to react. Leaving my theater was akin to coming down off an adrenaline high and I wanted to tell everyone I knew to see this movie. That's the power of great cinema and Villeneuve has created a compelling feature that deserves to be soaked up and studied. This is exhilarating moviemaking, folks. Nate's Grade: A",

Not for the faint-hearted, this film truly aims to make viewers feel the weight and is great in many ways once some glaring flaws are overlooked (including a script that by the end wasn't as expansive and fulfilling as initially indicated as well as some rushed but important moments of decision and protocol); it employs high stakes and tense scenes that effectively utilize the tools of cinema, and does so in a way that admirably and provocatively explores the conflict between morality and serviceability.",

Directeor Denis Villeneuve has proven himself once again to be one of the best filmmakers in the business, creating a gorgeous world that I completely immersed myself in. Its a very gritty and real film that looks absolutely beautiful in a way that you have to see to believe. Emily Blunt just keeps getting better and better, with her performance here standing out as possibly her best. Its a very emotional and dark role that she absolutely killed, showing new range in her talents. Josh Brolin has only convinced me of his acting abilities in the past, but it's always nice to see him give another great performance. He captures all the subtle characteristics about his character that make him unique, and we always get a feeling he is more than he appears. Benicio Del Toro is the man who steals the show here, giving his best performance in years. His dark, ghost-like performance is unnerving and took me completely by surprise. Unraveling the puzzle of this man was a beautiful little mystery and his performance, and character, were the best in the film. The writing was fantastic, giving us a great and layered story about the hunt for a cartel kingpin and the lengths these people will go to find him. It was a great way to present its themes of morality, control, fear and more. I will admit that sometimes the film could drag, but it was never boring. Sicario is an excellent film and one of the best of the year, delivering a brilliantly styled and intense thrillers mixed with a fantastic",

    "review": "  MAY I BE BLUNT? - My Review of SICARIO (3 Stars)Denis Villeneuve has demonstrated an effectively slow-burning, formalist approach to filmmaking in such features as PRISONERS and ENEMY, allowing suspense to build and screws to turn slowly to ratchet up the maximum levels of tension. In many ways, his somewhat classical style reminds me of M. Night Shyamaylan's, only with better scripts. His latest, SICARIO, from a script by Taylor Sheridan, feels of a piece with his prior films, but with more kinetic sequences and a cipher of a lead character highly reminiscent of Jessica Chastain in ZERO DARK THIRTY. Emily Blunt plays Kate, an FBi agent who is enlisted by a mysterious group of men, led by Josh Brolin and Benecio Del Toro, to fight the drug cartels near the Texas/Mexico border. If you're thinking this sounds a whole lot like the short-lived series, THE BRIDGE, you're pretty close. Nothing is what it seems, loyalties seem to shift constantly, and the notion of good guys vs. bad guys goes out the window. Drawn into this plot with a murky plan, Blunt seems to be the driving force of the film, until it starts to dawn on you that as good as she is, there isn't much of a character here for her to play. We know she's divorced, smokes, is great with a gun, and experiences horniness as a weakness...and that's about it. What's missing is the shattering of her world view. Sure, she's world weary, but the rug gets pulled out from under her so frequently in this film, that I expected a shivering mess or a deep catatonic state by film's end. Instead, we're given as rich and emotional performance as is possible when dealing with such thin details. In all actuality, she's our window into this world, but the action is mostly driven by Del Toro's Alejandro. He's great in the role as a Hitman whose actions and motivations reveal layers to his character. He's a brutal man you come to truly understand, and he runs away with the film. Brolin gives a delightfully relaxed performance that lives somewhere in the Lebowski universe, surprising us with a memorably incongruent approach to what is usually a stern, stock character. In fact, there's so much that's great about this film, from the taut, tense opening raid to the night-vision voyage into a scary tunnel, which feels like a nod to ZERO DARK THIRTY's big set piece. Roger Deakins, who shot Villeneuve's PRISONERS, does another great job with this film. You feel as if you know these dusty, burned out landscapes and your stomach is in knots with each taut, stomach churning composition. J�hann J�hannsson's score also adds immeasurably to the tension, reminding us that his Oscar nomination for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING was no fluke. Here is a composer completely in sync with a director, adding a feeling of dread to almost every scene. Despite surprising scenes, shocking turnarounds, and a fairly propulsive yet controlled style of storytelling, SICARIO comes up a little short for me. There's nothing here that we haven't seen in other drug trade expos�s such as TRAFFIC and MARIA FULL OF GRACE. Yes, we know there is no easy solution to the problem and that innocent victims are continuously caught in the crossfire. I applaud Villeneuve's commitment to his unique style, finding the breathing room he gives his scenes to be refreshing in this time of attention-deficit filmmaking. Had he insisted on spending a little more time and care with his leading female character, this could have been something even more emotionally devastating than what we're given.",

    "review": "  Exceedingly bleak, brooding, violent and yet unapologetic, Sicario is a mature film conceived and executed by mature filmmakers. When tensions rise on the US-Mexico border, a task force is assembled, enlisting a passionate yet na�ve FBI agent (Emily Blunt) to aid in its efforts. The goals and actions of the task force represent a departure the young agent is not yet willing to make, yet feels inexplicably logical in an illogical world.With Sicario, talented director Denis Villeneuve takes on the drug war in really an unprecedented way. Its' political overtones, realism, and cynicism is reminiscent of the great Traffic, yet without the overwrought indignation. It's a slow burn, with a methodical build up and a matter-a-fact way of examining the brutality and carnage that cartels engage in, without glossing over government complicity. Vilenueve pulls no punches, and succeeds in making a film that is both enthralling and cerebral. It has a point of view, yet the viewer has to make their own interpretations. Shades of gray abound, a laudable departure from a genre that otherwise can succumb to less nuanced stories.The film's ensemble cast is second to none, featuring marvelous performances from all involved, including Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and Benicio Del Toro. Toro, for his part, showed a depth I haven't before seen from him. The chemistry between the cast is palpable and the direction brings the best out of the actors, whose complex characterizations all bring a much needed wrinkle to a the story.Toward the end, one would wish for more exploration of the film's major revelation, feeling a bit unsatisfying in the last act. Yet it still manages to bring something to the table that past genre pieces have not, a very real sense of hopelessness that, if never confronted, will never be defeated.4/5 Stars",

    "review": "  Killing audiences like its Spanish namesake, tightly coiled thriller Sicario might be topical by proxy but boasts a white hot Who-Done-What at its red hot center. If Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock made a Mexican terrorism actioner, it would look a lot like this. Call it Crosstown Traffic, Steven Soderbergh's already timely drug drama made even timelier by an escalating narcotics war down south and framed with direction that's every bit as knowing and edgy. Though the set pieces stop your heart, your mind can't help but keep going at a feverish pace, always on the lookout for the next double cross or stray bullet. It constricts you from the get-go for a long con but Sicario's serpentine scheme never disappoints. In this R-rated thriller from director, an idealistic FBI agent (Blunt) gets enlisted by an elected government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs along the U.S. and Mexico borders. Through the eyes of the sometimes naive but rarely helpless agent Kate (an ace and award-worthy performance by Emily Blunt), Taylor Sheridan's script pits filmgoers in the midst of a deadly war that oftentimes seems pointless but the drive of the characters keeps you fully bullet-proof vested. Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro likewise give powerhouse performances, though the latter is inarguably the showier of the two. Denis Villenueve's taut atmospheric direction takes center stage, however. The Prisoners' helmer makes a Hitchcockian thriller without a Hitch. It's his own baby, killer turns and all.

    "review": "  With the plethora of popular fiction devoted to the doomed drug war, it's slightly hard to get excited about a movie retreading the same ground as Traffic or similar films in this genre. But Sicario is, for a lack of a better way to express this, pretty fucking great. The plot centers on a female FBI agent specializing in special tactical breach and clear missions who finds herself recruited by a shadowy team of DEA agents planning to go on the offensive against Mexican drug cartels across the border in Juarez. Emily Blunt subtly and emotionally plays this protagonist as she finds herself in over her head and struggling to maintain her moral compass amid the carnage. Josh Brolin plays a slimy CIA agent so easily that perhaps we should worry about what he does with his time when he's not acting. But it is Benicio Del Toro who steals the show. His icy, murderous double assassin acts as a sword of vengeance and a warning about those who fight monsters. Notably there is a dichotomy between the FBI characters who attempt to operate in civilian legal procedure with arrests, investigations, and public transparency, and the DEA/CIA team who are heavily militarized, use direct force, torture liberally, manipulate the criminal underworld, and engage in Special Forces style assaults.Sicario is a notably beautiful looking film for being so riddled full of grotesque violence and it demands the viewer's attention. While others may find comparisons to Traffic, I personally feel it has more in common with Zero Dark Thirty, in terms of the strong female protagonist, the direction and cinematography, and final night vision fueled spec ops raids. Of course, where Zero Dark had an uplifting, bittersweet ending, Sicario makes a salient point about the failure and futility of the drug war. It's about as on the nose as you can get, but it doesn't prove to be a fatal artistic flaw. The cold, violent nature of this piece may deter some viewers, but the rest are in for a hellish but rewarding and entertaining journey into the heart of darkness.",

Kate is assigned to a special elite task force led by its leader Matt, played superbly by Josh Brolin, to help in the never ending bloody battles against the insidious Mexican drug cartels, she crosses into Mexico on a clandestine mission into a lawless border area where headless corpses of murdered victims dangle from highway overpasses, with her mysterious mostly silent team companion Alejandro, a special \"consultant\" with a tragic past, played terrifically by a scene-stealing Benicio Del Toro. Kate will find soon question everything she believes in and her faith will be tested as the operation continues, in a land where anyone is a potential target or perpetrator. To say anymore about this film is to betray its sense of paranoia. Astute direction by Villeneuve, with magnificent pulse-pounding action-set pieces that are brutally intense and memorable. A taut script by Taylor Sheridan, Roger Deakin's ravishing sun-parched cinematography is very impressive, and Johann Johannsson's grandiose haunting score is superb. \"Sicario\" which means \"hitman\" in Spanish is a most remarkable motion picture in every sense of the word.

With veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins, he made something suspenseful.I like how this film brought a simple idea about the Mexican border drama into something scary and very satisfying thiller-drama.Emily Blunt was right for the cast - as a person that can be identified as us, who always tries to do something \"by the book\". Especially Benicio Del Toro, he made a comeback from playing some high-dude collector in Guardians of The Galaxy (2014). His mysterious character made the film looked more than a simple thriller. My dad, usually predicts what a character might do, but he couldn't predict him. Watch the climax of the film, you'll know what I'm talking about.Also the cinematography was great. The technical side of the film was very complex, but yet looked realistic. The old man really knew what he was doing since the 1980's.Besides that, I really like to hear the film's sound design and foely, it sounded so realistic. It build more of the suspense.As for the writings, there were plot twists all over the place, but the most surprising one was on the climax. We really don't know what Benicio Del Toro's and Josh Brolin's character motivation for 3/4 of the movie. Once we knew it, OH SHIT, this is fucked up.I bet this film would be in one of Oscar's nomination.The Verdict:Sicario is one of the most suspenseful film of the year, with strong cast, plot twists, and technical (cinematography and sound).",

    "review": "  How far we should go in prosecuting the drug war is the main concern of SICARIO, the latest directorial effort by Denis Villeneuve. The violence brought about by America's war on drugs is a sensitive one because of the complex motives and casualties on both sides. This film doesn't really offer any answers, but it does provide enough to mentally chew on as the morally gray areas inherent in such an effort are explored. The audience's surrogate is Kate (Emily Blunt), an FBI agent who volunteers for an inter-agency task force that takes her into the heart of Mexico with the goal of finding a top boss in the cartel. Along for the mission is a mysterious person, Alejandro (Benicio del Toro), whose allegiance and motives are unclear (at first). If there's one weakness in the film, it's Emily Blunt's character, unfortunately. While she and her FBI partner provide the bulk of the dramatic conflict, she never really develops satisfactorily, instead relegated to a mostly passive observer. Benicio del Toro's character is by far the most interesting and compelling, and he get most of the best moments and dialogue. From a technical standpoint, SICARIO compares well with Villeneuve's other work and features outstanding cinematography, courtesy of Roger Deakins (who also worked on PRISONERS). Slow and deliberate camerawork nicely complements the slow-burn pacing, which culminates in one of the tensest (and morally ambiguous) scenes in recent memory. If there's one thing that this film does extremely well, it shows that the drug war has far-reaching effects from the top of the food chain down to a cop who is just trying to provide for his family (even if it is on the wrong side of the law). I should also mention the excellent score by Johann Johannsson, although a key element of it is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer's style. If I had seen this last year, it most certainly would have made my top ten. As it stands, it further establishes Denis Villeneuve as a talent to be reckoned with and is suitably entertaining to boot.",

I found this much more disturbing and difficult than The Revenant, or even the documentary The Look of Silence.Although technically a fictional story, the film is laced with a gritty, docudrama aesthetic, albeit a beautifully photographed one, and is anchored in real world concerns that plague the various citizens and law enforcement agencies represented. I greatly admire this film. It's a work of art by a very talented group of artisans, it is well told and very intense. That being said, it's not a film I'll return to very often precisely because of how well it does its job. But I can certainly see why it has cracked so many critics year end top ten lists. Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie about a pressing topic that should be seen if you have any interest in films about the cartel, about the drug trade or about Americas various arms of law. All I'm saying is it's unpleasant to watch and to think about. It's very dark and ends quite cynically and as such I doubt I'll return to it often.",

    "review": "  Emily Blunt's character was an absolute puss in this whole story. She was the only thing slowing it down. She basically cringes in every scene she's in and fails to do anything really meaningful except in her first scene with the group making a key kill. But she's relegated to the sidelines for almost the entire 3rd act. It became Benecio Del Toro's rendition of Taken for about half an hour, and then BAM here come's Emily again to whine about a guy killing someone's family when she's witnessed endless amounts of horrifying bloodshed for an hour and twenty minutes. She somehow went unhardened in that entire process. She never accepted reality and its horrors, and instead of joining in the fight she just got in its way.It's still a good film. It just could have been so much more. I don't blame Blunt by the way, she was a fine actress in the film. The writing is to be questioned when you put such heavy emphasis on a character without explaining her properly. From the get-go they obscure the reasons behind her hire, making her more of a plot device than an actual character I should care about. But still they push her forward and I DO care about her because Blunt did a great job of interpreting her internal struggle between ethics and reality. Yet they never cashed it in. She ends up being a character who constantly seems in too deep and incapable of handling things. It makes her appear weak and the ultimate message becomes unclear. Is the War on Drugs good? Bad? Are our politics with Mexico sound? Is this good for people or not?Those are profound questions this film had the potential to answer, and it simply passed on them all. With regards to cinematics, it's a beautiful movie that reminded me of Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now, as well as flashbacks from The Hurt Locker. It's gorgeous. But unlike those movies, it doesn't take a definitive stance on what the story really means. I walked away more confused than enlightened and I believe where this could have been art it became shallow and obtuse past the mid-way point. While there are some highlights, the plot just leaves glaring holes filled at awkward times.Check it out, but don't wet the bed in excitement.",

It seemed that all of the main actors were on the same page as far as the movie should go. And portrayed their roles perfectly. All of the actors worked together like a well made Swiss watch. Denis Villenueve masterfully managed to capture the intensity and suspense of this mesmerizing thriller. The director cemented his name as one of the best if not the best thriller masters in Hollywood today. I would rate it 18/20Cinematography - Was really impressive, and manages to capture the audience from the first shot of the movie and never let go of the viewer. The lightning seems bleak, but that just adds to suspense of the movie. There were a lot of impressive shots, including the very well made aerial shots of the USA - Mexican border. I would rate it 17/20Writing - A movie is as good as it's script. Well in this case it's marvelous. The movie delivers everything it promises and more. It manages to deliver the thrills and sense of intensity from the start. All through out the movie, viewers are encouraged to question every single character, because the line of good and bad in this movie is very thin. 20/20Score - The composer Johann Johannson manages to do a very good job. Score is done to perfection. Every bit of sound seems to fit the frames perfectly and just helps to add the thrills. I would rate it 18/20Acting - A give a very big A plus for all the actors in this movie. Like i mentioned before, everyone fitter the role pretty much perfectly with good casting. All of the actors performed very well, so it is very difficult to mention some in particular. It seemed like every actor added something personal to the role, that made them very memorable. The chemistry between actors was something special, every relationship between characters was really intensifying, and mesmerizing. I would rate it 20/20Now for the MVP of the movie is: Jon Bernthal, who truly might have slipped under the radar. But his performance was both memorable and amazing. Even though he didn't have very much of a screen time, what he did with what he got, was really masterful. He deliver a bad cop, who does not give a bad impression and hides under a mask. His character is like a wolf, disguised himself as a sheep.In Total i would rate this movie - 95/100. One of the best thrillers ever made, and one of the best last years movies.",

Very cliched plot, and the characters (especially Mexicans) are portrayed as caricatures. Comes across as propaganda that the United States should increase resources and get tougher on the war on drugs, despite the evidence that the policy is misguided and the war unwinnable. Some of the plot elements are so outrageous and unbelievable, even in the fantasy land of a Hollywood script. Terrible film, nothing interesting or redeeming.

    "review": "  Something about this one bugged me enough to write a review. Maybe because it is overrated on this site and a couple others. It is not a masterpiece, it is a 3.5 star at best. It had a solid premise, twist, intense scenes, score, and decent into darkness. It also has a powerful message to send about escalation and drug enforcement policy. What went wrong? I think the film relied too heavily on shock and drama to obscure from its shortcomings. The plot moved at a snail's pace for 3/4 of the film where little was explained or happened. Besides that it has one major problem. The lead character was insufferable. She was annoying, clueless, afraid, and amateur, despite this being her profession. Her treatment was also abysmal. She was used, mislead, and bullied by her teammates; threatened into submission. There are deliberate undertones of misogyny, and promotion of violence. Expected considering the subject matter and audience, though are no less disturbing to experience. As for it's realism. Something funny to know is that the CIA, Mexican Government, and town of Ju�rez all called bullshit and denounced the film, even getting it ban in several places, since violent and cartel related crime statistics have been steadily dropping for years thanks to successful DEA, FBI, CIA, Mexican Army and police efforts to quell the cartels. In many respects what is portrayed in the film is still very \"Hollywood\".",

It deals with morality, drug cartels in Mexico (specifically in Juarez, at the height of violence in 2010, not a mirror of it now) along with the conceptual theme of rape. Which is probably why it also made me feel extremely uncomfortable at the same time. The Taylor Sheridan penned screenplay with this subject matter as a theme, direction work of director Denis Villeneuve, and Johann Johannson's deservedly Oscar Nominated score add to the movie's brilliance (and why it is one of my Top Movies from 2015, at the moment).",

Basically the moral of the story is: you can't do anything about the status quo so you might as well perpetuate it. While that may be the current state of affairs in the 'war on drugs' today, it's hardly inspiring to make an entire film based on that premise. Really it all feels like a long slow build-up to nothing at all. It's ultimately anti-climactic and disappointing, and as the credits roll, one is left feeling distinctly underwhelmed. I understand how critics would enjoy such a gritty and depressing movie, but I do not understand the high audience rating. And to call it as a \"thriller\" is a stretch to say the least. Less than one eighth of the film could be characterized as \"thrilling\". That's tantamount to describing the latest \"Die Hard\" as a foreign film because it features 15 minutes of Russian dialogue.

    "review": "  Exceedingly bleak, brooding, violent and yet unapologetic, Sicario is a mature film conceived and executed by mature filmmakers. When tensions rise on the US-Mexico border, a task force is assembled, enlisting a passionate yet na�ve FBI agent (Emily Blunt) to aid in its efforts. The goals and actions of the task force represent a departure the young agent is not yet willing to make, yet feels inexplicably logical in an illogical world.With Sicario, talented director Denis Villeneuve takes on the drug war in really an unprecedented way. Its' political overtones, realism, and cynicism is reminiscent of the great Traffic, yet without the overwrought indignation. It's a slow burn, with a methodical build up and a matter-a-fact way of examining the brutality and carnage that cartels engage in, without glossing over government complicity. Vilenueve pulls no punches, and succeeds in making a film that is both enthralling and cerebral. It has a point of view, yet the viewer has to make their own interpretations. Shades of gray abound, a laudable departure from a genre that otherwise can succumb to less nuanced stories.The film's ensemble cast is second to none, featuring marvelous performances from all involved, including Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and Benicio Del Toro. Toro, for his part, showed a depth I haven't before seen from him. The chemistry between the cast is palpable and the direction brings the best out of the actors, whose complex characterizations all bring a much needed wrinkle to a the story.Toward the end, one would wish for more exploration of the film's major revelation, feeling a bit unsatisfying in the last act. Yet it still manages to bring something to the table that past genre pieces have not, a very real sense of hopelessness that, if never confronted, will never be defeated.4/5 Stars",

The film was gritty, it was dirty and it was tense.Firstly the movie is visually stunning, the cinematography is exceptional and Denis Villeneuve showcases his directorial talents once again after Prisoners and Enemy is showing he can consistently created well directed and captivating movies.The performances in the movie are also magnificent Emily Blunt delivers another terrific performance and is fast becoming the best actress within the action genre after her tremendous performance in Edge of Tomorrow. Her character is the person that we see the movie trough and is probably the only morally stable person in the whole film, and this gives her a feeling of vulnerability because although she can physically handle her self, unlike the other law enforcement officers she is too idealistic and doesn't always have what it takes to get the job done. But definitely the best performance and most intriguing character in the movie was Benicio Del Toro who gives a fabulous performance as Alejandro, he is a mysterious character who's motives are unclear until the end and you never really know who's side he is on. The only minor fault with this movie is that its story and at times very little interesting is happening. Without the tremendous performances and direction the film could have fallen flat on its face but they elevate it from just being another standard drug bust movie to one of the best films of 2015.",

It is a thin story that's elevated by numerous standout performances and a sense of realism rarely matched in cinema. With a few more wrinkles ironed out it could have been a classic. As it is it remains a very polished viewing.",

    "review": "  Deftly directed and superbly acted, Denis Villeneuve's \"Sicario\" takes an unflinching look at a brutal drug war. Emily Blunt's performance could be overlooked for its subtlety, but that's exactly what makes it powerful. In \"Edge of Tomorrow,\" Blunt was an indomitable warrior; in \"Sicario,\" she's Kate Macer, an FBI agent trying her best to be that warrior. Kate is steely and pragmatic, but thrust into a situation she has no control over, she's entirely vulnerable, and Blunt balances that resolve and helplessness brilliantly. Equally compelling, Benicio del Toro (the film's titular hitman) layers his ruthless mercenary with a rich complexity and humanity. His character, like others trapped in this morally grey world, cannot be readily defined as hero or villain; they are all victims of a corrupt and lawless system.",

It's shocking, it doesn't have many plot twists but there are a few moments after which i stared at the screen with my mouth open totally not expecting what has happened. The directing and the cinematography are huge contributors to the movie's atmosphere, the cinematography is probably my favorite part about it. The colors, wide shots, i can't describe how pleasing was it to watch it. My main complaint about the movie is Blunt's character. It was a constant moral battle for me to watch her. Sometimes i loved her, sometimes her strong moral compass pissed me off and i wished she understood what's happening, and then i loved her again for being so opinionated. That's the beauty of it, seeing such complex characters on screen, never knowing whether to love them or be annoyed. The acting both on Blunt's and of course on del Toro's parts is amazing.The most important part though: this movie is scary. Seeing how much innocent people are affected by drug cartels running their towns and at the same time how used they are to it. Gun shots, missing people, dead family members are not treated as a tragedy anymore, it's a part of their daily life. And to think people still live like this in the world. It's terrifying.",

You get a very realistic feel into a world that's so close but don't realize how little we know about until you see this.

    "review": "  Review: SicarioWell, it's here. Sicario was one of my most anticipated movies of the year, right up there with Spectre and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Now that I've seen it, I wouldn't dare call Sicario a disappointment, but I wouldn't label it as my favorite of the year. After Denis Villeneuve's underseen gem Prisoners back in 2013, I eagerly awaited his next major film (he made the limited-release film, Enemy, between then and now-I've yet to see it). The two films share the similarities of being intense, suspenseful and bleak, but where Prisoners featured limited venues and focused more on characters' emotions, Sicario is a globe-trotting film (between the US and Canada anyway) that focuses on characters' actions.Emily Blunt stars as Kate Macer, a young cop who's work in leading teams that hunt down kidnappers and victims hasn't gone unnoticed by the higher-ups. She has a loyal partner in Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya who gets the task of playing possibly the only likeable male character in the movie, and he does a great job). After an investigation goes wrong and two cops from her team end up killed, Kate is eager to find the men responsible. She is afforded this opportunity when a mysterious task force of mixed agencies asks her to join them in taking on a Mexican drug cartel they tell her is linked to the kidnappings she is investigating. She doesn't hesitate to volunteer, leaving Reggie behind at first, but when she realizes she can't trust the strange new men she is working with, she insists on her partner's presence. She has every reason not to trust them. Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) won't reveal what agency he works for. And he's a bit on the quirky side-he wears flip-flops. And his partner Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) is even more mysterious-he doesn't talk much and it feels unlikely to both Kate and the audience that he works for any reputable agency. It doesn't take long observing their unusual and violent tactics for the normally by-the-book Kate to wonder what she's gotten herself into. The team conjures up a dangerous plan to follow a Cartel higher-up to the leader of the whole thing so they can both be taken down, hopefully putting a big dent in the criminal activities. There is also a side story involving a crooked cop with a heart played by Maximiliano Hernandez. This story feels very tacked-on throughout the movie and it isn't until the very last scene that you finally realize the point to it-but it still feels somewhat unnecessary.Every actor in Sicario brings their A-game and does the best they can with what they've been given to work with. That's not to be overly mean to the script as it is an interesting story, but at times the dialogue seems very generic and some very important characters are often left with little to do. Blunt plays Kate much more feminine than her much tougher roles in Looper and Edge of Tomorrow would have you predicting, but she makes the character feel authentic and she carries the film well-that is until the filmmakers decide to lose her for some time to focus on Alejandro's agendas. This isn't easy on the audience because we're asked to accept him as a protagonist even though he is very violent and unlikeable. Del Toro plays the part well and practically owns the final act of the movie. It is clear Alejandro suffered some horrible tragedy in life-and I wish they would've included a flashback or two to some happier times for him so that we might find it easier to sympathise with him and understand his actions. Other good actors show up for small parts including Victor Garber as Kate's boss, Jon Bernthal as a character I won't reveal, and Jeffrey Donovan as a member of Matt's special task force.Behind the camera, master-cinematographer Roger Deakins works hard to make Sicario a unique visual experience. He's one of the best in the business (12 Academy Award nominations and still no win-Come on Oscar!) and proves himself once again here. Some of the natural skylines he captures are gorgeous and there is an amazing sequence where everything is seen through infrared and night-vision goggles-fans of the compound raid scene in Zero Dark Thirty will love this sequence. Editor Joe Walker makes sure the film doesn't drag too much. When things start to feel a bit slow, watch out-because something intense is about to happen. The score by Johann Johannsson is one of my favorites this year. Director Denis Villeneuve and writer Taylor Sheridan have made a film smart enough to please critics but mainstream enough to entertain audiences.Sicario is a film about moral flexibility. We, the audience, are forced to recognize that sometimes good people do evil things because they they believe it is for the greater good and sometime bad people do bad things to protect those closest to them. Other than some lazy dialogue here or there, Sicario's weakest attribute may be what feels like a lack of purpose. While it does open audiences' eyes to the war zone certain parts of Mexico have become do to these cartels, I couldn't help but feel like \"That was good, but what was the point?\" when the credits rolled. Still Sicario Is an intense thriller that deserves to be seen. 8/10?",

On the plane to El Paso, Texas, Kate meets Matt's partner, Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro), and learns that they are going to Ju�rez, Mexico, where they will extradite one of Diaz's top men, his brother Guillermo...Denis Villeneuve is back with yet another fantastic film after \"Prisoners\" and \"Enemy\" and his \"Sicario\" is a tour-de-force thriller that pushes the boundary of where justice and morality are no longer valid. We are driven straight into the depths of criminality and it�s not always clear who is the good guys and who is the bad guys. It all comes down to reaching results and not how you reach them. Blunt, Brolin and del Toro are simply magnificent and in the hands of Villeneuve and cinematographer Roger Deakins we are served an amazing dynamic piece of film that keeps your blood rushing for 121 minutes. The tension is high throughout the film even in more slowpaced scenes and as in \"Enemy\" Villeneuve works with industrial muffled weird sounds in the background that creates a dark and disturbing vibe that fits the film. Villeneuve shows a situation that is beyond salvation, while showing at the same time that life nevertheless continues no matter what happens in the shady parts of the world. The action is truly believable and you end up together with Blunt and Co while they are trying to understand the events that occur. The role of the observing Macer is by far one of Emily Blunt�s best performances to date. I love as well that Villeneuve isn�t afraid of keeping a distance to his actors and the dialogue like in one scene between Macer and Graver where the camera is several feet away. Great scene. Dan Jolin from Empire gave the film 5 stars, calling it \"a beautifully murky, hard-edged thriller. Quite simply, one of the best films of the year.\" And I can�t agree more. Trivia: While Benicio Del Toro's character is frequently silent in the movie, he initially had more lines. \"In the original script, the character explained his background several times to Kate,\" Del Toro says. \"And that gave me information about who this guy was, but it felt a little stiff to have someone you just met 15 minutes ago suddenly telling you what happened to him and who he is.\" Working with director Denis Villeneuve, Del Toro began cutting some of his dialogue to preserve the mystery of who his character is; Villeneuve estimates they cut 90 percent of what Del Toro was originally intended to say by screenwriter Taylor Sheridan. Like Del Toro, Villeneuve saw power in stripping the character down to a brooding silence, stating that dialogue belongs to plays and \"movies are about movement, character, and presence, and Benicio had all that.\"",

Tackling the cartel directly in Mexico. Along the way she meets mysterious quiet but menacing Benicio Del Toro and the fun really starts. The is a highly tense ride into a dark world. Excellent thumping soundtrack that adds to the tension. Brilliant cinematography and high/long shots of the vast Mexican land scape. All actors are brilliant especially Del Toro who conveys both the sadness and ruthless drive of his character. Blunt is also brilliant but somewhat frustrating as she try's to play by the book in a world where half measures aren't allowed. Some surprises, plenty of violence and tension, great acting, twists and turns, shocking scenes. Great soundtrack and shot perfectly.",

Everyone here is excellent and in top form, from the actors, who do so much with the little dialog available (Benicio del Toro uses facial expressions like a master painter wields a paint brush, Emily Blunt is haunting and powerful), the directing, the score, the cinematography, everything comes together here to give a gritty reality to a dangerous part of our world. The action is exciting, but reserved, and absolutely thrilling. I understand why it's been placed on so many top 10 lists. I think it's biggest flaw is pacing. There were enough lulls in the narrative that I found myself getting distracted. That's probably more of a critique on myself than anything, but since I'm reviewing what I thought, I think 4 stars out of 5 is about right.",

The first 25 - 30 minutes of the movie is traveling and BRoll shots, just the three of them riding in the SUV's to Mexico and then driving around in Mexico. Must be nice to get paid $10 million to ride around in a car for a third of the movie. Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and Benecio Del Toro must have delivered at most 100 - 200 lines of dialogue between the three of them, and to add insult to injury, the movie isn't mixed properly so you can't hear/understand anything they are saying without headphones on. The whole thing just seems like a mash up of scenes where they just wanted to try to do cool shit that has nothing to do with anything, or is going anywhere or adds any direction to the movie. A majority of the scenes were of the actors contemplating, or preparing for a raid, walking around, or traveling in cars.I'm a stickler for knowing what the names of the characters are, I couldn't tell you one.You only need to watch the last 30min of it because that is the only period where it gets suspenseful and interesting, but I couldn't tell you how it ties into the rest of the movie because all the scenes preceding it are self contained and drive the story no where.I'm not sure how this movie has an 87% from the audience or a 93% from the top critics, but that is just a testament to how Hollywood can cut a cool trailer and can sucker people into going to see something that has no substance or story.",

    "review": "  An excellent movie that obviously benefits from some fantastic performances from Benicio Del Toro, realistically, this might be one of his best and Emily Blunt. Though, honestly, I will say that this is the type of movie that doesn't really reveal all its cards until the last act. That makes watching the film, not necessarily difficult, require a little more patience from some of those in the audience. This approach, however, I think really adds to the movie, because you're just as much in the dark Emily Blunt's character is. You learn things as she learns them and not a moment before. The character work in the film is top-notch as Kate, Blunt's character, is doing her damnedest to try to do things by the book as everyone around her goes about doing things the way they want to and the way that would get the desired result, which is to bring Alarcon down. Kate, and Alejandro points this out in the ending of the film, is trying to traverse a world of wolves without the necessary skill set to do so. Not to say that she is a sheep among the wolves, but she is far too idealistic for the type of tasks that the people she's working with are doing. In fact, realistically speaking, Kate is essentially useless to the task these agents are trying to accomplish. I don't mean ineffectual, like Kurt Russell's character in Big Trouble in Little China, I just mean that her contributions, as sound and as smart as they may be, will never be considered by the team, because she is there simply so they can carry out their operation, nothing more. And I think that's one of the things this film does so well. It gives you this character, that's supposed to be the moral compass of the film, the only person who, seemingly, wants to do things the way they should be done and she, even with all her efforts, is unable to change the way things were done. It wasn't a lack of trying, it was willful ignorance from those who are higher up above her. She, to them, is just a small pawn in a clearly larger game. So I thought that was a a really interesting choice to take the character and one that, again, adds to the movie tremendously. As mentioned, the acting is pretty fantastic. Benicio Del Toro is quietly menacing in this film. He doesn't have to show a lot of emotion or communicate a lot, but you know that this man has seem some shit and would probably kill his own mother if he felt that she was getting in the way of his progress. It's also interesting seeing his character arc and witnessing how he ends up in the movie and what really was haunting this man for all this time. As mentioned, Emily Blunt is also excellent as well, and her character, from a narrative standpoint, is probably the most interesting in the film as she slowly realizes what she actually adds to this mission. So, yes, this is an excellent film, but one that's just not gonna show all its cards right off the bat. That makes it more rewarding to watch as a viewer. I'd highly recommend this, might be one of my favorites of last year.",

I feel like there are times where first time screenwriter Taylor Sheridan falters, such as the scene about an hour in where we first get to engage with the character of Kate Macy as she walks into a bar. After watching the film for an hour and having it make no attempts to get me to connect to this character, rather simply using her as a vessel for the audience (which I'm fine with) when she finally does walk into a bar and show her human side it completely jarred with what I was expecting to happen. Nevertheless, this sequence is used to propel the plot forwards at the same time and so this complaint quickly disappeared as I was watching. What the film gives us is a timely message about large, faceless branches of government doing what they want and answering to nobody, told through the eyes of a few key characters that it switches between at certain points. Typically beautiful visuals from Deakins, characters are created through the performances (del Toro being very good at this) rather than expository dialogue, haunting score, and a screenplay that accomplishes what it wants with very little dead weight.",

    "review": "  Denis Villeneuve's powerful compelling dark drama about a naive FBI agent named Kate Macer, played brilliantly by Emily Blunt, in a physically demanding turn here that is filled with true grit, she is a real badass in the role. Kate is assigned to a special elite task force led by its leader Matt, played superbly by Josh Brolin, to help in the never ending bloody battles against the insidious Mexican drug cartels, she crosses into Mexico on a clandestine mission into a lawless border area where headless corpses of murdered victims dangle from highway overpasses, with her mysterious mostly silent team companion Alejandro, a special \"consultant\" with a tragic past, played terrifically by a scene-stealing Benicio Del Toro. Kate will find soon question everything she believes in and her faith will be tested as the operation continues, in a land where anyone is a potential target or perpetrator. To say anymore about this film is to betray its sense of paranoia. Astute direction by Villeneuve, with magnificent pulse-pounding action-set pieces that are brutally intense and memorable. A taut script by Taylor Sheridan, Roger Deakin's ravishing sun-parched cinematography is very impressive, and Johann Johannsson's grandiose haunting score is superb. \"Sicario\" which means \"hitman\" in Spanish is a most remarkable motion picture in every sense of the word. Highly Recommended.",

Otherwise, a nigh perfect film. The action sequences are very visceral and tightly filmed, but the main draw is the relationship between Blunt and Del Toro. Really well done. Villeneuve is one of the best directors of today and has a very clear stamp on how he does movies. There was one scene in particular where the soldiers are going into an underground tunnel and their bodies are silhouetted against a red desert sky and the pitch-black earth. As they move forward, the camera is still and the silhouetted bodies seemingly disappear into the earth, seemingly swallowed into the depths of hell as it were. It was a stunning scene.",

    "review": "  Sicario is a bit two-dimensional in its effort to pull this \"We're just as bad as the bad guys\" motif out of its hat. The two-dimensionality trickles down to the characters who mostly just feel like cliches, which is a shame, and the remarkable cast does the best they can which, coupled with the outstanding cinematography and Denis Villeneuve's deft hand make it a compelling film. It mostly plays like a lesser Hurt Locker/Zero Dark Thirty and a less shaky Paul Greengrass film, and Villeneuve knows when and how to perfectly ratchet up the suspense on the film's explosions of violence. Benecio Del Toro has shades of Javier Bardem's character in No Country for Old Men but is somehow more terrifying, even given his hokey, flimsy backstory that feels like it never evolved after the script's first draft. The script is the main issue here. The subject matter is fascinating, and I just can't help feeling that this could have been an outstanding film were the characters given the requisite amount of depth to make you care what happens to them and the script stripped of the action/revenge/vigilante tropes that cheapens the film.",

    "review": "  I had high hopes for this film which is winning awards and getting someOscar buzz. The cast is amazing and the storyline is very interesting.However, there are some very gross flaws in the direction andcharacters in the film that caused me to give it a 7 (maybe even a 6)out of 10. The handful of great moments of intensity make it worth a 7,but this is not a best picture nominee. Without giving away anyspoilers, I can say the following:THE BAD: * Emily Blunt character does (or fails to do) what you expect she would. She fails to ask questions or show some basic skills you would expect for someone in her position.* She is not believable in her professional or personal behavior. Wedon't really get her. Yes, she's conflicted, but there are 4-5 timeswhere it makes no sense. * The story gets confusing and convoluted. Who are they going after and how and why and how does it all work out.Beyond implausible, it's like they edited 50% of the film away and leftus with some gaping holes. * Governmental agencies are jumbled and confusing to an absurd level. * A few action scenes are absurd. * Random locations with random people where you do not know who they are nor why they are there.What I love about feature films in theaters is the level of realism,acting and storytelling is generally FAR superior to any TV show ormovie. In this case, the director handles the character development andaction scenes more like a TV movie. The cave scene being the mostabsurd and the main character (Emily Blunt) feeling like a poorlywritten TV character. Benicio and Josh Brolin have their moments of greatness, but theircharacters are too gruff to care much about them. There isanother storyline about a Mexican police officer that is also poorlydeveloped. THE GOOD: You will feel like you understand the complexity of theMexico-US drug crisis. For those who feel doing illegal drugs does notharm anyone, this movie will give you a clear picture of the dangers tosociety and the corruption that exists along the border. Clearly, wehave major issues that must be addressed.",

It explore many different moral themes from different angles.It's the movie that leaves you asking quesitons, and really wondering about things after the movie is over. I think it's those kind of movies that are the real good ones. The narrative is somewhat complicated but not too difficult to follow.The acting is of the highest order here. Emily Blunt is fantastic and you truly believe her performance. She is asked to join a task force to try and take down the highest members of a Mexican Cartel. Yet she is uneasy at what her role truly is.Josh Brolin is the leader of the team..a brash, cocky veteran of the biz who uses whatever tactics necessary.The star to me was del Toro...when on screen he has a sense of mystery around him. He is steady, no nonsense, and really hardcore. He obviously has a difficult past and has bee morphed into a different kind of past. His role is also unknown throughout the movie as we learn more as it goes.The movie really asks questions about how the drug trade operates, the true purpose of the United States, and how corrupt things can be to maintain order.It's an eye opening film featuring 3 fantastic performances. There are scenes or extreme realism that is fueled by fantastic direction. The movie isn't really concerned with being an action piece, more of an eye opening piece.",

Emily Blunt's character could have been unlikable, or worse someone the audience is required to side with, instead she ends up as something like the Starks in Game of Thrones. Someone who's too forthright and honest to fully comprehend a world without rules. I love how even some of the smaller bad guys are not even shown as conflicted and human instead of monstrous. But what I like best of all is the presentation of a wider conflict as many of the characters and groups peripheral to the main characters have lives and wits of their own and do not exist solely for the main characters to show up. It reminds me of Heat in a great many ways, and is one of the only movies I could call a worthy successor to that (which is my favorite crime film).",

Filled with an unrelenting tension and suspense (It's a film that turns rolling down your car window into a tension filled event). It's almost a dark horror film. It exists in a grey area. Nobody is good (Except for Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya, who plays her buddy), but nobody is really bad either. Most are just grey, or bordering on bad. It's expertly shot, with cinematography by Roger Deacons. It deserves an Oscar nod/win for that alone. Emily Blunt has a flawless American accent and is beautiful in a normal, everyday way. She is our eyes into the film and she acts as our moral compass. Benicio Del Toro is what I like to call The Dark Angel of the film. Both he and Blunt deserve Oscar nods, him especially. He's a mysterious but very likable character and it is Blunt and him that are our main characters. Daniel Kaluuya is also fantastic. The opening scene is one of the best scenes in film this year. It's fantastic and gripping. Sicario is certainly a tough watch, and it's almost a downer of a film (Really, not a happy film....but what were you expecting?) but I applaud it for handling it's subject matter in an adult, mature way.",

    "review": "  I am honestly struggling to see why this film is quite so critically acclaimed? It is painfully predictable at the best of times, seriously, the underlying 'twist' was about as transparent as transparent can be. Emily Blunt also appears to be in my opinion a completely superfluous character. Considering she is supposedly the lead role in the film. It is really quite difficult to see the point in her actually being present most of the time as all she seems to do is cry, a lot. From what i can work out she is only there to constantly remind us that what is going on is most defiantly bad. Seriously. And as for thrilling, it's a joke. I can honestly say there wasn't a single moment I was even close to the edge of my seat, quite the opposite in fact, at one point struggled to actually stay conscious. This may be due to the poor character development throughout the entire film all of whom have the most minimal backstories I have come across in recent memory. Meaning I felt literally nothing for them throughout and frankly could not give a toss what happened to them or not. The only character I felt any sort of connection with was the father, who, of course, predictably died. I would say this is a spoiler but the entire movie is so transparent I don't feel this would be justified.The only saving grace is the excellent work done from the films camera crew which helps, as at least it gives stunning scenery shots to distract from the rest of the content.Thoroughly disappointed. There is a absolute wealth of great quality films out at the moment. The Martian, The Revenant, The Big Short to name but a few. Go and watch one of those instead and don't bother with this!",

    "review": "  I'd say this movie is more style over substance, but damn if that style isn't amazing. Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins killed the look of this movie. I was a huge fan of Prisoners and looked forward to another great slow burn from this duo. It did not disappoint with its grittiness and realistic take on the War on Drugs. The shots of Juarez, the open skies and other scenery were breathtaking. The tension was built up excellently and there were many suspenseful moments, particularly that traffic scene. The action was handled really well in between the slower parts of the movie. The acting was all around great, but the character development was lacking. Benicio Del Toro easily stole this movie and was the most interesting character by far. Emily Blunt did a good job but I wasn't a fan of her character. She didn't really develop much and was kind of bland. Josh Brolin did a great job of playing a confident, gum-chewing asshole. This is where this movie fell pretty short of Prisoners for me. I was so invested in multiple characters in that movie and in its story. The story in this film is rather passable. Not bad, but nothing special or that memorable. It was a good look at the debatably immoral, but necessary means needed to fight the War on Drugs and the impact it has on the inhabitants in Mexico. The last scene of the movie really stood out to me and made me feel such sadness for the Mexicans living among such violence. This movie has its powerful moments here and there, but the story and characters could have been a lot stronger. Still worth a watch though, because it looks absolutely incredible.",

There are more complexities that come from the lawyers and head hunters, but that is the least interesting portion of the story in my opinion. We follow Emily Blunt's character who is not used to this kind of field work, but the team she works for interested me much more. \"Sicario\" benefits from a very solid script, a tension-filled story, and terrific performances. I do think this film is slightly overrated, but it's concept is worth the price of admission alone. In the end, I really enjoyed watching this film. I did not buy into everything that happened, but in the end, it became one of the more interesting films of 2015.",

Why not simply tell Emily wtf is going on, rather than speaking in euphemisms.Benicio Del Toro turns into Rambo towards the end of the movieSome clear plot holes:1) What would Alejandro have done had the cop car not been there?2) Why did they need to care about the tunnel at all? They already had a drone on the Mercedes, so why not follow it all the way to the drug lords home?3) The drug lord wasn't hiding. He was out in the open, in a huge mansion. This would make him pretty easy to find in the real world!4) Why did they have to go in and out via Chevys? Why not fly in and out of Juarez with Guillermo?",

    "review": "  \"Sicario\" only proves that Denis Villeneuve is one of the greatest upcoming directors! \"Sicario\" tells a generic story about an FBI investigation on a drug cartel, that is elevated through Villeneuve's fantastic direction and Roger Deakins' gorgeous cinematography, both Oscar-worthy in this film. The entire cast gives great performances, Benicio Del Toro gives his best performance in years and Emily Blunt gives what is possibly her best performance. Josh Brolin is also very good as this charismatic police agent. This film shows its story in a very realistic and gritty way, making for some very strong scenes. \"Sicario\" is one of the most powerful and one of the best-looking films of 2015!",

This one too focus on all the details, is long-winded and yet doesn't really have much to say in the end .

    "review": "  Sicario is a very realistic and disturbingly gritty thriller. The movie follows a team of FBI agents, as well as some others, but I'm not really all-knowing about this sort of stuff, who are trying to uncover the biggest cartel business in Juarez. Emily Blunt plays a very careful agent who tries to do everything by the book and when she's given an opportunity to help other agents to infiltrate this cartel, she immediately accepts the offer, but what she doesn't know is that the people she agreed to help are people who don't do anything by the book and are keeping secrets from her. That's the story in short, I don't explain stories very well in these reviews, but I feel like I have to... Anyways, the story is very intriguing and I was hooked from the very beginning. There are many disturbing and brutal scenes that will leave you breathless! The ending is, especially, unsettling. And while it does at times seem like it's something you've already seen before, you certainly won't think that once you see the ending. The acting was fantastic! Benicio Del Toro and Emily Blunt are the absolute best in this movie! Benicio Del Toro's character is very mysterious and has a very dark past and once you find out his actual intentions, you're gonna be quite surprised. Emily Blunt's character, on the other hand, seems like one of the only reasonable characters in the entire movie. The movie looks terrific! The entire movie has this orange/sepia sort of filter and it really works well with the scenes. All in all, one of the better movies this year and one certainly worth watching!",

    "review": "  \"In Mexico SICARIO means HITMAN\"'Sicario' is an Action Thriller / Crime Drama that follows an FBI agent who gets thrown into a war against the drug cartels operating along the border of the US and Mexico. Apart from the stellar cast leading the film, i was most excited to see this film because of it being directed by Denis Villenueve. For those of you who don't know, he directed 2013's 'Prisoners' and 2014's 'Enemy', both are incredibly fantastic films that were directed to near perfection and you should definitely check out. This was still a fantastically directed film by Villenueve, but compared to those films i just mentioned, this one has many other flaws that didn't make it quite as intense as i hoped it would be from seeing the trailers. If you are looking for a fast paced, high octane action thriller, this is not it. Much like his previous films, this is a very character driven story where the film at times is carried on the backs of the amazing performances by Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro. Despite these praises, there are elements of the film that i didn't enjoy and harmed my overall experience with the film. The film started off very promising, it showed off some some of the thriller elements whilst also introducing our characters and the main overall plot of the film which was pretty meh up until the last third of the film. I was initially intrigued by what was going on and wanted to find out more about what is really going on behind the scenes, especially with Del Toro's character. But for almost the entire second act of the film, i found myself checking my phone a few times because it dragged on and on and didn't look to be ending any time soon. It had some short moments that were quite interesting in terms of character development and getting me a little more interested in the plot. But overall, the second act wasn't all that compelling to watch like the rest of the film was. I feel like they tried to do a lot to set up the finale, and just the way it was structured became an issue for me. A lot of scenes didn't quite make sense and took me out of it a bit. It all ran at a fairly slow pace which i was expecting but there were no dramatic or intense tones to get me engaged with what was going on, apart from one or two moments. A lot of this middle section relied purely on the performances of Blunt, Brolin, and Del Toro, and even though they were fantastic it wasn't enough to make me enjoy this section. It's hard to explain, but just a lot of the writing in this section looks and sounds good on paper, but the execution wasn't great. That being said, the last 30 minutes of this movie....... SPECTACULAR. Not going to give anything away but shit hits the fan from a storytelling standpoint, a character standpoint and an action thriller standpoint and this really saved the film for me. All of the little bits and pieces that were set up throughout the film come full circle and you realise a lot of things that maybe didn't make sense earlier make total sense now, such as 'why is the film even called Sicario?....... **You know what, stuff this, i'm gonna revoke some of the things i have mentioned so far MID REVIEW but not edit it out, because thinking about the end, and then thinking about what happened earlier is making me realise that this film was a lot smarter and well crafted than i thought it was 5 minutes ago. I obviously can't talk about any of the things i am thinking about, but this is probably going to make me watch it again like i did with 'Prisoners' and 'Enemy', and i reckon i might enjoy it more the second time, only time will tell. But as i mentioned before, the performances of Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro were all absolutely fantastic. I am not necessarily surprised because they are all incredible actors but in this film when they came together no-one took anything away from the others' performances. One did stand out well above the others but it didn't make me love the other performances less, if anything each performance added to the others. There is also quite a bit of talent in the supporting roles but due to the scope of these three large actors always commanding the screen they will most likely go largely unnoticed. In the end, Sicario is a film that definitely not everyone will appreciate. It is more than an action thriller and incorporates great amounts of drama, and plenty of intense moments. The second act of the film whilst watching it did really hurt my enjoyment of the film in the moment, but as i mentioned, it didn't bother me nearly as much and i actually now praise some of the decisions they made. If you like Villenueve's previous films this one is not quite up to par but you can still see a lot of his signature all over this film and that is what i enjoyed about it. - 7.2",

    "review": "  \"Sicario\" is a realistic interpretation of the drug trade in Mexico as seen through the eyes of a slightly ignorant FBI operative. The film did not arrive with the same pomp as \"The Martian\" (which opened the same weekend), but it left an equally large impression on the critics. It is dark, gritty, and the only thing more disturbing than the imagery of cadavers hanging in the streets is the idea that the residents of Juarez have accepted this atmosphere as a part of daily life. The story seems a bit overdramatic but a little research shows this portrayal to be chillingly accurate. Moreover, the main reason that Juarez has descended from its rank as the most violent city in the world is because one drug cartel has defeated its rivals. One would hope that the police and military had brought order to the area, but that is simply not the case. Director Denis Villeneuve has made a bold statement about the government corruption and drug violence that rule this area. Most of the critical praise surrounding \"Sicario\" has involved the acting. Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro turn in impressive performances through subtle but powerful moments. I could see either of them receiving an Oscar nomination but neither performance is good enough to win. Josh Brolin also gives the high-caliber performance that we expect from him. I do feel that the film moves a bit too slow, especially after a riveting opening sequence, but the pace gives you a chance to reflect on the unfortunate circumstance of the area. The film focuses on situational development more than character development so that, in the end, you feel a greater attachment to the story than the characters within. \"Sicario\" accomplishes its goal of bringing awareness to the drug violence in Mexico through strong acting performances and a story that is so unbelievable that you have to believe it.",

Sicario is tightly directed and it's aerial shots are marvelous. It even has all the things you might see in real life missions, torture, night vision and thermal vision and when you compare it with the cinematography in the end of zero dark thirty, it's a level beyond. The script is sensible, but it could have had more story. The acting is perfect for the script, Emily Blunt delivers terrific emotion in scenes where she speaks nothing at all. Benecio Del Toro is good, but I somehow believe that I have seen him in better films. Josh Brolin gives one of his better performances in years.",

This slow-burn thriller recalls all the very best hallmarks of Steven Soderbergh classic Traffic, but intensifies and contemporizes this unstoppable war with frightening reality.You'll see it in the fluidic cinematography; the insane prisoner transfer through the streets of Tijuana is one of the year's finest scenes. Johan Johannson's ominous score adds to the continual overhanging sense of pointlessness of this war. But it's the trio of performances that really give Sicario its integrity. Brolin and Del Toro are both excellent, displaying the varying elusive and ambiguous qualities of their respective characters with great depth. But its Blunt's in-over-her-head FBI recruit who is the heart and soul of this film; its the two qualities completely redundant and wasted in the cyclical, cynical hopelessness this war weighs down on those with any humanity.So, not an uplifting film by any stretch, but a tensely accurate thriller that reminds us all that some wars are unwinnable.",

    "review": "  Denis Villeneuve may just be the most exciting and original film maker working in Hollywood currently, he recent psyche crushing thrillers have been a marvel to behold, if not ever so slightly flawed in the smallest of places. Sicario is his latest release before bringing the Blade Runner sequel to the big screen, and although many hardcore fans wait with bated breath, Sicario can act as a solid piece of entertainment to give them some confidence. Going bolder than ever before, Sicario follows the growing turmoil between the border of USA and Mexico, with cartel's massacring all walks of life for money, boredom or drugs. Presented with an opening to find the man in charge of such travesty, a covert government task force enlist the help of a by the books FBI agent, which she is all too happy to comply with, until she uncovers the corrupt and game changing mentality such a force need in order to succeed. From the moment Roger Deakins glorious cinematography lights up the screen and the pounding score breaks in, you instantly know your in for something thrilling and disgusting and Sicario doesnt let you down. The film continually throws you off guard by playing up a typical genre movie, only to snatch your expectations from underneath you and force you to endure a different breed of film. The performances in this film are stunning, Emily Blunt is beyond wonderful as Kate, our protagonist, Josh Brolin does what he does and to great effect, Benecio Del Toro almost steals the show and Jon Berenthal shows up to be an asshole for a brief amount of time. Sicario deals with some horrendous themes and subject matter, so having the cast downplay their performances really allows the grit of the piece to come through, especially when we question the force's tactics only to have them explain what needs to be done to win this war. It's harrowing and it manages to cause a range of emotions from disgust to anger, paranoia to fear and this is what sets Sicario apart from its competition, the film will have you on a razor blade throughout its 2 hour run time, managing to craft some of the most intense sequences you can imagine from the most unlikely of places, without spoiling anything, a traffic jam at the Mexican border will have you reaching for the valium. Its a wonderfully shot and excellently conceptualized thriller which plays the long game, rather than place all its eggs in one basket. Sicario's weakness is sadly its rock solid body armour, the film is so bleak and dank, so full of double crossing and back stabbing, its pretty hard to fully connect with. There are points during Sicario you will either feel lost or have an odd sense of deflation, quite possibly from being on edge constantly, and although if it were intentional this feeling would be acceptable, it happens all too often and for no good reason. Luckily Villeneauve bookends these moments with moments so shocking and pungent it almost makes up for it, almost. Sicario isnt perfect, but its stunning, gripping and darker than oil, an intense ride that will alienate some but further cements a director who may just be about to move up to another level entirely.",

    "review": "  A powerful piece of work from director Denis Villeneuve. More than that, it's nearly a masterpiece of sustained and unbearable tension, the sort of movie that gets the audience to feel that something truly awful could erupt at any moment. It's a grim and unflinching film, one that is unafraid to make the audience witness some very intense and unpleasant realities about confronting the drug cartels along the border. As the lead, Emily Blunt is incredible, delivering a performance full of depth that completely sells this by-the-book character's realization of the gravity of the situation she finds herself in; this is Blunt's finest hour, and it is one of the standout performances of the year. She's equally matched by Benicio Del Toro's subtle and enigmatic turn; it's not a showy role, in the traditional sense, because Del Toro plays everything incredibly close to the vest, and he makes what could have been a one-note character into the page into a dynamic and magnetic presence. Roger Deakins' cinematography is fairly stripped down, in contrast to his usually painterly style, but his photography here matches the harshness of the subject matter perfectly (and still finds a way to include some legitimately beautiful compositions, to be sure). If one wanted to nitpick, the plot specifics are - at times - a bit murky, but this appears to be by design. With this, PRISONERS, and ENEMY, Villeneuve has firmly established himself as one of the best thriller directors working today, and while it might be too downbeat for some to stomach, SICARIO is an engrossing and frightening movie, and an experience that won't be easy to shake.",

    "review": "  I can confidently say that 'Sicario' is one of the best movies of 2015. This movie exposes the bitter reality we desperately tried to hide, and by doing so, it makes us question about the fundamental values we have taken granted, so far. The most remarkable and charming point of 'Sicario' is it's complicated characters. There are neither perfect heroes nor utter villains in the movie. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses, and we, the audiences have much trouble in separating the sheep from the goats.  There are several critical issues that the movie requires the audiences to think about. The first one is about the law and the justice. Matt is very competent CIA agent, at least in the war against the drug. He frequently breaks the law, and sometimes, even makes us to question whether his acts are justifiable, but ironically these are the main constituents of his ability. In some sense, he is the most dangerous character in this movie. As the movie progresses, we are somewhat persuaded by him, and begin to think that maybe sometimes, to root out the great evil like the drug, it is allowable to cross a line. Like 'for the greater good' thing. However, is it? Who is entitled to allow such violence of law and injustice?  Kate is the complete opposite of Matt. She is faithful, righteous, and principled FBI agent. She is qualified for the typical protagonist, and we can say she was a good police officer in Phoenix where the rule of law still existed. However, ironically, in this fierce war against the drug, she is helpless and even incompetent because of her faith and morality. I wonder whether she is a 'good' police to deal with the drug problem, because she could not solve anything. This irony itself is what the movie requires us to think about the law. Law is the basic rule which we, by ourselves, made to live on the straight. However, if the law is helpless and incompetent to eradicate the evil and corruption of people, then, where is the place for the law? What is the meaning of the law?  Alejandro is the most complicated character who hides so many secrets. He helps Kate in critical moments. On the other hand, he ruthlessly killed the innocent woman and children for his personal revenge. He was originally a prosecutor, which means that he knows the law, and understands the very meaning of justice and morality. However, the extreme experience made him to do such cold-blooded thing. Can we judge him, and criticize him whose wife's head was cut off, and whose daughters were thrown in hydrochloric acid? To make our society healthy, we must think that even so, this behavior is unjustifiable. However, in the bottom of my heart, I am not sure. Then, what is justice? Second one is about the evil. To be precise, the banality of evil. From the beginning of the movie, it intermittently shows Silvio's everyday life with his son, right after Kate's life in work or home. At first, I thought these scenes are meaningless, but now I understand the meaning of them. In my opinion, this character, Silvio represents the banality of evil. Silvio is an ordinary man, diligent police officer, and good father who cares about his son very much. On the other hand, he works for the cartel, and delivers drugs which destroys millions of families. That is, he is also the part of the evil that should be eradicated. This is the essence of evil. Not every bad guy looks like a monster. He or she is usually among our neighborhood, and can be good mother or father for their children, and outside home, destroys millions of families. No one is born evil, and looks like devil. No one is designated to be evil. 'Sicario' is the movie that sets an extreme condition and require the audience to continuously question about the most basic rule and faith of our society. It does not give answers to these questions. Perhaps, no one can. I believe finding an answer is an obligation of all of us 'who lives in the lands of the wolves' I'd like to finish this plain review with the quote from 'Mad Max : Fury road', another fabulous movie of 2015 : \"Where must we go, we who wander this wasteland, in search of our better selves - the First Man\"",

    "review": "  Sicario is a bit of a tough movie to watch because it seems like the producer wants to desensitize the audience when it comes to murder and humanity. The fact that there are bodies hidden in the walls and hung across the tunnels in Mexico and Kate's lacking facial expression when she sees these atrocities shows that mutilated dead bodies are somewhat normal. This movie relates to the movie, Border Town, because of the misrepresentation of Mexico. Even though drug cartels exist, it seems like producers make these type of films to highlight the negative aspects of the country. City officials of Juarez even stated that this movie was depicting the city in a bad light. They also stated that criminal activities have declined since the movie has been made, so it appears that the producer wants to milk the criminal activity in Mexico as much as he can in order to make a masterpiece of a movie. Although one of the themes in the movie tries to portray the glorified murders in Mexico, an interesting theme in the movie is how they assigned a female to play the part of an FBI agent. Just like in the movie, Border Town� when Jennifer Lopez's character was assigned to play the lead role in solving or documenting a murder case, Kate, the FBI agent, is seen taking a stand and trying to figure out how to solve the case even after she was told that she wasn't needed anymore. Kate relates to Jennifer Lopez's character in Border Town after her boss decides not to use her information because he wants to sell out. These female characters are often assigned important roles in order to be demoted into the character that is no longer needed. This is borderline sexist because movies like this seem to be allowing the female characters to get a taste of being superior and to be considered as one of the guys when in reality they are just being used by the white men to gain access to the valuables. This movie proves itself to be sexist as well as devaluation of humanity because of the displays of dead bodies everywhere and that one female character who is considered to be of no use after the white men obtain what was needed. This movie appears to be insensitive to the people living in Juarez because they are communicating to the audience that this is not a safe place to visit or be. Sicario can influence a viewer to believe that the city of Juarez is dangerous and should be avoided at all costs.",

    "review": "  Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Enemy) has proven to be a dominating force in cinema. Sicario is an another outstanding achievement in his career. This time, Villeneuve takes on America's war on drugs. From start to finish, Sicario is a tension filled spectacle. If ever think the film will ever ease up, don't hold your breath. Sicario follows a FBI Special Weapons and Tactics Teams agent Kate Macer, played by Emily Blunt. During a drug raid, a bomb goes off killing two fellow officers. She meets Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), a Department of Defense adviser who is setting up a team to capture those responsible. Kate is offered a spot, which she accepts. She soon meets Matt's mysterious partner, Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Kate begins to discover Matt's and Alejandro's unorthodox and illegal procedures. Sicario is dark and gripping tale held together by a strong direction, screenplay, and acting. Emily Blunt gives an outstanding performance that should earn her an Oscar nomination. Much like the audience, Kate is in the dark about Matt's and Alejandro's agenda. As the film progresses, she is given more light on their agenda, but is morally conflicted of how they are going about it. She wants to capture this drug lord, but at what cost? One of Blunt's strongest aspects of her performance is her facial expressions. It highlights her confusion and frustration with the situation. Brolin is stellar as the cocky team leader. Matt's one and only goal is to take down this drug lord in any way he can. He doesn't lose sleep about the way he goes about it, it's just business. The most mysterious character is Alejandro. Del Toro gives bone chilling performance. It is also his most captivating performance since Traffic. Maybe films about illegal drug trade is his calling. The unsettling direction by Villeneuve is brilliantly captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins. Deakins uses actual darkness to capitalize on the film's gritty nature. If I had to give one warning about Sicario is that there is no shining light at the end of the tunnel. The film does not give the viewer anything or anyone to hold on to. Sicario commits in being dark. You feel like you have to cleanse yourself afterwards. But while you are watching the film, you will be glued. Sicario is one of the most captivating films of the year.",

A very well put together film with great cinematography by Legendary DP Roger Deakins. Solid Performances by Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benecio Del Toro.

My only small gripe is maybe the emptiness feeling and a sense of satisfaction or resolution you would expect, but that might just be my own preference here.

    "review": "  An average film. Nothing particularly gripping, just very violent. It seems as though some of the violence depicted is based on the real life events/violence going on in Mexico. However, a lot of the plot seems rather unrealistic. For example, I thought Emily Blunt's character's relationship with the Swat team should have panned out differently because of both her attitude, voiced opposition to the unruly behaviour/operations of the Swat team and also when she goes off on her own during a live operation. You would have expected some harm to come to her. The other thing I did not get was how Emily's character and that of her partner who seem to be both in position through political correctness rather than ability, no matter how much the film tries to say otherwise, are able to just slot into the Swat team's operations. Just not realistic at all, almost stupid. A bit like joining the Navy Seals for an operation with no training at all. Then Del Torro fails to deal with Emily Blunt's character in the manner consistent with his character. Similarly, the last scene involving Del Torro and the Drug Lord is rather silly to say the least. Hasn't the director seen Scarface. In short, there are some good parts to the film and some ridiculous, almost lazy parts that the director could have sorted out if he had a bit more balls. Scorcessee would have made a classic out of this. It was begging for it.",

With this title we been presented a blue print of what about too see. FBI agents Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) and Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya) raid the house of a suspected kidnappers. The team finds more than dozen of bodies hidden on the walls of the house.After this operation Kate's boos recommend her to Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) a CIA Special Activities Division to join the team. Matt is searching for a cartel boss who presumably was one of the responsible of the murders found by Kate and Reggie.Kate character is a green agent who still learning the vicious cycle inside FBI and CIA. Throughout the film she start discovering the corruption, manipulation, abuse of power of this federals agencies, but she is unaware of who is the real enemy. Kate is a strong woman on the outside, vulnerable for been alone and also divorced, it's also supporter of ethics and respect in the force, one of her biggest enemies in this war against corruption. Arriving to el Paso, Texas in a orchestrated operation lead by Matt Graver, Kate meet with Alejandro Gallic (Benicio del Toro) an advisor who seems to have ties with enemy. Alejandro is very sketchy person, and Kate figure out the first time she see him.Besides all this red flags Matt use it as his primary connection to get the cartel people capture.Sicario is a thriller but also a great film about the hard reality of drug traffic in US borders. Masterfully directed by Denis Villeneuve (Enemy, Prisoners) the movie immerse you in a harsh terrain where only the strongest succeed. Villeneuve engage with the audience with a rollercoaster of emotions by manipulating the senses. Sicario have constant moments of silence, also supported by the impactful original score by J�hann J�hannsson and the intense sound crafted for this film. The visual style is borrowed from films by Steven Sodergber in Traffic, also Jonathan Demme in Silence of The Lambs. The intense and long aerial shots are powerful and serve as another character for the movieAfter carefully you finish the film you came to the conclusion who is the enemy and who are the zealots. You care for Kate's character but not so much for Matt and Alejandro. The true meaning of sicario is the search for fanatical and uncompromising pursuit of ideas, that could be religious or political, you just need to pick one.",

    "review": "  One has to love brilliant acting from Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro, the most brilliant soundtrack which creates pounding tension and proper suspense, cinematography to create proper tension among sequences, etc. The story about drug trade is not new at all. After all these years' war on drugs, we are still fighting drug cartels, or drug cartels fighting one another, and so on. There is no black and white anymore as we might get the hint from Benicio del Toro' s character. And you know what? It is true. And who are we to judge what is right and what could possibly be definitely wrong?One of my top three movies in 2015.",

    "review": "  Sicario achieves the reality of drug wars that is often traded for the Hollywood effect; a reality where there are no losses or winnings, only trade-offs, and no heroes or villains, only victims. Intensely action packed from beginning to end, Sicario will have you at the edge of your seat while showing the astounding and brutal reality of drug wars and how powerful drug cartels really are.Directed by Denis Villeneuve, Sicario is a film about an FBI agent who is enlisted by the government on a mission to bring down the leader of a powerful Mexican cartel. The flawless performance of Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro, along with stunning cinematography, create a heavy and suspenseful atmosphere throughout the movie.Most importantly however, is the story and its relevance to the real situation. As someone who lived in Juarez / El Paso while the worst of the drug wars was taking place, who watched news stories after news stories of brutal assassinations, shootings and kidnappings, and who saw how the city became deserted as people moved out and businesses closed due to fear, I got chills while watching this movie. One just had to innocently be at the wrong place at the wrong time to have an unlucky fate.Sicario portrays the reality of a very cruel but important issue. While this film will not leave you with a warm feeling or a happy ending, you will be immersed into a very dark place and be surprised by how deep you will go.",

The side story of the Mexican family was so believable and gave the audience time to catch their breath. And then back comes the Heavy thunder of the main story!

Las actuaciones de Emily Blunt y sobre todo de Benicio del Toro son fenomenales, la direcci�n de Denis Villeneuve es impecable, el desarrollo de la psicolog�a de los personajes es muy impresionante.

De film sterren Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, en Josh Brolin. Deze film werd gekozen om te strijden voor de Palme d'Or op het 2015 Cannes Film Festival.-In december 2013 werd aangekondigd dat Denis Villeneuve een Mexicaanse grens drama zou dirigeren, Sicario (het Spaanse woord voor Hitman).--Kritische reactie:-Sicario wordt alom geprezen door critici. Recensie aggregator website RottenTomatoes, de film heeft een goedkeuringsscore van 93%, gebaseerd op 184 reviews, met een gemiddelde waardering van 8.1/10.. De site's kritische consensus leest. \"Geleid door uitstekende werk van Emily Blunt en Benicio Del Toro, Sicario is een strak, stevig gespannen thriller met veel meer bezig dan aandacht trekkende decorstukken.\" Op Metacritic, de film heeft een gewogen gemiddelde score van 81 uit 100, gebaseerd op 41 critici, met vermelding \"success\". Op CinemaScore, publiek heeft de film een gemiddelde cijfer van \"A-\" op een A TOT F-schaal.-Richard Roeper heeft de film een tien, noemt het een van de beste van dit jaar, en bejubeld del Toro's performance, zeggende: \"...er is del Toro, die loert over de marge van de actie voor het merendeel van het verhaal, en dan in actie springt in een handvol sc�nes in een verscheidenheid van manieren die laat geschud laten - en dankbaar om een zo mooi donker werk gezien te hebben'.-Dan Jolin van Empire heeft de film 5 sterren en noemt het \"een prachtig duistere, keiharde thriller. Gewoon ��n van de beste films van het jaar.\"-hoewel haar personage Kate Mercer niet plausibel is, Emily Blunt \"brazens uit eventuele onrechtmatigheden met grote actering focus en front\".- \"kunstig en spraakmakend\" en \"onberispelijk realistische momenten\", heeft een aantal tekortkomingen. Ten eerste, de federale agenten\".agressieve tactieken en overtredingen in regels in Sicario zijn veel meer nodeloos dan eender wat hij getuigde in zijn verslag. Ten tweede is er een gebrek aan invallende Spaanse rechtshandhaving agenten, zoals personages, in de film in verhouding tot die momenteel in het echte leven werkend. Tenslotte de film richt zich overwegend op het Amerikaanse oogpunt in de war on drugs.-heeft de film een B-, waaruit blijkt dat het gebrek aan karakter ontwikkeling was een afknapper ondanks extreem sterke cinematografische en stijlvol regisseren. Hij voegde er nog aan toe dat \"Sicario wellicht ��n van de meest melancholische, moreel failliet, en ethisch inhoudsloze mainstream films die dit jaar is uitgebracht; toch, zulke zwaarmoedigheid komt met het grondgebied van het huidige, politicus-gebrandmerkte 'war on drugs'.-Chris Ryan van Grantland vergelijkt Sicario met de film Apocalypse Now geregisseerd door Francis Ford Coppola. Hij stelt de gelijkenis van de visuals met betrekking tot de respectieve narratieven van de twee films. Hij schrijft ook dat de karakters Alejandro Gillick, en Matt graven in Sicario zijn vergelijkbaar met die van kolonel Kurtz en William Kilgore, respectievelijk in Apocalypse Now.--Reactie van ambtenaren in Ciudad Ju�rez (Mexico):-Sicario's portrettering van Ciudad Ju�rez werd bekritiseerd door functionarissen van die stad, die dachten dat de film hun stad in een kwaad daglicht stelde. In de film opgenomen sequenties die kadavers opknoping aan downtown viaducten en nachtelijke vuurgevechten in de stad vertoont. Deze ambtenaren zijn van mening dat op het moment van de release van de film, de intensiteit van criminele activiteit in de stad aanzienlijk waren gedaald ten opzichte van voorgaande perioden.- Bestudering van de Amerikaanse War on Drugs:-Volgens Sebastian Rotella, Sicario onderzocht vele aspecten van de oorlog tegen drugs door de Verenigde Staten tegen, meestal, drugskartels in Mexico, Zuid-Amerika en Midden-Amerika. Een perspectief nemend als een Amerikaanse, zo merkte hij op dat de film illustreert hoe de Amerikaanse war on drugs is \"wat ons in het bijzonder tot monsters maakt die wij proberen te verslaan.\" Bovendien is de situatie in Mexico, met betrekking tot de illegale drugshandel, gestagneert voor twee decennia, zoals van de film's release. Dit punt is herhaaldelijk door het personage Matt Graves gemaakt in de film.",

But however perfect I want it to be, this movie still has flaws. The characters aren't too unique or interesting in their own right, they're all just tropes, and the scenes near the end that focus on Benicio del Toro's character, while great, feel out of place with the rest of the movie. Despite the faults that it has, all its accomplishments are enough to outweigh them and to make this the best major motion picture of 2015 so far. A mainstream North American film that is subtle and challenges the audience? Who could've thunk it?",

Blending an almost majestic quality to the scope and span of the lands between Mexico and the US, which in simple terms for Sicario, the entrance to hell. The three lead performances of Josh Brolin, Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro are remarkable and mesmerizing to watch, with Blunt's traumatized protagonist leading us through a greenhorn's look at across the Mexican border and into a dark and violent world where law is forgotten and a distant idea. Brolin is likeable and charming as the commander of the squadron, Blunt is remarkable in her depiction of a woman thrust into a very real side of cruelty and injustice, but Del Toro steals the show with his as what I can only call the sicario, or hitman. His character's deeply troubled backstory adds to the disturbing nature of the somber and calm way he handles himself and commits atrocities, making you truly question what he stands for. The action scenes are incredibly thought out and the growing tension and suspense is Hitchcock level in how the scenes are set. The soundtrack adds a dark, ominous and thrilling atmosphere to an already chillingly grim and real movie.",

    "review": "  Sicario can be summed up in one word: intense. From the explosive first scene to the pulse pounding conclusion, the film is unrelenting in both its imagery and pace. This does not, however, hide the fact that the lead character, played by Emily Blunt, is a weak willed female being dominated by her male counterparts. This is a shame, as in the past, Emily Blunt has portrayed very strong female leads, such as in Looper or Edge of Tomorrow. I was looking forward to her dominating the screen, but instead found her crying more than she was helping her mission. The story is interesting, but once everything is set in motion, it is hard not to predict just what is really going on behind the curtain. It would be a mistake not to commend Roger Deakins on his brilliant cinematography, as there are some brilliant shots of Mexico that are haunting in their beauty. The soundtrack also helps to lend a sense of weight to the proceedings. I'm alway impressed with Denis Villeneuve's direction, and this is no exception. If it weren't for the disappointing lead character, and the predictable plot points, this may have been up there for my favourite film of the year. If you enjoy dark thrillers, action films or dramas, this should definitely be on your short list for movies to watch this year. 4 out of 5 stars.",

Blunt tine un personaje femenino complejo y bien construido y que es una extrapolaci�n del propio p�blico; mientras que Del Toro tiene un personaje que est� dise�ado para \"caer bien\", pero que en el fondo sabes que tiene algo oscuro y perturbador.La fotograf�a de Deakins es brillante, destacando su trabajo en la escena del t�nel.

Her FBI agent's horror is ours, from the moment when she discovers how brutal the gangs can be at the beginning of the movie right up to the moment when she lowers her handgun, realizing she is not in fact brutal enough herself to compete in the world of secrecy and violence she has visited during the film. Pretty rough fare but excellently done!",

I believe that even though there were no rapes involved crimes throughout the movie, there are still simular themes. Both Sicario and Bordertown deal with gender relations in the postion of authority. In addition, both movies had character in which played both sides of good and evil for personal gain.",

    "review": "  Sicario does not hold the audience's hand. In fact, even Emily Blunt's character is mostly left out of the loop as Denis Villeneuve dives into the unknown of crime and corruption. The build-up of tension is thus more impactful, with excellent cinematography that captures the sprawling environments which would be explored. The intertwining subplot is only occasionally seen, but it is there to further the ripple effect that the main plot causes.While Blunt and Josh Brolin are solid, Benicio Del Toro is one to look out for, as his character has a lot on his mind. The actors in general do display bits of comic relief to ease the film's stressful nature. Nevertheless, Blunt's character is purposely treated in a sexist manner, only so that she can properly manifest her opposition to the unethical procedures being ran by the team with whom she otherwise thought her methods would be useful.The lack of soundtrack of course adds more tension to demanding scenes, while the music that does play is visceral. And off-screen sound plays a key role in the alienation of the plot towards us and Blunt's character.Denis Villeneuve is however no stranger to tackling unconventional methods of storytelling, and thanks to his and his crew's fine work, Sicario proves to be a mysterious, daring, competent crime thriller.",

    "review": "  I was not a fan of director Denis Villeneuve's first two efforts (\"Prisoners\" and \"Enemy\"), both of which I felt suffered from weak writing.� Luckily, with this film, Villeneuve finally found the right material to suit his style.� Everything hits right in this movie, it's the perfect storm of an excellent script, sharp directing, and a stellar cast.� The actors are all at the top of their games, particularly Benicio Del Toro, who is in peak badass form.� The film has the same stylized look and ominous tone as Villeneuve's first two features, but as a composition, this one is far superior.� The film starts with a bang (there aren't even any opening credits) and grabs your attention right out of the gate, I was hooked within the first 5 minutes.� The story skims along nicely and maintains high-tension throughout, and makes excellent use of music to help pile on the tension.� It's not easy to watch, but it's to be commended that the film does not pull its punches, and it's all the more affecting for it.�� There are some pretty disturbing images and concepts here, but that's really the point.� This movie does not give you the typical \"good guy/bad guy\" scenario that we can all sit back and be comfortable with.� Instead, it's a full-tilt exploration of moral ambiguity and challenges your ideas of what being a \"good\" or \"bad\" guy even means.� But more than anything, it's a depressing confirmation that the 'War on Drugs' is hopelessly unwinnable. It does lose some points for a having a female lead who, in typical Hollywood fashion, ultimately has to be saved by a man.� So that was disappointing, I would have liked to see the so-called \"strong female lead\" save herself for a change.� But that's really all I can say against it.� This is an intelligent, atmospheric, gripping, and thought-provoking psychological thriller, that's also incredibly well made.� It doesn't give you the warm fuzzies, nor should it, but it should be seen.",

A young FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is working with the FBI to catch drug trafficker with a violent record. Sadly, she finds that the scope of the corruption is beyond her understanding. She is recruited by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) to be part of an Undercover Team to pick up a witness across the Mexican Border, and bring him back to the United States. Kate meets Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) who is a Consultant that she doesn't understand his job. As they cross the border, everything she believes is tested and her loyalties come in question. Their mission to find a notorious Drug King Pin turns into a bloody path with no real distinction between wrong and right. This movie is such a brilliantly directed movie with a perfect cast. Emily Blunt is so convincing as the naive FBI agent & Del Toro steals the screen with just one look. I expect this to be one of the contenders for awards season.",

If you are Western movie lover, like I am, this movie is the most accurate homage to western movies. The directing and editing of this movie is as impressive as the writing, because for a movie with great actors and a great writing the director does not disappoint, everybody brings their A game to this movie, making this movie a story that is rip off of today dark news headlines.

There's not much to say about the plot, since it's more about emotionally exploring the world of drug cartels on the other side of the American border. Through terrible events that occur around and directly to the main character, an idealistic white woman (an important storytelling decision), our sense of American law, order, and justice is crushed.

    "review": "  The biggest war that America needs to win isn't in the middle east or South Asia. It is deep within its heartland where the drug lords of the Mexican cartels have spread the highly influential poison and there is no sign of it ceasing. Tons of illicit drugs pass through secretive tunnels beneath the borders of USA and Mexico, accounting to some very wealthy and powerful cartels while scores of Americans perish under their harmful effects. Parts of Mexico are literally the most violent places on Earth and while Denis Villeneuve's 'Sicario' showcases all these realities between the borders, it serves merely as a backdrop to the true motive hidden beneath the story's surface. This covert war on drugs by America is completely in the gray area of morality and justice of which, Kate (Emily Blunt) is an exponent. She is, however, only learning to cope with the reality around her which alters itself brutally and that, makes her the perfect proxy for the audience. The cartel has pushed deeper into American soil with Manuel Diaz controlling much of their trade through his legit businesses. While raiding one of his properties for a kidnapping investigation, FBI agent Kate discovers several decaying bodies hidden behind the walls of a house in Chandler, AZ and a subsequent explosion in the backyard shed leaves two of her agents dead. Determined to bring Manuel to justice, she agrees to volunteer in a covert CIA mission led by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin). On their way to El Paso, she is introduced to the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), whose shady background keeps Kate on guard but whose sharpness on field soon gains her respect. What follows is perhaps the most tense, suspenseful sequence where the agents extradite Guillermo (Manuel's brother) in and out of a prison in Juarez. Brilliantly executed with escalating build-up, aerial cinematography of chaos and a thumping background score, this has to be among the finest moments in recent cinema. Emily Blunt's performance thereafter, portraying Kate's disbelief in the irresponsible engagement with the cartel members at the border in the midst of civilians, is outstanding. Throughout the film, she shows her righteous side that upholds justice, procedure and law. She is vocal about the ambiguity of the mission but as the events unfold, she is left with no choice but to become part of Matt's anarchic team. They soon track down Manuel and initiate a plan that would require him to meet the Cartel's head in Mexico to answer some questions. Against the backdrop of an incredible sunset, the team discovers the tunnel that would lead them to the cartel but Kate sees things she wasn't supposed to. Josh Brolin really gets into his character as he enlightens her about the reality that will be too much for her to handle. He is a bad-ass agent who isn't shaken by the guns firing around him as he chews his gum. Brolin depicts Matt's coldness but with purpose as he sets himself to pursue the bigger objective of the mission. Between Kate's idealism and Alejandro's darkness, Matt is simply a reality check for the situation and Josh Brolin delivers that superbly. Mayhem on a personal level ensues after the tunnel episode and without revealing much of the story's twist, it should suffice to say that it all makes sense in the end. Benicio Del Toro revisits the cartel world after 'Traffic', 'Che' and 'Escobar'. His insight into Alejandro's character seems naturally easy with a rock solid composure under any circumstance that is a result of his dark past. We will never know what he precisely did with the 10 gallon water container that he took into the interrogation room where Guillermo was held and that, is the level of intrigue held by Del Toro's performance. Screenwriter Taylor Sheridan doesn't just focus on the menace of cartel activity on the streets. The film also goes into its effect on a completely normal family of Silvio, a police officer in Mexico who gets his hands dirty for that extra income. Kate's evolution as a special agent in the war on drugs is in sharp contrast to Silvio's journey. The cinematography by Roger Deakins truly brings out the thrill of imminent danger with vast aerial shots, wide sunset shots and close, dark encounters in the tunnel sequence and the minimalist background score by Johan Johannsson's simply augments the effect. Villeneuve delineates this covert war on drugs without the typical mainstream approach. He shows monstrosity taking over both sides, resulting in total neglect of judicial process, law and morals. Benicio Del Toro is the manifestation of this monstrosity in a laudable performance that should win him a nomination for the Oscars. 'Sicario' isn't triumphant for society but it truly is one of the best thrillers that shows the merciless environment created by the cartels on both sides of the border. 8.987 on a scale of 1-10.",

    "review": "  Mexico's gruesome cartel wars makes for a bleak and deeply unsettling subject, but in recent years it's been mined by a number of directors and yielded a slew of terrific films. Sin Nombre, Cartel Land, Narco Cultura and a few others come to mind. Sicario has now firmly planted itself in that group. Probably best described as a cross between Zero Dark Thirty and No Country for Old Men, this movie borrows some of the best elements of both films to paint a brutal, deeply cynical portrait of \"The War on Drugs\" and its gruesome human costs. Without delving too deep into the story since you should see it - tonight if you could - but Emily Blunt gives a terrific turn as strong-headed, by-the-book FBI agent overwhelmed by an amorphous moral morass she finds herself in. Benicio Del Toro has always been a versatile actor - and he's been one of my favorite character actors since The Usual Suspects. He's been in enough cartel movies to be dangerously-close to being typecast. That said, he always brings something extra to these movies and he does amazing work here as a world-weary, mysterious enforcer. The past few weeks have been great for devastatingly-bleak films about real-world issues anchored by phenomenal performances (I saw this shortly after watching Beasts of No Nation which saw Idris Elba and newcomer Abraham Attah deliver awards-worthy work). Like that film, much of Sicario's haunting power comes from its rootedness in the ugliness of the world we live in but often choose to acknowledge.",

    "review": "  A pure mood piece. Stellar acting, a nervy score and assured pacing make Sicario the best thriller of the year. Without hyperbolising, this is an utterly visceral experience, with Villevenue gripping you tightly and holding you down, forcing you to witness the atrocities, which, whilst mostly played with nuance and style, are undeniably vile, with the revulsion pushed to the limit by the end of the film. This is a brutal, cold, unflinching and often breathtaking thriller, with awards-worthy work from actors Blunt and Del Toro, as well as covertly masterful cinematography from veteran Roger Deakins. If there's one flaw it's that, whilst Sicario may seep inside you as you watch, the wider point it makes about the situation in Mexico is rather unsubstantial if you consider it a few days later. No matter, this is pulse pounding thrill ride and any other clich� I could put here to close the review. It's good - watch it.",

    "review": "  It felt very un-Hollywood as it took its time to reel you into the plot. It was a very slow simmer with bursts of activity, but slowly getting hotter and hotter through the movie. It did a good job of making you feel the uncertainty and chaos that Emily Blunt is living in as you never really know where the plot is going or what is next. It is very raw. And the subject matter is super dark dealing with the drug lords in Mexico and the battle between them and the CIA. If it is even 50% true to life it is pretty scary and makes you scratch your head about the world. Overall, a good movie.",

    "review": "  I've really enjoyed Denis Villeneuve's films Prisoners, Incendies, and Enemy (this one was a little too weird for me, especially at the end) so I was definitely interested in this film from the get go. Sicario opens with a very intense and exciting scene that sets the tone for the entire film. Emily Blunt does a great job carrying most of the film and the supporting cast is really great as well. Bencio Del Toro, who I think is a tremendous actor, is great in this and can be one of the best actors in Hollywood when he chooses the correct role. This film is very deep and intense and I really enjoyed it and it will almost certainly be one of the favorite films of 2015.",

    "review": "  Denis Vilneuve is an expert in tension and atmosphere - this much I know. Sicario is a story highly worthy of being told. A very entertaining and flawlessly executed movie that made me hold my breath multiple times. Sometimes I felt so tense, that any little sound made me jump out of my seat. It's a gritty examination of Mexico's dire drug problem and its effects on the USA. Outstanding cinematography - of a landscape that is character in itself- and music that heightens the tension combine with Villeneuve's superb storytelling and intense performances especially by Emily Blunt- who holds her own in a tough male dominated world. Del Toro and Blunt both deliver outstanding performances, but Emily Blunt has an edge of steel. She brings off a mix of confidence, bewilderment and vulnerability. If you don't wanna watch this movie for its story, watch it for her. She ralmost knocks everyone else unconscious in this movie.Sicario is the kind of drama/action movie you wanna (or should) see. The tension and emotions are present 110%. The whole time I could not stop asking myself the question ''Who will pull the trigger first?''. You don't really trust anyone except Kate (Emily Blunt) - who is not trusting anyone either. Every time an ally is met, that ally either dies or betrays someone. Sicario is a completely engrossing, beautifully shot, terrifically acted thriller that exceeds expectations. I won't give away the opening scene, but I'd find it hard to believe that you're bored after seeing that. It's ultimately disturbing, kind of dark in a way, but that's also one of the reason why it succeeds: it reaches out to the audience and plays with your emotions.Villeneuve's taut direction, combined with beautiful cinematography, and an amazing score, make Sicario one of his best in his constantly growing filmography. The end result is a great movie that will hopefully get recognition at award season. A tense drama that is engaging yet leaves you feeling helpless at the end.",

    "review": "  Enemy, Prisoners and now... Sicario; Denis Villeneuve proves once and for all that he is one of, if not, THE most talented new directors to hit our screens in quite some time. For me, Sicario is one of the most grounded and realistic films i've ever seen. Every gunshot, every stand off and every corpse you see feels tactile, has gravitas and feels important. Rather than a story about the \"War on Drugs\", Sicario is much more a comment on the war and american foreign policy in general which originally took me off guard but I believe offered a much more deep and rewarding narrative for a film of such defined scope. The direction by Villeneuve is remarkably immersive as you the audience are treated just like Kate (Emily Blunt's character) as you are thrown into the story, out of depth and unsure of what lies ahead trying to negotiate the morality of what you see before you. Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin are remarkable while Benecio Del Toro is simply superb and deserves a nomination for, what I feel, is a career defining role as the troubled and enigmatic Alejandro. The moody, steady paced and brooding tone of the picture is matched by Roger Deakins' signature flawless cinematography where images of the vast landscape of Juarez and El Paso flow like liquid and where nighttime shots ACTUALLY look like nighttime!!! The thumping composed score by Johann Johannsson feels like that of a horror movie and keeps tension as high as possible during gripping build ups to shootouts between the cartel and the FBI. To conclude... Sicario is a film where it's weight doesn't hit you until you step out of the screen and really contemplate what you've just witnessed. One of the best films of the year and a real treat.... GO SEE IT!!!!",

His character was just scary and a badass. I really do think Benicio del Toro is Oscar-worthy. Same thing goes for the score and cinematography. Also the directing from Denis Villeneuve is also Oscar worthy and it's one of the best directed films so far this year. Villeneuve is starting to become one of my favorite directors in Hollywood. The story is very tense and in the end you'll feel disgusted and shocked. Overall if your a fan of thrillers or very intense story telling then this is the film for you.",

    "review": "  SICARIO is a thrilling film that plays like a gradual punch of adrenaline; it places and lingers the tension for a gripping experience - courtesy of the original score's strong presence and top-notch directorial and cinematographic execution. Not for the faint-hearted, this film truly aims to make viewers feel the weight and is great in many ways once some glaring flaws are overlooked (including a script that by the end wasn't as expansive and fulfilling as initially indicated as well as some rushed but important moments of decision and protocol); it employs high stakes and tense scenes that effectively utilize the tools of cinema, and does so in a way that admirably and provocatively explores the conflict between morality and serviceability.",

Emily Blunt's performance stands out, much in the same way as Jodie Forster's did in Silence of the Lambs, as she is not only the main character but the only female character in a sea of male testosterone - which makes the decision strange when she was sidelined in the finale confrontation. I suppose that this is illustrative of the film's insistence on realism and grittiness over contrivances and for that, I do applaud, but as a result, the downbeat and disconnected ending feels less than satisfying but maybe the gender unfairness is the point here?",

    "review": "  Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro put in two excellent performances in this thriller about the war on drugs between the US and Mexico. Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners) this is well executed film with some very tense set pieces. The story focuses on Kate Macy played by Emily Blunt, an FBI agent who has been hand picked to join an elite task force headed by Josh Brolin. However Macy is kept mostly in the dark about what her job is and it is this separation that the audience also feels. If Macy is the moral and righteous core on the flip-side you have Benicio Del Toro, who plays Alejandro, a Colombian consultant with some questionable methods of interrogation. And like Del Toro must of the characters in the film are unapologetic about who they are and realistic about the situation they are in which just adds to the whole sense of alienation and griminess of the film. Although it is a film that very well made it isn't one that you'll instantly want to watch again. However having said that you do feel that this part of something more epic.",

    "review": "  It is unclear why this film was made except for Americans to beat off to yet another mindless action-adventure that the studio tried to make legitimate by including Emily Blunt in the film. The development of the characters in this film likely occurred in ten or twenty minutes with the screenwriter arguing with the director over a bologna sandwich. Matt is the typical brash but yet relaxed government agent of unknown origin, who is somehow made into a complete character here by giving him flip-flops so we can see his relaxed side. Alejandro has all the charisma of Frankenstein uttering lines that would make Tom Cruise blush, such as \"You are asking me how a watch works. Just pay attention to the time.\" There is more drama and legitimacy in any episode of CSI or NCIS than this turd of a movie. We are supposed to believe that Blunt, who appears to have a passive and unnatural role in a kidnapping squad is brought into the inner circle of homeland security/CIA to tag along with special ops and so forth. In her work with the FBI she has likely used a gun once or twice and now is carrying a machine-gun down a tunnel into Mexico. I had to laugh when Alejandro brings Blunt's character a piece of paper at the end to sign to approve of what happened. Sure, sure, that's how it works, there is some piece of paper that CIA or special ops carries around and so long as it is signed, then everything is fine, and how convenient to create an ethical dilemma for the character. The comparisons here to Michael Mann are comedic -- this film is not worthy of the dirty toilet paper used on the set of a film like Heat. There are too many cliches in this film to count -- the slightly overweight slap-happy military types. The older bravado US Marshall types who are OK with joking about drinking to make your hand steady. The older White man Washington insider serious types. The field agent with more of an ethical awareness type who is brought into a world of greater moral ambiguity. The classic American bar scene where you get a couple of beers and have a honky tonk dance but be careful not to get double-crossed rape by border control agent gone rogue who happens to look like a Hispanic version of Bruce Springsteen with his nose broken. And how tragic that those little plastic-y wrist bracelets that everyone wears for cancer awareness and such can now apparently tip us off to anyone with a heart of evil. Josh Brolin steals a lot here from Jesse \"the Body\" Ventura's work in Predator I. How about the scene where Alejandro carefully folds his white linen jacket to add some complexity to his character. I can just imagine the director asking the writer to fill out the character a bit more and the writer comes up with idea of having him fold his jacket. If you want to see a Michael Mann movie, see a Michael Mann movie. If you want to see a two-hour version of CSI Mexico, then you might enjoy this.",

    "review": "  I was looking forward to seeing this, due to its high ratings by both critics and audience, despite it having a bad trailer. But all I can say after watching it, is \"why?\". The characters were more of just robots than fleshed out people with interesting backstories. The main character was a naive punching-bag, and might as well have been and audience member who also had no idea what was going on. I might have cared about the story or the tension more if I cared in the slightest for any of the characters. The one character that was more than a guy who \"does this\" or is \"Mr. I'm Mysterious\", was Kate's friend who was at least funny and cared about her. To add on to that, there was never a moment where something went wrong. Everything went way too well through the entire movie. Not a single character offed, no unexpected mistakes made by the police, no plot-twists (if it can even be said to have one in the first place).The \"plot\" follows an officer who decides to help out some people catch this cartel guy who is bombing places. She is left in the dark about everything, which could have been good if we actually knew anything. After all the shooting and proving that she doesn't know what she's doing in this corrupt place, it becomes a revenge story for the last fifth of the movie. After the \"Revenge Guy\" unsurprisingly kills off the \"Cartel Guy\"s family, the movie ends with solidifying how much of an ass all the other characters are to Kate and showing that she will just willingly take everything up the ass, like the rest of the film. No development, it didn't even feel like something changed by the end of the film, nothing felt different.All I have to say about the good in this, is that the acting was good for what they had, the choice of audio was great, and they didn't rely on flashy action scenes when there was action. Maybe most people could self-insert themselves as Kate because the shock factor of having decapitated people and dead children did them in, but it's not that shocking. I saw this and thought, \"Ok, just another day of brutal criminal activity in Mexico\". It's not that different to the stuff that drowns throughout the news every day. This movie is relying too much on us for a reaction.Overall, the characters are boring, the story is left a mystery as to what the point is, the acting is good but what it was used for was not, the effects and audio were great, and the mexican kid at the end was neither sad nor completely oblivious to the fact that his father is dead, which leaves the scene pretty pointless. If the point of this film was to show how big of a problem the cartel is, the entire story should have been surrounding how much Kate was against it and not waver from that. But in the end, she's just a wuss who just accepts the shit and doesn't really make the people watching it think that it is more than just another crime film.",

    "review": "  Denis Villeneuve has made two amazing films in the past few years. Prisoners and Enemy were both on my top ten list for both 2013 and 2014. Sicario, is another fantastic accomplishment from Mr. Villeneuve. Sicario looks beautiful on the big screen and has an amazing, Oscar-worthy performance from Benicio Del Toro. This film is intense, shocking, and unpredictable. I had no clue what was going to happen. Each scene has a sense of dread, which, in this case, is a good thing, because it added to the suspense. Sicario is also beautifully shot by Roger Deakins. Sicario was ALMOST a masterpiece. But, then there's that one itsy-bitsy little flaw that keeps it from reaching that kind of status. And that flaw is our main heroine. Now, Emily Blunt gives a terrific performance, but, the character is just very irritating. She is constantly questioning and not following orders and it just really doesn't work. You can't connect with her. But, other than that, I had no problems with this film. Sicario is one of the best films of the year. I can't wait to see what Denis Villeneuve does with the new Blade Runner film.Rating: A",

    "review": "  Buttressed by competent performances all around, \"Sicario\" is most successful when it constructs tightly-wound action/suspense sequences and allows them to go their merry way.Where it falls short is in its didactic attempt to address Important Issues. In this it is much like director Denis Villeneuve's previous film \"Prisoners\", which presented the post-Iraq world with Dick Cheney's torture dilemma; namely, if faced with a \"ticking clock\" scenario, is it ethically permissible to use whatever means necessary (torture) to beat the clock (terrorist attack, but in \"Prisoners\", a hostage scenario)? We the viewers are led to believe that this is an impossible, \"Sophie's Choice\"-type decision. But this is a nonsensical dilemma, as it is founded on false premises, namely, that torture is a reliable method for gathering accurate, \"actionable\" information. Similarly, \"Sicario\" presents its audience with quite a predicament: either we act outside the law (violating Mexico's sovereignty, torturing prisoners, assassinating cartel members on behalf of other cartels, using CIA operatives in domestic operations, etc), or else the flow of drugs across America's southern border will be unhindered! Left unanswered (or unasked, really) is the rather pertinent question \"Why would that be a bad thing, exactly?\" If \"Sicario\" weren't attempting to apply \"Zero Dark Thirty\" [sic] reasoning to the contemporary Mexican Drug Wars, one wouldn't think twice about the omission. But alas it does, and one does. \"Sicario\" nails its action/thriller/suspense aspects, but it's not nearly thoughtful enough (in contrast to, say, Soderbergh's \"Traffic\") to get away with lecturing any viewer with a functioning cerebellum.",

    "review": "  Blend a bit of Traffic, Training Day and a pinch of Se7en and you're on your way to getting the vibe of this super-slick thriller.Roger Deakins' cinematography contrasts the scorched, barren landscape of the U.S./Mexico border and the shady, midnight dealings of the FBI to great effect. The atmosphere created continues to ride a murky grey line between the two worlds, highlighting the conflicting attitudes of the central characters portrayed by Blunt and Del Toro.The war on drugs theme gives you the sense of Soderbergh's Traffic, but the quandary suffered by central character Macy (Blunt) as she is thrust into the slimy world of Matt & Alejandro (Brolin and Del Toro) is very reminiscent of Training Day. There's the great acting of both those films, as well as the superb acting, but Sicario succeeds in having a female character that be considered both weak and strong.Early on Blunt is shown to be a women just getting by in a man's world - always one step behind, having to ask questions and not quite in a powerful enough position to do anything about it. I thought it an illusion of a strong female character; portrayed to be strong because she's holding a gun, cussing and smoking. However, as the gripping story powered on it became clear that her strength came from still fighting for her ideals against a brick wall of secrecy and dirty deals.Some of the set pieces are very taut and the whole piece is very well directed. However, I found a few times I predicted quite a few moments that were intended to be shocks. This should in no way take away from screenwriter Taylor Sheridan and director Denis Villeneuve, who have delivered a fine film, that kept my attention throughout, in an time where mediocrity is so easy. Benicio Del Toro hasn't been this good in years (with the exception of Che) and Blunt and co. add to the universally great performances.Well worth a watch. Four and a half *'s",

I don't really want to get too detailed about it because this is the sort of story that constantly unfolds and you have no fucking clue where it's going. What I will say is it doesn't mess around, it's as ruthless as its characters and there are some truly brutal moments in this that gave me such a warm feeling of satisfaction that films rarely give me these days. There are no \"good\" guys or \"bad\" guys, everyone operates within shades of grey with their own agendas and motivations, you know, like real life. There's no pandering to the audience, no cliches and no Hollywood ending. Basically everything I want from a film. Emily Blunt is great, but Benicio del Toro steals the show. He's excellent in every possible way, and he doesn't even have to try.",

Centered on the border between El Paso, TX and Juarez, CH the drug business sucks in the rich, the poor, the poor that become rich and adds moral uncertainty to the roles of the FBI, DEA and any other person or agency sucked in by its vortex. Most conflicted is an FBI agent played by Emily Blunt who is allowed to join, what amounts to a paramilitary organization, because of her knowledge of some of the drug cartel's key players. It's a difficult role to play because anyone in it is going to be conflicted between FBI legalistic mind-set and the atrocities of the cartels. In a way, it's too bad (or done on purpose) that a female was given the role of the goody-two-shoes in the all-male (who looked like a Delta team) group of hunter-killers. Benicio Del Toro is just right as the team's 'consultant'. Josh Brolin comes off like the American tourist you don't want to see on vacation, but emerges as a guy who knows his deadly business.

I can't even go on to mention how much of a career high point this is for almost everyone involved. The characters played by Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro are incredibly fascinating and compelling at the same time anyone in a minor role is memorable enough. With incredibly effective thrills, enduring tense character development added to that with such immersive substance, to go with how beautifully shot and neatly directed this film really is.

    "review": "  'Sicario' Misses the Target'Sicario' is a U.S./Mexico border drama about...well...I'm not sure what it's about, and that's the main problem with the film. It lack coherence and focus. The film starts off centered on F.B.I. Agent Kate Macer and her desire for revenge. Then it becomes a film about the questionable morals of federal policing agencies on the border. Then it mutates into a revenge film about a completely different character. That might work if the plot was not so logically flawed. It might also work if we had more of a back-story on the characters. In one scene, Agent Macer takes home a Phoenix cop. It's clearly a set up, and we are expected to believe a trained F.B.I. agent would fall for such an obvious ploy. There is nothing to suggest that she is easily fooled or that the people behind it are that clever. Besides, the plan relies on coincidence and there is no guarantee that it would work. It is based on stereotypical notions of female weakness and illogic and clashes with the notion that Macer is a tough agent. If we knew she had made mistakes of judgement in the past, it might have been more credible. However, almost no backstory is provided for her character. Macer is a patsy, which is fine, but then why make her the main character? And if she is the main character, why move away from her entirely during a large portion of the film? It is because the film, for all its pretense at making a smart, complex drama is plot driven and the characters are secondary. Thus, the actions that the plot dictates don't make sense for who the characters are. Visually, the film looks flat. Certainly, part of that is because of the filming in low-light situations. I wonder if it is also because some of it was filmed in HD video, or was it? The music is good, meaning, I didn't notice it. What holds this film together at all is the acting. Brolin, Blunt and Del Toro are as good a trio of actors as you can find in film, and they deliver. Too bad none of them are let off the reins so we can appreciate their talents. Critics are fond of discussing the film they wanted to see and then slamming films for not satisfying their preconceptions. So, here it goes. The film needed to focus on either agent Macer or Alejandro (Del Toro) and complete their tale of revenge. Neither of these characters' actions are clever and in fact, they are quite predictable. Good thing the drug lords are easily duped and overpowered. Rating: Rent it.There is no reason to see this in the theater, except perhaps the beautiful overhead shots of the border between El Paso and Juarez. The film attempts to address large themes of betrayal, honor, corruption and revenged, but it misses the target. Peace,Tex Shelters",

    "review": "  This was definitely not 93% and 8.1/10 in my book. I give it a 70/100 and no more. We've seen all of this before, so it is not fresh and/or new. Emily Blunt reminded me of Sansa Stark, always emotional and sad, which she does fine, but her performance did not stand out from what one would expect in this role. Del Toro and Brolin gave better performances but they had more interesting characters. The movie was \"mumbly\" as well. In real life, we do not enunciate every sentence to make sure it is spoken clearly and easily understood. So, in that way it is realistic, but you also may miss a few lines. BBC's Sherlock also does this to my annoyance. The pacing was agonizingly, glacially slow. If you take a five star movie and add 15 minutes of non-essential material, it will lose a star. They advertised it as a thriller, but it dragged so much I stopped caring what was going to happen to anyone, and was yawning way more than I wanted to. Like The Hobbit, it would have been much better if it was edited more tightly. What also was annoying was the film focussed so much on the Emily Blunt character, but the real story is about the Del Toro character, which made the storytelling uneven. I was disappointed and I do not see what the critics or the 28K users who really liked it see.",

Director Denis Villeneuve is quickly becoming Canada's David Fincher in some ways, or in other ways, a relative to the Coen Brothers. That all being said, this was my least favorite of Villeneuve's films so far that I've seen of 3 (this, Prisoners, and Enemy). Comparisons aside this was easily one of the years best films and Villeneuve may very well get his first oscar nomination for this one or at least some of the cast at hand here. Especially Emily Blunt who has never been better than she is here. The atmosphere and everything about this film was quite unpredictable and you really never know what is going to happen. There is shock value here and realism that may turn off some viewers but all in all it's an incredibly rewarding experience for film lovers. This is one not to be missed but also not one for the faint of heart.",

The performances are first-rate, as expected from this cast. Benicio Del Toro in particular is outstanding.

Reminiscent of Hitchcock use of the medium. The cinematography from Deakins is absolutely gorgeous and the performances from all on board is fantastic but special mention must go to Del Toro who makes Washingtons character in Man on Fire look like a boy scout. Outstanding movie from Denis Villeneuve. ??Emily Blunt is a FBi SWAT leader seconded into an elite unit tasked with bringing down a Mexican cartel but refuses to cross a line of no return lead by the murky CIA operative Josh Brolin with the mysterious Del Toro in the back ground.

    "review": "  Drug movies have always been films of real intrigue for me. I don't know why but I just really get fascinated by how a drug system works or just a character or organizations stuggle in the midst of that dangerous world. Sicario is a brutal no holds barred picture that tackles the drug cartel in mexico but looks even deeper into human psychology, motives and desires, and just shows a war on two fronts if you will. Emily Blunt, Benecio Del Toro and Josh Brolin lead in this impactful story directed by the man behind the Sinster prisoners flick Denis Villenueve.  Kate Macer is an Idealistic FBI Agent who is good at what she does. She is a woman agent in an intense and highly dangerous environment. She gets word that she will be placed on a special task force to find a drug kingpin who is elusive, and has been killing and selling drugs for the longest time. She meets Matt Garver and the mysterious Alejandro. As the film progresses and she goes into the field she witnesses that something fishy is going on and that the guys are going beyond the required jurisdiction.This was just Gritty real and straight up hardcore. It's a film that challenges morality and what could very well shake your moral code. Nice directing from denies villeneuve his style from prisoners carries over here. Sound editing was superb here veeeery real Emily Blunt did a really good job here. Kate represents hope and a very idealized kind of individual almost the ideal FBI agent. Only problem I had was with her character development I kinda wished she was a bit stronger of a female character I mean I was kinda hoping she was more like linda Hamilton here and I was hoping she could be more mentally tough because she got broken down on both fronts for a good chunk of the film and it kinda disappointed me a bit but not to much she still did a very good acting job here. Josh Brolin did a fine job but the real highlight even beyond blunt is Benecio Del Toro. By the end of the film I came to reeeeally love Benecio del toro's anti hero character alejandro. He lost so much and in such a brutal fashion. He almost is like mirror to kate as they seem to have once been the same kind of person despite working different professions at the time. Del toro portrays such a cold character who has thrown his own morality out the window and is honed in on achieving his goal. He is like a wolf with rabbies that just needs to be pointed in the right direction. Wonder who would win in a fight whitey bulger or alejandro?Despite the Emily blunt deal the writing was real neat it sort of a film that builds in excitement and intrigue. Lot of reaaly good shots cinematography wise. Great score too. Sicario is incredible...nothing else really needs to be said.. go see this when you can!",

    "review": "  Considering the subject matter (a specialist drug-busting unit, murky operatives from the FBI and CIA along with gangland warlords) you could be forgiven for thinking you have seen it all before. Actually you probably have, just not done quite as well. Right from the opening scene when you find your heart beating to the same drum as the music score provides (the music is so atmospheric and original), this draws you in, clamps you in its jaws and only lets go with its closing titles. In fact there is nothing to criticise here at all. The casting and therefore the acting is superb. Direction by Denis Villeneuve (comparable to Kathryn Bigelow's style in The Hurt Locker) is needle-sharp. Scene after scene has you on the edge of your seat. Not a film for the squeamish, but still stylish and not unnecessarily gory, this is surely set to be one of the films of the year.",

Sicario is another fantastic movie, while not as fantastic as Prisoners and Enemy. Emily Blunt is great, Josh Brolin is really good, and Benicio Del Toro is phenomenal. This movie starts out super intense, and you learn early on that Roger Deakin's cinematography is going to dominate the screen. After a crazy highway scene, the movie slows down and kinda bored me for a good 10 minutes. However, it picks back up and keeps my attention all the way through its fantastic second half. The last 20 minutes is some of the most intense directing I have seen all year, featuring one of the best endings of the year. Overall, Sicario is another great thriller from Denis Villeneuve, despite it's slow middle section. It ranks as a highlight of 2015. 9.25/10",

This is director Denis Villeneuve's 3rd American/English (Prisoners, Enemy) film since his film and one of my personal favorites of all time 'Incendies' received a Best Foreign Language Film nod back in 2010. He doesn't shy away from showing the gruesomeness that result from real issues (here drug trade/war). His films such as this one are heavy to take in, doesn't make light of human life and its cost. The violence is not stylized but is necessary to the narrative. The screenwriting, directing, and acting draws you in and keeps you on edge throughout.

I don't even remember a single thing about it. Oh wait- there was guns, bombs, bullets, dead bodies all over and on screen you read 'smoking kills', that was cool. (2.5/5)",

    "review": "  Director Denis Velleneuve brings us his latest thriller with the new film Sicario, an extremely well made film that boasts a great story with even greater performances. The last time we saw Vellenueve have a major release was in 2012?s Prisoners which took us to new depths of a kidnapping investigation and here he does it again with a very layered look at the cartels in Mexico. There are a lot of things that make this movie work but here there is a tag team of greatness between the writer Taylor Sheridan and Denis Vellenueve. Sheridan's writing here is beyond superb as we follow FBI agent Kate Macer who is asked to join a task force that delves deep in Juarez, Mexico as they attempt to take down a major cartel. However not everything is as it seems when a mysterious member of the team, named Alejandro, has an unusual influence over the investigation and Macer dives deeper and deeper into this world. This story has very deep layers of mystery and intrigue that dive into the very foundation of Macer and Alejandro and you just can't help but get caught up in how complex and meaningful these character's actions are and the dialogue actually serves a purpose rather than just having characters spout of lines of random dialogue. Vellenueve's direction of this film takes center stage and takes this fantastic script and shows us how violent these cartels are as well as how intimate these characters can be when dealing with these horrific realities. There is a sense of suspense that never falters and makes the more intense scenes more exciting as well as powerful. His eye for the sense of setting here is even more impressive with each scene being filled with the perfect amount of atmosphere that really makes us feel as if we are in Juarez while these events are taking place. The cast here is absolutely phenomenal with Emily Blunt as Kate Macer. Her delivery in this movie is nothing short of masterful and as the film progresses we get invested in her and we truly learn to understand her. We also get to see Josh Brolin deliver as the team coordinator and Victor Garber does great as Macer's boss at the FBI. However the real standout here is Benicio Del Toro as Alejandro. Del Toro gives one of his best performances to date here as his screen presence just makes scenes both suspenseful and exciting. His portrayal as Alejandro is so complex and deep that we hang on to every action he makes as well as every word he utters. Simply, Del Toro steals the show. While all these things are beyond great there is an issue that holds back the film and that is in the pacing. Some of these scenes really drag at times and the plot becomes a bit convoluted at times/ There are some points that could have been shorter or cut all together, but as it is Sicario is still a phenomenal film. This movie tells a truly deep story that is filled to the brim with realism as well as great character moments where we identify with nearly everyone in this film. Sheridan's script is amazing and Vellenueve's eye for filmmaking is second to none with this movie. I highly recommend this film, there are some pacing issues but they are made up for with the great cast and great characters. Sicario is simply a movie you have to see.",

    "review": "  In Hollywood's Mexican drug war answer to the Steven Spielberg war epic Munich, the chance to castigate evildoers responsible for unspeakable atrocities yields for its idealistic main character an opaque path paved with deception, chaos and disregard for protocol. Emily Blunt is devastatingly magnificent as incorruptible, perhaps quixotic FBI agent Kate Macy. Not even a best actress Oscar nod would do her tortured performance justice. Take your opinion of her previous best work and multiply that by a million. Blunt scores with vulnerability in a harrowing, soul-crushing and impossible situation. However, even the esteemed actress cannot outshine a riveting, distressing turn by Benicio Del Toro. The truth of his character unravels inch by inch until the climax when he is terrifyingly naked with nothing else to lose. If he does not at least garner a best supporting actor nomination, you should boycott the Academy Awards. Josh Brolin also merits a mention for some superb acting. The gore is grotesque and the depiction of extremist cartel violence vomit inducing. If you want a feel good fall story, stay the bleep away from this film, which packs gut punch after gut punch with no apologies. Sicario leaves a haunting aftertaste that may linger forever.",

    "review": "  Killing audiences like its Spanish namesake, tightly coiled thriller Sicario might be topical by proxy but boasts a white hot Who-Done-What at its red hot center. If Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock made a Mexican terrorism actioner, it would look a lot like this. Call it Crosstown Traffic, Steven Soderbergh's already timely drug drama made even timelier by an escalating narcotics war down south and framed with direction that's every bit as knowing and edgy. Though the set pieces stop your heart, your mind can't help but keep going at a feverish pace, always on the lookout for the next double cross or stray bullet. It constricts you from the get-go for a long con but Sicario's serpentine scheme never disappoints. In this R-rated thriller from director, an idealistic FBI agent (Blunt) gets enlisted by an elected government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs along the U.S. and Mexico borders. Through the eyes of the sometimes naive but rarely helpless agent Kate (an ace and award-worthy performance by Emily Blunt), Taylor Sheridan's script pits filmgoers in the midst of a deadly war that oftentimes seems pointless but the drive of the characters keeps you fully bullet-proof vested. Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro likewise give powerhouse performances, though the latter is inarguably the showier of the two. Denis Villenueve's taut atmospheric direction takes center stage, however. The Prisoners' helmer makes a Hitchcockian thriller without a Hitch. It's his own baby, killer turns and all. Bottom line: Wonder Drug",

There is no clear resolution (which develops the meaning, but not the story), and many motives are unclear.This isn't the movie to watch with your friends, and it's not the most entertaining of movies.

    "review": "  I understand the praise this film has received up to a point. It's a very well-made and well-acted film, stylish and suspenseful and timely in a way that would suggest the possibility of valid insights into the dealings of the cartels in Mexico - the fact that it fails to deliver on that final point is the issue here.I don't have a problem with the construction of this film at all; the substance is what's objectionable, a fundamentally misguided defense of unethical, illegal, and hyper-masculine actions in dealing with the cartels while simultaneously ignoring the larger context that would nullify this defense entirely. American domestic policy regarding the prohibition of drugs contributes significantly to the prevalence and pervasiveness of these cartels, creating an illegal system that allows these drug networks to thrive. The fact that the film condescends to those who it would perceive as being \"weak\" for not wanting to engage in the actions it portrays as necessary evils is baffling and supremely ignorant.America is not the hero this film makes it out to be, one willing to get down and dirty in order to solve problems that idealists like Blunt's character can't handle (the fact that they've provided the moralistic, \"weak\" role the the film's only woman is a disappointingly sexist misstep); we are actively contributing to the problems that plague Mexican citizens, and people like Brolin's despicable character are not \"strong\" realists for engaging in their morally dubious actions while ignoring the larger picture. This fundamental problem seriously hinders what could've been an excellent political thriller, and its portrayal of torture as well as an indefensible rape joke thrown in among this misguided narrative only contributes to the bad aftertaste it all leaves in your mouth.Villeneuve seems to have a serious conservative streak in him (Prisoners had similar issues with attempting to justify illegal, despicable violence by simply pointing to the existence of evil), and its holding him back from creating something truly great. His technical prowess is undeniable; if only his ideology wasn't so retrograde.",

    "review": "  Emily Blunt packed a huge punch, and Del Toro was amazing, with great support from Brolin. The character matchup was great, from naive America(Blunt), to a great pairing of American sleezy government(Brolin) and corrupt south of the border hit man(Del Toro). The characterization alone said a lot about the story, without saying anything at all. The sound and score was the next most amazing part of this film. It hit you at weird moments, and only seemed to augment the craziness of the situation, or morbid sensation you already had from the visual the director presented to you. Overall though, I am going to have to go back, and watch it again. I was hoping for something a bit more fresh to it(with its 93% rating... and I'd expected a bit of the \"weird\" from Villeneuve) and didn't have that feeling while I watched it. For some reason, the cause and effect conflict wasn't enough for me. It seemed as though we just floated along, unsure what was going on, just like Blunts character(but again, I will definitely give this film another watch).But for everything said; -acting was superb(A+)-cinematography(B+)-production design(A)-story(B)",

    "review": "  Sicario is a grim tale of crime and murder that pulls no punches in the violence department and is bar none the most beautiful, dark-themed movie I've ever seen courtesy of the brilliant cinematographer, Roger Deakins. The acting is incredible with stellar work from Josh Brolin and powerful performances from Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro; the latter completely stealing the movie with his uncertain alliances and solemn demeanor. The film is helmed by mastermind director, Denis Villeneuve who gets right to the grit in the opening scene and sets the tone early that this is going to be a bumpy ride and it's beyond impressive. However, after the spellbinding first act that was non-stop tension, I found the story slowed way down and took a little bit too long to pick up again as what was happening in between wasn't all that interesting. I also take issue with the eventual reveal about Blunt's character who you realize didn't matter at all in the grand scheme of the plot and she's actually absent for most of the climax; which annoyed me as she was being built-up so well to be an amazing character. The climax is insanely well-done though beginning with a Zero Dark Thirty-esque night-vision raid that keeps escalating until Del Toro's character, Alejandro takes matters into his own hands and does what it takes to bring down the villains. I'm a bit mixed on the impact of the film because I believe the story wasn't all that remarkable, but it's undeniable that I was riveted through most of it, Roger Deakins can make the ugliest of scenes gorgeous, and the performances, especially from Del Toro, will keep you engaged until it's final moment.",

    "review": "  Sicario: 9.5/10This is the best movie to come out of Hollywood in 2015. It's my favourite movie to come out of Hollywood this year, at least.It's the story of an idealistic FBI Agent Kate Macer (the gorgeous and brilliant Emily Blunt) getting sucked into a dangerous, drug cartel-busting assignment with Matt Graver (Josh Brolin, in what could be one of his career's finest performances) and the ice-cold man-with-a-death-stare Alejandro Gillick (the ever efficient Benicio Del Toro). And it begins on an ominous note, with the message: \"Sicario is a word for zealots in ancient Jerusalem, who hunted down and killed Roman invaders. In Mexico, Sicario means hitman.\"Giving away any more of the story is a disservice, because Sicario is a film that must be experienced. This is one of those non-sci-fi non-gimmicky films that ACTUALLY deserves to be screened in an IMAX theatre, so you can lose yourself in Roger Deakins' jaw-dropping, trance-inducing cinematography. That, coupled with the chilling, yet calming score of Johann Johannsson, makes this one of the finest cinematographer-music director collaborations, to help with Denis Villeneuve's brilliant direction.It isn't flawless though. Sicario comes with a not-so-tight script that takes away from the experience. Denis Villeneuve is the man who's given us Incendies, Enemy, Prisoners, Polytechnique and the like. Compared to those, this feels like he's played a little safe with the script. The screenplay slows down in the middle, especially to the point of the intermission. But his direction still makes this an edge-of-the-seat experience. It makes all the slowness feel like a live, ticking bomb.I also had a problem with Emily Blunt's character, Kate Macer. Throughout the movie I was expecting her to do things differently, and most of the times I was left disappointed. I wondered, 'why isn't she as strong as she can be? Why is Emily Blunt playing such a weak character?' But then, with wisdom from my friend Achyuth Sankar, I realised that Kate Macer is actually a reflection of the human race - given the same circumstances, we would react exactly the same way. And that is what pissed me off more than anything else - that in life, when you're powerless, you truly ARE powerless and there's nothing you can do.Talking about the human race, there is someone who's not-so-human in our midst. How does Benicio Del Toro do it? How does this man straddle between English and Spanish with so much ease? How does he manage to be so ice-cold, almost Anton Chigurh-like, and yet make you root for him in a weird way? He has all the best lines in the film, especially these:\"Nothing will make sense to your American ears, and you will doubt everything that we do, but in the end you will understand.\"\"Finding this man is like finding a vaccine.\"Moving on to the third important cog in this wheel, Josh Brolin. Right from turning up in the meeting room in flip flops to his wisecracks and quips at Emily Blunt, Brolin has had a ball of a time, and this might be one of his best performances.Hey, you know what HBO? Cast Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro in a season of True Detective. Set it in the heart of Mexico, preferably Juarez. And get Cary Fukunaga to direct, with Roger Deakins as the cinematographer. OH YEAH.All I'd like to say in the end is, well done Denis Villeneuve, Roger Deakins, Johann Johannsson, Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin.Go and watch Sicario people. You should not miss this one in the theatres.",

Though treading fairly familiar narrative ground, Villeneuve knows how to stage a suspense sequence as well as anyone, with two scenes in particular here ranking as among the tensest I've seen all year. Throw in a trio of great lead performances from Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and Benicio Del Toro, a pulsating score from J�hann J�hannsson, and cinematography from the ever-reliable Roger Deakins, and you've got a film that more than warrants two hours of your time.",

It then moves along into darker country as it shows the other end of the law enforcement practiced by those with little morals to get the job done. Emily Blunt's character (Kate Macer) spends most of the movie looking appalled at the lengths Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) go to take down the Cartel and anyone involved with them. There is a point when Blunt's character asks 'What is our mission?' To which Brolin replies 'To dramatically over react'. Which gives you a idea where this is going to lead. The end builds up to a predictably conclusion of whether Alejandro (Del Toro) will get revenge on the Cartel's leader.",

    "review": "  In the film's opening, a title card explains \"In Mexico, Sicario means hit-man\", immediately setting a tense tone throughout the film. French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Enemy), working from a dark and dangerous script by Taylor Sheridan, steps into the haunting world of America's war on drugs. The subject matter and this story in particular could have easily turned into a generic, fast-paced and dumbed down Hollywood production, but Villeneuve's execution makes the film stand tall as an exhilarating crime thriller. The film is set on either side of the U.S. - Mexico border, but in this narrative, the border is more conceptual than anything. It is a place of anxiety, violence and moral compass.Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is an FBI agent assigned to tracking down kidnapping victims of Mexican drug cartels in the American Southwest. Early on, it is suggested that she volunteer - she can't be officially assigned- for an interagency joint task force. She joins in hopes of making a bigger difference and quickly finds out nothing is as she was told it would be. Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) is a government agent of shadowy provenance, officially an \"advisor,\" yet as a playful provocateur he seems to have vast resources at his disposal and free rein in the field. Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) is introduced first by Graver as a \"bird dog\" but reveals himself to be much more than that. Moving freely back and forth between the U.S. and Mexico, the trio are trying to disrupt the flow of money and drugs in hopes of causing higher-ups in the Mexican cartel to make a mistake and reveal themselves.Villeneuve, who stepped into similar moralities in Prisoners, maintains a masterful balance between the brutal and violent world of the story and deeper ethical ambiguity. The film is shot once again by the legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins (who worked with Villeneuve on Prisoners), and it is absolutely wonderful. The shots are steady and wide with beautiful colour pallets. It gives the film a fantastic sense of the world we are witnessing on the screen, the vicious and cruel world where morality seems to be lost forever. A haunting score by Johann Johannsson heightens the film's ominous mood and gives it a personality. This is the work of someone who has an opinion on this subject, and truly believes in his film which recalls Michael Mann's Heat and Steven Soderberg's Traffic. The pacing is slow and steady but the tension is endless with a smart script that manages to be simple enough to follow and plenty of surprises along the way. The film portrays the so-called war on drugs not as a battle to be won but as an existential minefield, something that changes people with the best of intentions and turns them into monsters. This is both a nail-biting action thriller and a social commentary on a world in which right or wrong have become essentially irrelevant.The acting is superb across the board with Emily Blunt showcasing one of her best performances to-date. Her character is reactive and underwritten in some aspects, but her performance makes up for this problem. Her character is both emotionally affecting and athletically adept, ultimately becoming the movie's heart and soul in a story where having a moral conscious seems irrelevant. She manages to create some of the film's highlights including the nail-biting opening sequence and a slam-bang action highpoint in her apartment. Benicio Del Toro is also fantastic as the mysterious Alejandro, who guides the team in their operations. His character is cold and brutal, making some of the tense moments even more watchable. Their chemistry is where this story truly shines because morally, they are polar opposites but they are circumstantially linked to the same world of crime and violence. Among the many things discussed in Sicario is the cyclical nature of violence and how feelings of hope and logic factor into its endless turmoil for better or worse. Alejandro is light years away from the idealism that Kate exhibits and how they try to unravel one another is an absolute joy to watch.Sicario manages to do pretty much everything it sets up and rarely misses a step. This is a slow but tense thriller full of intriguing characters and scenes that would be remembered for a long time. The top-notch acting, a mesmerizing score and camera work that is surely among the year's very best, all make this a must-see for film lovers. The subject matter is also timely and relevant as an increasing number of Americans have come to realize that the war on drugs has corrupted everyone involved. The film's bleak and nihilistic ending offers no hope that it can ever be won, or that the corruption won't continue to win over. When Kate argues that the strike team's actions are legally out of bounds, a superior sets her straight: \"The boundaries have been moved,\" he says. And will clearly continue to be.",

    "review": "  Cops and cartels, midnight raids and public shootouts, blood vendettas and hidden agendas, and a whole lot of dead bodies literally walled up in a house of horrors. If you told me all of this sounds like it belongs in a trashy detective novel, I'd probably agree. If told me it all sounds like it belongs in a trashy movie I'd say, \"Hold the phone! Who says the movie has to be trashy?\"And of course, it isn't. French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve insinuates and executes all of these familiar genre tropes with hitman-like precision in Sicario, delivering one of the most cringe-inducing, butt-clenching, downright excruciating films of the year... And I mean every one of those in the best possible way.Working from a twisty screenplay by actor-turned-writer Taylor Sheridan (Sons of Anarchy), Villeneuve has crafted an excellent thriller that's every bit as refined (if not more so) as the glossy biopics and period pieces that angle for adult dollars at the multiplex every fall. Along with 2012's Prisoners and last year's Enemy, Sicario further embosses his reputation as a filmmaker capable of elevating even the pulpiest story material with his surgical attention to form and construct.Emily Blunt headlines as Kate Macer, a straight-laced federal agent caught in a crooked system. Frustrated that her Sisyphean campaign against the drug trade is going nowhere, she eagerly volunteers for a special task force designated to take the fight to the cartels.Now under the direction of an unnervingly casual Dept. of Defense adviser (Josh Brolin) and his mysterious partner (Benicio Del Toro, quietly intense as ever), Kate can only hold on for dear life as she's thrust onto a whole new battlefield in the war on drugs; One made up of gargantuan, writhing border towns and dark, winding tunnels, where her enemies are hiding in plain sight.An apt casting call for this highly physical role, Blunt exudes just as strong an action-movie presence as her Full Metal Bitch from Edge of Tomorrow. It's an unfortunate shortcoming that she's written less as an active participant in the story than as an audience surrogate, mostly watching it unfold while dodging bullets.We are meant to be as nervous and appalled as she is by the unethical back channels and by the blind eyes of her superiors. \"You are acting within bounds,\" insists her FBI boss (Victor Garber). \"The boundary has been moved.\" But as Sicario spirals towards its bloody climax, it seems more and more that the boundary has been completely erased, leaving us to contemplate who are more monstrous; The traffickers or the feds?Villeneuve is a master of mood, with a penchant for suspense that rivals Hitchcock. His timing of the film's first jump scare instills the viewer with an enduring dread of what sudden horror will startle us next; A dread which allows him to stretch the tension tighter than a drum for prolonged (practically agonizing) periods of time.Master cinematographer Roger Deakins (probably en route to Oscar nomination #13) composes every frame with grace and grit. His camera shifts elegantly between POV to objective angles, sometimes within the same shot. When coupled with the atmosphere of Tim Ozanich's sound design - which superbly integrates J�hann J�hannsson's stealthily scary music - these images put the viewer square in the danger zone with the embattled narcs. You don't merely feel that they are unsafe. You feel unsafe.It's more than enough to keep us perpetually rapt, even when the script goes sadistically dark. It's true that the morbidities of Sicario may well cross the line for what general audiences would consider \"prestige drama\", but a director of Villeneuve's caliber proves that great storytelling knows no genre. The boundary has been moved.***1/2 out of ****",

    "review": "  The thriller film Sicario, by Dennis Villenueve, had me at the edge of my seat in the opening act. Emily Blunt, who is a lead FBI agent, of the kid-nap response team in Arizona, has discovered an unusual case of kid-naps. Emily is not entirely sure what is going on after a gross, but sickening discovery of dead bodies found in the walls of an Arizona home. With confusion and anger, after a bomb explosion that lead to two agents dead, left Emily anxious for answers on who was responsible for so many murders. Josh Brolin, a drug enforcement chief recruits Emily for her outstanding experience in the field. She is misled and confused on what her actual position is with the narcotics team. She elaborates that she is a specialty in the field of abduction. But, with her shaky vibe of the recent discovery of over 20 dead bodies; she is determined to catch those responsible of those who caused the explosion and the death of two fellow co-workers. She meets with Benicio Del Toro, on a private jet provided by the agency, just some of the perks for working with the big guys. But, Benicio remains mysterious throughout the film. She is misled by thinking she is working on a case in El Paso, Texas. When on the jet, she is somewhat informed that she is actually going to work on a case in Juarez, Mexico. Emily is still confused on the purpose of her position on the case. Josh Brolin, reveals the necessity of Emily working with the drug enforcement team up until the near end of the film. Brolin and Del Toro are two sneaky individuals that show no remorse on their actual intensions. Brolin and Del Toro are two individuals that play the game their way. Jurisdiction is not a word in their vocabulary. The title of the film Sicario, means hitman in Mexico. It was difficult to make some connection with the title of the film, throughout the movie, up until the end of the film. Sicario had me wondering before the ending, on why the film was named Sicario. I love the structure of the film and the way it had me wondering throughout the film. Towards the end it was still unclear on what was behind Brolin's motive. Del Toro was later revealed as a character that explained the title of the film. Brolin was still a mysterious shot caller that never actually revealed himself and the reason for why he was willing to work with Del Toro. It would be nice if there was some clarity on who Brolin really is. I can say, the story line was clear and interesting. Emily's performance was utterly compelling; she played a victim in some sense, but was a scared agent overall. There is no error in the story line, but this film had a trailer focused on action. Sicario, was a film more on the suspenseful side with little action to relate to its trailer.",

    "review": "  Sicario is a Spanish term for hitman. This was introduced to the audience at the beginning of the movie. The movie focuses on Kate, an FBI agent who volunteered herself to capture the people in charge of operating drug cartels in Mexico. As they arrived in El Juarez, Mexico, the agents faced reality of how drug traffickers took over the land. Dead bodies were hung by rope over a bridge and gangsters drove through the streets to patrol the area. The agents knew that they needed to act quickly in order to clean up the mess.  \"Sicario\" was a suspenseful movie where the director, Denis Villeneuve, did a wonderful job on tackling the relationship between the movie and reality. Portrayed by actress Emily Blunt, Kate joined a mission without knowledge of what was going on around her. She came from a background where she learned to be on top of every mission and knew exactly what happened in her surroundings. However, Kate struggled to follow the assignments given to her because she was not aware of the specifications of her duty and new endeavors to overcome. Higher authorities were often bribed to run deliveries, protect dealers, and hint information to cartel members. Denis Villeneuve attempted to portray accurate the views on state police members. When a dealer went through the tunnel and needed a ride, a state policeman was usually the one that gave him a ride. The corrupted officials often gave cartel members information on what was going on around the states. If any whistleblowers were to be caught, the cartel members would send people after their family.  This movie brought out the best in all the actors and actresses. From an audience member's point of view, each cast member acted out their roles perfectly. Cast members were able to depict their characters' lives, allowing the audience to truly understand the lifestyle in the movie. In addition, the cinematography captured every aspect of El Juarez to the smallest details. I did have a critique about the movie. If there were to be a change in the movie, I would suggest to add or remove the bar scene. Kate and her friend, Reggie, ran into one of Reggie's ex-coworker at the bar, who happens to be a state policeman. Kate decided to casually date him. Unfortunately, he ended up working for the cartel in which he tried to kill her when she found out. What I did not like about this scene was how it was a coincident for both Kate and the officer to hook up, as he ended up being a corrupted officer. Realistically, a good friend would not intentionally introduce someone to an individual that would cause harm. If Reggie were to invite him out on a separate occasion, this would have been a better scene than just running into each other at a specific bar. Overall, \"Sicario\" was wonderfully directed; I was captivated throughout the whole movie. It was full of suspense and never had a dull moment. Denis Villeneuve invoked emotion with each scene and connected it with real life situations. This movie was an eye opener to the audience because most people never understood how corrupted the state officials can be. Working within a cartel will never end well; members will either shoot or get shot at. With a movie this realistic, people will now understand the war against drug cartels.",

Ohne zu spoilern kann ich sagen das Sicario eigentlich 2 Filme sind, welche durch ein wenig unpassendes Balancing der Storys verwirrend wirken kann, weil der Zuschauer sich fragt in welche Richtung der Film gehen m�chte...

    "review": "  \"Don't ever point a gun at me again\".'Sicario' is a master-class in ramping up the tension. It's right up there with the best of them. Tense, twitchy scenes fit perfectly into the drug war story. Where something like 'Sabotage' failed (quite badly) 'Sicario' does it with ease. All film makers going for a similar plot with teh cartel, drugs DEA whatever link there is should look at this. Building the tension up, slowly twisting the screw and never really letting up completely - even when it comes to teh conclusion it still has you.As many adverts have stated 'Sicario' means hitman in Mexico. Meaning the real central character is 'Alejandro' (Benicio Del Toro) but it's lead through the eyes of 'Kate' (Emily Blunt). Displaying her skills in the opening segment (which already starts to raise things) she tackles what is meant to be a kidnap operation only to discover more and be inducted into a special operation to take out the head of the Mexican cartel - headed by 'Matt' (Josh Brolin). By the end it's hard to judge what is the right thing to do and who is doing it. It's intentionally murky with its perception of good - there's revenge, pride and manipulation at every turn.It's clich�d but the audience and 'Kate' know as much as each other. Her reaction to things synced pretty well with me, she may be part of the FBI but this is new territory for her. It's never clear what they're doing until it's already done. There's as much mystery about 'Matt' and his team as there is 'Alejandro' and his objectives. This could be tiresome and uninteresting but the intrigue and rising tension kept me glued to the film.There's also what has to be the best use of night vision iv'e ever scene and one of if not the most tense thing Iv'e ever seen on screen. Watch out for that because it blows 'Zero Dark Thirty' out of the water. Despite all the sides involved, drug empires and secret government ops there isn't all that much action and it's all teh better for it. If you're expecting something with explosive set pieces you won't get them here. It's rather, littered with more intricate constructed moments.Upping his game from 'Prisoners' 'Denis Villeneuve' has mastered his art. Where teh previous had some problems 'Sicario' never ever lets up the feeling of un-ease. Managing thanks to some clever camera work keep at a level even when there's nothing happening. 'Emily Blunt', 'Benicio Del Toro' and 'Josh Brolin' are all in excellent form here. Intense, startling and unflinchingly committed to being fair on all fronts, 'Sicario' is that rare thriller - very smart and very very good.",

Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin give terrific performances with Blunt's character being the rookie by the book officer who's in way over her head and Blunt gives us something great to watch. The same can be said for Brolin's hard edged but very laid back character, he too clocks in a wonderful performance. But perhaps the best is Benicio Del Toro who is absolutely incredible, stealing the scene everytime he appears, his character is quiet but harbours something dark and he only reveals his true self until the end in what is one of the most intense shootout in film. The music is loud and brazen and it conveys horror whenever played, it never feels out of place and it fits the subject matter perfectly. And Roger Deakin's cinematography is outstanding, when it's dark it's dark, you can't see the character's faces and even that gives it such a realistic and gritty feel, it's Oscar worthy. Dennis Villeneuve has given us a perfect film, a film that doesn't glamourise or make the war on drugs seem cool, instead, he's offered us the most realistic take on it since Traffic. Everything is Oscar worthy and it's sure to be the most nominated movie this year. Sicario is just mesmerising, I love this film and I can't wait to watch it again.",

    "review": "  I believe this is one of the first movies I have seen where the trailers lead you to believe 'action' movie, but instead, Sicario stands out as one of the best ghost stories of the year.The mood. The setting. The characters. The score. The cinematography. The direction. The dialogue. Everything about it comes together as more of a horror story than any action movie ever could. In fact, everything is so tightly wound in every scene, sitting through this for two hours felt like walking through a haunted house.The entire premise for director Denis Villeneuve, who directed Prison Break and Enemy...both excellent, is to place the audience in the shoes of Emily Blunt's Kate. Just like her, you as a viewer are completely unaware of what is going on. Who do you trust? Who's the bad guy? It's not only until the final stretch do you really get an idea, not even the whole truth, of what her purpose for being there is. It's her most stoic performance yet and thrown up with the best of hers like Edge of Tomorrow.Benicio Del Toro may steal the show, however. His brooding silence. His efficiency at his job. His delivery of both dialogue and mannerisms. He is the ghost you fear. The way he and Josh Brolin play off each other leads you to believe its a symbiotic relationship, but quite frankly, there is a point in the film where even Brolin's character says to follow Del Toro's lead without question. I mean...the movie's title is really about Del Toro's character anyway. Sicario = hitman. I've seen Brolin do some good acting before, but here he hammed up the stereotype of government lackey a bit too much with his snarky and loose attitude.As far as direction goes, the car chase through Juarez must go down as one of the best sequences of the year. What a brilliant idea to keep not only the pacing of the film consistent, but a chance to get a good drive by of what makes these cartel wars so violent. There's no lingering for too long for fear you might not make it out alive.Sicario stayed small in its scope by limiting everything to Arizona and the border around Juarez and El Paso. It was a great look at how things are handled (though to a certain elevated extent most likely) without having to see Washington DC or the higher powers. Del Toro and Blunt give masterful performances in one of the best ghost stories of the year.",

    "review": "  Sicario is an OK gritty crime drama centered around the Mexican Drug War. The cinematography and editing are good, the score is tense and the actors do well. However, I was disappointed with how irrelevant Kate Macy (Emily Blunt), our heroine, turned out to be. I understand her role was to be the bewildered moral compass of the movie but ultimately, the point of the movie is morally ambiguous, and the mysterious Alejandro (Del Toro) proves to be a vastly more interesting character. Alejandro has a harrowing back story thus rendering Kate to be a bystander in the grand scheme of things; a pawn in the war almost. What the film does well is hold you captive in suspense and keep you haunted with some disturbing imagery. Overall, I'd say it's a less well-done Traffic, only Traffic had a sprawling scope while this movie's focus is kinda narrow. The action scenes were good though.",

    "review": "  Sicario comes at a time filled with promising cinematic features and yet manages to keep its head well above water and then waver to the top as one of the definitive films of a rather uneventful year in film so far. To say the least, enough happens in the film's first tightly acted, edited, and directed 30 minutes to propel the intrigue of its premise and adrenaline of its execution throughout the film despite some uneven pacing. When Sicario succeeds, it succeeds at such a level that some of the shallow narrative flaws and minor issues can be pushed to the side. You can feel the intensity, emotion, and dedication emanating from each scene because it's very easy to tell that this is exactly the project that director Denis Villeneuve has been building towards. It is a story rooted deep within his own interests and heritage and a story of which he surely felt needed to be told, and he mostly succeeds in emulating his personal sense of urgency and importance unto the audience. The most fascinating part of Sicario is that it isn't too heavy-handed in its approach. It manages to entertain in balanced doses while still finding a way to pass along some vital social commentary that manages to sit uncomfortably with even those of which aren't personally familiar with the events and settings being depicted. I did take issue with certain aspects of the narrative, however, that I felt to be extraneous and perhaps even unnecessary, and to me these parts really got in the way of the otherwise smooth direction of the film. I can't mention these narrative aspects specifically, but it should be clear as a good deal of time is given for these detracting subplot elements to unfold in a way that really interfered with my ability to stay focused on the central plot. And to that end, Sicario doesn't really tell all that profound or unique of a story to begin with, but given the precise, calculated plotting, confident and bare-knuckle direction, and (of course) Roger Deakins' flawlessly detailed and complex cinematic abilities, it's easy to overlook this fact. The impeccable performances all around are worth mentioning just as well with a truly defining performance given by Benicio Del Toro who basically gave me the chills through his sheer confidence and obvious passion for the role. Overall, Sicario marks itself as a notable entryway into the award season for films this year given its highly admirable round of qualities. It isn't groundbreaking or really even that original but it is told in a way that certainly pins itself as one of the better movies of the year and, for many reasons, stands out as a rather memorable film. Much more than your average entertainment fare.",

This film is an uncompromising look, generally through the eyes of an idealistic FBI agent played brilliantly by Emily Blunt, at the war on drug lords in and around Mexico and the border with the US. Blunt and Del Toro are incredible, the story is tense throughout with more than one memorable scene to think back on. Beautifully shot by Villeneuve, Sicario is a movie that makes you ask yourself how far is too far, and even if you cross that line, will it matter.",

    "review": "  With the plethora of popular fiction devoted to the doomed drug war, it's slightly hard to get excited about a movie retreading the same ground as Traffic or similar films in this genre. But Sicario is, for a lack of a better way to express this, pretty fucking great. The plot centers on a female FBI agent specializing in special tactical breach and clear missions who finds herself recruited by a shadowy team of DEA agents planning to go on the offensive against Mexican drug cartels across the border in Juarez. Emily Blunt subtly and emotionally plays this protagonist as she finds herself in over her head and struggling to maintain her moral compass amid the carnage. Josh Brolin plays a slimy CIA agent so easily that perhaps we should worry about what he does with his time when he's not acting. But it is Benicio Del Toro who steals the show. His icy, murderous double assassin acts as a sword of vengeance and a warning about those who fight monsters. Notably there is a dichotomy between the FBI characters who attempt to operate in civilian legal procedure with arrests, investigations, and public transparency, and the DEA/CIA team who are heavily militarized, use direct force, torture liberally, manipulate the criminal underworld, and engage in Special Forces style assaults.Sicario is a notably beautiful looking film for being so riddled full of grotesque violence and it demands the viewer's attention. While others may find comparisons to Traffic, I personally feel it has more in common with Zero Dark Thirty, in terms of the strong female protagonist, the direction and cinematography, and final night vision fueled spec ops raids. Of course, where Zero Dark had an uplifting, bittersweet ending, Sicario makes a salient point about the failure and futility of the drug war. It's about as on the nose as you can get, but it doesn't prove to be a fatal artistic flaw. The cold, violent nature of this piece may deter some viewers, but the rest are in for a hellish but rewarding and entertaining journey into the heart of darkness.",

    "review": "  FBI & CIA 1 W&C 0 Two US govt agencies work as a clandestine drug busting team. Their catchment area is the Mexican border. Aerial photography- possibly from a drone - enhances a bleak script in which Emily Blunt seems to be the only woman with words. She is used as bait to haul in a drug cowboy by colleagues high up in the team. We witness highly unorthodox \"treatments\" against the cowboy to make him talk.  Confrontations and twists occur . In different settings EB and a dead cop's wife are left holding the remnants of life together: a child totally unaware his father was a part of the problem and a police woman who'd been violated by a superior officer to catch a \"sizeable\" slice of the trade. EMILY Blunt is cast well as the principled young cop. She spends so long \"fitting in\" with the male induction story. Her role is stereotype to the modern feminist role we ought to be seeing. She cannot fit in with the time servers of old America. They can't even get the seating right.  Men fight with guns and ammo and the latest technology to plan their getaways. Mr Big stays in his private abode. The price we pay for the drugs is a fatherless family, low horizons and brutalised women at every corner.",

From a average movie-goer's perspective, I can see how it can be a little boring at some parts. There were times where the movie really slowed down but at other times it was extremely intense. The whole raid into Mexico sequence with all the Jeeps is truly chilling and crazy to watch. Emily Blunt does a good job as the protagonist we relate to but the most interesting character was Benicio Del Toro's character Alejandro. He was the most exciting character to watch and he was the one who actually had an objective and took action to pursue it while Emily Blunt was just along for the ride. It works well though and didn't bother me that much. You'll be thinking of this movie long after you leave the theatre so I would highly recommend it. But this film isn't for the faint of heart.

This film calls upon a delicate balance between mainstream and art- house cinema, and is sure to hit a sweet spot with fans of either style. Benecio Del Toro knocks it out of the park with a dark performance that is striking in it's understated power. Emily Blunt proves solid as our lead character, who manages to give a fine performance despite having a slightly underdeveloped character. Josh Brolin proves himself great as always too, giving a charismatically unsettling performance. The cinematography in this film is gorgeous with Roger Deakins doing an (as per usual) fantastic job, particularly with his use of lighting in the nighttime scenes of the film. The soundtrack, by composer J�hann J�hannsson works well as the glue holding the film together, with perhaps his most haunting soundtrack to date. It cannot be understated, the soundtrack for this film is superb.This is a dark film, with an incredibly consistent tone which successfully evokes unease; haunting in it's elusiveness.

The scope, the cinematography, the production design, the score, and especially the cast; were massively stunning.Villeneuve was executing Taylor Sheridan's script (he's the actor from Sons of Anarchy and this was his debut script) with such precision. The blocking for every climax (owh yes, there were so many climax in this one) were immaculate. I especially loved the border ambush that involved thousands of cars and extras, and shot beatifully by veteran Roger Deakins. J�hann J�hannsson was giving another soul of this movie with his intense beat. While Joe Walker edited the film seamlessly.Kudos for Emily Blunt for another strong leading role. And most kudos for Benicio del Toro for being one of the most subtle and ambiguous character in recent years. The subtlety and ambiguity which always been a trademark of Villeneuve's works.And that was what made Sicario a strong movie with strong characters. It's a heart-thumping, mind-blowing, and intense cinematic experience with a strong execution full of great performances. Sicario surely one of the best and strongest movie I've watched this year. And for that, a deep bow for Villeneuve.",

    "review": "  Benicio del Toro carries this film with ruthless efficiency. Brolin brings snarky grit. Blunt takes a believable turn as the chain smoking ingenue who has no idea of how things get done on the other side of the Rio Grande. Ciudad Juarez is the real star of the film. It looks just the way I remember it, complete with APVs in the streets, and big black SUV convoys zipping around. A must see.",

    "review": "  \"Sicario\" is the true story of a U.S. Intelligence task force that was put together to investigate and sniff out cartel activity in Mexico. Emily Blunt is an F.B.I. Operative who is pulled into the fray by her cunning supervisor Benicio Tel Toro and his lackey played by Josh Brolin. Blunt quickly learns that this task force isn't what it purports to be. Though this film is violen perhaps unnecessarily so at times, I also applaud it for its realism. Mexico is a hostile country where nihilism abounds and its every man for himself. The movie conveys that ideology and shows that not everything in politics can be a pretty picture. Call it senseless if you will, but this film is ambitious and honest enough to accurately portray the dog eat dog world that the cartel run country is. Nothing is held back. Some may disagree but I see this as honest filmmaking and a rarity in modern cinema ------------------------------------------------- B+",

The Genius here , the one who really knows what's going on is Alejandro , played by Benicio Del Toro. Is he a Hero? Is he an anti-hero? Is he a villain? We decide or maybe we don't decide. That is the greatness of this film. We just know the drug battles made him what he is. The cinematography is breathlessly good. And the scenes in which they ride in a motorcade through the streets of Juarez like it's a warzone is awesome filmmaking because you really feel like you are a part of it. A stupendous film.",

    "review": "  Sicario, the third Denis Villeneuve feature film after the highly successful Prisoners and Enemy from 2013 and 2014 respectively. The movie stars Emily Blunt (Edge of Tomorrow), Josh Brolin (Everest and No Country for Old Men), and Benicio Del Toro (Escobar: Paradise Lost and Traffic) in a drug-fuelled action movie set along the US-Mexico Border. The movie is a cliche storyline with characters that have been seen before. But the way that the characters are played is what makes this movie stand out. It should be noted that the posters may show that the movie might be about Emily Blunt's character Kate, but the crucial performance is the performance by Del Toro in his portrayal of Alejandro. This is a performance that hasn't been seen from Del Toro in quite a while. I would have to say that a Best Actor Nomination should easily be coming towards Del Toro's way. An honorable mention to Josh Brolin, portraying the team leader Matt. His character brought comic relief to a movie that was disturbingly serious. Now the movie itself. The first thing to note is the cinematography. The movie is beautifully shot, which is not a surprise with Director of Photography Roger Deakins (No Country for Old Men and Skyfall) at the helm. The panning birds eye view shots of Ciudad Juarez along with street side shots showed the bleak circumstances that the people in Juarez were living in. The defining message from the film is the bleakness of the War on drugs in the Southern US. It shows how agencies have to \"work together\" just to have a shot at a cartel leader and even getting rid of a single cartel leader just means that another leader has already propped up and ends up being a never ending circle of massacre. It's not the story that contributes to the high mark it will get, it's the characters in the movie who you connect to immediately, with audiences most likely to latch onto Alejandro's story after his background is revealed. Sicario may not get a Best Picture nomination but might have at least 1 nomination for Best Actor. Sicario gets an A grade.",

    "review": "  On Thursday night I went to see the new film Sicario which opened wide this weekend. I've been anticipating this film since I heard about it. Not only did it look great but it has a stellar cast and a pretty great director. The film stars Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, and Josh Brolin. The director, Denis Villeneuve, directed Prisoners back in 2013 which was one of my favorite films of that year and probably of all time. He also directed Enemy which came out last year and although I didn't love it like Prisoners it was still a film worth seeing and very interesting. Roger Deakins, who has worked on films such as Prisoners, Skyfall, and No Country For Old Men, is the Cinematographer for Sicario and it really shows, giving us many breath taking scenes.I really can't say how glad I am that Sicario didn't disappoint. I loved this film. It's my favorite film of 2015 so far. The story was interesting and kept you on the edge of your seat the entire 2 hours. The cinematography was breathtaking. The directing was incredible. The acting was award worthy. The score was chilling. If you haven't seen this movie yet you need to go right away. I know a lot of people are seeing The Martian this weekend and while it might be good, Sicario is fucking great.The three things that stood out the most to me in Sicario was the cinematography, the score, and Benicio Del Toro. The score by J�hann J�hannsson was absolutely amazing and definitely added so much to the film. Emily Blunt clearly plays the lead in this film and she is great but the actor/character that steals the show is Del Toro. His character is interesting and demands your attention while he's on screen. If he doesn't get an academy award nomination this year I'll not only be surprised but incredibly upset. Out of the films I've seen so far I would nominate Blunt for Best Actress as well but that could change as I see more movies during award season. Josh Brolin is also in this film and does great in his role.",

Gang members, dead and alive, smugglers, illegal immigrants, young and old. All in the violent and scary setting where death is never far. Nothing is black and white, it is all various shades of grey (more than 50, I am sure!) where things you thought were wrong are necessary and somehow just right. Emily Blunt has come far from the Devilish assistant and in addition, the film posts talent and eye candy in the form of Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin.To note, this director has done other super films, such as Prisoners and Incendies. Both highly recommended, maybe even more than this one. Especially Incendies has stayed in my mind. Not many films do!",

Sicario depicts the war on drugs in a new light, showcasing the brutality and the victimization of the inhabitants of the land. Corruption spreads like a plague, middle class families live in terror, and there is absolutely no hope for requiem.

There really are no good guys and bad guys - everyone is rotten to the core. From the leaders of the cartels to the buyers on the streets, the drug world is nasty, bloody and merciless. This movie is a good film that shows the inner workings of the ant-drug enforcement world. It shows how the system is littered with corruption, loopholes, dirty money and dead ends. No one wins in this movie. Whether it's the good guys in the FBI trying to do their job or the poor devils caught in the crossfire, everyone ultimately loses.

The soundtrack, cinematography also takes on the surface a basic story and elevates it to HIGH ART!The movie is excellently casted. Emily Blunt is Kate, an idealistic FBI agent in Arizona who is recruited to \"special\" task force lead by Josh Brolin, to get to heart of problem in the war on drugs. Where she meets Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) a shadowy figure who you later finds out is the MOTHER FUCKER of the movie. The producers of the film would have you believe Sacario means \"hitman\" in Mexico. I don't speak Mexican but after seeing it I'm pretty sure it translate into \"mother-fucker\", because Benicio Del Toro steals this movie. The tension is HIGH and pushes the boundaries you don't often see in conventional films. The movie aims to be disturbing and fucked up and succeed in all regards. This movie is Great! Brilliant and possibly one of BEST movies of the year. If I had to think of legitimate reason someone didn't like this movie outside of being a lesser mind, id imagine it be to a \"basic\" story with little redeeming outcome and meaning by the end... Due to fact they can't grasp subtext and social commentary at that isn't spelled out in crayons. In the trailer, Benicio Del Toro says to Emily Blunt \"nothing will make sense to your American ears... But in the end you'll understand.\" What does that even mean?

The film has a Zero Dark Thirty feel to it and although it doesn't really end happily, it's still an interesting story. My grade=88%(B+).",

    "review": "  [10/3/15] Oh, boy. Where do I even begin? \"Sicario\" is a tense thriller that follows Emily Blunt as an FBI agent who volunteers to join, well, umm, we're not really sure and neither is she. Josh Brolin is this chill, laid-back dude who's forming a team with Benicio del Toro's character, but it becomes clear that there's more to both of their characters than what they say. At first, the operation seems simple based on the first 10 minutes: \"okay, so these three are after some cartel in Juarez. Big deal.\" It's not nearly that simple. I'll repeat this again, we don't really know who's working with who and what the legal parameters of their actions are--is Blunt's character working with mercenaries, rogue agents, the DEA, the CIA, a different cartel, and at times, it seems like she's signed up to work alongside all of them. It's not a confusing plot [I'm typing that in case you're thinking, oh, it's one of those 'I'm not following this movie at all' type of films. No, it's just a lot of strings being pulled simultaneously]. \"Sicario\" touches a lot on the current situation in Mexico--since it's set in the border region--with the drug cartels and the violence, I mean, when you watch this you're literally getting a taste, just a taste, of what's going on down there. Every minute/hour/what have you. Of everyday. And at times, just the film's handling of the content is terrifying, terrifying because in the back of my mind I know that the cartel violence in real life is much worse. And for the people down there, that's their reality. Gunshots, torture, drugs, etc--that's some kid's lullaby to get him/her to sleep. To counter the more graphic content, the film gives us a few scenes where a character's relationship with his son is highlighted (because we find out that the father is delivering drugs). What I liked most about those father-son scenes is that it's a subtle way of saying \"not everyone who works with the cartels does so because they're born evil. They're doing that to feed their families,\" doesn't make it right, sure, but it offers some perspective given the father's occupation. It hints at a greater message, I think, and I don't think the father would be involved at all if circumstances were different. If the country wasn't such a disaster. If his salary were better, etc. And I know I'm going off a tangent, the film is well-directed, it's well-acted, there's a few action scenes that put you right in the freakin' middle of all the chaos--it's great--and even if you're not completely impressed by the movie--\"Sicario\" definitely gets you thinking about the film and the Drug War in general. Take the fact that we get this really cool scene, sorry SPOILERS, in thermal vision as Brolin, del Toro, and Blunt's team sneaks into Mexico through a tunnel used by the cartels. Now we know that in real life, there IS cooperation between U.S Intelligence and the Mexican Government. Do events like those that unfold in the film happen [U.S forces going into Mexico to take down the cartels, in a way, committing acts of war] in reality? If it did, they'd probably have the approval of the Mexican government anyways. But what about all of that surveillance and technology that we're using on our side and also sending down the Mexicans, how are we not finding these big cartel leaders more easily? Should we even be getting involved, I mean, we already are, but should we be playing such a big role considering Mexico's infamy with corruption and bribery? Those are just some things I'd like to know. Perhaps the most thought-provoking part about the movie happens right at the end. There's a soccer game, we see the kids playing, the moms are there trying to forget about the environment's insanity...and then the gunshots start from a distance. One might say, \"wait a minute, I want to see what's going on.\" The truth is we already saw what we needed to see. It's a giant question mark and it concerns the youth, which in turn, concerns the future. Right now, there are no answers or realistic solutions, and that's kind of how I'd describe \"Sicario\"--it's a film that makes you ask and ask ...but gives you no answers [per se].",

    "review": "  After Prisoners and Enemy in back to back years, two of the more thought provoking films of the past few years, I have been awaiting Denis Villeneuve's next project. Of course, Emily Blunt is my favorite actress right now, so in my mind the two of them were enough to get Sicario on my most anticipated list for 2015. I can assure you, the film doesn't letdown. Sicario is about an FBI agent, played by Blunt, who is brought along by a government task force to help on the border of Mexico and the U.S. as drug cartels rule the area.One of the most chilling parts about Sicario is its realistic nature. I had a Zero Dark Thirty vibe in that it doesn't hold back in its brutality. They both have a brilliant female lead as well, although much different characters by motive. Blunt is complemented by Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin as the main three agents. Part of the greatness of Sicario is its cast but I think the marketing was a bit misleading. We are led to believe that Blunt is the central focus of the story, but there is almost as much if not more of Del Toro than anyone else here. It's both good and bad. I was looking forward to seeing Blunt as the integral part of the story, but Del Toro was just as good. I think the real star of the film is Roger Deakins, the director of photography. He once again gives an incredibly beautiful looking film through his award winning cinematography. Even though this film may fail to get any acting nominations or any ofthe other big awards, I think it's safe to say that Deakins is a lock for cinematography. It's his panning shots of the border along with J�hann J�hannsson's score that give the film an eerie and ominous feel. It's very difficult to talk about any details without spoiling anything, but I can say that it's a really good movie. I was reading a review that talked about the intensity of a scene before the intensity really begins, if that makes sense. It wasn't the gunshots or explosions that gave me chills. It was the quiet calm scenes before the storm. It's not the mind bender that Enemy was nor the shocker that was Prisoners, but Sicario is one of the most beautifully shot and well acted films this year.+Blunt can do no wrong+Eerie score+Deakins' cinematography+Brutally real+Very very very intense9.0/10",

    "review": "  Sicario was a bit slower than I thought it was going to be. It isn't bad, but man does the first half hour move at a snails pace. The film follows an FBI agent named Kate Macer (Emily Blunt). A by the books agent that is in charge of hostage situations. She is brought into a group led by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) an elite government agent that doesn't always play by the rules. Graver is working with a mysterious man named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) who has a hidden agenda himself. Their task is to take down a drug lord through any means necessary. Macer sees things that haunt her and she questions what exactly is going on and who exactly are the people they are working for. The movie is well done and shot really well. Like i said previously it has a very slow start, but after the cogs get rolling the film has a lot of suspense and is a mystery in itself. Overall, it won't be for everyone, but if you like a slow burner thriller with a slight mystery give this one a look!",

    "review": "  This is a solid thriller that has peaks and valleys of great moments and boring moments. When it wants to be a thriller, it really is thrilling but the quieter scenes just aren't all that captivating. Emily Blunt makes some of the more boring stuff worth while because she just is naturally a great actress to watch (and to the executive that wanted a man in this role, this movie would have been 10 times less engaging if a man was in her role). I also like how Blunt's character wasn't down your throat about \"oh I'm a woman in a man's game\" nor were the people around her undermining her because she was a woman. It was nice and refreshing to see that from a modern movie. Josh Brolin has been really winning be over these past few years as I was kind of meh about him in the past. He does a great job and Benicio Del Toro also has some good moments but he wasn't given as much to do with his character overall. If he had a few more scenes, he may have stolen the show. Jon Bernthal also has a great small part in this. I love the director Denis Villeneuve that made 2013's Prisoners and I think he did a good job directing this especially the climax. Roger Deakens' cinematography is really wonderful during the climax as well. Great sound design as well and some great thrills as I said. It's solid and worth seeing but you don't have to rush out to see it right this minute",

    "review": "  There are a number of reasons to like Sicario. This movie has amazing cinematography. It puts you in the middle of everything that's going on. At the same time, the movie intentionally keeps you in the dark, putting you in the same company as the lead, Emily Blunt. It gets frustrating, but that's part of the movie. Sicario drew a fine line between very good movie and dud, but comes through toward the end to be a very good movie. This is a solid script and is well directed. It's incredibly violent, but not just for violence's sake. Blunt's character seems a bit too whiny in the beginning, but it ends up being necessary for the movie to work.For people who have a solid idea of \"good vs. evil,\" Sicario will seem like nothing more than Hollywood entertainment. The fact that there is a middle ground, or more people are on the \"evil\" side of things that one would think, could cause more people to think about what's going on and may be a catalyst for many a discussion on the reality of America's involvement in the illegal drug trade.Emily Blunt is an entertaining actress, and Josh Brolin is on top of his game as the casual DoD agent. I firmly believe that Benicio Del Toro should be in every movie made, and he reinforces why in Sicario. Sicario is worth spending money on, whether you go to the theater or a rent.",

    "review": "  Denis Villeneuve is perhaps one of the most exciting directors to come into a more public eye; not that Villeneuve is a new director as he's directed several films already, but his growing popularity is getting him better and better jobs. Villeneuve has now taken on the drug trade of all things and has turned what could've been just a have been a great thriller film and has turned it into something more, he has us question the moralities of law enforcement not so much as a good cop vs bad cop but rather as the one who does it the \"right\" way and the one who breaks the rules willingly and regularly in order to get better results. Which is right? Which is better? Sicario isn't so much about answering it but portraying both sides and asking us to question what's right, and then threatens you with reality. Emily Blunt's Kate's crisis of morality and personal belief is brought out by Blunt's fantastic work, it's not the kind of performance that gives you grand scenes to quote, but an embodiment of a person and losing yourself to the role. Benicio Del Toro's almost polar opposite Alejandro shows the other side and is brought on by one of the veteran actor's best performances in years. His calm, cold, tactile demeanor and dead eyes convey more to us than even the most wordy of main characters. These two performances rocket Sicario's questions of morality into frame and never let up even at the end it's not entirely clear, but it's left up for the viewer to decide. It's a film that is so beautifully directed and equally haunting in it's content that it creates a brilliant contrast of beautiful horrors that actually could make Sicario one of the best horror films of this year. So utterly disturbing and yet for everything that we are more aware of and think of, it's almost like the film's just scratching the surface but we ourselves have to see how much is under that scratch itself. The result is one of the absolute best films so far this year, simply unmissable, even if it will make your ethics boil and your stomach churn",

    "review": "  Director Denis Villeneuve is not one to shy away from the darkest aspects of human nature. While far be it from me to call the plot of his films inconsequential, the setting is merely a catalyst to show what humans are capable of when pushed to the brink of their capabilities. He keeps his filmed honed and resolute, with minimal scoring, sparse and economical characterization, and an unhurried narrative. It worked brilliantly for a movie like Prisoners, but for Sicario, the results are underwhelming. And due to the relaxed delivery of the story, it wasn't until the second act that I realized Sicario wasn't going to deliver on the narratives promises. My frustrations are centered on the screenplay. First time writer Taylor Sheridan made a name for himself as David Hale in Sons of Anarchy, a series which lasted 7 seasons and 95 episodes, so he isn't accustomed to concluding a story in just over two hours. And this is where Sicario falters; The script meanders along the narrative, which puts you in a relaxed mindset, but spontaneous bout of ultra-suspense, and a plot with too many webs to follow puts Sicario at odds with itself. It tries to be too many things; a character study, an expose on drug cartels, a nail-biting thriller, an unhurried arthouse film. The best films in history have been able to have multiple personalities, so this is not impossible, but Taylor Sheridan is too green of a screenwriter to pull it off. As a result, Sicario is decent at many things, but superb at nothing. If by some miracle this review reaches Taylor Sheridan, I have a lesson for him; A story doesn't need to tie up all (or even any) of its loose ends as long as it has a point. The moral of your story is the driving principle - the lesson an audience takes away once the credits roll and the dust settles. 'Love conquers all', 'Teens often make bad decisions', 'Don't walk across the wood at night.' That kind of thing. Decide on the moral of your story and use it to drive the action. Be aware of the contract between you and your audience. Everything that happens must happen for a reason, and the more of a big deal you make of an event, the bigger the pay off must be.",

This one offically lands behind Straight Outa Compton and Furious 7 for me, at #3 and I can easily seeing this film just cleaning up at the Oscars come February. Incredible acting. Easily the best cinematography of the year and intense perfectly eerie music. With a awesome twist at the end which isnt all that surprising but still added to the effect of the movie, my heart was beating so fast for the last 15 mins of the movie I could barely take it",

    "review": "  Sicario is Spanish for hitman. In film lingo that makes it sensational viewing, a gripping and action-packed foray into America's War on Drugs. French-Canadan filmmaker Denis Villeneuve (Incendies, Prisoners), working from a dense, heart-shattering script from Taylor Sheridan, is out to fry your nerves. Mission accomplished.The film starts off a little opaque and convoluted but hang on. Just follow along with audience surrogate Kate Macer, played by a killer good Emily Blunt. Macer is an FBI field agent and Blunt gives her a tough core that is unforgettable. If Edge of Tomorrow didn't convince you of Blunt's inherent badass-ness, Sicario should.We first meet Kate in Arizona, raiding a hideout run by a Mexican drug cartel, a house with decomposing corpses stuffed into the walls. Kate is largely unflappable till she's essentially ordered to volunteer for an agency-merging task force that seeks to pit one drug lord against another.Sound confusing? Just sit back and absorb, basically the same advice Kate gets from operations chief Matt Graver (a stellar, smarmy Josh Brolin), a laid-back man of manipulations clad in sandals who claims to be working a defense contract but in all likelihood is CIA. His associate Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-Mexican-prosecutor-turned-assassin who may have a larger personal agenda. You can basically see it in his intense stare. Oscar-winner Del Toro is tremendous here, giving off a toxic mix of smoldering cool and menace that throws even Kate off her game.Sicario is all build-up for a stunning climax set in a world where right and wrong, good and bad, are no longer absolutes. As Kate fights to stand her moral ground as the ground beneath her perpetually shifts, Villeneuve expertly stages on gut-wrenching action scene after another, all set to a mirthful, jittery score by Johan Johannsson. All praise as well to cinematographer Roger Deakins whose aerial shots of a white-knuckle border crossing stands in vivid contrast with a tense tunnel chase. It's a visual knockout. But the real miracles of the film are all written on Blunt's expressive face. It's pure poetry and it's dark. You won't know what hit you.",

The film's pacing was decent, but reasoning as to why i am going to let it slide is because of its leading to the final climaxed scene which was bloody seatgripping. Emily Blunt did a fairly good job at playing the lead role. But as a full experience everything was pretty well done. 9/10",

    "review": "  Should I feel disappointed that Emily Blunt's character only shoots like 1 guy in this film? Here is a loss of naivete tale in war on the Mexican drug cartel. Blunt is our touchstone for perspective. There is the presentation that dark deeds must be done for the sake of our way of life, and those dancers in the dark have their souls hanging in the balance. Blunt does such a fine job as an American that I at times forget her English background. Bencio Del Toro and Josh Brolin do some solid work. The cinematography starts with a bleached out and baked color portraying the heat, and takes us into some stunning beautiful sunset and even night-vision work. My first thoughts were that the story did not seem all that original and director Denis Villeneuve didn't take a position of the soul darkening affects, so why was I being told the story. But the more I stew on the result the more I find it interesting to roll around in my head.",

    "review": "  What are the rules of engagement in fighting the Mexican drug cartels especially if US law enforcement agencies go into foreign territories where they have no jurisdiction; does the end justify any means? Denis Villeneuve's intense new film SICARIO (which means hit man in Spanish) takes us into the tactical underbelly of those cryptic individuals who carry out US policy decisions \"from on high\", cloaked in legitimacy, though they are prohibited maneuvers that would be considered illegal in any court of law.The atmosphere is beautifully filmed - either pale, washed out ochers depicting the long dusty border between US and Mexico, or the rich deep blues and blacks of the evening with night - vision goggles irradiating the world around them into skeletal images. Put a young, female FBI agent into this mix - Emily Blunt as Kate, a dedicated officer, former head of a kidnap-response unit based in Phoenix, who is forced to question all that she has practiced and been taught in the Bureau; her fiercely held personal values are turned upside down by the reality of being recruited into the midst of anti- cartel \"warriors\" who can behave as dark and dirty as their enemy - the drug lords that control the populous by murdering and slaughtering men, women and children, stringing up body parts hanging them from electricity wires like abandoned baggage on clothes-lines.Transporting, manufacturing, shipping and controlling the wildly lucrative drug industry necessitates making alliances - everyone is corruptible from the dealers to the federales and police on both sides of the border - all partaking of the spoils, while their interior sentiments become ghosts evaporating into the surroundings. \"It is not personal\" are words that exemplify the cool calculations of those in power whose humanity has been shredded, and who barricade themselves with bodyguards and fancy homes from the brutality that they inflict on nameless people.Kate and her FBI partner ( a good performance by Daniel Kaluuya) are the two newcomers brought along on a mission that they were not briefed on - so the \"fog of war\" is indeed literally murky. Everything becomes clear with time, but meanwhile we in the audience are as mystified as the protagonists. We meet a team of hardened DEA operatives with Josh Brolin as Matt - the wise-cracking, gum chewing leader who is a cipher, offhandedly refusing to respond with a straight answer to any question put before him. Despite his Cheshire-like grin, there is a man beneath the lumbering, impenetrable veneer who is callously determined to fulfill the U.S. government's calculated goals no matter the toll.Benicio Del Toro is the \"star\" of SICARO, brilliant as the mercenary Alejandro - a person whose face reveals little, but whose eyes and body language betray a passionate resolve for revenge, and a history of incomparable pain and suffering at the hands of the drug-lords becoming a person for hire with no longer a \"soul\" to lose. He is the \"enforcer,\" expert at torture and killing, yet despite his horrific activities, every moment he is on the screen it is filled with his abundant presence and an acute sense of heartache. Kate's sojourn from an idealistic FBI agent to an awareness of the brutal realities of the contaminated policies used by the United States to combat the \"drug war\" is a bit naive and inconclusive. We sense that she remains a staunch believer in the underlying principle of the \"rule of law\", but we know all-too-well that she is standing on shaky grounds.",

    "review": "  First rate crime thriller thanks to a superb cast & gritty direction by Villeneuve. The cast gives career best work, with Blunt continuing her streak as one of the best females in action movies while Brolin laid back cynicism hides a ruthless nature. The standout, though, is Del Toro as Alejandro, a man of few words & all action, coming off as a walking predator. He's someone who knows what he is and is okay with and is Del Toro's best performance since \"Traffic\" (in many ways, this is a spiritual sequel to that movie). Behind the camera, Villeneuve directs Taylor Sheridan's gritty script to near-perfection, keeping the action moving while giving you enough character moments to make you care. Plus, while not preached outright, there is a nice ant-drug war message in the sense that in other to fight monsters like the drug cartels, you'll have to employ a monster to do so, and if you don't like that, maybe this isn't a war worth fighting. Overall, one of the best crime thrillers in years and one of the the best movies of 2015 to date.",

She plays an FBI agent caught up in a shady CIA operation (is that a redundancy?) in Juarez. Her struggle with gradual corruption of the spirit is what makes this work so well.

    "review": "  This eye-opening and chilling tale tells the story of an idealistic FBI agent played by Emily Blunt who thinks she can put a damper on the Mexican drug trade by following the rules. Josh Brolin as a CIA operative who knows with even breaking the rules not much can be done to stop this scourge. Well worth your time and the entire cast is excellent especially Benicio Del Toro as a somewhat heartless spook with a past seeking revenge on the drug lords. Will be mentioned come oscar time...",

    "review": "  Simply put this movie is amazing. Thank you Benicio Del Toro for the unforgettable performance. This movie has some of the most intense scenes I have seen, the build up the camera work, the unflinching realism of the blurred lines of what is good and evil that this movie brings is unparalleled. A must see movie for anyone who is a fan of great films.",

    "review": "  4.5/5* or 9/10Have you ever wondered how people like Osama Bin Laden or El Chapo come to power, and become gang lords, and then are killed/arrested at a timely convince. Well Sicario has a theory of all things mentioned above, one may say its a conspiracy theory etc but like they say there is no smoke without a fire.But all withstanding, what I saw on screen felt like a true story, and it was thought provoking. Sicario is a dark, and eerie tale about what happens just a couple miles away from the American border in Mexico. Daily many innocents Mexicans die due to the cartel drug war. And Sicario highlights the cruel killings, and how one needs to combat the drug lords. Rarely do you see a film that from the first frame not only does it engage you but it takes you into the nail biting action which is happening on screen.Numerous times I had my heart pounding, and jaw on the ground from action and suspense unfolding on the screen. Simply put Sicario has the best performances, and dialogues I have seen in a film this year. Film of the year? Well its in contention for sure.Story wise the film talks about the escalating drug war the Cartel are engaging in on American soil. After FBI agent Kate Macer invades a house in Arizona and finds about 40 dead bodies which are collateral from the Cartel drug war, she is recruited by the a government agency to take down the real players of the drug war. This agency islead by two men Matt Graver, and Alejandro a columbian man. These two men target Manuel Diaz because he can lead them to the kingpin of the cartel because he is right hand man of the kingpin( Diaz lives in the USA, and fronts as a business man). After arresting Diaz's brother Guillermo on Mexico soil in a operation, he leads them to a tunnel used to transport drugs from Mexico to the US.How this tunnel leads to Manuel, and his boss is what forms the rest of the plot.Acting wise Benicio Del Toro is just mindblowing good, I thought Johnny Depp for Black Mass was the best performance of the year, but Del Toro gives him a good match. A oscar worthy performance for sure. Josh Brolin is superb. And Emily Blunt is fantastic, she shoulders the film at many junctions.Its difficult to find any negatives in Sicario, because even the smallest details have been dealt with beautifully. The films pacing is a bit slow, but the concluding 30-45 are adrenal pumping no stop thrill and action, so that makes up for any pacing issues. Sicario being such a great film has many positives them being the dialouges, espically the ones mouthes by Del Toro,two dialogues in particular where \"time to meet god\", and \"the wolves are taking over, and you wont be able to live with wolves so leave\"(in the context of the film, there are mind blowing). Secondly the films acting which i mentioned above. Finally the film is the definition of what a perfect action thriller must be, the film is extremely detailed, its has a dark atmosphere, the way the film highlights the cartel violence, and how the americans have a hand in the drug trade, is also handled perfectly. In short in Sicario content is king, and the script and screenplay are amazing. A special mention for the absolute amazing pre-climax sequence, i got my tickets worth in just those final minutes.Overall over the years Denis Villenue has become one of my favourite directors, and with Sicario he only solidifies his title. The film is a must watch, because if you don't watch it now, you will after seeing its oscar nomination list because its just that good.4.5/5* or 9/10",

    "review": "  Sicario is directed by Denis Villeneuve who directed Prisoners and Enemy, two movies I absolutely adored. Sicario is a tense and pulsating action crime drama with great performances,gorgeous cinematography and examines how the US government is willing to partner up with a bad guy to take out other supposedly worse enemies. The thing that impressed me most about this movie is its visuals. Every frame looks gorgeous and full credit must go to the masterful Roger Deakins. The opening immediately sets the grim and sombre mood with a thrilling rescue mission(Or so it seems) by the FBI. This is where we are introduced to FBI agent Emily Blunt. After a terrible turn of events she ends up volunteering to be part of an operation to take down a drug lord. Emily Blunt's character acts as a conduit for the audience as she is mostly clueless(Just like we are) about the shady things going around her. Just like Emily Blunt, we the audience get frustrated at points when she is confused about what exactly is happening in the mission. However, you are hooked in till the end because bits and pieces are dropped from time to time to keep you invested in what's going on. All the supporting actors are fantastic as well. My only real issue with Sicario is that there was a side plot which didn't really matter to the overall story and the fact that the middle section of the movie slows down in pace slightly compared to the first and last act. All in All, Sicario is a great crime drama that shows that the war against drugs might indeed be pointless. A-",

    "review": "  This is a noir-crime movie. It is not a thriller but it does have some action. It is a thoughtful movie and so it slows down, at times -- a lot! The main female character is built up as a tough person from the very beginning so it is odd to see her as a total innocent in the second half of the movie This incong ruity mars the entire movie. It's like watching James Bond feel sad and cry because someone was mean to him. It just doesn't fit the character. But it is a revealing look into both sides of the drug-trade -- the cops and the robbers. It isn't the good guys against the bad guys. It's just bad guys against bad guys, except that one side breaks the law to enforce the law and the other side breaks the law just because it can.",
