    "review": "  Too often with contemporary horror films we are subjected to a barrage of positive claims. Claims that the most recent one is the best for decades. It almost seems like audiences and critics are desperate for it to actually be the case, such is the lack of any true quality in a failing genre and the desperate demand to be spooked again. Sooner or later, though, one had to arrive where the positivity surrounding it would be genuine. Finally, we have It Follows: a film that can confidently stake it's claim to being that coveted frightener.After a sexual encounter, 19-year-old Jay (Maika Monroe) is told that she will then be followed by a presence - someone or something - determined to kill her. The only way it'll stop is if she has another sexual encounter where she can pass it on. Initially, she's doubtful but soon enough the disturbing visions begin...If you're ever in any doubt that you're being stalked by a malevolent force of some kind, then it's probably best to steer clear of the old rumpy-pumpy. Going by the usual horror tropes, when someone butters the muffin it inevitably leads to their demise. And by that, director David Robert Mitchell cleverly bases his entire horror concept around that promiscuous premise. What works in It Follows' favour is it's homage to films of old - namely, John Carpenter's Halloween. If you consider Carpenter's depiction of Michael Myers, you'll notice that he works slowly and never in a rush to fulfil his murderous intent. That's very much like the entity in this; there's a self-assurance in it's unrelenting pursuit. The setting also takes place in a similar leafy suburban neighbourhood and our protagonist goes by the name of Jay (short for Jamie) - a direct tribute to Halloween's afflicted heroine, Jamie Lee Curtis. Even Rich Vreeland's scaled down music is very reminiscent of Carpenter's classic synthesised score.You could actually spend some time identifying the previous horrors that Mitchell riffs on but that would detract from his own work and his ability to put his own stamp on the proceedings. His decision to shoot with a sombre mood and deliberate pace adds to the overall foreboding atmosphere and allows us to effortlessly enter into any given moment. This works the same in identifying with the characters. Their plight and struggle is all the more involving because it feels like we are getting a glimpse into their lives. It also helps that the cast is headed by reliable, and relatively unknown, faces and as the characters are in their teens, the film works as both an urban-legend horror and a dark coming-of-age tale. Their progression to adulthood and their promiscuity also sets up a clever sub-text that courses through the film in terms of sexually transmitted diseases: a reminiscent 80's setting suggesting the AIDS epidemic, in particular, and channels the deadly nature of that disease as it's psychological device. Mitchell's real trump card, however, comes from his use of space and setting up his shots. The background plays a major part in the film as you never know at which moment \"It\" might make an appearance, leaving you to regularly scan the whole frame for any movement.There's an undoubted ambiguity to Mitchell's film and while some may balk at this I, personally, welcomed it as it added another thought provoking layer. It works on many levels. If you're so inclined, you can adopt a metaphorical approach to the proceedings and delve into it's deeper meanings. But then again, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, right? If your not the type of viewer that wishes to explore the metaphors and just want to be entertained then the film can still be enjoyed at face value and works as a chilling and effective horror yarn, nonetheless. With or without mastication.In only his second film (the first being The Myth of the American Sleepover in 2010) there's no denying David Robert Mitchell's commanding handling of events and his ability to stage a real sense of uneasiness. It's an impressive sophomore effort that has given the horror genre a much needed shot in the arm by delivering substantial terrors and retaining a sincerity in its delivery.Mark Walker",

    "review": "  The horror genre has been on a downward slope for the past couple of decades, as remakes and sequels seem to flood the genre more than any other. Every now and then however, a little independent gem makes it's way into a few theatres and then becomes a loved hit on DVD. \"It Follows\" fits the ladder half of that description, being one of the creepiest pictures I have had the pleasure of viewing in a very, very long time. Make Monroe leads this film, and wow does she ever deliver a raw and true performance. She really makes the audience believe that things like this actually could happen \"in someones mind.\" From the work of art that is the cinematography, to the amazingly eerie score that sent chills down my spine in almost every scene, \"It Follows\" has the rare suspense that you just cannot find in horror films today. I was genuinely creeped out during the broad daylight sequences, and that is saying something. Overall, the film could have been pure perfection if it wasn't for the open ending that I think was great, but left a little too much to be desired. In the end, \"It Follows\" is one of the best recent horror flicks you can find on the shelves today. Definitely recommend, especially to fans of the genre.",

    "review": "  Dear Horror genre, Back in the day, nightmares, sleepless nights, and nightlights were invented because of you. Figures were found in my closet and I was left breathing underneath my blanket, sweating, in hopes for \"it\" to go away because of you. Fast forward to today, nothing has resonated with me. You no longer leave me biting my nails away or pulling me towards the edge of my seat. Perhaps age has gotten the best of me, but \"It Follows\" is the best horror movie to have come out since \"The Cabin in the Woods\".However, there's a huge misconception with \"It Follows\": this is not particularly a traditional horror movie. Some say it's a terrifying masterpiece and others say this is dreadfully boring. So then, let's bring clarity to this debate: what makes a scary movie scary? If loud jump scares does your bidding, this movie is not scary. But let's be real -- the horror genre lost its traction a long time ago. Why? Horror movies are completely dependent on jump scares. Screw tension, screw a nightmarish premise, let's throw in that good ol' violin screech. This very dependency raped the contemporary horror genre. As a result, audiences have bought the lie that scary movies are terrifying because of how high you jumped at these jump scares. You're calling that horror? That's just loud sounds.\"It Follows\" combats traditional horror tropes with inventive devices. Coupled with a slow building tension, it's easy to say that \"It Follows\" is more closely identified as a more moody and chilling creeper than a fright-fest of jump scares. But there's no denying it, this film gave me the goosebumps. Kudos to director David Robert Mitchell for always making audiences feel claustrophobic with its smart use of its score and camerawork. Everything from its 360 revolving camerawork that shows something new with every angle, to its lingering shots, \"It Follows\" has perhaps the best cinematography to hit the horror genre ever alongside the impeccable \"The Shining\". But to be exact, this film does more as a film than a popcorn horror flick will ever do. With ambiguous shots and events that are open for debate, \"It Follows\" transcends higher than any \"Paranormal Activity\" movie will ever do. To say the least, I enjoyed this picture more so as an artistic film more so than a horror film.\"It Follows\" has an incredibly creepy premise harnessed with fantastic cinematography and a genuine tension that left me breathless and waiting to learn more. It does not quite reinvent the wheel, but it sure did rejuvenate a dying genre.",

    "review": "  Indie horror is always looking for the Next Big Thing, and at the start of 2015, that movie was It Follows. Coming out of relatively nowhere, the second film by writer/director David Robert Mitchell was dubbed the real deal, and audiences flocked to see what all fuss was over. I would have been intrigued before the positive word-of-mouth namely because Mitchell made one of my favorite films of 2011, the understated and perfectly yearning ode to adolescence, The Myth of the American Sleepover. I dearly hoped that Mitchell was not another flash in the pan. In retrospect, I did not have need to fear. It Follows is unsettling, suspenseful, and borderline ingenious with its concept, but it also has some faults that mitigate its concluding power. Jay (Maika Monroe) is a normal 19-year-old girl going to college in Michigan until the night she sleeps with her object of desire, Hugh (Jake Weary). In her post-coital mediation, he drugs her, ties her to a wheelchair, and then waits. He wants to show her something, or more accurately someone (perhaps something is actually more appropriate). A woman slowly trudges toward them, the embodiment of a curse he passed on to Jay through sex. It will keep following her until it gets her and kills her. The only way she can protect herself is to sleep with someone else, to pass the curse onto a new recipient. Then the monster goes after them; however, once this newest curse-holder is murdered, the monster moves back up the ladder, attacking the next curse-holder. Once you have it, there's no getting rid of this curse, only delaying it. The top question with a horror movie is whether it provides enough suspense, spooks, and scares to jolt an audience, and in this regard It Follows is quite good; not as unsettling as last year's Babadook but still plenty unnerving and extremely well executed and developed. The opening is engrossing, with a teen girl constantly looking in the direction of the camera and clearly scared out of her mind. The camera has adopted the identity of the monster. The central premise is wonderful, rich with thematic potential about the alienation and anxiety of being a teenager navigating the world, but also intriguing enough that I always wanted a large expository info dump scene just to learn more about the rules or its history. Rare is the film, let alone a horror film, where I'm left desiring lengthy exposition. One of the clever developments of its monster is that it can adopt the appearance of anyone, including people close to you (though it rarely does this for an unexplained reason). That means anyone can be your doom and the only way to know is to double-check whether other people can see this menacing phantom as well. Imagine going the rest of your life always having to look over your shoulder, always having a little nagging doubt in your mind about whether or not this person or that person is real. The premise is well developed with sequences that draw out the tension and make us dread what's coming next or what may or may not be real. Now, slow-trotting fully naked people might not be a scarier monster than, say, Leatherface, but it's still alarming. The premise also allows the audience to imagine what course of action they would do if they were stuck in this situation. Would you doom an innocent human being to protect yourself? If so, would you be upfront about it and the ensuing danger? Would you formulate a plan like Hugh and drive long distances to provide further distance? If you thought you were being followed, would you immediately find a sexual partner? The clever premise gets your brain thinking of what you would do to survive and at what cost.There's a distinct Stanley Kubrick and John Carpenter vibe with the filmmaking, which will enhance the overall mood of the film or drive certain viewers crazy. The camera movements fall into very few selections, mostly slow pans, slow zooms, or long tracking shots with the subject routinely framed in the center. It's hard not to evoke feelings with The Shining, an all-time great horror film that likewise built a sense of foreboding terror. You're conditioned to feel that something bad is about to happen as the camera turns or hovers, waiting for the creepy thing to pop around the corner. It plays into second-guessing everything you see, taking away the illusions of safety, and the steady and controlled camerawork enhances this mood. The entire movie feels vaguely out of time, notably a capsule from the 1980s save for one strange inclusion of a wireless reading device. The musical score by Disasterpeace (nee Rick Vreeland) is another throwback to the 80s, and its fuzzy synth-drenched soundtrack smoothly blends in and enhances the atmosphere. If anyone caught Mitchell's previous film, you'll know that besides a wonderful eye for framing visual compositions, the guy has a very natural feel for developing realistic teenage characters milling about their relatable existences. It Follows is no different, and while I would stop short of saying that the characters have depth to them, they are realistically drawn and portrayed by actors who look and act like scared teenagers. The relatablility of unrequited feelings, or going out on a limb and getting your heart broken, of trusting the wrong people who have ulterior motives, is a universal pain that makes it all the easier to put ourselves in these unfortunate character's shoes. It also helps that, up until the final act, the characters defy the arc of rampant stupidity in horror. After realizing the danger she's trapped in, Jay actually seeks out the one person who she can get answers from, even if he's the same person who doomed her with the curse. It's unfortunate that the movie loses steam when it creeps into its third act and forces a solution and showdown with the monster that makes no sense whatsoever. I understand the need to feel like the teens can regain the upper hand or somehow outsmart the curse that doggedly follows them, but with everything presented, it's just not believable. For the entire movie, we've seen that this supernatural force doesn't really have a loophole in its system of rules. The only way to stave off annihilation is to pass it along and create a series of firewalls as protection with other sexual partners. Otherwise, it's relentless and like zombies the eventuality is what helps magnify the sense of dread. We even see it get shot in a hasty defense from the teens and the gunshots do nothing. And yet, this vital information doesn't seem to register with our band of teenagers. Their third act solution (spoilers): they're going to lure the following terror into a pool and... electrocute it. Huh? Why would a supernatural entity that has no shown any weakness to electricity, or any mortal dangers, be able to be killed? This plan makes no sense and not one character voices a counter-argument to what is proven to be a very bad plan. Maybe the point is that it's supposed to be bad, that it's an example of how desperate these characters have become that they would hold out hope for something that is completely inaccurate. After this failed plan, Jay does exactly what you'd expect with the boy who's been itching to jump her bones for the entire movie. He gets what he wants (physical copulation, being the white knight), she gets what she wants (flimsy security), and then the movie just kind of peters out and ends. I understand that Mitchell's extended point is that there is no happy ending possible and the characters will have to uneasily look over their shoulders for the rest of their lives. However, the point could have been made even without the third act. I wish It Follows could have found a better landing than just shrugging and saying, \"Well, what are you gonna do with curses, you know?\"Before the movie hits the skids in the third act, I was pondering the greater implications and logistics of its sexually transmitted curse. Does \"passing\" it along require some form of genital contact? Does it require fluid exchange? If you wear a condom, does the prophylactic also protect your sexual partner from the transmission? Does the curse function relatively the same for same sex couples? What about people with non-functioning parts below the waste? Can someone who suffers from erectile dysfunction pass the curse along? Can it be transferred onto inanimate objects? Can men ejaculate into some sort of container and then send the container into space via the space shuttle and be protected? Actually, banging an astronaut who's about to live on the space station or go to Mars might be the smartest move. I enjoyed thinking of a stratagem to best protect myself if I was caught in this scenario; even after passing it along and providing a buffer, you still always have to be on guard for the curse to move back up the ladder. My solution: have relations with a prostitute. This is probably a guarantee that the curse will be passed on within a 24-hour period, and even if that john is found and killed, chances are this prostitute may have already passed the curse along to a new client. If one cannot inoculate themselves from a supernatural STD-like curse with the aid of prostitutes, then there's no hope for the rest of us poor mortals. Anyway, my mind wandered a tad. It Follows may suffer due to the hype, the inconclusive resolution, and a third act that deflates, but it's still an extremely well executed horror thriller with a terrific concept at heart. The sense of dread is stark and the camerawork and storytelling draw out the tension until you feel you're about to break. It's more unnerving than traditionally scary, but it has a power that does stay with you, particularly its fascinating premise and the natural relatability of the characters and their choices. I don't know if this premise could sustain a sequel, especially with a villain that appears to be unstoppable, but that hasn't thwarted the horror genre before in its stampede at cashing in on success. It Follows is a solidly entertaining and creepy movie, but it's even more confirmation for me that David Robert Mitchell is going to be a filmmaker who has staying power. I'll be following him.

    "review": "  What makes \"It Follows\" feel like such a reinvention of modern horror is simply it's loving attempt to rekindle the flame of classic 70s and 80s horror past. It does just that, with style and infectious synths to spare. Unlike most current horror movies however, Director David Robert Mitchell's film has been meet with near universal praise. Maybe audiences have finally shown a demand for something different! \"It Follows\" is the antithesis to the house that \"Paranormal Activity\" built. An atmospheric, chilling thriller which strictly abides by the old moniker that \"less is more,\" and (surprise) it most definitely is. Also notable is young Actress Maika Monroe. She's a terrific lead who, with \"The Guest\" and now this film, shows all the makings of a potential go-to queen of the genre. She's great. If there's a single issue that some may have with the picture it's that it isn't terrifying. Factoring in the amassed hype, that may be a deal breaker for the more unforgiving. Though the term is broad, \"It Follows\" is scary both thematically and cerebrally, and as effectively horrific in hindsight as any of the persistent urban legends you've ever heard. It gets in your blood and stays there.",

    "review": "  A teenage woman has sex with her boyfriend and then discovers that a shape-shifting demon follows her; if it catches up, she dies.Here is what this film is trying to do: it's trying to send up the horror movie formula of if a female character has sex, she's sure to die. It's trying to be an homage to (or satire of) John Carpenter's original Halloween film.Here is what the film actually accomplishes: it annoys the living shit out of me. The follow shots and heavy-handed music do nothing to add suspense. Rather, they're almost comic in their over-drawn melodrama. And let's talk a while about this demon. What about hand stuff? Does the demon only get transferred with procreative sex? What if she doesn't come? What about lesbian sex? And why is the demon sometimes one shape but other times another? Why is it only occasionally naked? Why did the demon kill everyone else, but when it catches up to our heroine, it only plays with her hair? Why does it have so much trouble with doorknobs but is capable of flying or climbing on a roof, standing there with Osama bin Laden's beard over its dick? I know the film doesn't want to answer these questions, but they're so obvious.Overall, what's being hailed as \"one of the greatest American horror films in years\" is a dumb piece of shit.",

    "review": "  Incredibly disturbing, It Follows is a creepy and atmospheric low-budget indie horror film. An allegory about STDs (in part), the story follows a young girl who, after having sex with her boyfriend, is stalked by a mysterious shapeshifting creature that can only be seen by those who've had sex with an infected person, and it can only be escaped from (for a time) by passing on the infection to another person through sex. Maika Monroe gives a strong performance that's nuanced and really shows her struggle to come to grips with her situation. However, the director makes some odd choices in creating a setting, as it comes off as a strange alternative reality with a mixture of futuristic and retro fashions and technologies (which is quite distracting). Additionally, the creature effects are rather grotesque; with the creature often appearing mangled and in various stages of nudity. A problematic film, It Follows delivers some effective scares, but the who and the what are so vague that the story ends up being rather unsatisfying.",

    "review": "  The majority of modern horror films are cliche; cheap scares that involve something popping up out of nowhere (loudly), whether it's a ghost, a demon, or somebody possessed. So what ever happened to those classic 70's and 80's slasher films where the two kids having sex die first? It Follows reinvents the slasher flick with style, originality, and ultimately quality horror. A girl is given a curse (through sex) which involves a person who could be random or recognizable, to be constantly walking towards her. The only way to get rid of it is to pass it on through sex. Director David Mitchell is secretly mocking the entire teen sex field, when sex-ed teachers warn us of things like STD's and STI's. In a way, this \"curse\" that is passed on in the film is symbolic for kids catching STD's, and it's just as scary to see it unfold in this film as it was when you were first warned about diseases when you were twelve. With a low budget, It Follows succeeds in the utilization of it's simplistic yet effective horror which revolves around great cinematography, mood, and creepiness rather than the cheap scares we've all come to know today. This is one of the most original horror films I've seen in a long time.",

    "review": "  In \"It Follows,\" Jay(Maika Monroe) has sex with her boyfriend Hugh(Jake Weary) for the first time in his car. Afterwards, he drugs her. When she wakes up, she is handcuffed to a chair and he explains that he just passed on a monster to her that will kill her if she does not pass it on to somebody else by having sex with them. In the aftermath, she has trouble taking it all it in with her being so rattled. But then the reality of the situation becomes clear as during class she finds herself stalked by something inexplicable. So, she goes to her friend Paul(Keir Gilchrist) and sister Kelly(Lili Sepe) for help.On the one hand, it would follow that a modern horror movie like \"It Follows\" would have more than its share of cultural mentions, like say 50's science fiction movies, \"Charade\" and Dostoyevsky. Closer to the present, it could also be said that \"It Follows\" resembles \"Buffy, the Vampire Slayer\" as seen through a Stanley Kubrick lens, which is accentuated by an odd electronic score.(And notice how quickly Jay's Scooby Gang comes together.)Even then, \"It Follows\" is a highly creepy horror movie that more than stands on its own. In general, it seeks to explore boundaries of friendship, suburbia(we get a helpful shot of 12 Mile Road at one point to keep track of how far the characters are from Detroit) and between the real world and a darker, more imaginative one.(This would also explain the woman I saw in the cat costume on Fulton Street after the movie.) Thankfully, the movie never tries to explain the doppelganger(for lack of a better word).At the same time, \"It Follows\" not having an ending does not work entirely against it, as it also prevents the narrative from starting to chase its own tail. That's a consequence of the story falling into the some of the same traps that other horror movies have also faced over the years that also allows the audience to begin second guessing the characters. And then there is the movie becoming a little unbalanced by almost being more about Paul than Jay at times which could also be a symptom of the casting.",

    "review": "  THE RING GETS CHLAMYDIA - My Review of IT FOLLOWS (3 Stars)Often pretentious, overly metaphorical, and uneven in pace, IT FOLLOWS is still writer/director David Robert Mitchell's praiseworthy attempt to inject a little originality into the often stale horror genre. Whereas THE RING was built on the premise that a mysterious videotape would bring death to its viewers, IT FOLLOWS promises being haunted by a shape-shifting specter unless you have sex with someone to transfer the target over to them. Think of it as the consequences of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection, but with more horrific symptoms. As allegories go, it's rich with potential, and Mitchell clearly strives to make the most out of it. He works hard with cinematographer Mike Gioulakis to achieve an endlessly fluid shooting style rife with striking, unusual framing. One unfortgettable shot of blood in a swimming pool is almost worth the price of admission alone. Add a heavy 80s-style synth score, a strange, timeless, quasi-70s/80s production design that mixes cell phones with rabbit ear televisions, old rusty cars, a zonked-out, naturalistic acting style exhibited by its young cast, and the strangest clamshell cameo Kindle device that has never existed, and you're entering John Carpenter Land by way of Terrence Malick. The Malick reference gets its due in not only the unforced, elliptical way our characters converse but in choices Mitchell makes, such as concentrating on a shot of our heroine's hand grazing grass and flowers during a particularly quiet moment right before something awful occurs.The film opens strong, with a twirling 360 degree shot of a young girl racing out of her home dressed in bra, panties and high heels. She's being chased by something unseen and before you know it, she meets an unexpectedly grisly fate. From here, we meet our heroine, Jay (Maika Monroe), who looks like the the product of a fourgy between Kelly Clarkson, Kat Dennings, Reese Witherspoon and Chloe Sevigny, as she wades in her backyard, above ground pool. This is one laid back teen. She's so laconic, she can't even be bothered to shoo an ant crawling across her arm. It's suburban Detroit and Jay's life consists of being observed by her horny pre-teen neighbors, drinking with her friends and family, and dating an easygoing guy. It's at this date where things go seriously and irrevocably wrong. I won't spoil the plot much further, but the aftermath of some backseat sex isn't anywhere close to what Jay imagined. In most horror films, you pay for having sex. Here, sex is the only way out. IT FOLLOWS really turns up the creep factor after this initial sexual encounter, with a shocking cut to the next scene. It seems to be Mitchell's terror equivalent to finding out your partner just intentionally infected you with an STI. With Jay dumped back home looking like a rape victim, those closest to her rally by her side to help her escape her fate. In an almost silent performance, Monroe must convey fear and a certain guilt for the rest of the film. There are a few good scares of the \"jump out of your seat when somebody goes 'Boo!' variety\" and a few haunting scenes where she's being stalked. The framing of the shots truly helps these sequences flourish as you're made to look around constantly to discover the predator. Knowing the threat could be coming from anywhere is part of this movie's simmering tension. Additionally, like a diagnosis of syphilis, our main character has a tough time disclosing what's happening to her. Unfortunately, there's not much else to the film. Our leads run and run and run, stopping sometimes to have sex until they come up with a plan to conquer this \"thing\". Although visually stunning, that big sequence doesn't make a lot of sense, and it feels like the rules changed slightly to justify what happens. Ultimately, it feels like the film is a little light on incident and lacks a satisfying resolution, ending up feeling like a light campfire story instead of a big, hearty meal. More haunting than scary and more metaphor than fleshed-out storytelling, IT FOLLOWS is an admiral homage. Rich Vreeland's score is an acquired taste. It booms in almost every frame in a way that reminded me of Christopher Nolan's DARK KNIGHT and is highly evocative of the score from HALLOWEEN. It feels intentional and will either feel like a propulsive addition to the storytelling (my feeling) or annoy the hell out of you. Same goes with the odd, can't-place-it time in which the story is set. For me, it kept me engaged in the film, with its vague, hazy memories of a time where we would have to talk with each other instead of texting. Others will find it to be a pretentious conceit. Fair enough, but love it or hate it, IT FOLLOWS has a lot on its mind and Mitchell clearly wants to establish a new, methodical voice in film storytelling.",

    "review": "  An original concept with strong execution, It Follows represents the rare horror film that departs from formula and injects something new to the genre. In the film a teenager inexplicably finds herself followed by an entity that won't let her go and can't easily be shaken. Director David Robert Mitchell delivers a film that excels at methodical storytelling. There are no cheap scares, no contrived sequences, and no overtly predictable moments. It's a film that, assuming you get in to the premise, is chilling and also engaging. A film that respects the audience's attention span, and one that has an appreciation for earned scares, and earned horror.The acting is good, though not great, a seemingly rather low budget affair. The methodical pace does get a bit slow and things are never as fleshed out as they should be. Yet that's also part of the fun, this is a horror film that doesn't immediately bog you down with exposition and 'rules' rather revels in the inexplicable nature of it all.4/5 Stars",

    "review": "  Intelligent, entertaining, and effectively scary, It Follows might ape some classic '80s thrillers, but it's a masterstroke of modern horror cinema all of its own. Sure, we've seen virginal teens stalked by homicidal maniacs but never by the stigma of losing one's virginity. This young adult rite of passage proves scary and anxiety-inducing enough without a lead-footed specter attached to it! The title boasts a true Truth in Advertising moment, with this sex-related affliction passed along in the form of a form-changing foot-dragger who never stops moving toward the protagonist. The material works on many levels but stops short of becoming too Meta because it is - at its jackrabbit-paced heart - a brilliantly staged straight-ahead horror flick. It makes you think but not too much because it would take away the fist-pumping fun of having the Bejesus scared out of you. With long takes and synthesized music that would feel at home on USA's Up All Night 30 years ago, It Follows waxes nostalgic but somehow feels timeless. The rotating faces of the unknown terror makes for a monster for the ages, especially considering the fact that the chased (not chaste, mind you) find themselves in a particularly vexing and highly emotional time of their lives. Judgement and comeuppance comes from any direction in an unrecognizable form as your hormones are red-lining? Scary beyond belief.In this R-rated horror flick, a young woman (Monroe) gets followed by an unknown supernatural force after getting involved in a sexual encounter. With an ace cast filled with fresh faced actors devoid of big names and marquee faces, John Robert Mitchell's lean atmospheric thriller nails the genre with every terrifying beat. It Follows looks cheap but the exquisitely staged frights are top shelf. Plus, it takes a skilled hand to make a digital flick purposely look like an 80s video rental creature feature. Youll follow this horror gem anywhere. Bottom line: Teenage Wraith-Land",

    "review": "  For a change, a newer horror movie that not only lives up to the hype, but surpasses it. This movie is very scary, and for the first times in years, succeeded at making me squirm a few times. Sure there are plot holes as some have gone out of their way to shout out, but at the end of the day, this is a horror, and what successful horror doesn't ask you to take a leap of faith along the way? Hence that argument is just plain absurd to me. If you want to hate a movie and find things wrong with it, there isn't a single movie in the world that can stop you from doing so.There's so much about this movie to like: Maika Monroe, wow... wowow... she does a stunning job at making the viewer feel as uncomfortable as she feels in the movie; the entire cast adds up to substantially more than just the sum of their parts - their friendship and concern for each other is extremely genuine; the soundtrack and score is amazing, a perfect fit for the plot and what's occurring on-screen. Overall, everything about this movie is fun and scary, and exactly what the movie promises you it will deliver. Bravo!",

Adem�s, claro est�, tambi�n tienen sexo sin protecci�n.

Mitchell sabe muy bien que los cuentos de hadas y las pel�culas de terror muchas veces funcionan como advertencias a su p�blico.

    "review": "  How this movie gets 97 is beyond me. How so many people think this movie is good is even more puzzling. What is good about it? In my opinion it looked like a sub par student film. Please explain to me why 90% of the camera shots had to be a zoom, pan, tilt, dolly/tracking shot? Is it because the movie is called \"It Follow\" so the camera has to 'follow' all the characters? If so, that may sound clever, but it just seemed well overdone, plus it made the movie's pacing even slower than it already was. And thats another thing...slowest...movie...ever!So what are the rules? We know Freddy can only get you in your sleep, Jason cant do water, dont watch the tape and The Ring girl can't get you, etc. What are the rules of \"It\" other than banging someone else to pass it off to them? We don't know. And that, for lack of a better word, is stupid.But how do we even know that rule? Hugh tells Jay. But how did he find out? He said he didnt remember the girl he got it from, so who told him? If I'm just sitting there minding my business and notice someone walking towards me REALLY, REALLY SLOWLY, I may think its weird, I may think its creepy, I may even run away. But under no circumstances will it just pop into my head that this person is following cuz i just screwed that chick. And even further from my consideration would be sleeping with someone else so that it starts following her and not me.And what the hell year is it supposed to be? Old ass tvs, old ass phone, but cell phones (girl in the beginning), and that weird makeup ereader thing seemed like something relatively current. I'll give it to them that its somewhat original, but it made no sense at all. The kids never have an actual plan of attack. Why not just go to Japan or something. The thing is so damn slow that by the time it walked there you'd be like 90 and wouldnt give a shit anymore.I was honestly expecting this movie to score in the 30s, maybe...MAYBE in the 40s. But 97!

    "review": "  It Follows is hardly a scary film in my mind. There couple disturbing scenes perhaps, but it cushions the threatened protagonist by always keeping her company with her friends. This is not a film that uses isolation to its advantage for suspense. The menace doesn't care. But how the 'it' manifests itself is irrelevant, it's a coming-of-age film using a stalking terror as an allegory for the anxieties of adulthood. Sure, it could also be about sexually transmitted diseases given its teenage cast and the method of the monster, but the beauty of It Follows is that it works for any interpretation. The former is the one that resonated with me the most, hinted in an early scene where the protagonist hangs out with who later becomes the person who gives her 'it.' There's an odd nostalgia about it, conjured by the vibrant cinematography and retro score, but Mitchell keeps it fresh. The only misstep is the misconceived third act where the characters are essentially asking for the trouble they receive but the humanistic approach Maika Monroe takes to her character saves it from feeling too removed. So in other words this film was amazing. Scary and gritty but most of all real. A total change from the run of the mill middle class American movies.",

    "review": "  It Follows follows Jay, an attractive girl on the verge of her twenty's who sleeps with her boyfriend and contracts a demon as a result (your parents were right about premarital sex kids!)The demon takes the form of people, some of whom she knows or has known, and stalks her relentlessly, intent on killing her for her naughtiness. Now a synopsis such as this can curve one of two ways. Either this is a tongue in cheek horror-com, sardonically wagging its finger at the 'dangers' of flippant teen sex. Equal parts Scream and Cabin Fever perhaps. Or it's a horror that takes itself seriously and truly wants to frighten, but fails, as a result of its silly premise. Amazingly however, It Follows subverts both of these possible routes by being something else entirely. It's a real horror film, with real horror. And while it's message of 'the only way to avoid the demon is to abstain from intercourse' is within the narrative perineum arch of the film itself, it isn't concerned with preaching or educating anyone on anything outside of how to make a really good chiller. David Robert Mitchell is a filmmaker you've never heard of but I suspect will be heard a lot more of in the years to come. He makes films in and about Detroit and while It Follows is his first wide release, it isn't his first turn at the helm of the great ship celluloid. You can tell watching this film that Mitchell had a hell of a ball making it. It's technically interesting without being needlessly flashy. It's visually inventive without being ostentatious, which it had the ability to be if it so chose. If this film were made by Paul Thomas Anderson, the technical prowess that resides in abundance within his frame would have been distracting and off putting. You can tell that Mitchell, while commanding enough knowhow to comfortably move around within his frame, is still feeling his way around it as well, which adds an innocence to the picture that fits this particular tale well. Another big part of this film's effectiveness lies in its musical makeup. Composer Rich Vreeland, according to IMDb, is another relative newbie in the film scene, but his angry strings and neo-nostalgic bursts of synth crunch, grind through the picture, punctuating the dread that a film about demons stalking virgin-less teens asks for, no, demands. If a nude, hell spawn representation of a loved one walking toward you with a murderous glint in their eye isn't enough to creep a crawly up your arm, Vreeland is sure to remind you every time. Without doubt It Follows is a fiercely original film. But it also owes a great debt to the films it exists, at least in part, as a tribute to. Namely, Halloween. In fact, the film comes close to being a remake of that 1978 classic on a number of occasions. The music, the undead demon stalk, the naughty, frisky teens, the sheer relentlessness of the chase. And the look. The characters don't mention Detroit until the end of the film, but what other American city could it be? The neighbourhoods look like drab, forgotten relics of a more hopeful, prosperous time. Others look positively post apocalyptic. Whole city blocks abandoned and left to rot within their own skeletal structures. A city that failed its residents, and whose residents, as a result, left behind in search of greener metropolitan pastures. The exact year, or indeed, decade, of It Follows is also a bit of an enigma. The characters are dressed in modern clothing, but their houses are decorated in the faded earth tones of the 70's and the back projected televisions of the 80's. Some the cars are 2000-somethings, but there isn't a cell phone in sight, even when it would make most sense for the character to use one. And the aforementioned hollowed out city of Detroit itself is a shell representative of its modern bleak landscape, rather than the more fruitful years of twenty and thirty years ago. But while this dichotomy of time and place fits the story well, and harkens it to its genre defining forebears, it doesn't really matter when or where It Follows stalks its prey. What matters is that this film is cool, creepy, smart, brutal, sick, slick and exciting in all the ways horror films should be. It's got good acting, characters you'll care about, and ends just the way I was hoping it would. It Follows joins the likes of House of the Devil, The Innkeepers, The Conjuring and The Babadook in taking its cues from the slashers and the haunters of the second golden age of the grotesque in the 70's and 80's, rather than the over the top exploitation and swish boom cheese we usually see hit horror screens these days. It almost makes you wish one of these young filmmaking wunderkinds would resurrect Freddy Fingernails for one last slash of the throat...",

Honestly, I saw this like 3 weeks ago... hereeeee we go.Pro tip: see this movie at night, away from home, alone and then you can experience the real dread the film leaves you with. Having to walk home down 4 darkened blocks, the fear sinks in and you start glancing over your shoulder every couple steps. I was outrageously blown away by this movie: the premise is so simple, and yet so strikingly strong for a suspense horror. This film IS suspense. The monster just follows you until it catches you? How can there be a more suspenseful plot anywhere?? The suspense game has been won, not by Hitchcock, but by It Follows.The other huge success of this film is it's indie release, which has been discussed time and time again. A young no-name cast - the film stands on its own as an excellent piece of filmmaking, which is increasingly difficult in this cinematic day and age. It definitely deserves whatever acclaim it has received.I was mostly blown away by just how creepy the entire movie is; it opens on someone getting got and anyone walking is now a source of fear and suspicion. The set up is short and sweet and the movie gets right into it. The set pieces are simple and timeless - this movie will come to haunt audiences for years to come. See this anyway you can!",

Despite not being fully convinced by the plot/story and the slow pace towards the end, it felt very refreshing compared to today's Horror genre. The movie succeeds in creating a certain suspense by the smartuse and choice of sound. After the movie I had mixed emotions. I felt like the second half was rushed but I was pleasantly surprised by the style. Nothing that keeps me up at night but highly recommended for all Horror fanatics.",

Mitchell is undeniably a talented director and he captures some amazing visuals, even completely inconsequential moments are occasionally startling to look at. The screenplay is ... not so good. I admire a minimal concept in a horror film, but the concept here is so minimal it just stops moving forward before the film is half over. I was increasingly frustrated by the films' vague gestures and nonsensical plot developments. I didn't hate the film, but it's more of a promising beginning than a fully formed film.

Although the technical execution is superb, what one needs in order to make a good film is a satisfying story, an ultimate climax, something that the tension builds up to. What we get in It Follows is all of the suspense without the payoff. This review is coming from a mindset that loves metaphors, and is constantly looking for them when watching film. Because of this reason, the film confused the hell outta me, for it had no distinct purpose. I couldn't tell what the director was trying to SAY. Unlike other modern, critically acclaimed horror films (The Babadook comes to mind), It Follows doesn't know what it's symbolism is actually attempting to convey, and for this reason, the film gets muddled down into a pretty cheesy horror flick that probably doesn't deserve the acclaim that it has received. A disappointing, frustrating watch.",

It definitely is not smart, as it is literally about an STD. The acting is mediocre along with the plot which overall makes the movie extremely boring.

With a lot of horror nowadays, directors have opted to use more \"realistic\" camera like hand/video cam POV, which in my opinion is really really stupid and goes against what a movie experience is supposed to be. It Follows simply looked back at what horror films used to be a la Carpenter, Polaski, etc. who used the camera very precisely and also used music, effective simple premises, and really great cinematography. They basically implemented their techniques with a really original interesting and creepy premise. It didn't need to be deep(though there are definitely interesting interpretations of this film) or have annoying kids to be scary or a good horror film(I'm looking at you Babadook), it had to elicit fear and discomfort and it definitely did that really effectively and beautifully.

In the film a teenager inexplicably finds herself followed by an entity that won't let her go and can't easily be shaken. Director David Robert Mitchell delivers a film that excels at methodical storytelling. There are no cheap scares, no contrived sequences, and no overtly predictable moments. It's a film that, assuming you get in to the premise, is chilling and also engaging. A film that respects the audience's attention span, and one that has an appreciation for earned scares, and earned horror.The acting is good, though not great, a seemingly rather low budget affair. The methodical pace does get a bit slow and things are never as fleshed out as they should be. Yet that's also part of the fun, this is a horror film that doesn't immediately bog you down with exposition and 'rules' rather revels in the inexplicable nature of it all.4/5 Stars",

It follows you around until you pass it to someone else by having sex with them. Fortunately, it walks very slow - which is creepy and creates a great deal of suspense. The monster also takes different guises, so a different actor plays it each time. So, a bunch of teens confront this threat but it is a real challenge to stop; plaudits to the movie for keeping things realistic and practical (taking its cues from night of the living dead) even as the whole concept is not. The soundtrack and the burnt out neighbourhoods of Detroit add to the spooky atmosphere (and the absence of gore is a plus for me). Unfortunately, the filmmakers seem to run out of steam with their premise and can't quite produce a satisfying ending. But this is still one of the better recent horror flicks, in a genre that is pretty tough to get right.",

Perhaps the writer/director David Mitchel thought to fill these gaps with some kind of visual narration but it rang empty (fell on blind eyes?) in my opinion.Putting some awkward moments aside, in general the film is shot well and the sound design, excellent! If you enjoyed Final Destination (the original) then you may find the the kind of suspense beats on offer here familiar and I would recommend this movie in kind.",

These are the kind of shits that the original Scream(1996) so effectively mocked. This is also a kind of film that you feel like appreciating while you watchit, but once it's over, you end up feeling how unmemorable all the shit really is.",

Many times throughout the movie, the director decided long, drawn out shots of random places with 80s thriller music would make you feel scared. As well, there are holes in the screenwriting that completely give away some of the \"scariness\" factor. Indeed, the Midwest US is scarier than this movie. Save yourself some time and go watch a real horror movie. Also, pretty sure this movie is a metaphor for STDs. Just sayin'.",

    "review": "  If you want a simple synopsis of the story, here it is. This entity in this movie is equivalent to an STD. It's transferred through the process of sex, is nearly impossible to get rid of, and will probably kill you at some point. So the message in this movie is to practice abstinence. Show your kids this, and they'll not even think of sex for years.Okay, I was joking, don't show your kids this movie. But, for those of you of legal age, this movie is probably one of the smartest, and most simply horror movies of our generation. The screenplay is great, and you are on the edge of you seat throughout the whole movie.To start out, this movie just happens to be labeled as one of the scariest horror movies ever. Sadly, this is a false title for a great movie. This movie is not so much scary, as it is intense and nerve-racking. Those are two completely different feelings, and although I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie, I couldn't help but wish that this movie was scarier. Yes, although I did feel trapped and scarred for her life, it just felt like their was no end to the madness. It was always intense, but not particularly scary. This movie did a great job of making it feel like their was never a safety net to fall back on, and that this was a situation that no one would like to be in. I just loved the feeling that this movie gave me, and I felt like that because this movie was just executed really well. This movie was also shot really well. There are many shots that are just smartly filmed, and they utilized their low budget to the max. It was clear that the director and crew were intent on making a quality, well-thought out film, and it was clear cut when this movie was playing on the big-screen. The screenplay was also pretty smart, and although it wasn't genius by any means, it was a good fit for this movie. The characters never really did anything stupid to piss of the audience, like they typically do in dumb slasher flicks. Speaking of which, the actors in this movie were solid all around. Maika Monroe does a good job as the lead, and she's been in some good movies as of late. I can't wait to see her in more films, and the rest of the cast was functional enough. This movie ultimately did it's job. It brought us a smart, well-shot horror movie for the 21st century. Considering we don't get many of these very often, we should cherish the few gems we get. This movie was intense on many levels, and the plot was simple enough to comprehend, yet complex enough to entertain. This movie knows exactly what it is, and it capitalizes on it.",

This is the first serious film of David Robert Mitchell, an obviously extremely talented director that you should keep an eye on.The movie on the surface talks about some kind of supernatural virus that is transmitted through sexual intercourse (David Cronenberg influence spotted there). I know that sounds cheeky, but in fact the movie is an a deep allegory (I'm not going to say about what, that's up to your judgment).At the same time it's a surprisingly well made psychological horror movie that escalates slowly like all horror movies should (like classic movie \"The Exorcist\" does). Direction and sound are excellent and the dialogs between the characters imply more than the obvious. The ambiguous ending is fantastic. This is an art film that I have watched twice within a month. Sooner or later it's going to get the attention it deserves.Note: The trailer cannot depict the atmosphere of the film. If you expect cheap impressive horror movie tricks, this is not your cup of tea.Grade: A-",

    "review": "  It Follows is a movie that has intrigued me since it came out, but all the hype revolving around it had me worried. The movie was being praised everywhere and I thought that I would be dissapointed with the movie if I saw it. Now that I've seen it, I can say that the hype did not destroy this movie for me! The movie follows (hehe) a girl, Jay, that's been \"infected\" with the STD (Sexually Transmitted Demon, that's how I decided to call it) and now is being constantly followed by It. The only way to get rid of It is to sleep with somebody else, then the It will hunt them, but as soon as that other person is dead, It begins to follow you again. Quite an original and fresh take on the horror genre if you ask me. There is barely any violence in the film. The fear-factor in the movie mostly comes from the idea of being followed by something that you don't know what is and knowing that there's no escape once you have It. The style is very reminiscent of Halloween, where Michael Myers is always following somebody with his very slow walk and he's always sort of kept in the background. This movie also has, maybe, about 2 or 3 jumpscares, which I'm very thankful for, because the more jumpscares, the more silly the movie is. There are a few scenes that could've been cut, scenes that don't matter for the plot progression. The soundtrack was awesome! It captured the atmosphere of the movie very well and there were many scenes where It was following Jay and the music that played would make it even more frightening than it already was. The camera-work is great and there are some really interesting shots in the movie, for example the very first scene where the camera is just standing in one place, and we follow a girl being hunted by It only with the camera rotating in its place. The acting was pretty good and the characters are actually likeable! Whou would've thought we'd see a movie where friends actually help friends in a situation like this? All in all, a great, original horror movie with some really terrifying scenes and a paranoid soundtrack, but perhaps a bit too long as some of the scenes don't really matter for the movie and could've easily been cut out. I would deffinetely recommend checking it out!",

    "review": "  An innovative horror-drama with a simplicity.It was not too long ago I saw the director's other film, his first one and liked it instantly. I did not expect him to go all the way from a beautiful teen drama to a creepy horror flick. But I liked this movie as well, thus that prove he's not a fluke. After seeing his both the films, I can detect the style of presentation that marks his trademark. That is very realistic, dull, but a natural societal atmosphere with a mere background score.I have said many times that these days horror flicks are heavily leaning on the scary noise/sounds. But this film brings the tone that's really happening around us. The story was like a straight flowing river, no twists or turns like the Amazon river. Even it did not try to hide the existence of the evil spirit. Not only from us, but among the characters in the story. That means it is a very simple tale with the compelling scenes.It does not look like a cheap horror, this 2 million movie can stand up to any fancy horror flicks. The writer/director's interpretation was very interesting too. Like he said IT could board a plane to follow who he's after. The theme was also very innovative. Quite similar types have made out, but this one was way better. Yep, many movie goers overwhelmed by the unexpected, even the filmmakers for the response.Now I pray for if there is going to be a sequel, it must be made by the same writer/director. My worry is the B category filmmakers going to spoil the original in the name of follow-up. I highly recommend this movie, especially for adults due to the plot that develops on the sexual intercourse. Though there's no strong nudity. I also suggest you to watch at night, if possible alone. I won't guarantee that it would scare out of you, but that's the best way to watch any horror flick.8/10",

    "review": "  I've heard a lot of hype over this one so I gave it a watch. Overall it ain't bad but a good deal of faults stand out to me more than the positive aspects of it. It was mildly chilling but the characters were pretty much lifeless and the dialogue was poor. The toss in of Dostoevsky and TS Elliot quotes to attempt to latch onto a greater theme felt very cheap. It was cleanly shot and overall the score was quite good, except for a couple of the cues which sounded like the wrong sort of 80s horror soundtrack. I probably wouldn't watch it again. Very cheesy all and all.",

    "review": "  David Robert Mitchell takes the horror cliches but uses them in a completely new way, a lot of homages made to 1980's horror movies. The story follows (no pun intended) a teenage girl who gets a strange demon STD that will follow her anywhere she goes, what follows is an extremely intense and fantastic horror movie. Cinematography is fantastic apart from a couple of panning shots that even though were actually very good they were filmed very poorly and it made it impossible the concentrate on anything, it was like spinning around an office chair. Acting is good especially Maika Monroe's very realistic performance. The scares are real, not this cheap jumpscare that is used a lot nowadays, the intensity builds throughout the entire movie and it never stops until the final and absolutely incredible finale. But the real star of the show here is the utterly sinister and damn right fantastic soundtrack by Disasterpeace, a very John Carpenter-esque soundtrack and in my opinion one of the best soundtracks of all time because it doesn't just sound good it improves the creepiness and intensity of the movie at the same time, if it weren't for the soundtrack it probably wouldn't have been as scary. And also the ending was very open ended and left me wondering if it was it. 3.5/4",

    "review": "  Probably the best horror film I've seen since \"Let the Right One In\" (though I still haven't seen \"The Babadook\" which is supposed to be excellent). The film features a wildly original concept, which is saying something when you're talking about horror films, about an entity (the titular \"It\") that slowly follows it's victim in the different human forms, and which no one else can see, until it eventually catches up to the victim. The clever bit is that the only way to stop \"It\" is to have sex with someone and then \"It\" will then begin following that person until they pass \"It\" to someone else (unless \"It\" kills that person and then \"It\" goes back to following the previous person). The film is incredibly suspenseful and does not let up. The level of paranoia in the film, that \"It\"could be anyone around you at anytime, provides the film with a heightened level of tension you rarely get in films. Maika Monroe plays the film's heroine and give a very strong and empathetic performance. I'm really looking forward to seeing her in something else, as I believe this will be something of a breakout part for her. The film is also certainly a breakout film for writer/director David Robert Mitchell, who I also can't wait to see what he does next. Mitchell only has one other feature on his filmography, and it's not a horror film, so I'm quite interested to see what direction he'll go in his next film. There are subtle elements in the films, like the timeless setting of the film (featuring lots of cars from the 70s and 80s, antiquated TVs, while still having cell phones and a few modern cars), which also seems kind of unsettling. The throwback synthesizer John Carpenter-like score by Rich Vreeland is terrifically effective, and is certainly a treat for horror fans. I'm wondering if the choice of doing this type of score was a decision made for aesthetic reasons or if it was done out of economy, as it was originally done by John Carpenter in his films. The darkly moody and crisp photography by Mike Gioulakis, who also shot the surreal horror film, \"John Dies at the End,\" greatly aids the oppressive atmosphere of the film. Overall, this is certainly the scariest film I've seen in quite some time and is a must see for horror fans.",

You think to yourself, \"What would I do in that situation?\" and find that every conceivable plan has flaws; how do you escape a relentless, ruthless and apparently purposeless being that no-one else can see? This film demonstrates what a good horror film SHOULD be, and has only minor flaws which include a scene with a small boy that is ill-fitting to the remainder of the film, and an opening scene that contains an element of gore also seemingly out of place compared with the rest of the film.",

    "review": "  It is extremely difficult to hold tension throughout entire duration of a movie, but this movie does it magnificently. It has the relentless pace of an unstoppable slasher but also has the mystery and intangibility of a ghostly haunting. David Robert Mitchell clearly takes directional influence from John Carpenter's Halloween, and it does so most effectively. Horror in the mid-2010s is in an era of remaking or revisiting previous ideas and using new technology to enhance the imagery. That is not particularly a bad thing, but it makes a truly unique concept like this a real treat. While it features teenagers that seem to have no parents, it is hardly a dumb horror-teen flick. The story uses well-constructed teenage characters. Their insecurities and loss of innocence are important plot devices. Three are no cheap scares or distracting breaks in tone. It is tight, disciplined and consistent in its mood. The plot never stagnates and things are continuously unfolding, keeping you at the edge of your seat. One interesting aspect of the movie is its vague period. It deliberately mixes clothing, building types, accessories, and household items from different eras. There is a feeling of 70s or 80s, particularly in the camerawork. At the same time, there are also obviously present day elements. This approach my help the movie age well by removing the distraction of things that unintentionally date the movie in a negative way. The best horror movies are the ones like this that build and maintain suspense the best. This makes its mark as a high-quality horror film with its excellent execution and simple yet original concept. Take the recommendation to see this knowing as little as possible before going in and enjoy the ride.",

    "review": "  It Follows is the kind of movie that you bring up at parties when you want to pretend you have taste. \"Oh, you went to see the latest Saw? No, I'm not really into mainstream horror. Have you seen It Follows? It's more of a cerebral horror film, you know?\" The premise sounds like something a fundamentalist church would make up to scare kids into chastity: out on a date, the main character has sex with a boy. Immediately afterward, he reveals that he's passed on the mother of all STDs: a shapeshifting monster that will slowly but constantly track her down and kill her. The only way she can escape is by sleeping with someone else and passing it down the line.Shot with an eye for unflattering lighting that would make Terry Richardson proud, and scored with minimal electronic music reminiscent of Drive, It Follows is certainly stylish. Every location in the movie could double as an American Apparel photoshoot. The story drifts from abandoned factory ruin-porn to an instagrammable cabin to a normcore chic suburban living room. The characters, rock a \"bland as cool\" aesthetic that instantly made me feel old. Our protagonist (the one being followed by the \"It\") and her friends sleepwalk through an adult-shaped world where the adults seem mostly absent. Even as an unspeakable horror walks inexorably toward them, they behave like teenagers: pouting and procrastinating, lusting and bloviating. And always, over everything,they project that melodramatic sense of doom every angsty teen has felt. Though unlike most teens, in this case it's completely justified. Over the course of the movie, with the help of her friends and the boy next door, the girl attempts to escape through various means. What originally looked like a metaphor about the dangers of unprotected sex proves to be a larger exploration of the transition to adulthood and how the discovery of sex and our own mortality are linked. The running and screaming seems, somehow, more existential than usual. The fear seems more grounded in reality, despite the monster. The requisite sex scenes are less about lust than the loss of innocence and the transience of relationships. Far from turning the characters into sex objects, (there's no actual nudity by the way) they remind the viewer just how young and vulnerable these kids are. Overall, this is horror for those who like their chills flavored with a little intellectual pretension, a popcorn movie for those who insist that would rather critique than cry out in surprise. If you're looking to be titillated with blood and boobs you're going to be disappointed. But if you're a college sophomore who needs to bang out a five page paper for your intro to film class, It Follows is a great choice. It's neither as terrifying nor as deep as it would like to pretend, but there's enough in there to earn you an A.",

Horror stereotypes and cliches although present are kept to a minimum which is very refreshing. The story reminds me of Nightmare on Elm St without the massive body count. The cast although mostly unknowns all deliver good performances while the characters themselves are mostly likeable so you won't find yourself yelling at the television or getting mad at the dumb blonde for making all the wrong choices. A great watch for any horror fan, unless of course you're a sucker for all the typical chiche horror movies that flood the cinemas nowadays in that case you probably won't enjoy. To me this movie had an old school horror feel to it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My one criticism would be that the ending felt anti climactic and long it was as if the writer/director had made two thirds of an awesome movie but never quite worked out the perfect ending. This is forgiveable so I'll stick to my positive review. Check it out!!",

    "review": "  Hmmm where do I start with this one? I don't hate it like some people do. But I don't actually love it like others. For me, it fell in the middle. It was another great first half, marred by a dull second half.First, let me go over the good. The soundtrack is amazingly awesome. It may have the best horror score in decades. It's reminiscent of old John Carpenter. Speaking of Carpenter, this movie is so heavily inspired by his movies that it almost comes off as a shameless ripoff. It Follows is basically the best Michael Myers movie that doesn't actually have Michael Myers. The way things are shot and characters interact is very reminiscent of Halloween. Like I said before, the first half of this movie is great. It's full of wonderfully creepy ideas and the teenagers actually act like teenagers. There's a nice slow, tense build, and the car scene and the dilapidated building scene are well done and creepy.But that's where things started to go bad though. Not so bad the movie sucked, but just underwhelming. The first major issue is the \"it\" itself. It really should be just one monster with one identity. The whole ambiguous \"it can look like anyone\" thing just made it less terrifying when you see it on screen. I get that they were probably going for an STD-type metaphor, but I just don't find old ladies, chubby naked girls peeing themselves, and hipsters to be all that frightening. Why not have the \"it\" be faceless? Maybe make it naked, but with no discernible gender. Just an idea, but that would be creepy and it would give more of an identity to the monster and make it scarier when it appears on screen. Or maybe the idea of \"it\" being faceless would make the obvious connections to Halloween a little too obvious. Another issue is there is no real way to fight the monster. That would be fine, but since there is no way to kill the monster the characters just stand around and wait till it shows up, run away, and then do it all over again. There needed to be some sort of goal the characters were working towards. How about a Ring-esque plot where they're trying to figure out where the curse started from and how they can solve it? They could go from place to place until they end up in even worse parts of Detroit (the city by the way is one of the best parts of the movie). Maybe they do or don't find the origins of the curse, but at least it would give them something to do.The ending with the pool seemed confusing and pointless. Their plan was to electrocute it? Did they realize how stupid their plan seemed and that throwing toasters in an olympic-sized pool wasn't going to work anyway? They could actually interact with it, even if they couldn't see it, so why not try to trap it? Then the movie just sort of ends abruptly.So while I enjoyed most of the movie, it really suffers for being underwhelming. It's like everything was in place for a true horror classic to stand next to Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, and A Nightmare on Elm Street, but it falls way short of hitting it over the fence. I can't help but imagine how amazing this would have been if it were pretty much the same movie, but with a Michael Myers-like killer and a Ring-like plot to keep it interesting. It Follows just isn't that scary, despite having some of the most terrifying concepts and ideas to come to a horror movie since masked killers and reanimated corpses.",

    "review": "  I watched this movie on the recommendation of a couple of sources because I wanted to see some good horror with my friend. Honestly, I have no clue how this movie has such a high score. If I could describe it with one word it would be \"boring\". There's a difference between a slow burn and just unnecessary padding. Half the dialogue I was left wondering what the point of putting it there was. At one point there was an aside that sounded like it might be a commentary on classism in America? But it's placement was so strange and added nothing. At no point did they make any attempt to figure out this creature's limitations. Will uninterrupted water - lake, sea, ocean? - with no crossing hinder it? The pool scene implies it can swim, but can it swim across an ocean? For that matter, how fast does it walk? And it's obviously capable of more cognitively involved processes than walking- it throws rocks through windows and apparently recognizes a trap to electrocute it - what's stopping it from walking on transportation exactly? Other than it ruining this movie's \"gimmick\" of course. I'm not really sure what's so apparently original about this thing. It falls into some pretty common horror movie cliches - from sex inviting in corruption/evil/whathaveyou, to the casual use of women's naked bodies for shock, to the head-desk worthy amount of plot-induced idiocy required of the protagonists to make this setup work. I could've watched 3 Headed Shark Attack instead. At least that movie I know is SUPPOSED to be bad.",

    "review": "  Inexplicably earning a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes, \"It Follows\" benefits from reviewers anticipating that horror movies tend to be utter pieces of crap. Anything that exceeds these expectations gets a positive review. \"It Follows\" begins with a nice enough premise, practically guaranteed to build white-knuckle tension: promiscuous teens acquire an STD, \"se*ually transmitted demon\" who stalks them, one at a time, until they're either killed, or they pass the curse onto the next victim. The demon is always making a b-line for the victim, slowly walking. That's pretty scary, right? The only other thing the movie does right is cast a group of average-looking teens and create an environment that feels very real. For a reviewer who has had his fill of whitewashed cinematography, CGI, and perfect skin and teeth, \"It Follows\" felt refreshingly organic. Unfortunately, that's where the refreshment ends...precisely because that's where the writer/director stopped having anymore ideas. As the creature stalks our heroine hither and yon, the protagonists make no headway on solving the mystery or getting themselves out of the accursed jam. The filmmaker peppers the movie with anachronism, technology out-of-time: black-and-white picture-tube televisions share the same space as a digital e-reader shaped like a makeup compact. When questioned why this was the case, the director said he was trying to confuse the audience and create a \"timeless\" movie. Hey, idiot! That's not what \"timeless\" means! Additional groans can be garnered from attempts at poetry and metaphor, and artsy shots that serve no purpose to the story. There's nothing more tedious than posers trying to give their best impression of \"meaningful.\" Stick with the scary formula and make a straightforward horror movie with an ending. \"It Follows\" might have reinvigorated the genre. As it happens, It Sucks.",

By being a 2015 horror movie that is ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD. This is a quiet movie, with periods of intense swelling of suspense. Don't expect a high-octane chase film. This creature walks. But it doesn't stop. The tone of the movie mimics the relentless nature of the creature. This movie really pays homage to the horror films of the 80's, the most overt of these elements being the electro-sounding soundtrack.As a film nerd, I had a field day with some of the BEAUTIFUL shots and camerawork in this movie. The cinematography was so elegant in a very cinematic way, with stunning wide shots littered throughout the movie. The acting was also really surprisingly good, particularly the protagonist, played by certified 'Scream Queen' Maika Monroe. Overall, this movie is a relentless suspense ride, made with meticulous care to direction and cinematography that plays with the genre whilst also tributing it.",

    "review": "  I'm not a fan of horror movies. That's not the genres fault, but rather the fault of the people making them, as it seems to attract nothing but amateur talent with nothing substantial to offer. They're usually poorly acted, poorly written, and rely on either an excessive amount of gore, or lots of cheap jump-scares. This is the land of found-footage, human centipedes and recycled storylines.Then along comes \"It Follows\" which bucks all of these trends - to terrifying effect.I'm not easily frightened. The last (and probably only) film to genuinely creep me out was Banshee Chapter, thanks to its effective combination of number stations and \"never show the monster for more than a fraction of a second\" scares - but they couldn't sustain that for the whole movie. That said, it left a lasting impression.It Follows left a lasting impression for different reasons. I'm not scarred by it (although my other half appears to be irreparably altered forever, and still hasn't recovered), but I do have enormous respect for everything about it.The entire film has a dream-like quality about it. There's some purposefully slow and muted pacing which lulls you into a fairly comfortable place, but then perverts this with odd anachronisms and settings. You never quite know what era the film is set in. There are 60's era TV sets, 70's fashion cues, and e-readers made to look like clamshell make-up mirrors. None of this makes sense or goes together, and the effect is that of slight un-ease.The setting, similarly, is unusual - with suburban ghost towns of Detroit being used to great effect to make you feel both familiarity and isolation at the same time. All of this gives the entire film a slightly \"other-worldly\" feel, like you're observing a dream.It makes sense then, that the premise of the \"monster\" in this movie is something straight out of common nightmare tropes, and that something so very basic and vague is made so effective.You are constantly pursued by a figure. They always move at walking pace. They always movie in a straight line towards you. There is only one of them. They can appear as anyone. Only you (or someone previously afflicted by it) can see them. They can't move through walls, but they can kick down doors and smash windows, and hurt anyone that gets in the way. The only way to get rid of them is to pass the curse on to someone else (via sexual intercourse), at which point the figure starts following them instead. When the figure catches up with whoever is currently \"it\", it kills them violently. It then begins to pursue the previously cursed individual.This brilliantly simple premise is kind of brilliant. You really don't need anything more complicated than this to make something scary - just a person only you can see, constantly and relentlessly walking towards you, like your own personal zombie.There is some excellent camera work in this movie. The director doesn't appear to put a single foot wrong throughout, and we get treated to some truly special shots that say massive amounts without the need for dialogue. A particular favourite of mine is one segment where the camera is consistently rotating in one direction on a point, completing a number of full rotations. In this single continuous shot, it captures not only the actions of the main characters, but also the unseen persuer (always moving directly towards the camera throughout the film) like a very tense game of \"What's the time Mr Wolf\". Brilliant stuff!This film will probably give most people nightmares, but if you're into that sort of thing (or you can handle it), this movie is a real treat, and should be given the benefit of the doubt.",

Horror is often (rightly) accused of being simply a moral tale, a thinly veiled threat about the dangers of alcohol, sexual curiosity, or disobedience; It Follows makes such a blatant, in-your-face allegory of STDs that it might very well have been a juiced up after-school special. Avoid unless it is free. Even then, be sure you can't think of anything else to do first.",

    "review": "  This movie was truly astonishing. \"It Follows\" managed to create an entirely original idea (at least in film) and make it scare the shit out of you. The \"It\" is something we never quite understand, as the audience. \"It\" is a primal force, that can take the shape of any person- and it is after you, if you've got the \"disease\" it wants. That \"disease\" is passed through sex- so yes, the entire film is based on the concept that sex can kill, which, although a little childish, works extremely well here. Writer/director David Robert Mitchell brilliantly cast every cast member as a young-looking teen. It feels real- there's no summer camp, field trip, haunted house mumbo jumbo- it's just plain terror because, as far as anyone can tell, there's no way to stop this thing. \"It\" keeps coming, and coming, and coming, regardless of how far you run. It is quite easily my favorite horror movie in recent memory and, I think, it will go down as one of the best of this generation.",

    "review": "  It Follows tells the story of a teenage girl, Jay (portrayed by Maika Monroe), who is constantly being stalked by an \"it\" that only she can see. No one necessarily knows what exactly \"it\" is, but we do know that it has the capability to change it's appearance at will to affect its victim in the way that it sees fit. My best guess as to what \"it\" is, is a paranormal entity that is similar to the horror movie icon Pennywise the Dancing Clown from Stephen King's \"IT;\" Something that is able to take the shape of different things. The only difference in It Follows is that the \"it\" can only take the form of a human. Is it a coincidence that the \"it\" is similar to Pennywise? I'll leave that for you to judge. Getting back to the actual plot, you might be wondering how this \"it\" came to follow Jay?? The answer is rather obvious...she had sex, of course! The one single action that is guaranteed to give a character a death wish in horror movies stays consistent in this movie! Over the course of the movie, the audience discovers that the only way make \"it\" stop following you is to have sex with another person and pass it along. Jay's friends join in and try to help her get rid of \"it\" and in turn, we have the movie. I'm not going to lie; you are either going love or hate It Follows. My good friend Derek Boyer, hated the movie, but I absolutely LOVED it. Pretty much every aspect of this movie was brilliant. The direction by David Robert Mitchell was solid, the acting performance by Monroe was convincing and powerful, and the score by Rich Vreeland was utter perfection. I haven't heard a more eerie score since Insidious came out in 2010 and that is saying something.One of the aspects that worked so well for this movie is that the idea Mitchell had was so simple. His goal was have something slowly stalk a character for about an hour and a half and gradually build tension through different camera angles and a bone chilling score. Mitchell accomplished his goal because the finished product freaked me the hell out. Please note, I said that this movie \"freaked me the hell out.\" I did not say this movie \"scary.\" It Follows does not contain anything that will make you jump or cause you to have nightmares. Instead, \"It Follows\" will make you check your surroundings after you watch it and see if anyone is following you. It creates a great sense of unease amongst the audience and is seriously eerie. If you have seen the 1978 movie Halloween, some of the shots and scenes will look oddly familiar to that movie. Mitchell took some of the elements that John Carpenter used in his masterpiece and adapted them to his vision. Some will not appreciate that but I thought it worked well. He never really straight up copied the Halloween but it did get close in a specific scene.Even though there were an abundance of positives, this movie did still have its problems. The performances given by Jay's friends were subpar at best. None of them stood out so I won't list their names because they are pretty irrelevant. Too often, they were just there, doing nothing. The movie also does not answer all of the questions the film proposes. I enjoy movies that make you think and allow you to come to your own conclusions but sometimes as an audience we need more answers. How did this curse start? What happens when it gets ahold of you? Things I'd love to know. The ending of this movie was clever in my mind but many will not like it. After you all watch, I'd love to hear what you guys think. Let me know down below in the comments.The only thing I will say is too often horror movies are ruined by sequels and there is absolutely no way an It Follows 2 could be made. Thank the Lord. All in all, It Follows is a fantastically directed and beautifully presented horror movie that never tried to outdo itself. The plot was simple, yet effective, and will have the viewers constantly checking to see if anything is slowly creeping along beside them.",

Thus, it relies on the chilling and creepy atmosphere that will scare you whenever IT is around.The plus factor of this movie is the 80's take of it, I love 80's Retro movies. Then the cinematography was spectacular and with mix of it's music scoring made the movie creepier. And, the factor where they make you use your (audience) head and imagination during the course of the film.BOTTOM LINE:Some people may like this or may not like this.

    "review": "  It Follows, independent american horror film starring Maika Monroe (The Guest). Well, you may find this ridiculous, but yeah, it's about a, STD, Sexually Transmitted DEMON! Yes you heard it, but hear me out and give this movie a chance. So basically, this movie is about a demon that follows someone and then kill them unless they pass it to someone else by means of, yeah, sex. I find it ridiculous and funny that sex is the thing that you have to do to pass it, but what I love about this movie is the uniqueness it has among other horror films that follows a cliche pattern. This movie doesn't have a lot of jump scares. It relies so much on its content to frighten you. I mean, I got scared by just waiting. Like, where is the demon already? Is it near? Did it kill the person I passed it on to? That thing and that thing alone makes it scary. That's what it makes it so unique and creative. I also love the establishment of characters here. This would be a little bit of a spoiler to you guys so consider yourself warned. So Paul (played by Keir Gilchrist) has a feeling or desire towards Jay (Monroe). You can see it in his eyes at the first part of the film. Clearly he loves, Jay. And he sees the opportunity to get her when Jay got the demon. I love the paradoxes here. Look, Paul loves Jay and wants to make love with her with or without the demon (but of course if Jay has the demon then it would be a great excuse to have sex with her right?) and wants to have sex with her so as to help her pass the demon to him instead, but you can also see there the desire that he really wants it without the demon. Now Jay on the other hand doesn't want to have sex with Paul because they were friends and having sex with him will just cause trouble. I love that establishment and that subplot never overshadowed the whole point of the movie, which is HORROR. It still revolves around the story that you are being followed even though there is a love story sub plot (They didn't focus too much on the sub plot that's why). It Follows is definitely a great movie experience because it is something new, well, I still find it ridiculous to transmit demons through sex that's why I lower my rating to 3 & 1/2 stars but yeah. Great movie, so unique, great horror experience!",

It's got deep themes, great cinematography, intelligent updates on classic tropes, and spooky and unsettling -- if understated -- horror imagery. With a nostalgic 80s vibe helped by a soundtrack to rival The Guest's, one can't help but recall some great movies of that period. Aside from some baffling moments of ambiguity and a somewhat inconsistent mythology, this unforgettable chiller makes one hungry for more films in the genre with this kind of narrative and technical skill.",

Instead of elevating its very original conceit to something truly terrifying and poignant, it instead lost its focus for two thirds of the movie, devolving into lame dialogue and cheap thrills.

The main character has a lot of scenes where she is clearly distressed and her acting doesn't feel uneven like how it could in horror films. I did enjoy it, its an understated film that doesn't rely on any jump scares to creep you out and it obviously leaves the film open for a sequel, but please don't outstay your welcome, we don't want another Saw or Paranormal Activity franchise...",

    "review": "  I'm not a big fan of the horror genre, but I do listen to buzz around film. In this case, the buzz around \"It Follows\" is earned. It's a \"smart\" independent horror movie all the way through. And it does a nice job of keeping the cheap gore and jump scenes to a minimum so that the \"horror\" can be developed based on a simple premise: something frightening is after you and it won't give up. Ever. This is one of those movies that fans of horror movies may not enjoy, though. I suspect that's why there's such a wide spread between the Critics and the Fans: currently 96% to 65%.",

    "review": "  In horror movies, it stinks to be young. Our minds and our bodies are beginning to get adjusted to so many scary and then you have to deal with some fool with a butcher knife or a ghost with a 200 year-old axe to grind. It's hard to grow up, but it's even harder when it comes in the form of outward forces that we can't explain - we get enough of that from the natural world. Kids in horror movies have gotten a raw deal ever since that chainsaw business back in the early 70s, and we find that the best of the genre seems to lean on this idea.David Robert Mitchell's oddly titled new horror exercise It Follows is no different. The kids are dumped on from beginning to end, but the difference is that there's a method to all the madness. They aren't just pawns, they are actual human beings forced to deal with the unexplainable. Mitchell's genius is that he creates a dark mood and tone, and the feeling that something is around every corner and emerges from a place no one can quite explain. He's a born filmmaker whose efforts here got him noticed - the film was widely praised at the Cannes film festival last year, and I'm happy to say, it was earned. Unlike most films in this genre that feel like fish food hammered together based on whatever seems popular at the moment, this is a movie that was put together with care - somebody wanted to make this movie.It Follows is built on a premise that is almost fatally ridiculous but you don't mind so much because the movie is put together with breathtakingly ambitious filmmaking that evokes a sense of fear and terror even when nothing is happening. It takes it's horror from the simple but unsettling notion that even when all is peaceful and calm, someone is watching.It Follows is a movie that might have found good company back in the 70s and 80s when filmmakers - newly free from the strangulation of the production code - were not only able to experiment with new kinds of explicit content but with mood and tone and a sense of dread. That was the age of Last House on the Left, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Exorcist, Carrie, Halloween, The Shining and Poltergeist. We are reminded of the spirit of those films because it builds it's supernatural terror from a foundation of reality.The movie opens in a quiet suburban neighborhood with the camera planted in the middle of the street. The camera swivels around to a middle-class cracker box house from which emerges a young girl who is obviously scared out of her mind - something is chasing her. In a few short moments, she gets in her car and drives away. At a shallow spot in road, she calls her father to tell him goodbye and the next morning - well, you can guess.Our focus shifts to a different girl - broody young Jay Height (Maika Monroe), a pretty blonde with gangly limbs whose 20 year-old youth ebbs somewhere between the end of budding teen years and the beginnings of the mysteries of her own sexuality. There's nothing typical about her. She's got a lot on her mind, and we can see in her eyes that something is going on - perhaps the terror that the kid years are ending and the real world expectations are about to begin. That's the least of her worries, especially when she accepts a date with sort-of hunky Hugh (Jake Weary), a good-looking but dorky kid who tries and fails to hide jangled nerves - he takes her to a movie but bolts when he thinks he sees someone staring at him.Spoilers Ahead!Hugh's eccentricity is not enough to keep Jay from accepting a second date so they go out for a drink before she (consensually) surrenders her virtue in the back of his car. What she doesn't know is that Jay is cursed, and has passed the curse on to our heroine. That's right - the curse is sexually transmitted. But! But! But! Just wait! Before you shut down this review in a fit of jaded cynicism hear me out. What happens to Jay is not based on plot but on blistering paranoia. She sees entities, dead people who approach her at a walking pace and never seem to stop. They come in through windows, across fields, down the beach, from everywhere, at any time, at any place. Worse is that sometimes they don't come at all. At times she sees several dead people, at times she sees nothing. She never knows where they will come from or in which form they will take.What makes It Follows so special is that director David Robert Mitchell has deep-fried his movie in an almost crushing atmosphere of dread. Every frame of this movie is steeped in dark tones, bare-bulb lighting and an electronic score that seems to be piped in from Mars. He has so much confidence in his tone that he hovers on long scenes of fields and parking lots and windows. We expect to see something emerge. Sometimes it does, many times it does not.This is a beautifully shot, but unsettling movie to experience. Mitchell lingers on long shots, of grassy fields, parking lots, dirty houses, and long corridors. We remember little details like tin cans, a beach chair, a telephone, a blade of grass. The movie's production design is not slick but made up of filthy rooms, dingy corridors and open spaces. Much of the movie is seen through Jays eyes, and we feel her terror. Young Maika Monroe - an actress that I am unfamiliar with - gives a wonderful performance as a young woman whose problems of youth are doubled by the terror she experience from the curse. She has an expressive face with eyes that reveal feelings that she doesn't express in words.In many ways, It Follows reminds me of the early films of Wes Craven (particularly the first Elm Street), only this film isn't quite as plotted as Craven's work. Much of what happens once the curse is set in motion is left to the filmmaking, not the writing. Much of Jay's journey is helped along by her high school friends who take her at her word that something wicked this way comes. Mitchell keeps the viewer at arm's length and seems unwilling to hold our hand. We don't get inside Jay's head but we feel more like we're standing next to her. We're in the room with her and her friends as they hear noises outside. The friends are not standard movie types, but specific individuals who seem to exist in Jay's hemisphere as classmates who are on the verge of moving on with their post-high school lives - this is a movie very much about time and place.The third act does get a little gimmicky as the kids try and confront the curse on a physical level. That part of the movie seems a little hokey. The movie works best when the dread is suggested rather than confronted. Still it ends on a terrifyingly reasonable note suggesting an endless vicious cycle. Life goes on and so, apparently, do the dead.",

    "review": "  Excellent terror / psychological thriller about a curse of a stalker entity that it is spread from one person to another in sexual relations. The photography is gloomy, retro like (60's, 80's) with a color cast that reflects the opressive nature of the plot, with a strange music (synthetiser thriller music, with odd sounds reminescense of old science documentaries) - the few effects are nice, and so the setting (on Detroit) - the actings are good. The movie bases itself of the story, and construct all the rest around it, in a excellent way, leting you thing about many things that happened or that you saw on some scenes. One of the better releases of the genre in the last years, and a cult one to me. 8,4 / 10,0",

    "review": "  Basic: It Follows is a supernatural teen indie horror film. Set in the 1980s, around autumn, a 19 year-old girl name Jay (played by Maika Monroe) dates a man, who's in the same age like her. One moment in the film, we see these two characters having sex in a car, and then this person that she's dating, drugged her. Later, she wakes up, sees herself tied up in a wheelchair, and the person, who was dating her and drugged her, tries to tell her that he passed over this kind of curse to her when they were having sex in the car, and now it's going to hunt her down, and kill her. The kind of curse that's upon to Maika's character, Jay, is a mysterious figure that can disguise to anyone she knows or a stranger in a crowd. Now, all of her friends (Keir Gilchirst, Olivia Luccardi, and Daniel Zovatto), and her sister, Kelly, (played by Lili Sepe) are not only going to protect Jay, but also getting rid of this mysterious figure that's hunting her down. All of these actors or actresses may not be familiar to you, but I do remember Keir Gilchirst in \"It's kind of a funny story\" and Maika Monroe in \"The Guest\". Plus, she's also going to be in The 5th Wave, and Independence Day: Resurgence.What's the deal: Well, to be quite honest, I really like this film, and not only that it is one of the greatest horrors film that I've ever seen (even though I haven't yet saw The Babadook), but it's also one of those movies that I would rank it on my Top 5 best films in 2015. Everything about this movie just left me so effective. Now before I begin my reasons to why I really like this movie, I would to explain all the similarities and the influences in this movie because there's so much to talk about it.The storyline to It Follows is kind of like \"Drag me to Hell\". The fact, that the main character is a female, and she has this curse, of where these demons or monsters from hell, are trying to take her to hell, except in It Follows, it really doesn't have any demons or monsters from hell, that want to take her to hell. All we have in It Follows is a mysterious figure, who's trying to hunt this main character down, and kill her. But the one movie that this movie refers back to the most is John Carpenter's Halloween, mostly because of its setting, its visuals, its camerawork, and its music. The biggest setting in It Follows is the neighborhood. The music goes completely pumped up, when something scary is about to happen, which Halloween certainly does that. There's also a shot in It Follows of where Maika's character, Jay is walking with her sister, Kelly at the neighborhood, which it has this similar shot in Halloween of where Jamie Lee Curtis is walking with her friends around the neighborhood. Plus, there are a couple moments of where it reminded me of Blow-Out. One, for example, of where Jay and Greg (played by Daniel Zovatto) are inside of a public library and the camera swirls around it, when they're in there, just like in Blow-Out of where John Travolta's character is in his recording room, and the camera swirls around it, when he finds out that all of his tapes are erased. So, anyway, the film really does pull out a lot of references to other films, mostly to Halloween but that doesn't mean it's a problem to me. I think, writer-director David Robert Mitchell does it all in the right places, and that's one of the reasons of why I was impressed with the film.To start off with all of my reasons to why I really like the film are the characters. I was really connected with the characters, and I certainly, at times, feel for them. I never at all find them at least campy or silly like the ones in the Final Destination movies. I do see that Jay's sister, Kelly, and all of her friends really do care about Jay; they want to protect her because she's the main character, who's in danger. Of course, there's a character in the film, his name is Paul (played by Keir Gilchrist, who was in \"It's kind of a funny story\", which I already mention that), he's friends with Kelly, and he also works with her in an Ice Cream shop, but he secretly has a crush on Jay. I actually thought Maika Monroe and Keir Gilchrist look good when they're onscreen together.Another thing that I really like about this film is its camerawork. A lot of the shots have wider angles, and closer angles, but they certainly do make it look scary, while they're using it. I was more impressed with it than its eerie, pumped up score. The most memorable and craziest scene in the movie that made me go, \"Wow\" is the one at the beach, and I absolutely don't want to give away that scene because, obviously, it's better for you to watch it than for me to tell you it. The ending of the movie is ambiguous. I like how it ended, and that's all I got to say about it. My full opinion: It Follows has characters that I really do connect with them, lots of camerawork that I was really impressed with, a lot of references to other films that does it in all the right ways, and of course, lots of scariness.-Okay, maybe it's not scary for everybody, and I can totally see why they would say that, but as for me, I find the tension of the film fascination. It has everything I want it for a horror movie to be, and mostly, I was really impressed with this way more than Oculus. 9.3/10",

    "review": "  There seems to be quite a few films recently which hearken back to the late 70's/early 80's in terms of filmmaking style. IT FOLLOWS is one of the films in this mold that capture a certain feeling of nostalgia while also having its foot firmly planted in the present. It's about a vague entity that follows you around after having sex with somebody who also has the same problem. Inasmuch as the Friday THE 13TH series was about abstinence, IT FOLLOWS is in a similar vein, with a heavy dose of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and Wes Craven for good measure. The most outstanding part of this film is the subtle approach taken with the horror, letting it build quietly without using the score to jolt you. There was also great care taken with the direction and cinematography that helped to build an atmosphere of tension and dread. Even without being a horror movie (albeit, more of a psychological one), the cinematography and camera-work was excellent, with precise, deliberate movement, slow pans and zooms, etc. It was quite artful, to say the least. I should also mention the outstanding score by Disasterpeace, which captures a feeling I haven't felt since watching HALLOWEEN. So, at least on the surface, IT FOLLOWS has a lot going for it. However, I do ask a little bit more from movies I watch than to impress me visually and aurally, and apart from these qualities, IT FOLLOWS was quite banal. The acting was decent, although no one really stood out from the rest. The potential in the setup for this \"it\" to be anything or anyone allowed for a few good sequences, but it also meant that the narratively was a little too linear for my tastes. It boils down to have sex, wait, and run. And for a 100 minute film, I expected more. There wasn't even an underlying emotional subtext like was in THE BABADOOK. Still, despite being bored through parts of it, the film does manage to pull together for a decent (and appropriate) finish. I would recommend people to see this, but don't go in expecting something revolutionary. There is a little bit of subtext about abstinence/STDs that can be read into IT FOLLOWS and, courtesy of a CHARADE billboard, possibly some meta-commentary on artificiality. However, IT FOLLOWS works perfectly fine as a stylistic exercise that aspires to little more than imitating its cinematic forebears, and does an admittedly good job at it.",

Its a good horror to watch if your don't like being frightened with horror movie scare tactics, as they are kept to a minimum. Terror is instead made up for in excellent plot and cinematography.

I've read that there may be a squeal in the works so it may have been sitting itself up for that. Nice too see a more progressive film of this genre.

The score is very impressive, really bringing out the sheer 'eighty-ness' of the film. I found most of the film to be quite engaging. But, however, there is a scene during the middle that really pulled me out of it. I felt the film delved into your run-of-the-mill paranormal shenanigans with that scene. The movie was still intriguing, as I wanted to see how the problem would be solved (and I have to give it credit for that), but it was no longer frightening. Most of the ambiguity had been removed, thus the climax wasn't as tense as it should have been.",

If you watch it straight up then it doesn't make much sense since the monster moves really slow (it follows) and while that gives it some creepy moments it's a bit hard to carry a whole film on that premise. So 1-1/2 stars for me on that. If, however, you look at it as an existential film ala Bunuel's The Exterminating Angel, then it becomes a film about life, death and our response to inevitable mortality - keep moving! In that respect it earns 3 stars, maybe 3-1/2. So, it is only so-so as a horror film but is quite good as an existential film about life, sex, and death. IMHO",

    "review": "  It Follows. The perfect title to understand this brilliant horror flick - two words that sum up all the great tense moments of this film with a clear explanation.The premise - this supernatural figure follows you. There is only one of it, it only walks and never runs, and it will kill you. It can look like anybody and only people who have \"had it\" can see it. Why does it follow? If somebody who \"has it\" has sex with you, they pass it on (a likely metaphor for STD's) and you become the new target.It may sound really simple, but that is the beauty of it. It follows you wherever you go, but it has a slow pace, not unlike a zombie. It follows you in a straight path and kills you if it has the chance to get close to you. What is creepier than basically being stalked and having no idea when your stalker will get to you?What helps induce horror in the audience is the techno, heavy-bass style music not unlike the music in horror classic Halloween by John Carpenter. It really sets the tone for the film, and has an eerie feel to it, which keeps reminding you that there is something wrong and disturbing with this world.Trust issues are a heavy theme in this film and understandably so. The main character \"gets it\" from a guy she goes on a few dates with, but he explains the situation to her in order to warn her and help get her out of the situation. Guys she knows want to protect her and take \"it\" away from her, but she is hesitant on letting certain people have it, especially her good friend Paul. On a couple occasions, however, characters attempt to pass it on to complete strangers - they would have no regrets if strangers die because of them. The idea of sexuality can, and should be discussed in great detail when analyzing this film.Is it a perfect film? No. I believe it is very difficult to make a \"perfect\" horror movie, but this one keeps you on the edge of your seat while simultaneously making you question the idea of sex, making for a great, layered horror movie.",

    "review": "  This movie was a fail for me. Recently, Quentin T. praised the creator of this movie for the concept yet criticized him for failing to \"take it there\" and I would sadly have to agree. I thought the concept was awesome; that's why I was so eager to see it. However, the execution was just.not.there. There are no excuses even with it being a low budget horror flick. John Carpenter Halloween. I feel as though issues like this start with the writing. First off, on a basic level I didn't give a f about any of the characters. Wrong note to start off any story and not spend at least a brief amount of time developing the characters well enough for the audience to be invested. Second, the \"supernatural entity\" just wasn't relentless enough for me. I'm not even talking about kills here, or even necessarily explaining what it thing is (sometimes mystery is good, leave it to the imagination), it's just about creating tension and having an element of shock value to keep people on their seats. That wasn't there for me at ALL, as I spent most of the movie more interested in what was going on on Instagram. Maybe it would have been better had I seen it on the big screen or alone in the dark. At any rate, this one goes down as a \"Cabin In the Woods\" for me, a movie critics and horror fans love for the sake of getting something \"different\", but the substance is lacking and the scares were almost non-existent. For example (slight spoiler), there was a most ridiculous part in the beginning when the main character first deals with her curse in the classroom and she sees some geriatric old person in a hospital gown coming for her; she runs into the hallway and is terrified, but me I'm like really? You silly girl, you can easily just knock grandma out lol...I get what they were going for (vision - Exorcist 3), but the set up was all wrong. If this entity can take on whatever form it wishes to, why wouldn't it at least start off as something more intimidating to make her fear more believable? Overall, GREAT concept along the lines of a movie like Fallen, good camera shots and use of atmosphere, but subpar story and execution.",

An allegory about STDs (in part), the story follows a young girl who, after having sex with her boyfriend, is stalked by a mysterious shapeshifting creature that can only be seen by those who've had sex with an infected person, and it can only be escaped from (for a time) by passing on the infection to another person through sex. Maika Monroe gives a strong performance that's nuanced and really shows her struggle to come to grips with her situation. However, the director makes some odd choices in creating a setting, as it comes off as a strange alternative reality with a mixture of futuristic and retro fashions and technologies (which is quite distracting). Additionally, the creature effects are rather grotesque; with the creature often appearing mangled and in various stages of nudity. A problematic film, It Follows delivers some effective scares, but the who and the what are so vague that the story ends up being rather unsatisfying.",

    "review": "  Understated and intelligent, \"It Follows\" offers a haunting portrait of true psychological terror. A teenage girl becomes the recipient of a deadly curse that she and her friends must try to escape before it claims another victim. Writer-director David Robert Mitchell creates an unrelenting sense of dread and paranoia through cinematography and sound. Slowly and methodically, the camera stalks its adolescent targets, while the synth soundtrack strategically pulses at all the right moments. While mostly unsettling, \"It Follows\" also has its slyly comic, self-aware moments. Mitchell employs a fine brigade of young actors to inhabit his eerie suburban wasteland. Reigning queen of indie horror Maika Monroe (\"The Guest\") is once again a standout, conveying a palpable sense of trauma and fear. Like the best horror, 'It Follows\" is a metaphorically rich fable where the symbolism takes on multiple meanings. At its most literal, the film serves as a twisted sex-ed class, but Mitchell's shape-shifting harbinger of doom more subtly represents the inevitable extinction of youth and impending mortality. Death, inescapable and universal, is the one foe that cannot be defeated - the one fear that, at one point or another, shakes us all to the core.",

The only way to pass it on is to have sex with someone, but if they die It will come back after you. The premise is very interesting and the way it all plays out is fun to watch. There are plenty of tense moments but because the It can only walk, there are times where the fear fades because you know the person can easily escape. There are very few dull moments and the music is very creepy and creates a great horror atmosphere. I was never really scared watching this movie which was kind of a let down because the goal in these movies is to freak out the viewer.

    "review": "  In 1978 John Carpenter's Halloween launched the \"Slasher Film\" sub-genre. While technically not the first film of it's kind, it was definitely the first breakout hit and it's simple formula has been shamelessly copied by ... I'll say hundreds of films at this point, some better than others. This formula has single handedly launched at least a dozen entire HORROR FILM FRANCHISES, most of which have been remade in the last 10 years. And the baffling part of all of this is: none of these subsequent films have ever figured out what made Carpenter's original Halloween scary. The copy-cat slashers that followed all zeroed in on the following elements; teen sex, violence, and the general plot involving a masked killer stalking a group of teens. Obviously all those are key ingredients in Halloween, but that's not why it works. It works because of it's ability to create tension. How does it do this? Because it is patient. It takes it's time. In Michael Myers, Carpenter created a mindless shape of evil that is rarely seen, but who's presence is felt in every moment. This presence haunts and follows Jamie-Lee Curtis's Laurie Stode, without explanation. (Yes I am choosing to ignore their brother-sister backstory that was revealed in Part II after Carpenter admitted he ran out of ideas while trying to write a sequel he never intended.) These elements of tone and atmosphere where really what made Halloween so fresh and terrifying and it's fascinating how in all the films that followed these elements were basically dropped completely in favor of nudity and gore. It's understandable though. Nudity and gore are easy. Finding a filmmaker that understands and has the ability to successfully create and sustain tension throughout an entire film, well that's rare. This is why It Follows is so special. This is a film that boils down every slasher film to it's core elements and then doubles down on all the elements that used to make slasher films work, but have been forgotten and buried under piles of cheap knock-offs and the uninspired garbage that springs to mind when you think of any contemporary horror film. This film is pure, sweet terror, and if rubbed upon one's gums will give the satisfying pleasure that only comes along once in a very great while, and that is, a truly GREAT HORROR FILM.",

    "review": "  I don't understand the 96% critics rating. Maybe there's something here that I'm not getting. Maybe I'll rewatch it one night when it's dark. I didn't think it was particularly scary, though there was a somewhat permeating sense of dread throughout the film. I'm not happy that it's a sexually transmitted disease type thing. It feels very \"punished for sex\" trope, and I was over that so long ago.The thing following them wasn't fleshed out enough. The director and writers didn't capitalize on the potential it head. It was sort of half-fleshed out, which is frustrating. Either they should have explained nothing, never let it catch up to her so you're not sure if she's really experiencing something or just just going insane or they should have gone ham with it trying to kill her. As it was, it felt half-assed and half-finished.",

    "review": "  Where to start with this one. First of all, the acting was just plain bad. There's cliche lines throughout the entire movie. Not much to say about this, but if you don't like movies with bad actors, I wouldn't recommend this one. Extremely unrealistic scenes where teenagers say things that they would most likely never say. It's just like every other horror movie, they try to have \"deep\" scenes where characters bond or comfort eachother, but they end up being super cheesy and just stupid. Honestly, there's just not one good actor that appears in this film.  Terribly written storyline as well. It mentions the main character, Jay's, parents multiple times throughout the film, but we never see them other than in pictures. Even when a window breaks in her kitchen, or when everyone is freaking out and screaming, or when their own daughter was in the hospital, there are no parents to question what is going on or to comfort her/them. This goes with almost everyone else's parents as well, not that it's a huge deal, but it was a flaw in the storyline. They also explain that you must pass it on through sexual intercourse (no explanation as to why, or what it the entire thing is even about) and Jay has sex with \"Hugh,\" real name Jeff, and it still goes after him. Why? We don't know, it just does. As stated before, we don't know what the thing even is. We get no background of it, where it started, why it started or anything. Which could leave some of the audience rather confused at times. The final verdict is, I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you want to see something you can make fun of. I give it a decent 1/5. They are also supposedly working on a sequel, and considering that this just came out this year, and they're already working on the next one, it most likely won't be any better.",

Every now and then however, a little independent gem makes it's way into a few theatres and then becomes a loved hit on DVD. \"It Follows\" fits the ladder half of that description, being one of the creepiest pictures I have had the pleasure of viewing in a very, very long time. Make Monroe leads this film, and wow does she ever deliver a raw and true performance. She really makes the audience believe that things like this actually could happen \"in someones mind.\" From the work of art that is the cinematography, to the amazingly eerie score that sent chills down my spine in almost every scene, \"It Follows\" has the rare suspense that you just cannot find in horror films today. I was genuinely creeped out during the broad daylight sequences, and that is saying something. Overall, the film could have been pure perfection if it wasn't for the open ending that I think was great, but left a little too much to be desired. In the end, \"It Follows\" is one of the best recent horror flicks you can find on the shelves today. Definitely recommend, especially to fans of the genre.",

And when the dead victims, ghosts, cursed, w/e, appeared, it was nowhere near as effective as how M. Night Shyamalan pulled it off in The Sixth Sense.

    "review": "  \"It could look like someone you know or it could be a stranger in a crowd. Whatever helps it get close to you.\"Over the past few years the horror genre has been plagued with complete bullshit (a fucking board game?!) That said there are some wonderful gems that still do the genre justice. A genre which once thrived on getting inside the audience's head through psychological horror via tension, apprehension, atmosphere, suspense and our fear of the unknown seems all but forgotten now. These days the genre gets most it's scares out of the over use of jump scares which startle for a brief second but don't genuinely terrify. Not all jump scares are a bad thing however. Some can be truly effective beyond the initial \"jump in your seat moment.\" It is the \"false\" jump scare that is the problem. There's a difference between a jump scare of a lamp crashing or [insert loud noise here] and a jump scare where the \"antagonist\" shows his face through a hole in the door. One of those is inconsequential to the story at large while the other has a purpose beyond just making you jump (I trust you can figure out which example applies to which scare. If not I have some bad news for you...) Another problem with horror is the audience itself. They've forgotten what real horror really is. If someone ever asks me \"was it scary?\" I'm hesitant to answer because by today's standards \"scary\" for the most part means \"did I jump in my seat?\" To me and many fans more well versed in the genre than myself, that is not what horror is about. Or at the very least it is a very small part of it. Having said all this, is \"It Follows\" the type of film the horror genre has been sorely missing these past few years? Or is it just another jump scare fest to be piled on top of all the other bullshit?Story\"It Follows\", directed by David Robert Mitchell, stars Maika Monroe (most recently seen in \"The Guest\") as a teenager named Jay living in the suburbs of Detroit. Jay is your typical well-to-do teenager. She goes to school, she hangs out with her friends, she goes on dates. One day she goes on a date with this guy she's been dating a few times but doesn't really know all that well. This night they decide they are finally going to have sex. After a series of events which I won't spoil here, Jay is told by her date that this \"thing\" (from now on I'll refer to it as an entity) has been following him for quite some time and he has now passed the curse on to her (via sex) and the entity is going to start following her and that if it gets to her it will kill her. It can look like someone you know or it can be a stranger you have never seen before. It does what it has to do to get to you. The only way to get rid of it is to \"pass it on\" to someone else. Eg, have sex. He continues that there are ways to buy yourself time. It only walks so you can drive far away and buy yourself a few days before you have to keep moving again. The entity also only goes after one victim at a time and only those that are affected can see it (which begs the question who is real and who is the entity?). He concludes that it is slow, but it isn't dumb and that no matter where you are it will always know and it will always follow.ActingI think it's rare in horror films these days (for me anyway) to really care about the characters. They are either doing something stupid or out of character in general or they just aren't that interesting. Therefore I don't really care what happens to them. Sometimes the actors just suck at acting or they are given poor direction. For the most part I thought the acting in It Follows was really good. Maybe not the best, but better than most in the genre today. Maika Monroe in particular gave a wonderful and most importantly believable performance that was easy to accept. While the film does a good job on it's own of helping you buy into this world, Maika's acting really helps sell it. When she is supposed to be frightened you genuinely feel frightened. When she asks her friends if she is crazy you know she isn't, but at the same time based on the way she is acting you might think she was crazy. She plays a terrified character really well, but she also does a good job of showing bravery at times in regards to what she's going through. She's no Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween, but I honestly think if Maika Monroe decides to persue the genre we could have another future \"scream queen\" on our hands later down the road. Along with the character of Jay we have her sister Kelly (Lili Sepe) and their friends Paul (Keir Gilchrest) and Yara (Olivia Lucardi). While I didn't think these actors and actresses did quite as well as Maika, I do think they did a good and servicable job. It's saying something that I didn't really hate any of them. They just didn't seem to feel all that important. I will say I really did like the sisterly bond between Kelly and Jay. It was believable. Kelly loves her sister and worries for her, but at the same time she is kind of jealous. It feels real and genuine. Paul is a childhood friend of Jay and Kelly who has had a crush on Jay for awhile now. He comes off as a bit meek and a bit of a push over at times, but he does show a sense of bravery later on and he is just trying to protect his friends. Yara is obsessed with this palm reader thing and just spouts off various sayings that happen to tie into what is happening around them. She isn't a bad character, there just isn't much character there. I don't fault the actress for that though. On the contrary I do think she did a good job with what she was given. There are one or two other pivotal characters, but I don't want to spoil anything. Overall I think the acting was really good. And when it wasn't I really couldn't fault the actors themselves. If anything I give them credit for being likeable characters who you do care about. That goes a long way in any film. CinematographyThis film looks great. From the very first opening shot which pans a full 360 degrees, within the first minute of the film, I was hooked. This 360 degree style of filming comes up a few more times in the film and it is used to great effect. This film also relishes in wide, open shots which slowly pull in center frame. There is a scene in this film, and one of my favorites, where it is just a car in an abandoned lot with a desolate buidling off to the right and the camera ever so slowly zooms in center frame. I absolutely loved it. It is a fairly simple scene and not much happens in it, but the way it is shot with the wide angles just feels ominous. The director really has a way of heightening the suspense just from how much scope of the shot you get to see. I find that for the most part as an audience our center of attention on the screen is, well, the center. It is because of this that we might miss some other elements in the background. The film also uses focus and lack thereof to mess with the audience. Sometimes the camera will focus on what's in front of you while the background is out of focus and you miss what is happening in the background until it is too late. Because there are these wide shots and out of focus shots it heightens the tension and paranoia. It is that sense of paranoia that really compliments the camera work and vice versa.SoundIn my personal opinion the use of sound and music can make or break a film. Most notably a horror film. Try to picture some of the most well known or best horror films without those iconic sounds or musical scores. \"Halloween\" without John Carpenter's theme? I think not. It might still be a little terrifying, but for the most part it would lose a huge amount of that sense of terror. It Follows knows how to use sound and when not to. This film does have one or two loud jump scares but they are there for a reason and they are effective at what they set out to do. The sound doesn't just scare you for a second and then ends, it lingers with you and drives that sense of dread. This is where the score/soundtrack shines. Ever since \"Drive\" came out in 2011, there seems to have been a sort of resurgence of modern day artists/composers adapting a more 80s electronica sound. It Follows's score from Disasterpeace is that same type of 80s electronica, but it does so better than any of it's peers. Most notably however is that this soundtrack takes most of it's influence from John Carpenter's own type of sound. This soundtrack would honestly fit right in with a horror film from the 70s/80s. I find that sometimes filmmakers use soundtracks as backgroud noise. Particularly in horror films. It feels as if it is just there because the film needs music. Occasionally it might spook you a little bit, but beyond that not much else. Going back to the whole problem with horror today thing, the use of sound can also be a film's downfall. In some films these days we are conditioned by the music and it deflates that tension that we had. What I mean by that is say you have a scene where one man is on-screen and then from off-screen a hand places itself on that man's shoulder and then the full character steps into view. In today's typical horror films some kind of musical cue would play at that last moment and tell the audience that this is the killer so they now know what to expect and that tension is gone too early. Or worse than that, the same secenario plays out and it's a false jump scare but the audience thinks he's the killer anyway because they associate that musical cue with the killer. There is a simple scene in this film that wasn't even a jump scare, but made me tense just because of what happened before and it turned out to be nothing. The fact that I still felt tense without hearing anything but footsteps and breathing is testament to the point I'm trying to make. In most of today's horror films, even if it was a false scare there would still be some obnoxious loud cue that would make you jump nonetheless. It Follows doesn't use these tricks. The score and audio compliments and accentuates the suspense and paranoia at all times.ScaresI feel like horror films have to be graded just a little different than films from other genres. You could see an action or drama film, but for the most part you know what you are getting yourself into and you know what to expect. With horror however, you expect to be scared or to feel something. I think it is because of this expectation that horror should be graded a bit different and maybe a bit harsher. At the opposite end of that spectrum I think if a horror film truly accomplishes it's goal (scares) in an effective manner then maybe it could be graded a little more lenient or rather certain minor faults could be slightly overlooked more than films from other genres. As I alluded to earlier, today's horror films have an obsession with jump scares and using them in all the wrong ways. It Follows still has one or two false jump scares, but it also uses jump scares that actually matter and are equally as effective. However, the real reason this film is being regarded as one of the best horror films in years is because of it's use of suspense, tension, atmosphere and the sense of paranoia that goes along with it. This is the stuff true horror is made of. The imagery in this film is disturbing at times to the point where I just tensed up in my seat and felt my pulse increase and mixed with the haunting score it was all the more terrifying. The film takes relatively normal looking people at times but just makes them absolutely disturbing. There is a scene in this film where it is just an old woman walking, but coupled with everything else it is truly terrifying. The paranoia created in this film is unnerving. Too many times during this film I felt like it was playing a demented game of \"Where's Waldo?\". I touched on it earlier, but the wide shots really add to that tension and paranoia. A few times I would see the rustle of a bush and look in that direction of the screen to find nothing. In an earlier scene I was looking to the far right of the screen because I thought I saw or expected to see something when in fact I missed what was center screen. I feel like with a broader scope for the audience to see it adds to that tension and paranoia because you are not sure where exactly to look. You expect something to happen but you're given so much to look at that you might miss something and then what happens next may surprise you. The cinematograpy mixed with the music and sense of dread really plays with the audiences expectations in the best way possible. I have said it before and I will say it again: I really do think that psychological horror is the most effective. It gets in your head and when it is really effective, it can mess with you by not even doing anything. As I mentioned in the beginning only the affected (or infected if you prefer) can see the entity. This adds another layer of tension because despite it exhibiting some fairly obvious mannerisms (the audience might realize, but the characters won't), from far away you can't be sure whether that person coming up behind Jay is real or not. That is the type of horror that makes It Follows so great.Negatives/ConsAt the risk of being biased I will say the film wasn't perfect (no film is.) While it has an inventive and clever climax, I do feel the final \"confrontation\" was a little bit of a let down. It was an interesting way of doing things and still enjoyable, but I guess for a final act I was expecting something different and a little more. Also every now and then I felt like some characters were underutilized or not as fleshed out as they could have been. Other than that I really can't find too many faults with this one.Miscellaneous ThoughtsI feel I have to mention how \"timeless\" this movie felt. I don't mean that in a \"lasting\" type of way so much as I mean literally. There were things that happened in this film that made it feel almost dream-like. Too many times during this movie I kept asking myself what decade is this set in. The television is a small box and plays old sci-fi films in black and white, but the police cars are more modern. The refrigerator is older and bulkier, but the girl has a slightly futuristic touch screen phone/palm reader thing. The theater they go to looks older and more retro, but the city and suburbs feel more modern. It felt really disorienting at the time, but not to the point that it was a distraction or a hindrance. It was actually a really neat touch that gave the film a unique feel. The director has gone on to say that it was intentional and supposed to make it all feel dream-like. Also, I wasn't sure how to fit it into a category, but the pacing of the film is perfect. It is not slow, but it's not break-neck fast either. When there are moments of down time it is still interesting and you are never really bored. The tension slowly builds, but once it does it never lets go. You are always engaged with what is going on with these characters. Finally, it is worth mentioning that I love how the film takes a timeless horror trope (you have sex, you die) and makes it lead to literal death. It's another example of taking something proven to work and making it fit in a way that feels fresh again. Overall, I loved this film. On paper It Follows shouldn't work at all. The concept alone sounds incredibly stupid. What it does so well is that it borrows elements from other well established entries in the genre and tweaks them just a bit to create something different and original. The story is unique and the premise is rather clever. The acting is great with likeable characters while Maika Monroe delivers a great and believable performance. The cinematography is excellent and really adds to the dread that is being portrayed and the story that is being told. It helps add to the tension that is present throughout the film. The sound in the film is amazing. The score is haunting and loud and piercing but it is that way for a very good reason. It Follows knows how to use jump scares and when to use them effectively. The scares in this film are perfect. They are sometimes subtle and cerebral, but always effective. The tension is unrelenting and the paranoia is almost constant. All of these elements combine to create something wonderful and unique. This film is an homage and love letter to classic horror from the mid 70s and 80s. It takes the best of those films and leaves behind the cliches that other films today rely so heavily on to make you \"scared.\" The film has a few faults, and if you really want to nit pick you might find more, but nothing that really detracts from anything. I don't know if it is true, but I feel like sometimes with horror people go into it trying to be \"macho\" and trying to prove they aren't scared. I think this is sometimes why the genre gets a bad rep at times and I think it defeats the purpose of seeing a film of the genre in the first place. Movies are supposed to be fun and horror is no different. If you go in trying to sabotage that experience then yeah, you might be disappointed. You are supposed to go in and just accept whatever is about to happen with a normal mentality. If you go into this one knowing little and expecting to feel fear and unnerved, if you accept it, you won't be disappointed. It Follows is one of the best horror films in recent memory. It is a breath of fresh air in a genre that for the most part has been kicked around, mocked and left for dead and it is hopefully a sign of things to come. 8 out of 10",

    "review": "  Great horror film. There is so much going on in this film that I don't know where to start. But let's start with the hook. It follows has a novel hook, the most intriguing hook since The Ring. The idea is that there is some kind of demon (for lack of a better word) whose attention is passed on from person to person through sex. A person so infected moves to the front of the queue until he or she finds a partner to pass the curse on to. And apparently if the demon touches the person at the front of the queue, he or she dies, and the demon moves on to the next person.And the demon operates according to some simple rules: it stalks its target by walking towards it slowly, which means that running away is easy. But the follower never stops. And its invisible to everybody but the target(s). The lead is Maika Monroe, who is nearly a ringer for Kids-era Chloe Sevigny. She's a relative unknown, as are the actors who play her circle of friends. This reviewer approves of the use of unknowns in horror films - it's a choice that makes viewers see the characters, not the actors, and makes all of them seem vulnerable. The writing for the young adult characters is superb - they have the right level of emotional maturity, with a mix of loyalty and insecurity that is just right. Monroe as Jay and Keir Gilchrist are particularly strong. I don't fathom some of the criticisms of the plot. Apparently some viewers disliked the slow pacing, which I thought was a good choice because this movie is much more than a monster flick (hint, hint). There are also criticisms of character logic, which I find particularly odd. Each character is working with his or her personal logic, and each makes sense in the choices made. Also: people don't immediately recognize that they are characters in a horror film (unless we're talking about 'Scream'). This film has a lot to say about human sexuality, and people who ignore that, and are looking for just a slasher film are going to be disappointed. But not only does It Follows work as a psychological study, it also works as an extremely scary horror film. It's the best horror film I've seen in years.",

I have been reading some of the reviews of the people who did not enjoy this film, and I am disappointed that some people miss the point of what a horror film insights. A horror film is supposed to insight deep psychological thinking to the viewer. I want to leave the movie thinking that it could actually happen, and leave me having dreams (or nightmares) that night about it happening to me. Yes, the film is not full of cheesy jump scares. Yes, the film doesn't add ridiculous music to build up a scare, but the film leaves us wondering what is going to happen next. I feel this is what people have become accustomed to when it comes to horror. Horror should be a psychological mind f**k; not just a bunch of silence followed by a loud noise and a flash on the screen. This film is what I have been waiting to watch for years.",

This one, I couldn't believe -as horror flicks go- was rated pretty high for the genre. Most horror movies are too stupid to be truly scary or barely scary with horribly stupid, unoriginal story-lines. If a horror flick gets more than 3 or 4 stars it might be worth checking out.. This wasn't, There isn't, there's nothing to see here.. I can't believe the accolades or Rotten Tomatoes scores...how original is this story line? just how truly terrifying is it? It is neither original or scary. Some of it was even laughable. The pool scene, all those appliances..lol..? Them sitting discussing things around on the front lawn with the guy that gave \"IT\" to their friend...\"I gotta go\" he says? lol...10 year old's might find this the real deal, but this scores less than a star for it being a bad movie, and for the unwarranted hype",

    "review": "  I've been hearing a heck of a lot about this one since well before its release so I was eager to get my little hands on this one. I made a point of reading as little about it as possible and I'll do my best to keep as little out of this review as possible as well.It is an 80s horror film throwback but done a bit better. There are sequences that are lifted right out of films like the original Halloween and the soundtrack is also a throwback to something from those days as well. A lot of the shots of suburbia and the cars and the wonderful wide shots with a few very choice things to focus on was fabulous. Very much in the same style as Drive in that regard.This is a film about an STI basically. Something follows you after you have sex and you need to find a way to pass it on. It can look like anyone and anything and It may move slow but it is not stupid. Only you can see it but Its actions do affect the outside world. Jane finds herself infected with It and the film deals with her dealing with that. Her friends, like any good horror film, are also there to help her out. Parents, as this being an 80s throwback, are of course randomly absent. That being said I had a hard time pinning down whether these kids were in late high school or early university but I suppose it doesn't really matter.While I didn't find the film overly scary (though there were a few WHOA moments) there was tension maintained throughout the whole thing. I also really loved the ending in that both my sister and I both had completely different perceptions of what the ending was. I feel it is going to be worth another viewing along for taking a longer look at some of the shots and what was in them to find out another story that may be being told there.All in all I enjoyed it. I thought it was clever and did a great job of upholding the 80s films of old. I wish there was a bit more to it story wise in parts (how It works, what exactly was going on in some scenes, etc.) but it is a very interesting film to watch. If you're looking for something to terrify you though, this probably won't do it.",

It's for sure low budget and it happen to pull off a really cool movie and I'm sure movie fans of this style of thriller/horror can enjoy it. The acting in this film was pretty well done and the graphics were even better than I would've thought.It Follows was put together with a small cast and an even smaller crew and yet pulled off a fairly well made horror story. It's a story that makes you think, and at the same time when ya think about it; well it's kind of funny. When I watched this film I started thinking about the old horror films like Halloween, Friday 13th, and others along this film styling; very well played. So if you're up for a fairly good thriller then check this one out; it'll surprise you.",

Sure it's original, classy, arty (80s retro) & isn't revolved around desensitised murder & gore like so many horrors these days, but even so I thought it just didn't deliver. This is basically the ultimate urban legend come to life with an ingenious concept of some demonic relentless creature that pursues you after being \"marked\", which just so happens to be unprotected sex (lol), but I'm gonna be the one to call BS. This was seriously not that impressive & left me extremely underwhelmed. The creature could kick a hole in a door, smash a window then jump through it, lunge at someone & even swim but apparently skipped the lesson on running - where's the logic in that? Also what's the underlining message with the sex? Is the creature a giant metaphor for HIV/AIDS? Is this ultimately a hate movie against sluts? I'll also say, this movie relies waaay to heavily on the strange sinister soundtrack, if you took that away - it's not scary at all, just dumb. The more I think about it, the more I hate this film.",

The actors are lethargic and mumble their words constantly-- that is, when they finally decide to break the dead air as the camera pans to and fro across the beautiful composition. Yes, the cinematography and sound design were superb-- it's just everything around it that turns out to be a dud. If you thought the first hour and 40 minutes were bad, stay tuned for the home stretch! It will make you feel things, finally -- not quite fear, unfortunately, more like disappointment, irritation, befuddlement as to how this movie has inspired many to wax poetic about how much a masterpiece it is.Close to the movie's end, we find a main character-- whose existence is, objectively, entirely unnecessary -- reading a few lines Dostoevsky out loud to her friends. I think that line alone should tell you whether you'd be the kind to like this movie or not. I'm firmly in the \"not\" pile. At the minimum, good movies-- good art-- make us feel the way they were set out to do-- fear, in this movie's case, rather than ire and tedium. 0/5 would not recommend.",

    "review": "  It Follows (2014)After a strange sexual encounter, a teenager finds herself haunted by nightmarish visions and the inescapable sense that something is after her. ------------------------------------------------------Watched this film and overall it was a decent addition into the horror genre, but it had too many flaws to be considered great. The basic plot felt like something on Creepypasta and a slight turn around on the basic cursed object or activity horror films that plagued the screen the last few years. At times the follower makes sense, but the catch up times varies so much based on plot convenience that a lot of the relentless terror gets cast aside.The direction at times is done with a subtly that brings back the 70's slow build terror horror, but then they have entire scenes where the camera breaks this convention and does something that detracts from the film and scenes that have no purpose or reason to be there other than filler. The worst part of this film is the score. I have no idea what they were trying to do, but like the direction, at a few times it was perfect but then would go off the rails with bad 80's synths and like most modern movies EVERY scare or build up has that heavy bass tone that gives it all away.Visually the \"creature\" was very well done, and the best part of the entire film. When it is in sight it is disturbing, haunting and ramps the movie up nicely until you actually see what it does, which once again makes it feel like a Creepypasta tale written by someone young. Honestly they should have never shown what it actually does and continue to just show the after effects which gave better results anyway. While decently acted, especially by Maika Monroe, the characters just were not really likable and most of them were very cliche. The ending and stinger made sense in a way, but didn't satisfy as an evil will continue moment.Overall, it's definitely worth a watch, but overthinking it will lead you down the path to see more flaws, plot holes and an overall story that just really doesn't work as well as it could of.",

    "review": "  The horror genre is back and in full swing with this very original, imaginative and unexpected film that helps to redefine the genre. The film centers on Jay, a college student, who after having sex with her boyfriend, finds out that he has passed on a force to her which will kill her if she doesn't find someone in time to pass it onto. If she is killed, it resorts back to the previous occupant. The force is revealed to be capable of taking on the form and appearance of anyone.This film is pure horror, with real suspense, while acting as a homage toward films of the 1970s and 1980s, that mostly centered on suspense. The cast in the film is impressive, especially Maika Monroe as Jay, who really shows this sense of withdrawal and uncertainty after she starts to witness this force. Monroe really does show the right sense of fear and dread in many crucial scenes.The cinematography by Mike Gioulakis is dreary, bleak and stark, acting perfectly like a 1970s or 1980s horror film. The light especially supports many scenes, always keeping up the sense of suspense at the right moments. The music by Disasterpeace is also terrific, having the effect of John Carpenter, most notably Carpenter's score for Halloween. The music has this great feel of a 1970s or 1980s horror soundtrack, done just right. It's never hoaky, its a great throwback of horror films of old.While the film isn't really scary, it's more suspenseful, it's a great horror film, done with a clear goal and objective, never faltering and never becoming boring. The film is outstanding achievement and welcome return to horror films of the golden days. Well done!",

Many critics seem to agree that the movie is a revelation, a revitalizing of the Horror genre itself.

That drew me in alone, and the initial scene with the monster, the audience's first experience, is not bad.

    "review": "  By now, everyone should know the drill: if characters in a horror movie have sex, those characters are as good as dead. They might as well paint a bull's-eye on their head, as the killer will instinctively flock to them with murderous intent. While being chaste does not necessarily guarantee one's survival, the odds are far better than for those who give in to sinful temptation. This is not a new concept; it's a trope as old as the genre itself, brought to mainstream attention (along with many other tropes of the genre) with John Carpenter's \"Halloween.\" But filmmaker David Robert Mitchell has found something new to do with it, putting a whole new spin on the idea that sex will get you killed. The result is \"It Follows,\" an insidiously suspenseful piece of work that, as the title would suggest, sticks with you. It's creepy and unsettling, and Mitchell displays a profound, Hitchcockian knack in building tension. When 19-year-old Jay (Maika Monroe) finally gives into the sexual advances of her new boyfriend Hugh (Jake Weary), she unwittingly puts herself in grave danger. Hugh breaks it down for her; apparently he is the victim of a terrible curse which was passed on to him after a one-night stand with a girl he met at a bar. This curse manifests itself in the form of a slow-moving, shape-shifting entity that follows Hugh wherever he goes, visible only to him. By sleeping with Jay, he has passed the curse on to her, and now she is the new target of said evil entity. The thing moves slowly, but if it ever catches up with its prey, it kills him/her. Therefore, if you're its target, you better keep moving. According to Hugh, there is no way to stop it; the only thing Jay can do is \"pass it on\" (i.e., sleep with someone else, thereby making that person the new object of the demonic entity's hunt). What's particularly clever about this set-up is that sex is both the catalyst for a person's demise as well as the only way to stay alive. But even then, there're no guarantees, for if the thing kills its current target, it will revert back to its previous one. So if Jay were to get caught and killed, it would go back to stalking Hugh, and if it got him, it would go after the girl who passed it on to him, and so on. There are all kinds of social allegories present here (you could basically look at the thing as some kind of lethal, sentient STD), but at its core, \"It Follows\" is quite an effective little horror film. The thing about \"it\" is that it always takes on the appearance of people, but the appearance is always changing. So if you're the target and you're in a crowded area, for example, it could be difficult to tell which member of the crowd (if any!) is your pursuer. The only real giveaway is the fact that it's visible only to you; so if you see an odd-looking person walking slowly towards you that nobody else can see, it's time to run. It's remarkable how effectively creepy this all is, considering its simplicity. The entity moves at a snail's pace, but like the Terminator or Michael Myers, it never stops. As Hugh explains, wherever the thing is, regardless of the distance between it and Jay, it will always be walking in a straight line in Jay's direction. She could hop into a car and drive across the country, but all that really does is buy time. Eventually, inevitably, it will catch up. This leads to some spine-tingling sequences in which Jay is forced to stop moving, and she-and the audience-nervously scan her surroundings, just waiting for the creature to turn a corner or pop into view. As with all the great horror films, the anticipation is nerve-wracking. I do have some issues with the film. I'm still not quite certain I understand what Jay and the other characters were attempting to do during the climax of the film, nor do I understand its resolution. And at one point in the movie, it appears as if Jay is about to \"pass it on,\" but there is never any mention of this in the next scene, and it's unclear as to what ended up happening. Problems aside, \"It Follows\" succeeds in invoking feelings of unease and dread in the audience. It takes a well-established horror movie clich� and somehow forms a pretty original concept from it. In this instance, abstinence doesn't just make it harder for the monster to kill you; it keeps you off its radar entirely. In this universe, it just might actually be a good thing if you're not successful in landing that hottie sitting on the barstool next to you. The skeletons in their closet may be shockingly literal.",

    "review": "  Let's be honest, in the 2010s the horror genre is again facing a crisis -reminiscent of the one that almost cause its extinction in the 90s- as every year a handful of forgettable and clich� filled films arrive. But in this phase of forgettable and laughable horror films there are a handful of exceptions (\"The Conjuring\", \"The Bababook\", and the more comedy than horror \"The Cabin in the Woods\"), so the question is: Can \"It Follows\" be a new member in that extremely short list of exceptions or is it another mess of a horror film? Jay is a teenager that just experienced her first sexual encounter, but this makes her the vessel of curse: An unknown being will follow her and will kill her in case of getting to her. In this dark phase for horror films, when one manages to get critical acclaim and achieve good word of mouth, fans of the genre are curious and excited to see it, so does \"It Follows\" live up to the hype? \"It Follows\" counts with a premise that sounds ridiculous but the execution is masterful, it pays homage to numerous films of the genre (specially certain John Carpenter�s films), an electronic score that works incredibly well with the story and it is used when is necessary, the cinematography is surprisingly straight out of an art house film and is the biggest star of the film, it masterfully creates an unnerving and highly suspenseful atmosphere, it takes advantage of some horror clich�s, a theme that's heavy handed but still works, and a slow pacing that's all about buildup. But even if this film has some greatness, it also has humongous flaws. There are some inconsistencies in the script, the setting is distracting as at times it feels like the 70s but then they use cell phones or have this ridiculous and bizarre sea shell Iphone (I get that it's supposed to feel like a nightmare but it is distracting and unnecessary), some story elements go nowhere, the acting is dreadful, the script needed a little background regarding the characters, most of the dialog is laughable, the characters are caricatures, the second half completely ruin the buildup of the first half as it lacks a payoff, the climax is laughably absurd and dumb, it has no resolution, and the pacing never gets faster even if the story demanded it. \"It Follows\", is an interesting take of this dying genre as it combines art house indie style with various 80s horror movie clich�s, and the result is this unsettling film with a heavy handed theme. It starts with a promising and highly suspenseful first half but it then deteriorates into an unintentional comedy. Worth seeing if you are a lover of the genre or if you like indie films.",

It Follows was not at all what I expected, the few inconsistencies were easily looked over due to the extremely interesting was this movie played out. Characters are dressed like it's the '70's but with cell phones... not sure what was happening there. An STD (sexually transmitted demon) as we called it follows you around trying to sex you to death? unless you pass it on. water seems to stop this demon and my biggest question still is why didn't she trying going to an Island of some kind? just to see if it works. instead she passes on her STD to her friend then watches it kill him only to pass it on to someone else! Scariest part is when the demon transforms into what looks like a grosses creepiest child ever and crawls through a hole in a door the size of a dog door, also the kitchen scene where it is naked woman possibly covered in running water or she might just be peeing herself, thinking it was pee made us all want to vomit so this move gets an extra half star from me.... makes you jump out of your seat due to slight fear check, make you grossed out to the point of almost vomiting check, makes you question every sexual partner you may ever be with in your life.... CHECK CHECK CHECK.",

    "review": "  While I admit that the dialogue in the film is lacking, this is one of the better horror films I've seen in a very long time.I've been trying for ages to find that special horror movie, the one that got under my skin and made me think about it at night when all the lights were out. The one that kept me awake at night. The one that I tried to forget when I closed my eyes. While It Follows didn't get that deep under my skin, and while it didn't keep me awake at night, it did haunt me, it stayed with me... and I couldn't forget it.After movies like The Conjuring and all of those other \"demons, demons, demons\" flicks, all that supernatural nonsense, psychic powers and Bibles and fire and possessions... I've seen it all, and I'm so tired of it... this was a very fresh return to what horrifies me most: psychological horror. The creeping sensation that something is after you, something that no one else can see. Demons, ghosts, witches, etc... none of that ever frightened me, because none of it is believable. But I can believe that someone can go insane and start seeing things, because that happens in reality. Demons don't possess people... but seeing an old woman walking toward you across the yard is possible. She may not really be there... and that's what's so terrifying to think. Are you crazy... or are you not?The question of whether or not we're \"cracking up\" or going insane truly is a very frightening one. The sense that someone is following us has been part of us for a very long time, and it always frightens us to feel that chill, that concept that there is someone right behind us, wanting to hurt us. I can only imagine the terror someone goes through when they first discover they're seeing things that aren't there... until It Follows came around. Then I saw a pretty good example of what that might be like.It Follows succeeds in capturing a very real feeling that some people go through, that someone is always out to get them, and there is nothing they can do but run. It gives you the sense that there are things other than bumps in the night to be afraid of. The fact that the monster walks, not runs, but walks toward you, is a pretty effective way of showing that it has nothing but time to catch up to you and eventually nab you. That's pretty chilling when you think it over.Some people are sniveling that the movie is too ambiguous, but I like it that way. I want it to be cryptic. I DO NOT need a movie to explain every little thing to me. Just give me something to work with, make it seem real, and I'll run with it if you can achieve that. I don't have to know \"where the monster came from,\" I don't have to know \"if it can be killed.\" I just want the director to make me believe in it. And that was a very successful attempt at doing so. He made me believe in the monster. Not many horror films do that to me anymore. None of them do, actually.I also have to comment on the soundtrack. My god, is it good. They're these gorgeously crafted synth tracks that really reach you and fill you with a sense of unease and even tranquility at other times. One of the best horror soundtracks I've ever heard since the soundtrack to Maniac.No, some things in the movie don't make 100% perfect sense, but it's not supposed to. You're supposed to be left wondering. If you don't like that, that's your deal. Movies have spent so much time explaining themselves to us that we feel like we're supposed to be told every little thing whenever we see a story. Movies have been holding our hands for generations, so when we don't \"get\" something, we get angry, rather than scratch our heads and discuss what we thought with others. Some things are just supposed to be concluded in your way. They're left up to interpretation by you. I like that everyone comes to their own conclusion at the end of the movie. Some say the monster can be destroyed. Others say it can't. I say it can't. Others would disagree. I like that. Not every ending needs to be over-analyzed, like the end to stupid Inception. If you come away from the movie getting angry asking yourself a bunch of needless questions, you might be overthinking it. And coming from me, that's saying a lot, because I overthink every movie I see. This movie was made in such a way where it was scarier NOT answering those questions. Some aren't, but some are, and this was.All-in-all, other than the Babadook, this was the best horror film I've seen in ages. Any movie that can haunt me does its job. Please, no more ghosts. No more demons. No more vampires or zombies or any of that crap. Just scare me, damn it. Make me uneasy. Make me feel trapped in a maze of my own mind. If a character hears voices in a film, I want to feel like I too can hear those voices. I want to be scared.It Follows seems to be guiding the horror genre in the right direction. Films, especially horror ones, have trained us that there is always some magical solution or deus ex machina to save the friggin day when real life doesn't work that way. I want movies to be true to life, because then I can relate to the characters, I can feel them, I can sympathize with them, I can react with them. If you want big-budget Michael Bay BS special booming effects and characters so fake that you can't take them seriously, there's plenty of brainless popcorn-stuffing superhero films to gorge yourself on.",

It's a weird movie but a genuinely chilling one even if things don't completely fit together. I wonder what It Follows would've been if it was a bigger budget movie. For points on creativity, \"oh shit!\" moments, jumps and freakishness, It Follows is a must-see for any horror fan.",

It is not one of the scariest movies ever, either. I did not find it scary at all, actually, but yet again, no horror film ever scares me, so there's that. The premise is good, it's ambitious, but not without flaws. 'It,' literally follows the protagonist, slowly, but persistent. What is 'it,' is where the problem lies. Nothing is really explained in depth, and the movie lacks logic at times. Also, I have to say that it's a bit repetitive. This movie reminded me quite a lot of 'Halloween,' it has a lot of similar scenes. The cinematography is pretty great, the camera shots build tension appropriately. I also have to say that I liked the main character, I recently saw that actress in 'The Guest,' another film that feels like it was made in the 80s. I don't know what the meaning of this film is at the end. The themes range from the dangers of having sex with people you don't know all that well, STDs... heck, it even feels like a summer coming of age movie. Is it abut bad parenting? Parents are never around, but that's just a cliche, or a trend, rather, at this point. Perhaps I'm just putting too much thought into it. Like I said, I did not love it, but I did enjoy the ride. I appreciate them doing something new with the horror genre.",

I think it makes a good job making the metaphors about losing your innocence through sex and how that can follow you around forever. Anyways, cinematography wise, the movie is pretty on point. My only problem would be that even though it's all about making suspense and tension, there's a fine line between that and making a movie too slow to be entertaining. It's also kind of lazy in my opinion to not explain in any way what the ghost was or what it wanted or how it started or anything. But after all, it does a great job at being disturbing. I noticed all the people I consider to be hipster love it, so I guess it's really a hipster-flick. If you're into the more mainstream stuff, you may be more likely to think this movie is quite slow and boring.",

If you, like me, are fond of smashing special effects thrilling action and survivors deperatly fighting for their lives using the supernatural, stay away.

    "review": "  I must sound like a broken record (or corrupted mp3 file) when I say that quality horror films are few and far between. A good horror film can keep you on the edge of your seat, thrilling you with clever scares or unnerving imagery. But any horror fan knows that in searching for a good horror film, you're going to see a lot of bad ones. Unfortunately, It Follows falls into the latter category. This film has a familiar beginning, though skillfully done: a teenage girl in red high heels bursts out of her house and runs out into the street then to her car. She runs, but doesn't get away. There is definite skill in the staging, and it was clear from the outset that this was aiming to be a low-key, subtle horror film, but something was amiss with that opening scene. The random teen girl being menaced in the first scene is not just a horror movie clich�, she, and those red high heels even more so, are a signifier that It Follows is a film that will emphasize style over substance. That would be forgivable if It Follows was engaging and scary. However, It Follows also emphasizes style over scares. The premise of this movie is intriguing and fresh. After having sex for the first time with her older boyfriend, young Jay (Maika Monroe) is attacked by him, drugged, and tied to a chair. He explains to her that he has passed to her a ghost that will follow her until it catches up with her and kills her. If it does, the presence will go back to following him. \"It\" can appear as anyone, even people she loves, and though it moves slowly it won't ever stop following her. There is nothing she can do to get rid of it, only pass it along to someone else. Though clearly aware of the allegorical implications -- STDs/AIDS, or adulthood/maturity, both of which amount to decay and death to a teenager -- the film never fully embraces this subtext, insisting that the theme is open to a broad interpretation.It Follows steers clear of some horror movie clich�s (there is almost no violence or blood), but falls into others (Jay's \"nerdy\" friend is characterized by big glasses and reading Dostoevsky's The Idiot). There are, of course, a few pop-up/startle scares. The climax is capped off with a creepy and memorable visual element. However, too many times I noted that while what I was seeing looked creepy, I wasn't actually creeped out or scared. Is that figure in the distance behind Jay \"It\" or just a normal person? Speed walking or a light jog in the opposite direction is all it would take to diffuse the situation. At certain points It Follows moves too slowly, and the non-scary scenes fail to build dread and danger. The \"scare\" scenes, or potentially scary scenes, are separated by scenes of Jay and her friends talking like they are adults on True Detective. They wax poetic about the line between the suburbs and the bad parts of town, but those ideas are not explored any further. The one consistently effective element of It Follows is the haunting synth score by Disasterpeace.I very much enjoy slow-burn horror films (Audition, John Carpenter's Halloween, and Val Lewton/Jacques Tourneur movies are some of my favorites). Because these films typically have low budgets, they avoid effects-heavy set pieces in favor of a grand, thrilling finale. The most successful examples make up for a lack of spectacle by building atmosphere and tension and creating full characters. It Follows clearly aims to be like the classic slow-burn horror films from the late 70s and early 80s, but ultimately it falls short in those crucial areas of mood and character and instead fills the time with dull teenagers talking to each other in rooms. Horror films can be flawed and still be successful. A good horror movie can have flimsy characters, plot holes, contrivances, it doesn't even have to make sense (I'm looking at you Suspiria and Hausu), but it must spook, unsettle, creep, disturb, or unnerve. It absolutely must scare and, even more importantly, entertain. It Follows did not have me anywhere near the edge of my seat. Instead I was slumped back, my mind wandering to memories of other horror movies.",

    "review": "  The first time I watched \"Halloween\" was all the way back in October 2012, on Halloween night, to be exact. I was fifteen-years-old, had never considered myself to be a horror fan, and didn't have a clue what made the film such a hit among slasher buffs. Midway through the harrowing climax, my sister, who had gone out trick-or-treating all night, crept up to the living room's back window and banged on the pane as hard as she could. That should have been the fright of my life, but \"Halloween\", as it turns out, is so scary that a quick jolt hardly compares to the lasting disturbia of its nuts and bolts. Everything about it is straight out of a hyper-realistic nightmare you might have had after a night of anxiety attacks - the score, the acting, and of course, the sight of Michael Myers' mask are still enough to cause me to collapse into a puddle of yesterday's confidence. And despite the fact that the film is really and truly an exercise in horror, the scene that has lasted with me the longest is the final scene, which, after a few seconds of regrouping, cuts to a shot of Laurie Strode's lawn from the view of the balcony. There, the body of Michael Myers (recently shot) should have been strewn. But after barely recovering from her attack, Laurie peers over the ledge and finds him gone. On the loose. Ready to kill. Again. When putting my movie watching history into consideration, ambiguity is the tool that seems to make a horror movie work for me. My personal favorite, \"The Blair Witch Project\", was such a masterpiece because the fear was never fully explained, despite seeing monstrosity after monstrosity occur before our very eyes; and in other excellent works, such as \"The Innocents\" or \"The Babadook\", the villain on the prowl is kept invisible, while we collapse in fear over the mental detonation that befalls its protagonist.  Horror is one of the few genres that rarely seems to work - because the main goal is to scare, much of the plot points have a similar air, even the gems ringing with a sort of depressing familiarity. And considering the genre has been around since the 1920s, it seems to be, especially as of late, increasingly difficult to make a chiller completely new and completely disturbing. Finally, we have a mood piece worthy of the hype: \"It Follows\" is one of the best, if not the best, horror movie of the 2010s. It takes the best of Carpenter, the most subdued of Argento, and the ghostliest of Romero and makes for the most outrightly ominous terror train of recent years. It sticks with you - no, scratch that: it follows you - for much too long, individual scenes as impactful as the aforementioned finale sequence of \"Halloween\". As of right now, it may be denoted as a terrifying indie sensation that pushed past its low-budget constraints and broke the ground. But in twenty years, it might be a golden egg horror buffs gaze upon like a stack of one-hundred dollar bills, the knight in shining armor that saved the genre from completely collapsing into hardly seen independent fare. The monster stalking the premises is not an axe wielding murderer or a snaggletoothed demon but a soulless entity who menaces a victim at a time. The victim in \"It Follows\" is Jay Height (the wonderful Maika Monroe), a blonde college student whose life is turned upside down after spontaneously having sex with date. The guy (Jake Weary), it seems, did not undergo the act as a deed of passion but as one of necessity. He is being staked by the previously mentioned ghoul, who follows him, like a zombie, wherever he goes. Like an STD, the fiend seems to travel from victim to victim through intercourse - but if the person on the receiving end of the devilish transfer is killed, it goes right back to its previous owner. It's a cycle of the most vicious quality, making life a living hell for anyone touched by the curse. Jay, a heroine in the same spirit as Laurie Strode and Dana Polk, isn't content passably sitting like a helpless victim, doing everything she can to survive and figure out to end the problem, her clueless friends in tow. In concept alone, \"It Follows\" is intriguing to the highest caliber, but execution is what makes a film what it is and David Cameron Mitchell is an auteur of enormous potential. Some scenes have the specificity of a severely darkened Wes Anderson flick, others drowned in uncomfortably colorful dread only found in the finest Bava. He's intensely concerned about texture and sound - the tone, unrelentingly gutted by dread, is threatening enough to cause the Blair Witch to back off; the score, emulating \"Halloween\" and the chamber stealth of an Ennio Morricone scored giallo, sends a rippling effect of panic through the body. If it were flatly shot, \"It Follows\" would be frightening, but not emotionally stimulating. And because Mitchell's dynamic is so saturated and so eerie, we don't solely jump in fright at the nearest cat-at-the-camera scare; we feel so blatantly terrorized that we become certain that maybe it's following us. Ghostly, stylish, and deliriously terrifying, \"It Follows\" is a classic in the making, a supernaturally subtle piece of uncompromising power. It renews what we've come to love about the horror genre, injecting much needed adrenaline in the long suffering brand. More, please.",

We seem to be getting past the whole torture porn phase of horror as a people, and returning to a more creepy atmospheric style. This movie reminded me a lot of some of the best 80's horror movies, particularly Halloween. The blood is pretty restrained, the music is creepy and electronic, and it's largely a story of young people being pursued by an unbeatable force that's always around the corner. It was apparently based on a recurring nightmare, and it has that vibe to it. It's not really outright scary, but it's definitely tense and creepy. The characters don't have a ton of depth, but they feel genuine and likable enough that we care about whether or not they get through their bizarre circumstances. It's nothing particularly revolutionary, and it's a nice return to a lot of the stuff I like about horror.",

    "review": "  It Follows is not a scary movie in the least. A thought process on becoming an adult and std's maybe, but a scary movie it is not. The sexual monster has only two advantages really. Only people who have had it can see it and it never stops. The disadvantages are plenty though. It walks every where. It picks random people to be and usually they are naked. It can't open a locked door. While others not being able to see it helps it a lot, once you've had sex with someone then you both can see it. This means that you can get others help. What I think would have helped would be that you can no longer see it once you've passed it to another person. It's supposed to know who to pick to be, but that doesn't help if it decides to be naked. Most people aren't going to talk to a parent walking up to them naked. Which is another disadvantage is it can't talk. Usually you're taught at a young age not to talk to strangers and avoid people who frighten you. Someone who just walks towards you and won't say anything is in my book both. Then there is the huge flaw of it not being able to get into any place that a normal human couldn't do. I can't believe that I'm supposed to be afraid of something that can't get passed a locked door. Simple trap would be to lure it into a place with two exists and have a friend lock the door behind it while you lock the door in front of it. Now it's trapped till someone lets it out. Which if you picked a good spot could be never or at least well after you passed from old age. The last point is a flaw in the movie it seems. It gets shot, but gets back up and goes on as though nothing has happened. Then why is it afraid to get in the pool? If you say it's to kill her easier than it's doing a bad job.",

I was expecting something more I guess. I don't wanna say too much but it did not live up to the hype. It is worth watching because it is well made and a good horror flick is very rare these days. Good is about as high as I can praise it though.",

    "review": "  Something that the horror genre seems to suffer nowadays is lack of originality. Since \"Cabin in the Woods\", it is difficult to recall an original horror film. Unoriginal does not always mean bad, of course. Movies like James Wan's \"The Conjuring\" or the \"Insidious\" trilogy aren't original horror films, but are really solid homages to the genre, and they are successful at what they set out to do. \"It Follows\", however, is the rare film that manages to be both: A refreshing new take on the horror genre, and a love letter to the same.\"It Follows\" follows (no pun intended) the story of Jay (Maika Monroe), a blondie that spends his days hanging out with her sister Kelly (Lili Sepe) and her friends Yara (Olivia Luccardi) and Paul (Keir Gilchrist) and is also dating Hugh (Jake Weary), who seems to be a promising candidate for a relationship. After a few dates, the night finally comes when Jay and Hugh have sex. However, instead of the after-sex cuddles, Hugh sleeps Jay with chloroform and ties her to a wheel chair. When she wakes up, Hugh explains him that she now has \"it\", meaning that someone will follow her in a zombie-esque way. This someone could be anyone, and can take many forms, although only she can see that someone. She mustn't be touched by it, because if not she will die and the \"it\" will return to chase Hugh. The only way to get rid of \"it\" is to pass it to another person by having sex with such. Therefore, \"it\" is like the deadliest, creepiest and most relentless STD imaginable...sort of.\"It Follows\" is a highly stylish movie. David Robert Mitchell and cinematographer Mike Gioulakis tell the story through long takes and wide shots that allow Mitchell to be extremely playful with his direction. Directing a horror film is not easy: A great deal of balancing has to be made, and more if one is ambitious enough to dare write in interesting characters. That's what \"It Follows\" does so well. The direction is unique, and the characters are not the recycled horror film clich�s. They are also played by capable actors. Maika Monroe, who we've seen kick ass in the similarly nostalgic \"The Guest\", is much more visceral in the leading role. Did I mention the movie was scary? Oh, yeah. The amount of tension found from the excellent opening sequence (Which sets up the tone for the film perfectly) till the very last shot of the film is delightfully unbearable. Plus, Mitchell also adds a deliciously pulpy and darkly comic background to the plot, making its impact much sweeter and refreshing.But \"It Follows\" is more than that. It is also a throwback to the old John Carpenter-esque horror films of ye olden days. It can be seen in the peculiar setting, a Seattle suburb that is at moments calm and friendly, and in others extremely dreary, and that also seems to have no clear sense of time. The cinema is playing \"Charade!\" and the kids' clothing seem fresh out of a 60s sitcom. But Yara also likes to read novels out of a smartphone the shape of a clam. Yes, this movie is quirky. It is true that this may not appeal to general audiences: After all, if box office numbers tell us something, is that original content is most of the time not lucrative. But those horrors fans who seem unamused by the movies the genre has produced nowadays, definitely give this indie gem a go. This movie is sheer horror perfection.",

    "review": "  It Follows is a clear homage to the golden age of horror and its directors, most notably the voyeuristic, tension building photography of John Carpenter and the sexual and body horror of David Cronenberg. It is essentially very much a 2 sided coin, 1 side being a refreshing and well visualized piece of horror that steps above the mountains of garbage out there at the moment, and 1 side, typical and by the numbers characters and closure. This film follows a group of teenagers, your usual suspects, as Jay, a 19 year old female, has a terrifying sexual encounter with someone she thought she could trust. Soon we realize that by having this sexual encounter, Jay would be followed by an unknown pressence, unless she slept with someone else to pass it on, although this entity appears to be relentless and we essentially get a tension fulled game of cat and mouse. When It Follows is good, its really good, David Mitchell clearly knows what he is doing when it comes to building tension, in camera effects and subtle horror, however the writing and certain elements of pacing leave an extremely sour and bland taste in our mouths. The script is largely to blame here, yet again written by Mitchell, his characters are in no way likeable, unique or stand out in any way. Emphasis is slapped on this matter mainly through the dialogue, which at times is extremely cheap, horrid and overly trying. It's annoying because there are writers out there that can capture the innocence, fear and immaturity of teenage life, however Mitchell doesnt seem to be that person. His writing is 1 note, very forced and we end up with shallow, lifeless and dead beat characters who we really dont want to fall in love with. He also doesnt know exactly how to wrap this one up, although his final scene is a brilliant stop note, we hum and haw over the majority of the final act, with a handful of scenes that pack a tense punch but nothing more. However It Follows makes up for all of this with its visual style, its array of innovative shots and its haunting score. The film 90% of the time looks fantastic, it has a great life like feeling to it, colours are simple and effective and the overall feel is superb. The shots are excellent, mostly when the entity is in the back ground, stalking its prey, it completely reminds you of Halloween, with is uber wide shots, that allow the audience, in their own time, to witness the threat at hand. However my favourite shot has to be, after Jay's sexual encounter, where she finds herself strapped to a wheelchair, the DOP decides to attach the camera to the wheelchair itself, giving you the lead characters reaction for the entire scene and a dizzying background and she is spun around. All this is brought even tighter together with a fantastic score bit Disasterpiece, its dark, industrial and highly retro. I like the theme of this movie, its clearly aimed at the fear sex within teenagers and potential threats that can come of this very human and common act and the way Mitchel majoritively plays with that is fantastic. However being slightly older, it feels slightly alienating, I found myself asking questions such as, why dont the teenagers do this, or that in order to evade the threat. This feeling is made even more apparent by the films lack of adult pressence, its obvious Mitchell has decided, artistically to remove it almost all together and although this does give a feeling of hopelessness towards the kids, its almost non existance hinders any audience over 30 of any real appeal. This is a minor point as, maybe what he was trying to achieve here was a decent horror film for teenagers and if thats the case, he has hit the nail right on the head, it has enough to frighten, thought provoke and give you goosebumps, however a more mature and deeper thinking audience, will struggle to get the degree of severity this film tries so desperately to convey. It has plenty of merit and Mitchel is certainly a force to be reckoned with, however this outing boxes in its audience and once its started hurtling towards the finish line, there isnt an awful lot left for a huge demographic. If your a horror buff i reccomend giving it a watch but this predominantly acts as a great horror film for teens and an okay attempt for everyone else.",

However, It Follows didn't follow. The story falls flat, the characters are one note (with one particular character absolutely pointless), another falls prey to some horror tropes (running up the stairs, really?). There's something to be said for not much exposition , it still treats its audience as stupid with characters that make dumb decisions and a storyline that just doesn't work. I do applaud the film for its ambitious attempt, it's a lot different than most horror fare out there going for psychological thrills rather than blue and guts that most horror films go for nowad. I did enjoy the eerie atmosphere, the throwback imagery and setting, the ambiguity of the time setting, and the panning widescreen shots.

The acting is fine, but it's almost as though the directer has just one move in his bag: a slow, full, one shot, pan of the room or area. It's just about every scene that he does that shot. It gets old really quickly. I would have liked to have known why \"it follows.\" And there is a scene in the movie that makes no sense at all: at some point the main character, who is trying to get rid of the problem, is on a beach and sees thee men in a boat. They show her swim towards them. Then, in the next scene, she and another boy are talking and the boy asks her why she doesn't just pass it along. She then ends up sleeping with that boy to pass it along. But it is implied that she slept with at least one of the men on the boat! So what was the point of that scene?",

After a great opening, the movie dips into a lull and gets boring for a while until the scene where our lead character (Maika Monroe, who will next be in Independence Day: Resurgence) discovers \"It\". \"It\" is slow-moving and creepy, and \"It\" will kill her until she passes it on the next person. The movie is a great allegory for STDs, but then it dips again. And that becomes the movie's downfall. For all the gorgeous cinematography, the fascinating plot and the stunning set pieces as her and her friends battle \"It\", the movie keeps hitting dull patches. It's like a sputtering car; it stalls out several times over the running time before it reaches an unsatisfying ending. Perhaps it is one of those movies that need to be revisited again to catch new things, and I would watch it again. But for now, it's a slow burn thriller that fizzes out. It's also not scary at all, but it's got a promising idea for a sequel as well that I'd watch and hope is better.",

    "review": "  It Follows took me by surprise with a compelling, fresh and much needed addition to the bland horror movie genre. I will admit, the first fifteen minutes of the movie were rough. Poor acting, corny lines and they even had a girl fart in the movie. YES! A girl farting! But despite that, once the movie picked up, I was hooked. The plot of the movie seems like a testament against sleeping around which I appreciated. If she didn't have sex with this stranger on the second date, there wouldn't be this spirit following her. Take notes, ladies!",

    "review": "  I give this horror film props for going against the grain from all the found footage horror films that are released nowadays. This is has a throwback feel from the music, the slow pace, and the minimal violence. It is all about atmosphere. Though I appreciate the originality of it, the movie moved a little too slow. It does pick up in the last 30 minutes. What will make some viewers mad its that we never know what IT is, but I guess not knowing is what makes the movie even more creepy. At least it is good to know that there are some people who are willing to make an actual scary movie. Grade: B+",

    "review": "  It Follows is a truly remarkable film. The film's premise could have easily been reduced to a subversive piece of cult horror, but what writer/director David Robert Mitchell manages to achieve is nothing short of extraordinary; a truly masterful piece of art that's thoughtful, stylish, horrifying. When the film is not rendering its audience completely terrified, its presenting a layered story, complex with deeply felt human interaction and self introspection. This film's seemingly laughable premise, a sexually transmitted demon that plagues those who contract it with inescapable persistence, actually serves quite well as a vehicle to discuss societal shame associated with sexual encounters. The premise seemingly seeks to subvert the horror genre by offering us a literal curse that associated with sexual activity. This theme has permeated the horror genre for years. The bimbo cheerleader and the testosterone-filled jock have often been discarded as fodder for sadistic bloodletting in horror films for decades. This is not the point of It Follows. It doesn't seek to subvert the genre, it seeks to rise above it; offering instead something that is totally authentic and cuttingly true. It offers fresh perspective on our society's penchant for demonizing sexuality.  The main character, Jay, is, in the beginning, intoxicated by the promise of young romance and love as she is courted by a seemingly handsome and kind young man named Hugh. Eventually the two have sex. The passionate encounter turns traumatic though as Jay is let on to the fact that the her courtship was only a necessary means to pass on the demonic sexually transmitted curse and afterwards she is promptly discarded. Her friends and family and neighbors know that she has had this encounter and they know that she was used and unceremoniously discarded or worse. What follows Jay for the rest of the film is a walking demon that permeates her life, making it unbearable, and obstructing every relationship she has and destroying everything she hopes to do. Some have said it is allegorical of contracting a sexually transmitted disease. I agree the film is allegorical, but this meaning is far too simplistic. What really plagues Jay is shame. Shame that lingers in the back of her mind, that seems to lurk behind every corner and that can come in the form of a complete stranger or as someone she loves. Hugh mentions that it does this \"just so it can hurt you.\" This sort of shame is the natural outgrowth of a society that is all too eager to judge the actions of others and to label people, particularly females, as sluts or whores. One can carry around this shame for a lifetime. The film's themes evolve in the end to more general notions of human mortality and of accepting one's own fate. It might seem a little scatological but it fit's the narrative arc rather well. Director David Robert Mitchell also films this movie with the direction of a man who has digested a lot of horror films in his day. It is colored by everything from Romero, Carpenter and Craven to Polanski and Dargento. I could name two dozen horror films that play as inspiration for this film. It feels like a piece of throw back pulp horror. The soundtrack is synthesized straight out of the early 80s, the camerawork feels like it was shot by the demon offspring of Carpenter and Polanski, and the supreme leeway given to the unaccompanied minors in this film evokes visions of a certain time spent on Elm Street. This movie caters to everything we loved about those horror films but it does not pander to them, which is what will make this film an instant cult classic. The only complaint I have about the film is the slightly disappointing third act which, despite its faults, dose still manages to terrify. If Mitchell had dreamed up a final showdown as well conceived as the films final two shots, it might have been the undisputed best horror film of the past year, but unfortunately for it, it comes in a close second behind The Babadook. Even so second best in that contest is still pretty good.",

    "review": "  This is a real damn good horror movie, all things considered. It's the type of film that I think non-horror fans would enjoy as much as horror fans due to its subtext and heavy use of symbolism. Here's the thing about the movie, it's very smart movie, but the symbolism itself isn't exactly subtle. A 5-year old can figure out that the It the film so ominously refers to is either a metaphor for a sexual transmitted disease, which is why it's, obviously, transmitted through sexual intercourse, or it's a metaphor for the inevitability of death. The film even throws in several excerpts from books that heavily hint at this. While I think, with the way the film plays out, that it's a combination of both, I think there's more of the latter than the former. There's a certain reality in the way how some people try to find ways to prolong or delay something that happens to us all in the end. No matter what we do, we cannot avoid our own demise, and that's, essentially, what Jay is doing throughout the film. She's just trying to buy as much time as she can to see if she can find a way to either delay it or stop it altogether. So it's a film that doesn't only work as a horror film, but also as an existential drama. But, like I mentioned, it's not like the symbolism itself is really subtle. The fact that it's so easy to figure it out, and how they beat you over the head with it, takes something away from it. It might not be a lot, but it does, slightly, take away from it. With that said, I do think that the horror itself was incredibly well-executed. The film does an excellent job at constantly reminding you of what is at stake and what It is capable of doing once It gets its hands on whomever it may want at a particular moment. Essentially, It can take the form of anyone that would allow to go after the person it wants, in this case Jay. It walks very slowly, but It always finds where Jay is at. Because of that, there are certain scenes where you 'nothing' is happening and, randomly, you'll see someone walking very slowly towards Jay and it's on again. That's one of the things I love about this movie, it's the fact that it doesn't ever let you forget what's going on at any time. It can appear at any time, so you, much like the main character herself, are always on your toes, looking out for any suspiciously slow-walking people. The threat of It is ever-present and, because of that, I think the tension builds and builds and people will definitely find parts of this to be terrifying. I just think that it's very effective at getting a lot of scares out of something so simple. There's very little gore, outside of a very graphic death, that happens off-screen to show what It can actually do. I think it's all tension and the fear that It can literally appear when you least expect it. The hallway scene in Jay's house is particularly effective at this. I think the film not explaining what It is and where It exactly came from adds to it, the lack of explanation does not feel cheap in the least. I read this somewhere, but the fact that the film, somewhat, exists in a dreamlike world explains this in that when you're having a nightmare, you're not trying to get to the bottom of what's so terrifying about it. You're just trying to escape it. Plus, and this is something that's been debated, is that if sequels to this film are made, which I hope isn't the case, that you can explore the origin of It or look at it from the perspective of another person being followed by It. I just think that a sequel, while a good idea, would take some of the novelty away from what made this film so good in the first place. Getting to the bottom of it would ruin the mystery this film attained by not getting to the origin of It. I'm not saying that a sequel wouldn't be a good film, but it's just not something I'd want to see. While I think that the film gets better as I'm reviewing it, to the point that I'm upgrading it from 3.5 to 4 stars, it's a film that starts to fizzle out after Jay has sex with Greg. It definitely gets back on track by its climax, but there are some rough spots here and there. I think there's also something very interesting about the film and that is the people that follow her as It. The last person that follows her looks an awful lot like her father, they show a family portrait after the fact. It may not have been, but I'm curious as to whether or not there was something deeper going on there. Maybe I missed something, but I'm curious as to whether there was anything behind the last person looking so much like Jay's father. The score to the film is also top-notch and the film is well-shot, there's more thought put behind the framing of the shots than your usual horror film. So, all in all, in spite of a few flaws, this is an excellent horror movie. It just works on a much deeper level than just a straight-up horror film, yet it also provides great horror. There's not many films that can claim this, it's usually either one or the other. It's just an exceptionally made and written film. I think it's a film that actually gets better the more you think about it, it's not something that you're just gonna watch and forget about it by the next day. Highly recommend film right here.",

    "review": "  When was the last no-nonsense horror movie that included actual scares? It may very well have been a decade, at the least. The Cabin in the Woods was good, but more as a mockery of how formulaic modern horror movies have become. The jump scares, the soundtrack that is more memorable than the score, and the shakey cam. Sweet Jesus, am I sick of the shakey cam. It Follows breaks away from all of those tropes, and is more akin to the old-school horror movies of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Halloween was the movie that came to mind. This is not a slasher movie though. There is no story behind what follows. It's some sort of material ghost that you can only see if it follows you at some stage in your life. And if it's following you, it will kill you in a sadistic, inhumane way. In order for it not to follow you, you have to have sex with someone, then that person will be followed. That is, unless it kills that person and starts following you again. With this paranoid of an atmosphere, I may point to The Thing as being more similar. What really crawled under my skin is how open the world was, yet there was no way to escape that paranoia. No matter where a character was, it would always follow. That is brilliant enough as it is. On top of that, since only those caught in the sexual circle (and the audience) could see the \"monster,\" we, the audience, are then able to show plenty of empathy for those being followed. When no one else sees it, here we are, screaming, \"IT'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU. NOOO.\" Director David Mitchell never had to shout out, \"Look, the monster is there!\" He allows the audience to do that, and thus we can become part of the group of heroes. That aspect is probably why I thought of Halloween, along with the fact that our main characters are all teenagers/young adults. Parents want no business with this, and the characters know not to drag them into it. Oh, and the score sounds very inspired by John Carpenter, and Brian Eno too. No single theme stood out for me, but in the context of the movie, the synth waves sunk me in my seat.And about empathy. David Mitchell, also the screenwriter, ditched any cultural references in character development. The only sign of it being modern day is one character's eBook makeup clamp. I don't think I saw any cell phones, not that they would have been handy anyway. It may seem unimportant, but without the necessity of cell phones, It Follows felt rather ageless. None of the characters were jabbing at modern celebrities. They were watching B-movies from the 1950s, like all of the hipsters do. Everyone could act like human beings and not rave about sex until we accept each person as monster bait. That was awfully nice of David Mitchell to do. In fact, he only made one of the several sex scenes look pleasant. After the first one, and the mythos of the monster is explained, sex quickly became an act of desperate survival. So when Paul finally gets his wishes to be romantic with Jay, we're not rooting for them. We're frightened because either one of them could be next on the monster's kill list. And they know it! Yeah, if you're a horror fan, I'm sorry that you're spending your time in reading this long review. Why don't you just watch It Follows and join me in a song of praise for a possible new era of horror?",

I'd not only call this one of the best horror films of the year, but one of the best in the last 20 years. It Follows successfully avoids everything that's been killing the genre. There's no box-office friendly PG-13 rating, it's not a remake, there's no excessive gore or torture, and no stupid found footage gimmick. This is classic suspense in the vein of Halloween, Don't Look Now and Rear Window. This is a horror movie that takes a uniquely simple premise and gets every bit of mileage out of it. This movie doesn't use cheap jump scares, it focuses on common psychological fears and paranoia. The direction is amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous, the acting is superb, and the retro 80s synth score is extremely unnerving. Is this every horror fans dream come true? No. Because this movie is different, and not everyone likes movies that are different. Some people just want the same old, same old. Is this a perfect horror film? No. There are some gaps in logic, especially in the third act. But none of it ever bothered me because this movie creeped me out and stayed with me days after I'd seen it. And I honestly can't remember the last time a horror film had that effect on me. If you're looking for gore and random loud noises, this isn't for you. This is classic 70s/80s inspired horror and gets my highest recommendation.",

The premise demands some sex scenes, and these were actually done tastefully and without gratuity. All of the nudity in this movie is meant to scare you, but after the third or fourth example, it's just irritating. That having been said, I would recommend it to anyone who wants an original horror movie and doesn't mind that aspect.",

They talk about great performances and metaphors for teen sexuality and a really uniquely terrifying film. But the film I watched was shit and excruciating to watch and it ruined my day. Sitting there in the theater watching these long ugly scenes, with shit characters and smelly dialogue and this blaring synthesizer music that must have gone on for 60 mins straight; and looking across at my date who gives me a troubled smile that seems to say \"You really fucked up with this film that you said was really good, we could be hanging at the pools right now\"",

I haven't seen a decent horror movie since Babadook and was hoping that this film would occupy a spot on \"my list\". I was insurmountably let down by this movie. As a 26 year old male, the fear factor inspired by this movie seemed like it was written for tweens who have just had a sex ed course about the hazards of intercourse. If you have an irrational fear of sex then this movie is for you. I think the main reason this movie received decent reviews was its original thinking and great soundtrack. I would not recommend it, I felt little tension with no fear. Big let down for me.",

A casual act results in someone being tagged for destruction by an implacable, relentless enemy. In this case, it's sex. This is the sort of film that acts as an anecdote to those grubby found footage things: it's luxuriantly composed and shot in and around Detroit using wide-angle lenses and is lovely to look at. Considering the fear revolves around the inevitable reappearance of the follower, the tension is kept at a high simmer all along. Recommended.",

Now it seems that movie audiences don't have the patience or insight to understand that a purposeful threat, ever-moving and seemingly unstoppable is actually more frightening than adrenaline-fuelled zombies or disease-stricken mutants rapidly swarming their prey. Definite echoes of a prime John Carpenter but with the thoughtfulness of David Cronenberg combine to make one of the best horrors in recent years.",

A killer soundtrack akin to Halloween and sharing some camera moves styled after Carpenter and Kubrick, It Follows is extremely creepy and pulls you in pretty much from the get go and provides enough chills throughout the proceedings. Defintely one of the stronger horror films to come out indie or otherwise since most likely Let the Right one in in the late Aughts. A can't miss.",

    "review": "  Semi Spoiler ahead.It Follows was one of the most suspenseful movies I've seen in a long time. It was dark, mysterious and genuinely had you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The cinematography and music was a masterpiece.The movie followed a mysterious and interesting path that constantly had you wondering what does this all mean? Where does 'it' come from, why is it here, how are they going to solve the problem. You want them to solve the problem. You don't want to feel that 'it' can follow you forever and you can't do anything about it. If Mitchell wanted you to leave the movies feeling agitated, wanting more but also disappointed because of unanswered questions, then he did a great job.The movie however, becomes repetitive to the point where you almost need the above answered. Leaving an open ending leaves you one of two ways, happy because that's how you like your horror, or intrigued to the point where you'll want to research more on the meaning behind the movie. BUT - the intention is not to really give you any reasoning, which adds to 'its' never ending journey. It's also the reason I kept double checking that my door was locked every night for a week before going to bed after seeing it. I still needed some closure, so I researched more on the movie.The thing that put me off was the Director, David Mitchell's comments on the film and where 'IT' came from, \"I'm not personally that interested in where 'it' comes from.\" BUT WE WANT TO KNOW. The fact the film was thought up from dreams Mitchell had when he was young just made everything more disappointing. I'd have rather he lied. Give genuine horror fans something to believe in. Other than that, I bought the film upon release and pan on watching it on an eerie night. It's that good.",

I can tell you, although it is not \"terrifying\" as the consensus claims, it is VERY VERY creepy, and really haunting. The movie is very stylish, and has an eighties 'feel' to it, and I really liked it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to fans who love gore, or movies like 'Carrie', 'The Shining' or other similar stuff, but it is a really good watch that had me very unsettled!! :D I am so glad, as a horror movie (and novel) fan, that movies like this and 'The Babadook' are being made!!!

The premise is really good but comes off completely dull and boring thanks to the director trying WAY too hard to make the movie feel like a late seventies movie. The result is a movie acted by dull characters that comes off way too dull. Horror from the 70s was slow but riveting. This was not. Adding the synth soundtrack also screamed that the director was trying too hard to make it a 70s movie. Thinking you can electrify a giant swimming pool with some house appliances also made me lose all respect for the characters intelligence level as well.

This film is more sleek, professional and crafted better than most films with a budget towering closer to $50 million. An impressive feat to say the least. The film is masterful from every perspectives. Mitchell has created a sort of alternate world in which his characters and story reside. This world feels \"familiar\" but somehow none of it is quite right. It seems like we are in a sort of dream where everything seems like it could be from another era -- even as far back as the mid-70's -- yet there are cell phones and modern cars, but there do not appear to be any modern televisions or computers. Instead, this is a world filled with typewriters, somewhat out-dated medical supplies and odd mixtures of clothing/hairstyles that don't quite seem \"current\" or right. This disoriented world helps Mitchell achieve a deeply creepy vibe that starts almost immediately. \"Horror\" never feels like the main goal of this movie. Mitchell is more concerned with psychology, paranoia, sex. And most specifically a sort guilt or worry attached to casual sex. The lead characters fears are immediate and are presented as \"fact\" -- these paranormal stalkers are unnerving. As her fear/paranoia take over her life, she finds herself facing an ethical decisions which quickly dismisses. Jay is being stalked not only by some sort of paranormal rage, but guilt as well. The importance of this smart and polished movie is the way Mitchell manipulates every aspect of his production to create an almost immediate tone of danger/doom that is so fully articulated -- this \"tone\" becomes a character. More profoundly creepy than scary, It Follow slips under your skin long before you recognize it.",

These are not your typical high school/college students that you hope die soon after the movie starts. Instead you care about them, they care about each other, and they make some shocking, jaw-dropping choices that are not stupid but complex and fascinating and speak to the larger themes at work in the movie.Let me also point out the amazing movie score. It resembles the best horror scores of all time, but adds modern elements for a soundscape that weaves back and forth between reality and the supernatural. It works so well with the movie and editing, helping to make the movie even more frightening, if that is possible.",

With phenomenal direction, a haunting score, excellent cinematography, and a strikingly original story. This film is not only one of the best films of 2015, but also one of the best horror films of the best decade. And leaves us with an amazing sting of an ending.",

If that is David Robert Mitchel's idea of horror then he should take a look at the reflection of my sweaty ballsack in a bird birth on a hot summers eve then he might be a bit more qualified to write horror. The film should be renamed people sitting around looking sad. It's basically an STI with a grudge!",

    "review": "  Writer and director David Robert Mitchell has a very simple, very scary idea: imagine being followed everywhere you go by a lone figure that's slowly but surely creeping towards you and that no-one else can see. Unfortunately, the idea doesn't quite work in practice, at least not as a feature length film. For most of its running time, It Follows is atmospheric, engrossing and often strikingly beautiful. But cheap jump scares and an absurd climax seriously undermine it, with Mitchell either unable or unwilling to commit fully to his premise. It's a shame - this could've been great.",

    "review": "  It may be slow, but it is not dumbIt Follows is like a breath of fresh air in the horror genre. First of all the premise is quite unorthodox and interesting. Secondly it provides a fine blend of psychological horror along with a few jump scares as well. The somewhat ambiguous approach of the film though may face a divided response. The horror element here is something which is referred to only as \"it\" and \"it\" follows only one target person at a time. A person becomes a target through sexual encounter with a person who is currently a target. Thus one can pass the curse of \"it\" to a person by having sex with that person. Interesting right? There isn't much light shed into the origin of \"it\" but as the film goes on we learn slowly about the functioning of \"it\" but never its origin. The ending is ambiguous and didn't work so well for me this time but considering most of the film relies on ambiguity(ie.how the audience interprets) the ending is fine.It Follows is a slow burning film, so have patience and let the plot and suspense build up. The best aspect I felt was the haunting soundtrack and the strong cinematography. It totally establishes the gloomy atmosphere. The script could have revealed a bit more about \"it\" but some open ends are fine for me (might not be for all). There were many loose ends I felt. There may not be any popular faces still the acting was quite believable for an horror film.Another similar recent horror movie comes to mind is \"The Babadook\". Both of these are thought provoking Psychological horror films unlike the rehashed, unoriginal, jumpy and predictably bland horror films we are getting these days. If you liked \"The Babadook\" I suggest you don't miss this one. It has its flaws but I would appreciate it for its originality. If you were totally sucked into the film's atmosphere and story then for days you will feel like checking around if someone is following when you are alone. This low budget indie film I believe will be a cult horror classic.Rating: [3.5/5]",

Is awesome .. the direction of David .. cinematography is spectacular, terrifying and very alarming and especially the soundtrack of this movie which creates a terrifying and disturbing atmosphere ... very good movie ..

    "review": "  What they did right: 1. Well done on the score. the music leaves nothing that will stay in your head, but fits the genre and the movie very nicely. 2. The acting was decent. Applause for them all doing a nice job coming off as normal people that react in believable ways. 3. Great shots and the general ambiance of the Michigan neighborhoods that I know so well really put a bullseye in the \"Anytown USA\" factor. Good attention to detail. Additional points for making me unable to date the film by mixing up the styles and technology. I liked that. 4. Successfully added suspense with minimal jump scares. This is the only thing that is making me understand the high reviews. People are just so desperate for true suspense in films, we'll take whatever we can get!What they did wrong:1. The ending. Really fell apart there. A lot of potential that ended flat and with messy, nondescript scenes. If they had just showed Paul walking in Tokyo or anywhere distant, that would have been more acceptable. Being that this is getting such good reviews, I'm sure we'll get that kind of scene in 2 or 3 or 6.2. The premise is provocative and alludes to the intrinsic basis in most horror films. That's neat. That's also about where that ends. Again, maybe having this STD from Hell is what's causing all the spine tingling, rave reviews. I don't know. To me, it's fairly dumb and classless. 3. The fear just isn't there for me. As I said, they managed a level of suspense rarely seen today, but the premise kills the fear factor. Just go bang someone young, horny and far away is the obvious solution. And the 1 death scene we got to view was far more disturbing than it was scary. 1. Just 1. So no, I'm not riding this train of praise for It Follows. I'm not fulfilled in any way after watching this movie. The best part about it was the realism of the shots and the environment. Other than that, this is Horror on Prozac.",

    "review": "  Dear Horror genre, Back in the day, nightmares, sleepless nights, and nightlights were invented because of you. Figures were found in my closet and I was left breathing underneath my blanket, sweating, in hopes for \"it\" to go away because of you. Fast forward to today, nothing has resonated with me. You no longer leave me biting my nails away or pulling me towards the edge of my seat. Perhaps age has gotten the best of me, but \"It Follows\" is the best horror movie to have come out since \"The Cabin in the Woods\".However, there's a huge misconception with \"It Follows\": this is not particularly a traditional horror movie. Some say it's a terrifying masterpiece and others say this is dreadfully boring. So then, let's bring clarity to this debate: what makes a scary movie scary? If loud jump scares does your bidding, this movie is not scary. But let's be real -- the horror genre lost its traction a long time ago. Why? Horror movies are completely dependent on jump scares. Screw tension, screw a nightmarish premise, let's throw in that good ol' violin screech. This very dependency raped the contemporary horror genre. As a result, audiences have bought the lie that scary movies are terrifying because of how high you jumped at these jump scares. You're calling that horror? That's just loud sounds.\"It Follows\" combats traditional horror tropes with inventive devices. Coupled with a slow building tension, it's easy to say that \"It Follows\" is more closely identified as a more moody and chilling creeper than a fright-fest of jump scares. But there's no denying it, this film gave me the goosebumps. Kudos to director David Robert Mitchell for always making audiences feel claustrophobic with its smart use of its score and camerawork. Everything from its 360 revolving camerawork that shows something new with every angle, to its lingering shots, \"It Follows\" has perhaps the best cinematography to hit the horror genre ever alongside the impeccable \"The Shining\". But to be exact, this film does more as a film than a popcorn horror flick will ever do. With ambiguous shots and events that are open for debate, \"It Follows\" transcends higher than any \"Paranormal Activity\" movie will ever do. To say the least, I enjoyed this picture more so as an artistic film more so than a horror film.\"It Follows\" has an incredibly creepy premise harnessed with fantastic cinematography and a genuine tension that left me breathless and waiting to learn more. It does not quite reinvent the wheel, but it sure did rejuvenate a dying genre.",

    "review": "  There are so many meager horror movies released nation-wide every year (Annabelle, Poltergeist, to name a few recent ones), and there are a few gems like \"It follows\" that cut through the morass and are barely noticed. While mainstream American Horror continues to disappoint in many of the same ways it has been for decades, the last couple of years we have begun to see what looks like a promising new wave of Horror directors emerging from the New Zealand, Australian, UK and American Indie Movements. \"It follows\" is one of the best horror movies of the past decade, a rarity among modern horror - it's unique and spells out very little for the audience by focusing entirely on eerie atmosphere and constant suspense. Newcomer director David Robert Mitchell and Jennifer Kent (The Babadook, another horror movie not to be missed) are breathing fresh life into a struggling genre. They are directors to keep your eyes on in the upcoming years. Overall, it's a beautifully shot, spare horror thriller with an amazing retro-analog synth score that keeps you tense and engaged throughout. The brilliant musical score elevates the film and provides a retro feel similar to John Carpenter's \"Halloween\".Low on bloody gore but high on atmosphere, most of which is wonderfully generated by simple shots such as roads, trees a gate or a swimming pool. These and many other ordinary compositions have been lit and captured in a way that gives the film its eerie sense of menace and dread. It is also good to be able to report that the film does not rely on gimmicky shock tactics to raise the hairs on your neck. In fact, there are surprisingly few jumps to be had. Still, this doesn't prevent the film from being quite terrifying.The movie is slow at times, but the scary parts really do pay off. This film has a very simple concept when it comes to the \"monster\", however it really does a great job in building the tension. The moment I watched it, it became an instant classic to me. If you enjoy the old horror of Halloween, you will love this movie. Mitchell and Kent understood perfectly, that horror isn't all about stupid jump scares, blood and gore - it's about messing with your mind and creeping inside your skin. \"It follows\" does both really well and works incredibly well on a surface-level viewing. The film will suck you into its dreamlike reality and make you care about its sympathetic and well-rounded characters. It moves at a relatively easy pace, but the haunting atmosphere and pounding electronic score will leave you twitching in fear and anticipation. The dread of the unstoppable and unrelenting force pursuing them is never lost on the audience. Rather than settling for cheap scares, the film creates a building tension which it maintains for almost the entirety of the running time.",

Unfortunately, I found that the awesome idea behind the film and the originality and attractiveness of the camera work are watered down by the pace and mood of the film that make it a tad boring at parts, predictable and a bit too subtle to even be acknowledged.

    "review": "  It Follows is a very good movie,which it doesn't rely on jump scares or other things that most horror movies this days are relying on and naturally are failing.This pays so much tribute to older horror movies and does it great.The acting is good especially the main girl does a great job,the editing is great and the camera moves in a perfect style.The cinematography is awesome especially considering that is has such a low-budget.This really should have gotten a wide release everywhere because it's worthy. Unfortunately it's not what most people have said it is the scariest movie ever,that's not true,I mean it's scary at times but that's not what the overall movie is,it mostly has big tension build up perfectly and that's what makes the movie for me.I'm so glad it's rated R so we can enjoy a good and masterfully done 2015 horror movie. In the end I'll just say that this movie succeeded at what is was going for and that's more than enough to love this movie.",

I don't know how in the world this got such a high rating, but you would be better off giving your money to a homeless person or getting a happy meal. Trust me, it would be a far better experience. The dialogue and acting is an abomination. And there is this girl who reads random quotes from a kindle in a clam shell. It has all the suddenness of a early eighty's horror film complete with bad synthetic music yet it carries no other qualities of a film. Just don't waste your money",

In fact, for most of the time this movie is boring and sleepy. The original ideia comes by 20mns after the film starts, and it delivers with smartness and ability, but in my opinion, since we now know the premise the movie fails until the end. We have nothing new to see until the credits roll. We have some hight points here and there (I remember the beach and the pool scene) .. but man.. The inescapable sense does not exist. The director didnt give me that. I want some goosebumps. Stay only for the peculiarity. The Good: the pool scene... I guess.The Bad: this is not horror.. maybe thriller? Or a little YA sci-fi with independent execution? I don't know.The Ugly: err.. the new ground that the movie enters it's nice.",

    "review": "  This is the horror film I've been waiting for! A film that is very retro in its style and execution. It Follows is a movie that is pure '80s horror, much in the style of John Carpenter or David Cronenberg. Fantastic cinematography, a chilling and creepy synthesizer score, great performances, and the biggest compliment I can give it is that it takes time in developing a mood and atmosphere. I have never felt so uneasy during a movie since I don't remember when. Some may get irritated at the film's pace or its lack of modern-day horror tropes (i.e. non-stop jump-scares, loads of gore, and obnoxious, stupid characters). It Follows is a cinematic gift for horror fans. It's great to see a film go back to a filmmaking style that works. One of my favorites for 2015!",

    "review": "  A fresh face to the horror genre, David Robert Mitchell has created a new classic with the clever, engrossing fright-fest, It Follows, a metaphor for the dangers of STDs and unprotected sex. The best of the horror genre involving teens and young adults always finds new and inventive ways to punish the horny. Pretty Jay gets busy in a parking lot with this new mysterious guy she's been seeing. But it isn't long before he gives her the bad news: he just pasted something on to her, and she needs to stay out of its reach or suffer the horrific consequences. Only the infected can see the terrifyingly, banal and often naked specters which relentlessly, at a deliberate pace come right at you. This is a great take on the often laughable \"slow walker\" syndrome that makes so many horror movies laughable. Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers often move so slowly it's a wonder they ever catch a victim. Same thing here but the idea is wherever you go it just keeps coming in your direction. A trip across town might buy you a few hours respite, but it's gonna catch up to you eventually. The only cure: perpetuate the problem by passing it on to someone else and hope they pass it on with the same warning because this evil works its way back to the source over time. The talented young cast is more than game for the thrills and chills, and the plot is always clever and exciting. It Follows is the latest in a horror renaissance over the past few years with films like The Guest, You're Next, Josh Whedon produced The Cabin in the Woods, and All the Girls Love Mandy Lane. All of these have a decidedly 1980's vibe which is refreshing and nostalgic. Make sure you check this out in a theater to get the full dreadful effect.",

It has a generous share of tension and suspense, it is masterfully crafted(seriously, just look at that camerawork) and it has a very effective starting premise.

More precisely, what the film is lacking is a deeper, more detailed story. And it is a shame, because all of the very good aspects are somehow wasted on a story that takes the same course most b horror flicks take. Yes, the film is effective, it is very well executed, but as it reaches its final act you kinda wish that it would deliver more than you'll know will deliver. Something like an underlining story, or some palpable leads(that would be even more fun).Also, there are some laughable moments here and there, but these are so common in horror flicks that it is difficult to establish - sometimes - whether they are deliberate or not. All in all, even with its flaws, this is still better than the average horror flick, but given its praise and premise, I really hoped for more.My two cents: 3.75/ 5.",

    "review": "  Es uno de los filmes recientes de horror m�s comentados, y ya pude ver porqu�. Ya que la pel�cula recupera esa sensaci�n de \"horror real\" que aportaban ciertos filmes de los 70s y 80s, donde realmente deseaban (y lograban) asustar a la audiencia. El filme as� mismo, no solo recupera el legado de filmes de horror de la \"vieja escuela\" sino que les hace un tributo con ingeniosas y muy sutiles elementos. Pero sin olvidarse de que es un filme a presentar a una nueva generaci�n de audiencia. Por ende, el resultado visual es una mezcla perfecta entre los �ngulos de c�mara en filmes de horror de los 70s pero incorporando el estilo moderno de cine independiente empleado en el nuevo milenio. Y uno de los factores claves es la m�sica instrumental, donde sin duda, creando una banda sonora instrumental totalmente original pero que es evidente que fue compuesta pensando en los filmes de horror 70s, donde sin duda \"Halloween\" es la mayor influencia elegida, pero igualmente rescatando herramientas en filmes m�s contempor�neos como \"The Ring\" (en cualquier de sus versiones). El filme realmente crea una atm�sfera de horror que te mantiene tenso, a la expectativa, y asust�ndote incluso antes que a los incautos personajes. Entonces es perfecta? En mi humilde opini�n no, ya que tiene dos problemas en mi apreciaci�n: Uno, el m�todo elegido para transferir la \"maldici�n\" de la trama, donde es por medio de relaciones sexuales. O sea, un ente multiforme te persigue a donde quiera que vayas, pero si deseas evitar que te alcance y te mate, debes \"transferir\" la maldici�n a otra persona y la forma es teniendo sexo con esa otra persona, pero si esa otra persona muere, la maldici�n se te \"reversa\" nuevamente a ti. El mismo director/guionista admite que mientras filmaba la pel�cula, evitaba decir en voz alta el m�todo de la maldici�n ya que decirlo en voz alta, hac�a que sonara rid�culo, y tiene raz�n. El sexo ha sido un factor inherente en los filmes de horror desde siempre, donde inclusive en filmes como la saga \"Scream\" recalcaban que siempre cualquier que hubiera tenido sexo en la trama mor�a, mientras que la protagonista usualmente \"casta e inmaculada\" era quien sobreviv�a. Por lo que esto es b�sicamente una re-interpretaci�n de esa \"regla no escrita\" de filmes de horror combin�ndolo con la popular \"maldici�n\" de The Ring, donde un cassette de VHS era la herramienta. Por lo que, qu� suena m�s implausible en la bizarra l�gica de los filmes de horror? Un cassette de VHS maldito, �, pasar una maldici�n por medio de relaciones sexuales? Supongo que no hay una respuesta f�cil. En cuanto el filme, la segunda objeci�n de mi parte es la conclusi�n (no, no la voy a spoilear, tranquilos), pero donde aunque hay una t�pica escena climax, dif�cilmente se puede considerar un final, y ciertamente aunque muchos filmes de horror siempre dejan abierto un portillo para posibles secuelas, aqu� creo que realmente no dan un respiro a la audiencia o a los protagonista y donde el filme concluye simplemente porque la pel�cula deja de mostrar im�genes y pasa a los cr�ditos, sin brindar un cierre aceptable. Sin embargo, aunque la premisa suena rid�cula y no aporta un buen final, no se puede negar que el desarrollo de la pel�cula es filmado con profesionalismo, extraordinario cuidado a la fotograf�a y m�sica instrumental, y una genuina atm�sfera que te asustar� llen�ndote de escalofr�os, por lo que definitivamente, a�n con mis objeciones, es un filme que recomiendo positivamente.",

    "review": "  Why have so many critics been duped by this film? Director David Robert Mitchell's horror movie drips with faux \"Virgin Suicides\" atmosphere and oozes \"style\" over substance, with the exception of the solid performances from his cast. The trendy synth music serves only to irritate with its hipster desperation and derails any chance his scenes have of creating terror. Stop filling your movies with so much fucking score, film makers of the modern age. The lack of clearly established rules by which the supernatural force (the \"it\" of the title) operates should have been an invitation for the director to create a story of compelling suspense and of the unexpected. Instead we have a poorly paced narrative (this film drags like a wounded dog) replete with frustratingly unanswered questions and inconsistencies. The \"conclusion\" illustrates that the key concept was only partially explored, and with a poverty of imagination and an over-investment in trendiness, it is ultimately squandered. Perhaps not a complete failure - there are a handful of effective scenes - but certainly a wasted opportunity and a genuine disappointment. The 96% rating at Rotten Tomatoes reminds me that this site is not always an accurate meter for determining what to see next.",

    "review": "  It Follows recycles familiar teenage horror tropes - a girl alone in a house, evil forces banging on a door - but its mood is dreamy. Seldom do you feel manipulated by exploitative formulas. The violence, when it comes, is sudden, and the camera doesn't linger over the gore. Despite borrowing cleverly from the best, It Follows still manages to feel like no other example in recent years - tender, remarkably ingenious and scalp-pricklingly scary. It's terrific. It's about many things, but dread infuses them all. You won't be grossed out. You'll be creeped out. And that's a lot more satisfying. No matter its conceptual intentions, It Follows never ventures too far from visceral horror. Mitchell populates a number of scenes with well-timed jump scares as the being frequently bursts out of the shadows or appears in unexpected forms, while the score provides a screaming punctuation mark. It Follows doesn't try to get viewers to jump out of their seats. Instead, employing the time-honored technique of the \"slow build\", it pressures fingernails to dig into arm rests. It Follows is well worth a look and if you go in not expecting the second coming of horror, you'll likely have a good time with this unique, slowburn supernatural fable. Smart, original, and above all terrifying, It Follows is the rare modern horror film that works on multiple levels -- and leaves a lingering sting.VERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent... (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

    "review": "  Esta semana hemos ido dos veces al cine. �Dos jodidas veces! �Twice! �Due volte!. Hac�a tanto tiempo que no pasaba algo as� que siento una extra�a emoci�n solo de pensarlo. Y adem�s he visto dos pel�culas incre�bles. �Dos! La virgen santa. Tan incre�bles las dos que una de ellas, la que he visto hace escasas horas, me ha llenado la cabeza de pajaritos terror�ficos y soy absolutamente incapaz de conciliar el sue�o.  Me gusta el cine, me gusta ir al cine, me gusta esa oscura y fr�a sala, con es aroma de productos de limpieza ultra r�pida entre peli y peli, mezclado con el salado olor de las palomitas y de los alientos y sudores humanos. Me gusta escuchar la respiraci�n de la gente, sus susurros al entrar, sus quejas cuando el temita de la publicidad se hace insoportable.  Me encanta el cine, de verdad, pero no voy pr�cticamente nunca. Creo que una de las razones principales es que el tipo de pel�culas que me gustan no suelen estrenarse en las salas de Espa�a, supongo que por el escaso �xito econ�mico que tienen la mayor�a. Pero en los �ltimos a�os, gracias en parte a peque�os festivales maravillosos, en parte a la moda del gusto por lo elitistamente desconocido (moda que en m�s de una ocasi�n me ha puesto de muy mala hostia), es posible degustar y devorar joyitas varias en pantalla grande. Llevaba un tiempo esperando para ver It Follows. La ten�amos en casa, por supuesto, pero guard�bamos la esperanza de que en alg�n momento se estrenara en los cines de Madrid. Y lleg� el d�a. Y fuimos a verla. Y no defraud� para nada. Una querida amiga me la hab�a recomendado. Una de estas amigas que nunca se equivoca respecto al cine, una de esas amigas a la que siempre le pregunto el t�pico qu� has visto �ltimamente y cuyas respuestas siempre me dejan satisfecha: o me habla de alguna joya desconocida y crea en m� unas maravillosas expectativas o hemos visto lo mismo y nos enfrascamos en conversaciones interminablemente enriquecedoras. Pero volviendo al tema; hace unos meses me dijo que hab�a visto It Follows, hab�a ido ella sola a la sesi�n matinal, sesi�n ya de por si solitaria, pero ese d�a lo fue especialmente ya que no hab�a nadie m�s en la sala. �Ella sola en la sala viendo una oda al terror juvenil! �Ella sola ante la pantalla viendo como David Robert Mitchell, con su ritmo lento y exquisito, ha convertido esta historia adolescente en 100 minutos de bell�sima ansiedad! La envidi�. La envidi� mucho. Con envidia de la mala. Me cont� tambi�n que al salir, a pesar de ser la hora del almuerzo, no pudo reprimir el horror al volver a casa, mirando por encima del hombro a cada paso, en una calle atestada de gente parsimoniosa.  No me cuentes m�s, le dije, alargando la \"a\" para darle un toque desesperado a mi s�plica. Voy a verla en cuanto la estrenen, le dije, rotunda y convencida de que si la ve�a en las mismas circunstancias que ella iba a estar unos cuantos d�as sin pegar ojo. Cuando entr� me enfad� un poco. No estaba yo sola en la oscura sala, hab�a m�s gente. Mucha m�s gente. Gente a mi alrededor, gente normal, gente que me resultaba conocida, algunos que me atemorizaban un poco, otros de cara amable, todos sentados y atentos a la pantalla. Todo correcto. Todos quietos. Esperando al apagado total y al final del silencio. Y empez�. S� que esta noche tendr� unas bell�simas pesadillas en consonancia con la incre�ble fotograf�a, aderezados con una fant�stica y escalofriante banda sonora (DisasterPeace) envuelta en colores e im�genes terror�ficamente maravillosas. S� que correr� sin moverme y pegar� golpes sin fuerza. Tendr� toda la noche ese sentimiento de desasosiego que inund� hoy la sala y sonreir� perturbada al despertar, descubri�ndome a m� misma mirando por la ventana, con el est�mago en un pu�o esperando que no... por favor no...",

I'll admit I wasn't watching it to be intellectually stimulated, I was watching it to get the crap scared out of me (or at least for a good story). But this movie did no such thing! Call it what you want, but it was essentially a movie about a deadly Sexually Transmitted Poltergeist!!! It cant be in her mind or some clever play on a nightmare, solely because ****SPOILERS**** HER FRIENDS SAW IT (and by \"IT\" I mean the actions of the \"ghost\" because the could never actually see the \"ghost\" [If you can call it ghost, because it seemed to possess few ghostly qualities.]) Also there were waaaaay to many points in the movie where the story didn't add up, and it seemed to blatantly favor the main character (by this I mean, others in the movie have died in ways that she too was exposed to, and did the same as others did- yet her outcome was victorious...if that makes sense. I'm trying not to spoil the movie for people who still want to waste their time with this movie.) My point being I seen nothing \"Artistic\" or \"Thought Provoking\" about this movie, you have to try too hard to get real meaning from this movie. At best it can be used as a PSA for abstinence in Sex Ed class. If you disagree, please show me where I'm wrong. I am always more than happy to see things in more than one way, and I am most curious as to what 65% of you seen differently. I'm not here to troll the internet at 4am giving negative reviews on movies, I was just utterly shocked that so many of you gave a good review- my opinion had to be heard for the apparent few that felt like me.",

    "review": "  Sorry, but this isn't original. It fits in the body horror genre and belongs along certain films like 'Teeth' and Cronenberg's 'Shivers'. So calling it original is for the naive or amateur horror buffs. Now as for the film it's pretty stupid and slow moving. I felt like a zombie while watching it. My brain severely numbed by the whole experience. It's artistically driven and I'll give it that, but harbors a severe amount of artsy fartsy that I really couldn't help but laugh at certain times. Like the pool scene near the end where they try to electrocute the IT that follows while the main protagonist is in the pool. Like I said stupid. Overall, Hipster horror at it's finest. The only thing I would say that was missing was the MTV Films logo at the beginning.",

From the Babadook of 2014 to this gem of a film, It Follows depends on atmosphere, tension, dialogue, and a terrifying belief that whatever or whoever this thing it is, it always follows. David Robert Mitchell has created an instant classic, without the use of gore and cheap scares, but just sheer terror and the ability to make your mind believe this will never stop. Forget insidious, forget paranormal, or any of those other cheap thrills horrors, this movie will really scare you!",

    "review": "  Most modern horror films these days are just plain lazy in terms of storytelling and use the same cheap tricks over and over again to shock the audience instead of scare them. Most audiences seem to think that being shocked is the same as being frightened. This is definitely not the case and it follows is the rare horror film that attempts to affect you psychologically instead of relying on cheap jump scares and gore to shock you. While the film is not as unsettling as last year's babadook, It follows works due to its wholly original script and wonderful score that really helps to set the mood. The cast was great and i really enjoyed the climax as well as the ambiguous ending. My biggest flaw with It follows is that there was a certain scene that completely took me out of the film for a few minutes. There was no way the main character would have done such a thing while in danger. I really hope this is the start of horror movies making a comeback and more indie horror films like the babadook and it follows come out every year. B+",

Yeah, a mess even when a lot of nothing happens during most of its running time.What was once a neat trick with that 360� degree pan with the camera, quickly because a nuisance. It doesn't create any tension whatsoever and the idea for the haunting doesn't help either. It's just some dudes following you around. Worse is that the way the movie is shot doesn't allow for some tension to build, to scare you, giving most of the money shots away, minutes before they even happen.Maika Monroe is fairly solid here but the rest of the cast are just there, doing incredibly idiotic things. I get the dreamy approach but the movie becomes unintentionally hilarious, specially towards the end when logic goes out the window (and we're speaking of a horror flick here) and we're served with a pool scene that seems like it was made for a Scary Movie scene.Thematically it tries to be edgy and maybe that's why the \"critics\" liked it but it just doesn't add up and any sort of message about teens' sex lives, dst's and whatever never really comes across, leaving us scratching our heads in vain. Did she really screw the dudes in the boat? Does it matter? Do I even care? Nope.",

The soundtrack and the feel of the movie are notable upsides, but in the end, it's just not scary. At first the idea sounds creepy, but there's one thing, \"It\" is incredibly f****** slow. It's creepy for a little bit because you never know when or where \"it\" is going to show, but it gets kind of boring as the movie trails on. I think two people died in the whole movie, because once again, \"it\" is insanely f******* slow. \"It\" can always be out run, and it's so boring. Did I mention that, \"It\" is essentially the worst STD ever in the history of STDs. \"It\" is passed on by having sex with someone, ridiculous. This movie should be called \"Run away from the agonizingly slow killer ghost STD\"Verdict: D+Good direction, and a good score can't save this flick from ridiculous amount of plot holes, boring, and slow pacing with little payoff. Seeing some random person walk slowly towards the protagonist is only scary so many times, and then it gets pretty boring. And the naked old guy on the old roof? Come on now. So, \"It\" hijacked some random naked 60 year old man, walked who knows how far to climb a two story house, to stand on the roof naked? What? Why didn't \"It\" just hijack someone's body in the room with her?! This is what I mean, so how many plot holes.",

    "review": "  I went into this movie with a lot of hope. Some of my friends told me it was the next Babadook or Rosemary's Baby. (two of my favorite horror movie) But, did I get it? Well, no. But, before I get into the negatives I wanted to discuss all the positives. To begin with the score is infectious. It is an awesome blend of 80s retro music and modern techno. Next up is the acting. Malika Monroe kills it as the lead, Jay. Well then, again Malika Monroe kills every performance she's been in. Another positive this movie holds is its interesting and elusive concept of a monster that is transmitted like an STD. Finally the set pieces and costume designs are stylish to a fault.Now onto the negatives. Firstly this movie was not scary. I don't think I even flinched once in the one hour and forty seven run time. I don't find this to be a problem in most cases, for example the Babadook. In the Babadook, there are truly terrifying scenes and then there are some that just aren't scary but all the scenes in the movie build up the main theme of the movie. Unlike the Babadook, some of the scenes of this movie don't even come close to building up the theme of Paranoia. Instead they are filled with cheap and meaningless jump scares. Unfortunately its originality works against it. In the guise of ambiguity the much needed explanation to what or why everything is happening is neglected. Because of this the conclusion seems more bland than it truly is.For these reasons, I would give the movie \"It Follows\" a 6/10 or a B like \"Tomorrowland\" but unlike \"Tomorrowland\" I wouldn't recommend this movie.",

    "review": "  \"It Follows\" is a horror film directed by David Robert Mitchell. The cast includes Maika Monroe, Keir Gilchrist, Daniel Zovatto, Jake Weary, Olivia Luccardi, and Lili Sepe. Jay (Monroe) is a young college student with a new boyfriend. One night, the couple go to a play together. Out of nowhere, he pulls her out of the theater. Later that night, he and Jay have sex in the back of his car. Suddenly, he knocks her out and ties her up in a wheelchair. When she comes to, he informs her of this thing that's following him. He has passed it onto her, and now it will follow her. If it catches her, it will kill her and follow him again.The cast assembled is mostly unrecognizable. Maika Monroe is the lead actress and character in the film. She hasn't been in much, but she definitely knows how to act. I won't say her performance was award worthy, but it was rather impressive. All of the cast does a great job, despite the fact that all of their characters are replaceable. Jay is the only interesting character in the film, and even she isn't particularly deep. None of the characters are that interesting, but this can be overlooked because the scary horror elements make up for this.Despite a couple of juvenile jump scares, the film never looses it's tension. Constantly, there is a feeling of dread and horror felt. You never know what's going to be around the corner. The scary bits are not knowing who is or who isn't the thing following Jay. The audience is put into her shoes, constantly on edge and looking for the follower. This makes this horror film really effective. You constantly feel afraid and tense through the entire film. Possibly what makes this movie so powerful, is the underlying message of sexual dread. In order to pass the disease on, the one being followed has to have sex with someone. It's a very provocative theme, and it's very powerful.\"It Follows\" is a great modern day horror film. Maika Monroe gives a fantastic central performance, the direction is steady, and the dialogue is mostly solid. Despite it's slowness at times and shallow characters, this film was never boring. It's a haunting experience with brilliant horror and stunning cinematography by Mike Gioulakis. The horror is fueled by the haunting music, and the superb direction from Mitchell.",

    "review": "  This one surprised me. \"It Follows\" has all the moving parts necessary to suck- a nobody cast, a teenage-sex-gone-wrong scenario, ultralow budget, a retro aesthetic, little-to-zero information about the spooky ghost etc. etc. etc. and yet it consistently avoids every opportunity to become a stupid B-horror flick. In fact, it's really good. The use of unsettling angles and wide sweeps through desolate Detroit backdrops work insanely well. The actors, inexperienced as they may be, put on the performance of their lives and rival the best of the best. It's minimalist tone and sparse dialogue bring Larry Clark to mind. And the score is... incredible. Scary, original, expertly directed future classic.",

    "review": "  Indie horror is always looking for the Next Big Thing, and at the start of 2015, that movie was It Follows. Coming out of relatively nowhere, the second film by writer/director David Robert Mitchell was dubbed the real deal, and audiences flocked to see what all fuss was over. I would have been intrigued before the positive word-of-mouth namely because Mitchell made one of my favorite films of 2011, the understated and perfectly yearning ode to adolescence, The Myth of the American Sleepover. I dearly hoped that Mitchell was not another flash in the pan. In retrospect, I did not have need to fear. It Follows is unsettling, suspenseful, and borderline ingenious with its concept, but it also has some faults that mitigate its concluding power. Jay (Maika Monroe) is a normal 19-year-old girl going to college in Michigan until the night she sleeps with her object of desire, Hugh (Jake Weary). In her post-coital mediation, he drugs her, ties her to a wheelchair, and then waits. He wants to show her something, or more accurately someone (perhaps something is actually more appropriate). A woman slowly trudges toward them, the embodiment of a curse he passed on to Jay through sex. It will keep following her until it gets her and kills her. The only way she can protect herself is to sleep with someone else, to pass the curse onto a new recipient. Then the monster goes after them; however, once this newest curse-holder is murdered, the monster moves back up the ladder, attacking the next curse-holder. Once you have it, there's no getting rid of this curse, only delaying it. The top question with a horror movie is whether it provides enough suspense, spooks, and scares to jolt an audience, and in this regard It Follows is quite good; not as unsettling as last year's Babadook but still plenty unnerving and extremely well executed and developed. The opening is engrossing, with a teen girl constantly looking in the direction of the camera and clearly scared out of her mind. The camera has adopted the identity of the monster. The central premise is wonderful, rich with thematic potential about the alienation and anxiety of being a teenager navigating the world, but also intriguing enough that I always wanted a large expository info dump scene just to learn more about the rules or its history. Rare is the film, let alone a horror film, where I'm left desiring lengthy exposition. One of the clever developments of its monster is that it can adopt the appearance of anyone, including people close to you (though it rarely does this for an unexplained reason). That means anyone can be your doom and the only way to know is to double-check whether other people can see this menacing phantom as well. Imagine going the rest of your life always having to look over your shoulder, always having a little nagging doubt in your mind about whether or not this person or that person is real. The premise is well developed with sequences that draw out the tension and make us dread what's coming next or what may or may not be real. Now, slow-trotting fully naked people might not be a scarier monster than, say, Leatherface, but it's still alarming. The premise also allows the audience to imagine what course of action they would do if they were stuck in this situation. Would you doom an innocent human being to protect yourself? If so, would you be upfront about it and the ensuing danger? Would you formulate a plan like Hugh and drive long distances to provide further distance? If you thought you were being followed, would you immediately find a sexual partner? The clever premise gets your brain thinking of what you would do to survive and at what cost.There's a distinct Stanley Kubrick and John Carpenter vibe with the filmmaking, which will enhance the overall mood of the film or drive certain viewers crazy. The camera movements fall into very few selections, mostly slow pans, slow zooms, or long tracking shots with the subject routinely framed in the center. It's hard not to evoke feelings with The Shining, an all-time great horror film that likewise built a sense of foreboding terror. You're conditioned to feel that something bad is about to happen as the camera turns or hovers, waiting for the creepy thing to pop around the corner. It plays into second-guessing everything you see, taking away the illusions of safety, and the steady and controlled camerawork enhances this mood. The entire movie feels vaguely out of time, notably a capsule from the 1980s save for one strange inclusion of a wireless reading device. The musical score by Disasterpeace (nee Rick Vreeland) is another throwback to the 80s, and its fuzzy synth-drenched soundtrack smoothly blends in and enhances the atmosphere. If anyone caught Mitchell's previous film, you'll know that besides a wonderful eye for framing visual compositions, the guy has a very natural feel for developing realistic teenage characters milling about their relatable existences. It Follows is no different, and while I would stop short of saying that the characters have depth to them, they are realistically drawn and portrayed by actors who look and act like scared teenagers. The relatablility of unrequited feelings, or going out on a limb and getting your heart broken, of trusting the wrong people who have ulterior motives, is a universal pain that makes it all the easier to put ourselves in these unfortunate character's shoes. It also helps that, up until the final act, the characters defy the arc of rampant stupidity in horror. After realizing the danger she's trapped in, Jay actually seeks out the one person who she can get answers from, even if he's the same person who doomed her with the curse. It's unfortunate that the movie loses steam when it creeps into its third act and forces a solution and showdown with the monster that makes no sense whatsoever. I understand the need to feel like the teens can regain the upper hand or somehow outsmart the curse that doggedly follows them, but with everything presented, it's just not believable. For the entire movie, we've seen that this supernatural force doesn't really have a loophole in its system of rules. The only way to stave off annihilation is to pass it along and create a series of firewalls as protection with other sexual partners. Otherwise, it's relentless and like zombies the eventuality is what helps magnify the sense of dread. We even see it get shot in a hasty defense from the teens and the gunshots do nothing. And yet, this vital information doesn't seem to register with our band of teenagers. Their third act solution (spoilers): they're going to lure the following terror into a pool and... electrocute it. Huh? Why would a supernatural entity that has no shown any weakness to electricity, or any mortal dangers, be able to be killed? This plan makes no sense and not one character voices a counter-argument to what is proven to be a very bad plan. Maybe the point is that it's supposed to be bad, that it's an example of how desperate these characters have become that they would hold out hope for something that is completely inaccurate. After this failed plan, Jay does exactly what you'd expect with the boy who's been itching to jump her bones for the entire movie. He gets what he wants (physical copulation, being the white knight), she gets what she wants (flimsy security), and then the movie just kind of peters out and ends. I understand that Mitchell's extended point is that there is no happy ending possible and the characters will have to uneasily look over their shoulders for the rest of their lives. However, the point could have been made even without the third act. I wish It Follows could have found a better landing than just shrugging and saying, \"Well, what are you gonna do with curses, you know?\"Before the movie hits the skids in the third act, I was pondering the greater implications and logistics of its sexually transmitted curse. Does \"passing\" it along require some form of genital contact? Does it require fluid exchange? If you wear a condom, does the prophylactic also protect your sexual partner from the transmission? Does the curse function relatively the same for same sex couples? What about people with non-functioning parts below the waste? Can someone who suffers from erectile dysfunction pass the curse along? Can it be transferred onto inanimate objects? Can men ejaculate into some sort of container and then send the container into space via the space shuttle and be protected? Actually, banging an astronaut who's about to live on the space station or go to Mars might be the smartest move. I enjoyed thinking of a stratagem to best protect myself if I was caught in this scenario; even after passing it along and providing a buffer, you still always have to be on guard for the curse to move back up the ladder. My solution: have relations with a prostitute. This is probably a guarantee that the curse will be passed on within a 24-hour period, and even if that john is found and killed, chances are this prostitute may have already passed the curse along to a new client. If one cannot inoculate themselves from a supernatural STD-like curse with the aid of prostitutes, then there's no hope for the rest of us poor mortals. Anyway, my mind wandered a tad. It Follows may suffer due to the hype, the inconclusive resolution, and a third act that deflates, but it's still an extremely well executed horror thriller with a terrific concept at heart. The sense of dread is stark and the camerawork and storytelling draw out the tension until you feel you're about to break. It's more unnerving than traditionally scary, but it has a power that does stay with you, particularly its fascinating premise and the natural relatability of the characters and their choices. I don't know if this premise could sustain a sequel, especially with a villain that appears to be unstoppable, but that hasn't thwarted the horror genre before in its stampede at cashing in on success. It Follows is a solidly entertaining and creepy movie, but it's even more confirmation for me that David Robert Mitchell is going to be a filmmaker who has staying power. I'll be following him.

    "review": "  It Follows play out like an Arthouse Experimentation film with the horror genre implemented into it. It's excellently shot and has without doubt some of the best cinematography I've seen for quite sometime. The soundtrack has a very 80's retro vibe to it which fit in with the tone of film, the OST is pretty faultless and sets the mood for each scene. It's unquestionably reminiscent of many John Carpenter movies but unlike John Carpenter movies It Follows was not a scary film. However, what it fails in scares it makes up superbly in atmosphere. It Follows is an undeniably creepy movie which lacks in scares but gets major support from a fantastic soundtrack and some truly great cinematography.",

Beautifully shot and very deliberate in its storytelling, the film forces you to question everything you see, and everyone walking on screen, with its slow and scary curse, ever stalking, ever hunting. The film is strong in humor and allegory, sending up the familiar trope of \"first girl to have sex dies next.\" Demanding multiple viewings, this film is wrought with details...pay attention to the background...pay attention to everything. Like last year's \"The Babadook,\" this film suffers from over-marketing. Its not just a scary movie, it's a beautiful, smart, and carefully crafted film; many viewers will be frustrated that it is not a terror-a-minute scream-fest as promised by the trailers, which is a shame, because it really is so much more...it's a beautiful film.",

    "review": "  Never has the old adage \"The Devil is in the details\" been more pertinent than in writer-director David Robert Mitchell's horror triumph It Follows, which sees the film jumping from seeing a Straight-to-VOD release to one that slowly inched its way menacingly into international theatres as an unabashed psychosexual dive into the now irreverent dangers of sexually transmitted diseases, the fleeting innocence of youth and ultimately, the imminence of death.As Jay catches her breath and plays with shrubbery, all while speaking of her dreams to Hugh, It Follows revels in both the moments of youthful bliss and of the sheer animal panic that follow, at times both at the same time through the beautiful dreamscape cinematography. Set on the outskirts of a fictional Detroit that is stuck in a dreamy haze with an alarming lack of adults and having different elements fit together - rabbit eared television sets and e-Readers - but never making sense, there is a lot to take away from It Follows and its layers prove that as arthouse as the film gets - conventional modern horror films aren't meant to evoke deep thought, especially with different takeaways on each viewing -, It Follows eases itself well even with mainstream audiences.Mitchell subverts the conservative notion of sex out of wedlock and modern horror clich�s as deftly as he has the camera capturing the metaphysical dread of watching \"It\" slowly push towards the frame - the viewer - and encroach on the often wilfully unaware characters through the experimental use of the camera by Mike Gioulakis that turns each encounter - or near-encounter - into a different experience that would cause viewers to frantically scan the screen for \"It\". With every frame and false scare either painting a story or paying homage to the works of legendary horror filmmakers such as John Carpenter, each scene lends to the burgeoning sense of dread that swells with Disasterpeace's retro synth score.It's evidently a tale with a major emphasis on sex, as Mitchell quickly lays the intentionally uneven, unreliable ground rules for It Follows through exposition cleverly masked by an uneasy blend of terror and the grotesque, but the writer-director also strips away the beauty, or even the instant gratification, of the act through the very rules that make up the film's universe.As the film loosely says \"Have sex, but make it fast and hope the next person passes it along\", one character asks another after sex if they feel different, as they both coldly settle on the mutual feeling of indifference, the once beautiful act turns into a job, a task, a box in a checklist that the characters have to tick off to hopefully stall death. The very act of sex is an immediate death sentence in It Follows and it's a brilliant injection of fresh creativity into a genre that has slowly become comfortably saturated by hackneyed writing.",

    "review": "  An original. So this is about a young woman (Maika Monroe) who unwittingly makes the biggest mistake of her life: she has sex. Soon after the deed, she starts to be slowly pursued by a mysterious supernatural entity. If there's one thing I get excited for, it's an original horror piece. If something can truly affect me viscerally to the point where I am covering my eyes, that's where I award points within the genre. I can say without hesitation that It Follows is highly probable to wind up being the best horror movie of the year, not that it looks like there's going to be a whole lot of competition for the title. It pulls you in right away, presenting a situation where you are really not given a whole lot details, you're just thrust right in the thick of it. It's all amplified by this pulse pounding synthesizer score, and while I am unfamiliar with Richard Vreeland (aka Disasterpeace), I can say that this is the kind of work that guarantees him a bright future. It helps to underscore this feeling of dread that is ever-present throughout, and that is the biggest thing this film has going for it: while you may be able to delay your demise, it's eventually going to catch up with you. They are very clear in setting up the rules to this universe because this entity can look like anyone, almost utilizing dream logic for what's ultimately coming. It adds such a great dynamic to it, because you are constantly looking in the background, looking for the one person that's out of place. While the entity is only coming for you at a slow lumber, it's kind of like slow moving zombie rationale: it may not be today or even tomorrow, but it's going to get to you eventually, and that's what I admire the most about this: the captured feeling of inevitability. You can interpret metaphor here if you like, and this is the most effective abstinence video that you could possibly show to your children. I love that they don't ruin what they have here by overexplaining it, because much like real life, the less you know about something mysterious, the scarier it has the potential to be. It's an innovative concept, and once it starts, it doesn't let up as you watch this girl get pushed to the brink of madness. If suspenseful horror is your thing, you should go out of your way to check this out, because quality wise, I'd say this is right up there with The Babadook, which is good company to have.",

    "review": "  Audiences are used to horror movies being terrible. Horror, more than any other genre, is full of talentless hacks, tastelessness content, bad acting and bad writing. For those of us who love the genre it can be a challenge to find anything worth watching, which why I am so pleases to report that It Follows isn't just the best American horror movie in some time, but also one of the best films of the year so far. The story is simple. A girl goes on a date with a guy. They have sex. He drugs her, ties her up and tells her that he has given her a curse. Something is going to follow her, she can't let it touch her and the only way to get rid of it is to pass it on to someone else by having sex with them. The thing that follows can look like anyone, which creates a wonderful and terrifying paranoia because you never know if someone walking in the background is \"it\" or just a normal person. David Robert Mitchell raises the tension with long winding takes, and a score that reveals the very strong John Carpenter influence.  In terms of form It Follows has been billed as being revolutionary, but I think this is an overstatement. It obeys many of its genre tropes in the way we expect it to, and generally speaking doesn't play too much with the rules of horror. What makes the film, so good is that it is filled with characters that seem real. They are teenagers who genuinely care about each other and have real conversations about issues in their lives. Mitchell is more interested in his characters than his monster and in this case that is a great thing because these are characters worth knowing (Jay, the lead, and her sister in particular).  I'm not entirely sure what it is, and I won't speculate too much because I don't want to ruin anything, and being ambiguous is fun. However, there are lots of ghostly shots of empty house in Detroit where the film is set like the decay is following the main characters from the city into the suburbs.",

    "review": "  Intelligent, entertaining, and effectively scary, It Follows might ape some classic '80s thrillers, but it's a masterstroke of modern horror cinema all of its own. Sure, we've seen virginal teens stalked by homicidal maniacs but never by the stigma of losing one's virginity. This young adult rite of passage proves scary and anxiety-inducing enough without a lead-footed specter attached to it! The title boasts a true Truth in Advertising moment, with this sex-related affliction passed along in the form of a form-changing foot-dragger who never stops moving toward the protagonist. The material works on many levels but stops short of becoming too Meta because it is - at its jackrabbit-paced heart - a brilliantly staged straight-ahead horror flick. It makes you think but not too much because it would take away the fist-pumping fun of having the Bejesus scared out of you. With long takes and synthesized music that would feel at home on USA's Up All Night 30 years ago, It Follows waxes nostalgic but somehow feels timeless. The rotating faces of the unknown terror makes for a monster for the ages, especially considering the fact that the chased (not chaste, mind you) find themselves in a particularly vexing and highly emotional time of their lives. Judgement and comeuppance comes from any direction in an unrecognizable form as your hormones are red-lining? Scary beyond belief.In this R-rated horror flick, a young woman (Monroe) gets followed by an unknown supernatural force after getting involved in a sexual encounter. With an ace cast filled with fresh faced actors devoid of big names and marquee faces, John Robert Mitchell's lean atmospheric thriller nails the genre with every terrifying beat. It Follows looks cheap but the exquisitely staged frights are top shelf. Plus, it takes a skilled hand to make a digital flick purposely look like an 80s video rental creature feature. Youll follow this horror gem anywhere. Bottom line: Teenage Wraith-Land",

The Performances were pretty good even if no one of the actors stood out in perticular. I really liked the soundtrack/ score and it was kind of an retro blend with modern day loud noises (joke). The shot composition is really great because it fits the movie in a neat way, and the framing is very well done. The film itself is very beautiful looking and the whole thing had a nice pacing. There are some questions that are left unanswered but I feel that it was the point. There is some clich� characters and made it less original and some of the things that happened I thought was illogical.

This is the first movie review I have ever written. I dont know who sucked who's dick to give this movie such a great rating and review. I trusted you rotten tomatoes. And you fucked me. Fucked me long and hard Rotten Tomatoes.",

    "review": "  Damn it I wanted to love this movie. The premise is fantastic, and the characters, cinematography and music are genuinely fantastic, but what it builds in tension and scares, it tenfold looses with idiotic scenarios, unrealistic behaviors, and a ghost/monster that may or may not be able to be killed but can certainly be injured and stopped easily enough. In fact, the ghost-thing is barely a threat at all when you consider the facts. And because of this, the film itself falls flat as a horror. It's only the character's unrealistic fear if this thing that keeps the movie going. But the audience is likely done with this nonsense half way through. Not to mentioned the horrible ending... ugh.",

What could've made it better is if it dug deeper into the thing itself; she could've tried to learn more about the creature (which seems like a succubus/incubus type thing) and tried to find ways to get rid of the chain entirely. But no. This movie wasted the potentially amazing plot it had in exchange for three sex scenes and a plot centered around sex.

    "review": "  It is indie horror films like 'It Follows' that are the reason why i still have much faith in future of the horror genre. Whenever a film like this comes out where it manages to scare you from start to finish without using jump scares and other modern horror movie cliches i get really excited. This film utilised amazing camera techniques and sounds that alone just absolutely scare the crap out of you just like old, classic horror films used to. I found myself constantly trying to hide from the screen because the imagery was just so damn terrifying. Much of the film uses the idea that someone might be following you at all times to get you to always be in fear no matter what is happening. As well as being a device to scare the living daylights out of you it really helps to keep the story moving and adds to some pretty major plot points. Also there are scenes where this mysterious thing actually shows up and that is just the stuff of nightmares. I felt like a little kid looking up and getting the life scared out of me by anything that looked even remotely weird. In terms of the plot, the film does well to stay away from 95% of predictable moments and that really helps in a horror film so you don't have much time to brace for a huge scary moment (not a jump scare). In terms of performances, i thought they were pretty good all round, with the standout being Maika Monroe who i also remember did a great job in The Guest last year. You always bought into her actions and the way she reacted to certain events which made the film a lot more believable. Where the film let me down was towards the end. The ending sequence of the movie was still pretty damn terrifying but not as terrifying as the rest of the movie, it felt a little cheesy or messy and i was just taken out of the film for a little over 10 minutes. Not only did the ending sequence disappoint me but the very very end didn't work for me, there are quite a few films that do this and sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't and this time it didn't. So despite a disappointing ending, this directorial debut for David Robert Mitchell will keep you up for days with endless nightmares. - 8.1",

Director David Robert Mitchell doesn't go for the cheap jump scares, but rather utilizes the background, and lets the audience see the fears for themselves and shout at their screens to get Maika Monroe's \"Jay\" to run. It creates a very real fear that never goes away, with no cheap way out of tricking others (i.e. The Ring), and does away with modern day horror movie tendencies to quickly throw something at you, be it a real threat or secondary character finding the hero moments before their untimely demise - Mitchell focuses on creating a creepy atmosphere that ebbs into reality, somehow breaking the fourth wall, like other recent successes (e.g. Sinister and Insidious).",

It had a good concept and good idea, but she was the worst character that I have ever seen. Even Michelle Gellar was better in The Grudge. Why is that every movie you have to have some extremely dumb girl as the character? Can we have a character that actually would think like a realistic person? How about someone who isn't stupid enough to go a check something out but has the idea that they should get away?

The teens are well under-played. There's the typical teenaged angst and lust for sex and of course the bungling in the dark corners. After some good scares the music gets really squirelly and we know we're on a trip with the kids as they get haunted wherever they go. Detroit, crumbling, rattly, abandoned-of-all-hope Detroit serves as the perfect backdrop. You want the person next to you to hold on...this will do it. It is not horror it is scare. If you are looking for bloody messes, this is not it. The movie is stylish and unique. It makes you guess and curse yourself for trying to assure yourself you would never never NEVER do the same stupid mistake these kids make. That's its near perfection. You would. Oh yes you would.",

    "review": "  You ejaculate it follows, if you seen the movie you would understand that.The story is about a 19-year-old, should be spending Autumn worrying about school, boys and spending week-ends at the lake. But after a seemingly innocent sexual experience she finds herself unable to shake the feeling that something is stalking her. As strange visions begin to plague her, she turns to her friends to help escape this horror - if she can.It Follows was a horror movie that I've been waiting for a while now. As I'm speaking right now this movie is rated 96% on Rotten Tomatoes and critics have been calling this \"The scariest movie of all time\", says some movie magazine. The movie was getting hyped up and I wanted to see what was all the fuss about and after seeing the movie I can say that It Follows isn't the scariest movie of all time, but it's still a great horror movie with a lot to like from it (even the soundtrack).The director of this movie David Robert Mitchell is unknown directed to me as I haven't seen any of his Previous movies and It Follows is basically the first movie I've seen from him and a great one. David Robert Mitchell directed the movie unsettling and beautiful at the same time adding the art house look and feel to a horror movie which made the tone of the movie creepy and haunting with a throw back of classic horror nostalgic. I will be keeping my eye out for his next movie because David did a excellent job directing and crafting a horror nostalgia, work one David Robert Mitchell.I remembered seeing Maika Monroe in last year's movie The Guest and now she's in It Follows and she delivered a great and stunning performance. In my opinion I think this is the movie that she really stands out from being good to outstanding. Now this isn't a spoiler to the movie but the scene I'm about to talk about involves Maika Monroe acting and why she was brilliant in this movie and that's when she first encounters the first follower and it's a old creepy looking women that start's walking towards her and the scene itself is very terrifying, Maika Monroe looked like she was scared and confused of what's going on and to be honest that's the face I will pull if so one started following me with that creepy look on their faces. Maika Monroe was pure outstanding in this movie and I can't wait to see more of her talent in the late future.The soundtrack to this movie is hands down some of the best horror soundtrack of the year, it's right up there with The Guest and other movies like Drive and Under The Skin. It's got a nostalgia of horror to it and a big tribute to John Carpenter's movies. I listened to the soundtrack more times then I excepted, that's how amazing this masterpiece of horror music should be done.The movie's tone is what made the movie more effective to me as the movie doesn't have loud stupid jump scars or any cliche annoying characters to bring the movie down, no the movie allows on it's setting, it's atmosphere and the performances to make the movie effective or you like to call it frighting. Don't go into this movie expecting a popcorn horror flick with all the cliches you can check off the list in your head, the movie isn't like that has it's different then most horror movies.Now for the problems: I already talked about how amazing Maika Monroe acting was in the movie but the other actors who played her friends wasn't all that good I mean if you have to compare it to Maika Monroe performance to these they didn't do so great. These a scene in the movie were one of them get's shot in the leg by accident and oh my god they reaction to getting shot was freaking dreadful and such bad acting it took me out of the movie a little bit, but luckily Maika Monroe was on screen most of the time in that scene so she pretty much saved it.Don't worry I won't spoil the ending for you but let just say that the movie doesn't end on a good note, it just kind of ends just like that. It was like the season finale to The Sopranos it just ends like that and I'm there all like \"Was that it?\".Overall It Follows is a great horror movie and I like how different and original it is. Is the movie over hyped? well yeah since critics are false advertising it saying it's the best thing that every happened and people are excepting to be scared out of their minds over this movie and leaving disappointed, well the movie didn't scary me but it left me thinking and it did have it's chilling and creepy moments that got under my skin a lot of times. If you haven't seen the movie yet go check it out but please don't go in thinking it's going to be scariest movie every made, just expect a good horror movie that's clever and unsettling.",

    "review": "  What makes \"It Follows\" feel like such a reinvention of modern horror is simply it's loving attempt to rekindle the flame of classic 70s and 80s horror past. It does just that, with style and infectious synths to spare. Unlike most current horror movies however, Director David Robert Mitchell's film has been meet with near universal praise. Maybe audiences have finally shown a demand for something different! \"It Follows\" is the antithesis to the house that \"Paranormal Activity\" built. An atmospheric, chilling thriller which strictly abides by the old moniker that \"less is more,\" and (surprise) it most definitely is. Also notable is young Actress Maika Monroe. She's a terrific lead who, with \"The Guest\" and now this film, shows all the makings of a potential go-to queen of the genre. She's great. If there's a single issue that some may have with the picture it's that it isn't terrifying. Factoring in the amassed hype, that may be a deal breaker for the more unforgiving. Though the term is broad, \"It Follows\" is scary both thematically and cerebrally, and as effectively horrific in hindsight as any of the persistent urban legends you've ever heard. It gets in your blood and stays there.",

    "review": "  Mainstream audiences are most likely not going to fully embrace this masterpiece of horror cinema now that it has gotten a wider release. I have read a lot of people complaining about it's slow pacing and the usage of nostalgic music throughout that most younger audiences might not understand here and might find irritating unless one is familiar with horror films from the the greater years of horror film back in the 70's or 80's. For example, there is throwbacks to The Shining (1980) and Halloween(1978) and even more recently with it's tone in some places, Drive(2011). All of these some have been comparing this work to and all of which are perfect examples or what this films echos. That being said, this is something new added to the table of great horror films and easily the best one I have seen from this last decade or more. Even as I type this, I am still filled with paranoia and itching goosebumps on my arm just thinking about it and it's hidden meanings which I will leave out here to avoid spoilers. Some will also complain here that some of the characters within are irritating at times, but then again, when has teen centred film ever had every character entirely likeable especially within this genre? None. Another thing that most will not embrace is the slightly abrupt ending which leaves this title open for endless dread yet to come and no real answers to what the hell was going on. I thought about this as well here, and really, I can't think of a great horror film that has had a happy end or one that leaves one without a single question at hand for everyone to ponder over after viewing. In fact, leaving this film with as much mystery as there is is what will garner this as one of the most memorable films in this genre as well as possibly the best film to come out so far this year in my books. That all being said, this is not one for the faint of heart and it is quite disturbing and unsettling at times and not something I would recommend to anyone with sleeping issues. I can say that I am likely not going to be able to sleep right for days after this experience and I love that all the same. For hardcore horror fans and ones who are finally ready for a game changing movie in this genre are in for a treat as well as the cinephiles out there.",

The reason why I hate jump scares so much is because it diffuses all the built up tension in a scene, forcing that build up to start all over again, last year's poorly made Jessable, Annabelle and Ouija are some perfect examples. Well it not fair to say all of them sucked, as of course we got the Insidious series, The Conjuring & Babadook which have managed to keep the genre alive. Yet, when we look back at the horror films of 70s or 80s films like The Shinning, The Thing, Poltergeist & The Exorcist are a few names which stand out. This films despite their comparatively lack of technique at that time scored with the audience with their brilliant portrayals, atmospheres & story telling. A horror movie is like a roller coaster. It's scary, but you're having fun because you know that it's perfectly safe. The scarier it gets, the more entertaining it is because it pulls you deeper into the story until you forget entirely that you're in the theater watching a piece of fiction. Luckily, this film delivers where other recent horrors have failed, it creates memorable moments and characters which the audience feels for. Also unlike recent films, there is no way to predict what direction the movie will take, and there is finally not a completely predictable ending. Horror movies have taken easy ways out and desensitized the audience throughout by having things jump on screen which make the big moments feel insignificant and forgettable because audiences have been jumped at so much they just don't care anymore and cant wait for the film to end. This film makes a statement of how far Horror can go if done right! The story follows Jay (Maika Monroe), a high school girl who goes on a date that ends with a seemingly innocent sexual encounter. Soon after she finds herself being followed by a supernatural entity. She must find a way to escape this curse before it leads to her death. The film starts with a very simple and effective idea, uses perfect lighting, unique cinematography, design, and a memorable soundtrack in the suburban setting of Detroit. There is some kind of malevolent force that follows you around. The way you contract and eliminate this threat is by having sex. Somehow by having unprotected sex, you get it, and then, as the title says it follows you around. Only you can see this thing though. So every person who might look a little strange to you could be the force that is out to get you. And it creates paranoia because you don't know what's real and what isn't. This is an incredibly effective plot device in the film. As it is explained to J, after she gets it from her new boyfriend, this force can be anyone. It walks slow so you can buy yourself time by outrunning it or driving away but like the Terminator, it will not stop ever until you are dead. Twisting these elements into a nightmare that never stops, it's one of the scariest films of the decade. When it comes to these films I prefer to be frightened by the things I can't see, playing off of the psychological terror of the characters. Quite frequently horrors have the dumb blonde who sleeps around, a cheap cliche that easily fits this premise. However, Monroe's character was more than this typical cliche. She's just an average teenage girl who happens to be a victim of unfortunate circumstances. You see how conflicted she is on how to handle this curse, whether to pass it on, involve her friends, or simply give up. Another horror cliche that is turned on its head is the topic of sex. Most of the time sex scenes are just added in scary films to attract a certain type of audience, but in this film sex is an integral part of the story. There is something deeply terrifying about being haunted for a very personal act. A supernatural entity infringing upon your most private moments is disturbing to say the least. The film uses a number of conventional horror tropes that really help amplify the terror. There are many moments where you just want to yell, \"look behind you\" and grip the edge of your seat in the hope that the characters can see what you can. What is unique about this film is the amazing cinematography, very smart at times. The director of photography makes an intelligent use of constant pans, slowly building tension. There are and a number of inventive camera tricks which give this film its signature style.The soundtrack really stands out; It is perfectly in tune with the scene, surroundings and the plot. It gives you goose bumps even during the scenes where nothing is happening. Dark, classical sounds adds so much emotions, gives you a feeling that 'IT' is somewhere behind you, in the movie theater. I think the composer paid homage to about 80s horror themes. I am simply in love with the music that was used here. The cast comprises a bunch of unknown actors, people may recognize the beautiful Maika Monroe from last year's awesome thriller The Guest. Not only is she strikingly beautiful, she absolutely nails the character. She's unabashedly terrified all throughout the film and when she's scared, you are scared for her. The rest of the cast is very good as well and there's a nice love angle as one of her long time friends - Paul (Keir Gilchrist) has loved her probably since they were kids, but he's not quite her type and this creates a lot of tension. He's willing to sleep with her and take the malevolent from her, that's how much he feels for her. Director David Robert Mitchell has proven he is here to stay, with this craft & story telling abilities, we are sure to get some refreshing films in the coming years. On the whole, 'It Follows', is a perfect film! With a high concept, low budget, absolute masterpiece of a movie that gets under your skin and freezes your blood with eerie dread in the way that few films in the genre seem to do these days. This is about as original as it gets and that is a rare thing in today's cinema.",

The central idea of the movie is that there is a sexually-transmitted curse. Once you get the curse, an apparition will follow you--slowly, but steadily, until it catches you and kills you. The only way out is to transmit the curse to someone else. Then the apparition will follow that person, but if it gets her/him, then it's coming after you. Creepy and original idea. A bit too much reliance on jump scares. There really could have been more psychological terror here-- manipulation of the desires of central characters to pass on the curse, for instance. And maybe there was some opportunity for social commentary here on the idea of sex as exploitation. But a good film nonetheless, and the door is open for a sequel. I hope something follows this.",

Like the original Final Destination, it fails to provide a mythology for what's going on, leaving both the characters and audience in a state of helplessness that mirrors real life panic. The not actually period but deliberately not modern setting - that we've all been getting so sick of since House of the Devil - works here to give the story the instant familiarity of an urban legend. It also does a fair bit wrong, most notably the fact that the slow burn set-up should give the characters ample time to take a considered approach to how they're going to defeat the titular entity, which they fail to do in spectacular fashion - perhaps most notable in the fact that guns are shown to be at least partially effective half-way through the film, and it takes another forty minutes and a failed death-trap worthy of MacGyver before anyone thinks to shoot the antagonist lots more times. Ultimately, for all the film's technical skill and an its apparent lack of malice, it's still hard to get past the fact that after decades of horror films about rape, we now have one screaming \"consensual sex - be scared of that too!\"",

    "review": "  This movie could have EASILY been a FANTASTIC 30 minute short, that's my only true criticism of this horror film.The atmosphere is fantastic, the soundtrack is absurdly fresh, and the setting ridiculously 80s. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride this movie provided, though I must mention that I knew nothing about it going in, and I suggest you do the same. It is ALSO worth note that you need to watch this movie with an open mind, that the cliches are intentional, and that the characters are purposely stale. And if executed correctly, is more than acceptable for me.Again, great, great soundtrack, hauntingly 8-bit.",

It Follows is a film by someone who clearly has been paying attention to John Carpenter's films, because you could have convinced me that this was his come back to horror. It Follows made me realize that I have never truly been tense, I mean truly on the edge of my seat. I think John Carpenter was right when he said \"Finally, horror with suspense... loved it!\" It made me feel as if there's a quality in horror we could be getting, but we aren't. Even though the Babadook was terrifying, I don't really see the re watch-ability that It Follows has. This is a horror film that is fun. I'm not sure I can say the same about horror films these days.",

    "review": "  Ever since hitting indie theaters earlier this year, \"It Follows\" has been receiving an immense amount of critical acclaim, going as far as being deemed \"the most terrifying horror film of the past decade.\" Due to its extensive positive praise and high-grossing status, the film was expanded to a wide release this past weekend for all to enjoy, and it did not disappoint.\"It Follows\" has an ominous and simplistic plot, yet it is a difficult film to discuss without sounding ridiculous. It is important to note that the film is deeply metaphorical and requires a great deal of patience, but if given the time and post-viewing analysis it deserves, it will undoubtedly leave a great deal of viewers paranoid and highly unsettled.After a brutally unsettling opening scene, we meet the protagonist of \"It Follows,\" Jay, as she calmly floats in her backyard pool. Jay is a pretty, calm-mannered teenager with a close-knit group of friends. She's currently dating a mysterious boy named Hugh, and during their date one evening, he panics and forces them to leave the theater they are attending. Jay, however, is so enamored by Hugh, that she looks past his erratic behavior and continues to see him. On their following date, they drive out into the woods and have sex in the backseat of his car, and as Jay lies in the backseat discussing her childhood dreams of being with a cute boy and having a sense of freedom, Hugh attacks her from behind and puts her to sleep with a cloth dosed in chloroform.Jay awakens tied to a chair, terrified by what Hugh will do to her. He promises her he has no intentions of harming her, but rather tells her she is in danger. He discloses that during intercourse, he \"transferred\" something to Jay-a supernatural entity that will hunt her down and kill her unless she sexually transmits it to someone else. \"This thing... it's going to follow you,\" he tells her. \"Somebody gave it to me, and I've passed it to you. Wherever you are, it's somewhere, walking straight for you. All you can do is pass it along to someone else.\" The entity first appears to Jay while she is with Hugh in the form of a naked woman, as he tells her that only those that have been infected are able to see the entity, himself included. \"It could look like someone you know, or it can be a stranger in a crowd,\" he continues. \"Whatever helps it get close to you.\" The entity, essentially, can shapeshift into a person of any age, race, or gender, and will walk towards the infected until reaching them and killing them. If Jay is killed, the entity will attempt to kill Hugh again, and return back down the line of all those who have sexually transmitted it beforehand.Jay begins to see the entity everywhere after that night, in the form of an elderly woman, a deformed man, and young girl, among other incarnations-always hauntingly walking straight toward her. Her only choice is to run from it, though it is impossible to ever escape it. Her friends seemingly play along at first, taking shelter in distant cabins and beaches, doubting Jay's sanity as she begs them for help. They soon discover that the entity is altogether real during a supernatural experience where they see an invisible force grab Jay from behind and fling one of their friends backwards, leaving a demonic, hand-shaped bruise on his torso. The group then agrees to do whatever it takes to keep Jay safe, and soon construct a plan to kill the entity before it takes her life.Simply put, \"It Follows\" it easily the most effective and spine-chilling abstinence film ever made. Its metaphorical stance on safe sex and the spread of STIs are palpable and visceral, and yet, the film is so much more than that. It has the look and feel of a teen horror film from the 80s, with a sinister and atmospheric mood along the lines of the work of John Carpenter and Wes Craven. The film also has a gorgeously dreamy and nightmarish soundtrack echoing 80s horror synth-scores, adding to the film's suspense and intensity as it progresses.Essentially, \"It Follows\" is as much a horrific experience as it is a subtle one. Although it builds suspense expertly, it is not a film with any large payoff, climax, or conventional jump-scares. Nothing in the film is overdone and it does not provide a sense of closure. For this reason, \"It Follows\" is a film that will appeal more to audiences looking for something outside the typical horror norm, where everything is allegorical and nothing is spoon-fed. That said, \"It Follows\" may not be the most terrifying experience you will have in a theater all year, but rather one that begs to be deciphered and judged as a whole. One thing, however, is for certain-many will be looking over their shoulders and practicing safe sex for quite a while after viewing.",

    "review": "  I have never been more disappointed going to the movies. As a self-proclaimed movie fanatic, specific to the genre of horror, I was beyond intrigued after hearing the rave reviews from the 2014 Cannes Film Festival regarding It Follows. Headlines proclaiming \"The Years Scariest Horror Film!\" and \"A Film for the Ages\" immediately pulled me in. Given the inconsistency within the genre, any horror movie buff worth their salt, does not take new films lightly. We go into the theatre waiting for the first impulse to critique and are always genuinely, even surprisingly, elated when we find out we were wrong. Alas, I was unable to be put in my place, nor was I able to walk away with the elation I was so hoping for with It Follows.  Set in Detroit, It Follows tells the story of 19 year old Jay, who after a sexual encounter with a boy she has been seeing is told she has been given a curse. Her partner has passed on an evil entity, which is only seen by her as someone she may or may not know, that will follow her forever until she either passes it on to someone else or the entity kills her. Written and directed by David Robert Mitchell and supported by a cast of unknown actors, the film was set to high expectations. Not being blemished by the mainstream idea of \"typical horror\", the visibly low budget feel of the film was one thing I actually enjoyed. You can tell right away Mitchell was really able to create something without any outside influences telling him what he should do, albeit with a sloppy plotline. From the first scene, John Carpenter is alive in the film, neighborhood street scenes in suburban Detroit look like they have been frozen in time for the last 30 years, immediately calling back to Halloween. I almost expect to see Michael Meyers creeping in the shadows. The entity itself that follows Jay, in certain moments is bone chilling. Only ever walking -another nod to classic slasher films- but never too far behind, it seems the anticipation of the being is more frightening then what may happen if it catches up to you. Although the thrill only lasts a moment before you start to tire of the same scene over and over again without any real climax.  Aside from the fact that the film seems to be one speed only, I was hoping that because of the low budget independence of it, Mitchell wouldn't get caught up in all of the predictability of horror films. This was wishful thinking I suppose. The main point of the story is the fact that Jay receives this curse because she sleeps with someone. Not only that but she has to sleep with someone else in order to rid herself of it. That is the most classic diatribe in the genre, which for decades has been the idea that if you have sex you die. It Follows takes it even a step further in almost creating sex itself as the killer since that is the only way this entity continues to thrive. This idea is overdone and boring. Last but certainly not least, as this was the most vital and the worst part of the film, is the end. Not only did it leave something to be desired, it completely left out an actual resolution. I don't have an answer as to if Jay dies or survives. I don't have an answer as to what this entity is, where it came from or why. Leaving the movie without a resolution is not the problem, I actually like the agony involved when directors and writers leave it up to the audience to decide how the movie ends. But only if it works, and preferably if I had already enjoyed sitting through the first 90 minutes. After sitting through the first hour, already angry and basically still there for the sole fact that I had paid 11 dollars to be there, I needed something at the end to validate my overpriced ticket. Eliminating this for your audience creates a feeling of incompletion. It made me think that maybe there was a mix up and the actual ending is on the floor of an editing room somewhere.  My recommendation to any and all who love and respect film, especially horror, save yourself the trouble and do not see this movie, or if you must, wait until it's free somewhere. I would rate it 2 out of 5 stars. I did enjoy the cinematography and music, as well as the classic feel of the film. I only wish that everything else in the film was on par to back those things up. Unfortunately with horror films, you must go through a lot of black coal to find the diamond.",

    "review": "  A strong, underplayed and unpretentious horror film, It Follows harkens back to scare flicks of yesteryear (the late 70's and early 80's specifically). It ironically has more in common with Drive than it does any recent entries in the genre, as it comes complete with a synth soundtrack, long organic takes, and a strange dreamlike feel that set it apart from anything else you will see. It was quite refreshing to see a cast of characters and a female protagonist who were surprisingly sympathetic and relatable, even if they were irritatingly and laughably stupid (a convention of the genre they don't subvert). The first half quite honestly put me on edge and had me scanning the screen for the silent, supernatural, and unstoppable Terminator-esque killer. The tension died down a bit in the second half and I seem to not be alone in this regard. It suffers from an ambiguous non-ending and a slow pace that general audiences will not forgive it for. It personally didn't bother me. At the end of my screening there were outbursts from loud dipshits - \"THIS IS BULLSHIT! I GOT RIPPED OFF!\"; \"MAN THAT WAS FUCKIN BORIN! WACK ASS MOVIE.\" Even a seemingly more restrained older couple were less than impressed - \"I just thought it would be well...more...exciting...or something.\" At least the underground horror community have something to celebrate and cherish among themselves. Because the studio-produced PG-13 shlock of today definitely does not have them in mind. They have my sympathies.",

I have seen it twice in theaters and find it thought-provoking, engrossing, and overall a great movie. The cinematography enables your mind to get developed in the plot and keeps your interest throughout. The one reason why I am not giving this horror flick a full five stars is because of the level of \"scariness.\" I find this movie utterly suspenseful more than terrifying. Although \"It Follows\" guarantees a look behind the shoulder every know and then, I do not find it frightening, more chilling. \"It Follows\" goes down as one of my favorite horror movies of all time and is a fantastic endeavor for any creepy film fan.

I was incredibly excited by the prospect of \"It Follows\", a new, unconventional twist on one of my favorite genre's. I think I'm savvy enough to modify my expectations in the theater and leave my baggage at the door. That's why, two weeks after seeing \"It Follows\", I can state without hesitation, that the film was a massive disappointment. I'm baffled by the good reviews. I thought the angle of the amorphous boogeyman pursuing the heroine, was solid. I thought that most of the plot machinery was logical and sound and I thought the performances were compelling and professional. The kitschy touches by the writer/director were forgivable. The problem was - the movie was boring. Stultifyingly, agonizingly boring. There was zero tension. There were veritably no scares. There wasn't a single moment that made you forget you were watching a movie. The narrative just plodded along without any rising tension or drama. Rarely have I felt so uninvested in a movie. A true disappointment. I'm glad that we have another auteur on the scene. Perhaps he has a more compelling film in his future but, \"It Follows\" didn't deliver. In fact, the most interesting thing about the film is how entirely over rated it is. Curious.",

    "review": "  A nearly plotless film. A few half baked plot drivers to keep the movie going, but nothing to acutally there to maintain interest. The 'follower' is a slow and unterrifying horror 'monster' that seemingly is only half of a concept without any back story. I honestly don't know why people enjoyed the movie so much... it was slow and lacklaster. I nearly fell asleep during the first 30 minutes. I assumed they were going to tie the movie together somehow at the end, but the ending just sort of happened.... I honestly could have written this script in about 10-15 mins....and came up with way better plot drivers. Only pro's to watching this movie was the rich sounds. But that was about it for me.... I was too busy cringing the entire length of the film.",

    "review": "  A teenage woman has sex with her boyfriend and then discovers that a shape-shifting demon follows her; if it catches up, she dies.Here is what this film is trying to do: it's trying to send up the horror movie formula of if a female character has sex, she's sure to die. It's trying to be an homage to (or satire of) John Carpenter's original Halloween film.Here is what the film actually accomplishes: it annoys the living shit out of me. The follow shots and heavy-handed music do nothing to add suspense. Rather, they're almost comic in their over-drawn melodrama. And let's talk a while about this demon. What about hand stuff? Does the demon only get transferred with procreative sex? What if she doesn't come? What about lesbian sex? And why is the demon sometimes one shape but other times another? Why is it only occasionally naked? Why did the demon kill everyone else, but when it catches up to our heroine, it only plays with her hair? Why does it have so much trouble with doorknobs but is capable of flying or climbing on a roof, standing there with Osama bin Laden's beard over its dick? I know the film doesn't want to answer these questions, but they're so obvious.Overall, what's being hailed as \"one of the greatest American horror films in years\" is a dumb piece of shit.",

It Follows may have a simple plot but what makes this creature so interesting is that you have no idea what this thing is or why it's doing what it does. The score to the film is amazing. Felt like I was hearing something fro a 70's/80's horror flick. It felt the score from Halloween meets the score from Suspiria.",

Save your money & see something else lol- I heard this movie was supposed to be really scary..it was the complete opposite- It had a few moments where you are jumping, but that's about it- definitely the worst horror film I have seen so far. I found one scene in particular a little disturbing, I will not go further to explain it.",

David Robert Mitchell did a great job trying to recapture old 80s horror flicks and despite his occasional detours into art-house territory, he's made an impressive enough mainstream debut.",

    "review": "  It Follows is the most persistent film I've seen so far this year. I mean, it just doesn't quit. It's always coming for you. What is It? A ghost, a monster, a poltergeist? It is a supernatural force that is always coming for you. Slowly, never stopping, It Follows. Don't let it catch you, cause it will kill you.How did It become attached to you? By doing the nasty . That's right. If you knocked boots with someone that had It following them, then It starts coming after you. How do you get rid of it? Easy Peasy. Find some poor sucker and take them for a romp in the sack. Sadly, this is at best a temporary solution. If it kills that person, then it moves down the line to you. And so on, and so on. A Supernatural Herpes. You may not have an outbreak for a while, but when you do, it's a real bitch!!I really enjoyed watching this movie. The soundtrack was reminiscent of an 80's horror flick and the cinematography gave it an interesting look. It didn't scare the socks off of me, but I left with a case of the creeps. I kept looking over my shoulder on the walk home. If you like the horror genre, then this is right up your dark alley.",

This movie is like a long joke that has no punchline. The whole movie, I'm sitting there going \"Okay, it'll start picking up soon.\" Never did. The \"scary stuff\" was a hooker in the kitchen, an old lady walking slowly towards her, a naked old guy on a roof, and a guy in his underwear and a beard, throwing hair blowers into a pool. When did this movie take place? It's like the 80's, but they have laptops and smart phones. I'm flabbergasted that this film has gotten the reviews it's gotten. The fact that it has a higher review than The Conjuring and Insidious is just blasphemous.",
