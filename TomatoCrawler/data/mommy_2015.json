    "review": "  A decent but irregular effort that feels too long for the kind of story that it wants to tell and not really well polished as a whole, while its unusual aspect ratio of 1:1 may be interesting, especially as a basis for the most beautiful scene of the film, but also starts to bother after some time.",

It's a powerfully moving film with smothering performances and Dolan's trademark style. It will punch you in the gut, seemingly for the fun of it, then show you the valid intention of that punch that will leave you in somber gratitude. Good luck at this year's Oscars, \"Mommy.\" I have very high hopes for you.",

    "review": "  Many describe this Canadian film as an emotional horror show, and make no mistake, Mommy will leave you shaken. Writer-director Xavier Dolan debuted six years ago with I Killed My Mother and Oedipal issues are still on the menu in Mommy, in which a 15-year-old, omnisexual, possible bi-polar boy named Steve (Antoine Olivier Pilon) is more than his widowed mother, Diana 'Die' Despres (Anne Dorval) can handle.A new law taking effect in Quebec will allow for a parent to institutionalize a child without a court procedure, which gets Die to thinking. She's only about 50, and her tight pants and tall heels suggest she's not ready for retiring from life anytime soon. The trouble is that blond, blue-eyed Steve is very charming when not setting things on fire or threatening people with violence. Die seeks help from her neighbor (Suzanne Clement) a delicate looking teacher who only thinks she can contain Steve.One thing about Mommy: Even when Dolan hits you over the head with his themes, he puts on a show that burns in the memory with images that are unforgettable. Pilon is firing on all cylinders, but it's the tour de force from Dorval that transcends language and cultural barriers. Hers is a performance that dares you not to watch.",

    "review": "  Wunderkind Dolan (25 years old & this is his fifth movie) builds wave after wave of intensity in this shattering character study of damaged families trying their best to fit into a society which just seems impossible to navigate. Anne Dorval is amazing as the fierce and wacky Mommy who improvises her parenting and providing skills as a recent widow without much going for her but looks and love. Pilon is amazing as the explosive adolescent Steve, a singular creation for such a young actor. Dolan's sense of pacing, framing, scoring and use of music, and his work with actors is pretty remarkable. This is a career to watch.",

It was the first time I saw such approach in films, to be honest. Then, there is the actors performance, which is brilliant trough the whole movie, mainly the main actress' performance, but the performance of the main male actor is a standout to point too. This plot addresses some interesting points, such as a dysfunctional mom-son relationship ala Nornam Bates and his mother, a maladaptive behavior of a person with ADHD and its percussions to the people around him, simple themes as love, friendship. The whole movie is just filled with emotions. Not to mention the soundtrack of this film, it is indeed proper for the scenes, well chosen and great.

I find it beautiful yet traumatising to watch as it is a rather unconventional movie, mainly because of the unusual relationship between Die and Steve and the unconventional screen size (1:1), which adds a sense of perversion as we watch these characters unfold in our eyes and the feeling of claustrophobia because of the dimensions and the close shots. As for this movie, I thought this movie was well-acted and shot. I find Die and Steve's relationship as a mother and son was a little frightening and very complex. Steve's actor really did shine through with this film and the struggle was convincing and did find this child to be scary enough to be close to. I thought Kyla's actress was great and was a joy to watch her interact with Steve as she helps the struggling family despite having problems of her own and nearly almost neglecting her own family. This movie was just full of compassion and kindness added with the chaos of Steve's ADHD, a little uncomfortable to watch but an eye opener to the potential and talent that the actors and Dolan have.",

    "review": "  Small in scale, but ferocious in feeling, \"Mommy\" is another astonishing feature from writer-director Xavier Dolan. A fitting companion piece to his debut \"J'ai tu� ma mere,\" Dolan continues his exploration of combustible mother-son relationships. While Dolan mainly holds an attitude of angst toward the maternal figure in \"J'ai tu� ma mere,\" he views the mother with a far more compassionate gaze in \"Mommy.\" The eponymous matriarch is Diane 'Die' Depr�s (Anne Dorval), a widow struggling to look after her son Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon), who suffers from ADHD and other undiagnosed mood disorders. While Die looks for work, Steve is home-schooled by their reticent neighbour Kyla (Suzanne Cl�ment). The three central performers are outstanding. In Dorval and Cl�ment, Dolan has secured himself two complex and fascinating female leads. Both are expressive actresses who can communicate tremendous emotion and subtext even in the absence of dialogue. Newcomer Pilon offers contrast to their subtlety with his exuberant yet sincere performance. Steve is a heartbreaking character, who possesses this pure and unconditional love, but is often unable to express it appropriately. His frustration quickly gets distorted and fuelled into fits of rage and aggression. Dolan writes from a personal place, which often makes his work painfully honest and real. He makes these private, intimate moments not only cinematically compelling, but also emotionally resonant and relatable. There's a hand-sewn originality to Dolan's work that captivates and sets him apart as an artist.",

Though I had to pause many times just to take a break from reading the subtitles, it is a really riveting family drama full of great heavy dramatic material but still some really joyful moments including many well crafted montages. It has a weird style of cinematography being shot in a very tight frame like you are looking through a crack of a door the whole time but when it does extend into full screen, it's like you can feel the tension break in the movie. Xavier Dolan is a very interesting director that I want to look into more of his work and excited for his future work. It also has a great soundtrack including a beautiful finale involving one of my favorite songs by Lana Del Rey",

The writer/director of the film, Xavier Dolan, just turned 26 this year. 26!!! And now he has the rest of his life to make even better movies. How exciting!",

    "review": "  Perhaps Xavier Dolan's best film yet, and his most difficult to watch. Every moment is full of tension because of the 15-year-old Steve (played with charm to spare by Antoine-Olivier Pilon) who has ADHD and perhaps other behavioral issues. It is never certain when he is going to lash out in violence or some other inappropriate action. HIs mom \"Die\" (the always fantastic Anne Dorval) is forced to take him back in after he is kicked out of a youth detention center after he causes a fire that badly burns another child. Adding to the stress, she loses her job and her car is totaled. She puts on a brave and hopeful and vivacious face, but she might have some behavioral issues at well, though she is much more high functioning. After Steve nearly strangles her and she escapes to hide in a closet, the woman from across the street, Kyla (the also always fantastic Suzanne Cl�ment), intervenes and seems to have a way with him that calms him down. She soon becomes a part of their routine, providing home-schooling for Steve and another adult to engage with for Die. With Steve, though, his next behavioral outburst might be just a scene away.Dolan films the movie in a claustrophobic square frame, with huge black bars on the sides on a widescreen TV. Once in a great while, when there seems to be hope that things are turning around for the better, the frame suddenly widens to fill the full rectangle. When it tightens again...By the end of the film, it was unclear to me what other options were available for this woman and her son. It was also unclear to me exactly what was going on with Kyla, a woman of quirks that suggest a difficult recent occurrence that is never explicitly stated. Despite the difficult material and the horrifying situation, the movie is full of warmth and humor and sharp dialogue. Dolan dials back his signature artistic flourishes, but only a little, and it is always wonderful to see what he can do with his camera, filters, shots, and editing. After four of his five movies to date as writer/director/editor and sometimes actor (he does not appear in this film) he has become one of my most favorite artists. I'm looking forward to watching Tom at the Farm which comes out in the United States soon, and he is busy working on his next films, including It's Only the End of the World and his English-language debut as director, The Death and Life of John F. Donovan.",

    "review": "  Last September, I had the amazing opportunity to volunteer at the Toronto International Film Festival, or better known as, TIFF. With this amazing opportunity also came amazing perks such as free movie vouchers for each shift we completed. I knew going into this festival that Mommy was my number one choice on my list of movies I needed to see before the festival ended. I have seen 3 of the 4 other films by director Xavier Dolan and he has since become my favourite director, so seeing this film was a must.Before I get into the review, I have a bit of a story to tell. Now, you may think that as a volunteer you had a 100% chance of seeing the films you wanted. That is definitely not the case. You have to remember TIFF is one of the only film festivals that is also open to the public. Almost as soon as the tickets went on sale, Mommy was sold out. If you get to the box office as soon as it opens on the day the film is being screened there may be a chance that tickets are still on sale. Of course, for Mommy they were completely sold out. One of the perks of TIFF is that they have last minute entry on a RUSH line basis which means in the off chance there are any seats left they give them out to whoever is at the front of the RUSH line. The movie wasn't being shown until 12:00 in the afternoon and I got in line at 7:30 AM, because that is how badly I wanted to see this movie, and of course I was first in line. At around 9:00 AM a man came up to the front of the line and asked if by any chance anyone was here in line to see Mommy. I raised my hand and said that I was thinking that he was just checking to see if people had already started lining up for the film but, to my very lucky surprise he had an extra ticket and gave it to me free of charge. I was of course ecstatic! Now let's get on to that review. Out of all the films I have seen by Xavier Dolan, his first film (I Killed My Mother) has always been my favourite...until now. This film was emotional and heartbreaking and just such a pleasure to watch. The acting was incredible by all three leads. Anne Dorval and Suzanne Cl�ment have been in a few of Dolan's other films and were miraculous in each role so it didn't surprise me when they were just as amazing in Mommy. The real surprise came from Antoine-Olivier Pilon whom I have never seen in any film before. I wasn't sure what to expect, but he was perfect for this role.The special thing about this movie is the way that it is shot, in a perfect square. I was lucky enough to attend a Q&A with Xavier Dolan after the film had finished playing and someone in the crowd asked him what the hardest part about making this film was and his answer was the way it was shot and trying to fit everyone into the frame. I can honestly say that I did not see any evidence of that struggle. Everything looked perfectly framed to me which just proves how much time and effort Dolan spends on making things perfect.The soundtrack was what I was most worried about. I saw a trailer for the movie before TIFF started and it used very commercialized, popular songs that have been on the top charts on the radio recently. In previous films, Dolan was more artistic with his music choices so going into this film I was a little worried about what the music choices might be. Although they were common songs that majority of people have heard, the way they were used and what they meant made up for any doubt I had. The songs worked perfectly, and in some strange case, made me feel new emotions while listening to them which was also another topic that Dolan addressed during the Q&A.I was also lucky enough to meet Xavier after the Q&A session and he was beyond kind and spoke to everyone that stayed behind to meet him. He answered more questions, signed autographs and took photos with all of us even after people told him he had to leave.All in all, I would have been happy just to attend this one film and have all the experiences that I did, but TIFF is a 10 day long festival and I was able to see two other films in between volunteer shifts, so keep an eye out for those reviews coming soon.I highly recommend checking out all of Xavier Dolan's films, but especially Mommy if you ever have the pleasure of getting your hands on this film in the near future!",

    "review": "  Watching \"Mommy\" unfold is a mixture of annoyance, amazement and ultimately astonishing. Xavier Dolan finally finds his grounding in deceptively \"simple\" story of mother trying to come to terms with her son's mental challenges. Dolan's cinematographer, Andr� Turpin, applies the director's idea of trying to find a visual way to capture the limited and isolated reality that traps both mother and child. It is particularly challenging at first. In fact, if the cinema had not warned the Canadian audience, I think we all would have thought there was some sort of projection problem. The idea is fantastic and the eyes quickly adjust. It is a transportive device. Featuring three amazing performances -- Anne Dorval is particularly riveting. This movie is grounded in a harsh and often brutal reality -- and yet the actors bring out moments of true bliss that make it bearable. An unforgettable cinematic experience. Xavier Dolan has been making interesting films for some time, but he truly makes his mark with this devastating and tragically beautiful movie. It is exciting to write that he has made a film that is a must see.",

    "review": "  You know what sucks? I already did my top movies of 2014 list, now if I only watched this movie before making the list this would have made the list easily. Well I got something to learn next time.The story is about a single mom's drama about raising her son, who's behavior deteriorates into violence, due to a mild mental illness.I first took interest in the film Mommy just because of the hype and the positive praise it got from the 2014 Cannes Film Festival and the amount of awards it won from the Jutra Awards and Canadian Screen Awards for best Foreign Language film, but not a Academy Award for Foreign Film at the Oscars. Since I am watching more Foreign Language films and searching the ones that got high ratings or just the ones that may interest me, because I'm taking a break from some movies today as they normally not very good or just too Hollywood for me, I mean movies today are getting pretty stale and cliche as nothing feels originally anymore. When Hollywood tries to make a original movie that's down to earth it's laughable. These something about Foreign Language films that always feel real and sometimes so tight with it's story and ending that most movie studios will shy away from and I love it. So I checked out the 2014 Award Wining Mommy and it was absolutely brilliant, I mean how could I even dear overlook this I mean this is a great movie right here and true film making at it's best.Not only did the Oscar screw up for not awarding this for Best Foreign Language film, they also didn't nominate Anne Dorval for Best Actress, because she did one of the best, the most heart felt and the most real piece of performance I've seen in 2014. I felt her struggle and the mix relationship between her and the missed behaved son. There was many scenes in the movie were the son and her have this argument over each over and it never felt like I was just watching actors reading out the script and pretending that they related, no they back and forward arguments always felt real and I bough it. Oh and I found out most of the awards that this movie won are not just for the Foreign Language Award but most of the awards went to her and she deserves it and a Oscar too for god shake. At the Cannes Film Festival Julianne Moore won for Best Actress for Maps to the Stars and I haven't seen Maps to the Stars yet so I can't really judge on her performance in that movie since I haven't seen it, but Anne Dorval was nominated in that category so it was disappointing that she didn't take the award, but I have seen Still Alice and she won a Oscar for that role, but Anne Dorval should have took that Oscar home as she did a much better than Moore as I connected to Anne Dorval more and how her performance made me feel different emotions that I never felt before while watching the movie.Antoine-Olivier Pilon is a unknown star to me as I haven't seen him in any other movies before so this is basically the first ever performance I get to see him in and man god can this kid act, I mean he was so good in the movie. Just like I said about Anne Dorval and that is all the time it never felt like acting to me, it felt real. Antoine plays the misbehaved son perfectly that he actually catches the trouble child very well since I have seen young people like him in real life and how they act is just like him. I also love how they never force the message of \"He's got a mental illness oh feel sorry for him\". The movie never puts that in your face like most movies do when they try to be realistic or make you feel something for the character. He's performance showed both angry, goofy, troubled and damaged but all that is in he's performance and it never feels force and that was so well done that movie didn't slip into that cliche that happens in most movies and that's due to Antoine-Olivier Pilon excellent performance.The director of the movie Xavier Dolan which I haven't really seen any of his last work so this is my first movie directed by him and a great start. This is film making at it's best, I mean the cinematography is beautiful, the tone of the movie can switch to serious drama but quickly change to happy and many other tones and it didn't ruin the movie like most do. Xavier Dolan did both a excellent job on directing the movie and making this as down to earth as possible showing characters and they problems that most people can relate to. Awesome work Xavier Dolan.For problems with the movie I haven't really got any to be honest, but I'm not going to give this the perfect rating as I think this isn't on the level of 5/5 rating it can ever get it, but the rating I'm giving it is really outstanding and it's the highest rating I give this week.Overall I say that Mommy is worth checking it if you haven't seen it yet. It's worth your time and don't do the same mistake as I did and not watch this fantastic movie.",

It's dealing with issues relevant as ever, where a troubled child are being handled by his mother as she tries her best. Ordinary people. Troubled kid. Troubled mother. Troubled neighbours.It's superbly acted. The three leads are magnificent, but Antoine-Olivier Pilon as the boy and Anne Dorval as the mother really impress. If Pilon does not have some sort of ADHD-dignose he better get himself checked. Magnificent!This is very affecting stuff and the way it is presented is flawless. The narrow screen makes put's you more directly into the situations. You are in the house with the struggling family. It's a bit demanding, but very rewarding. Some genious editing are topping the appearance of the film - a very clever and original touch.It's not the easiest of films to watch. It's rugged, it's heartbreaking, it's very real. It got an incredible character build-up - one of the very finest I have seen. It's intelligent and a bit of fresh air I must say. The music also blend so nicely with the dull colors, the brilliant cinematography, and there are superb dialogue here. Many great scenes, I can easily count 10 big scenes for me here.This film will stay with me for a while. I'm looking forward to it. I got to see more of Dolan's work that's for sure.9 out of 10 squares.",

    "review": "  One of the most jaw-dropping movies in recent years, this blackly comical drama is the most audacious work yet from Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan. As challenging as it is rewarding, Mommy finds writer-director Xavier Dolan taking another impressive step forward. Dolan is a director who thinks hard about the possibilities of cinema and explores them with verve and ingenuity, but it is in his latest film that everything has come together. There are ups and downs and soapish highs and lows, but what stops this from ever becoming a telenovela is the riveting wonder of the performances and the sheer brio of the filmmaking. Mommy is first and foremost a mother-and-son story, but it's also a surprisingly delicate exploration of lonely lives, and the temporary islands of companionship that make them bearable. It's uncanny how much Dolan's style and overall solipsism have evolved in five years' time, resulting in a funny, heartbreaking and, above all, original work - right down to its unusual 1:1 aspect ratio - that feels derivative of no one, not even himself. Anne Dorval, Antoine Olivier Pilon and Suzanne Cl�ment give scary-good performances.This is easily Dolan's best film, and it's exciting to think how many times we might have to revise that statement over the years to come. Mommy is going to linger. The love, the laughter, the anger and the sorrow--it sticks. This film earned a place in the top three of my favourite films of all time.VERDICT: \"Instant Classic\" - [Positively Acclaimed Reaction] Usually I give this rating to a movie that I believe is absolutely outstanding and has little to no flaws in it. Audiences, who haven't seen this film, must see it right now! (Films that are rated 4.5 or 5 stars)",

    "review": "  Dolan trae el cometido del cine a la cara del espectador de una manera sutilmente, en una pel�cula que logra establecerse en la intimidad pero tambi�n en lo inc�modo de lidiar con las situaciones que la vida ofrece y que comunmente son ignoradas tal y como el caso del tri�ngulo afectivo entre Diane, Steve y Kyla. Aparte de contar con un gui�n familiar que ya lo caracteriza (los numerables defectos en el ser humano, pero especialmente en la relaci�n madre e hijo), Xavier Dolan despliega un juego visual que nos hace sentir en carne propia la b�squeda de la libertad, el enfrentamiento ante nosotros mismos y la m�s importante: la uni�n inquebrantable que se forja cuando una persona logra entregarse y mejorar hacia con el/la que tiene al lado. Un nudo en la garganta es el efecto final que \"Mommy\" logra establecer en el espectador, invitandolo a cuestionarse acerca de la verdadera importancia de quienes nos rodean.",

I rather intensely dislike his characters, which has always been my main problem with his films, and it's fairly clear that he likes his characters a lot. It usually stops me from getting swept up by his films ... here I ended up being along for the ride. The majority of this film is framed at a peculiar 1:1 ratio, which seems like a gimmick until the film opens up to 1.85:1 for a key sequence. That sequence alone was enough to really win me over.",

    "review": "  As of right now, Xavier Dolan has made two masterworks out of his five films so far: Laurence Anyways and Mommy. Ferocious, funny, over-indulgent, messy, and claustrophobic, Mommy soars thanks to Dolan's technical prowess and the monumental performances from the three leads. As much as the film talked about hope and redemption, I'm not quite sure anyone achieved any by the end. While most would see this film as three people coming together to form an odd family unit, I'd say it's more about three people whom society has deemed unusual and wants nothing to do with. Die is unorthodox and a little shameless, Steve is fiery and problematic but mostly misunderstood, and Kyla can't seem to find the right words while no one seems willing to want to help or understand her. A film just as much about emotions brought to the surface as it is about the things that go unsaid. The film is also incredibly gorgeous and the unusually aspect ratio plays as a gimmick at first but slowly starts to bring you into the confined, restricted world of these characters. These people's lives are messy, contradictory, and a little bit sad. Mommy makes the case that these are people to be understood not to be pitied or cast aside.",

Changes moments of poetry angry at times.

Writer-director Xavier Dolan debuted six years ago with I Killed My Mother and Oedipal issues are still on the menu in Mommy, in which a 15-year-old, omnisexual, possible bi-polar boy named Steve (Antoine Olivier Pilon) is more than his widowed mother, Diana 'Die' Despres (Anne Dorval) can handle.A new law taking effect in Quebec will allow for a parent to institutionalize a child without a court procedure, which gets Die to thinking. She's only about 50, and her tight pants and tall heels suggest she's not ready for retiring from life anytime soon. The trouble is that blond, blue-eyed Steve is very charming when not setting things on fire or threatening people with violence. Die seeks help from her neighbor (Suzanne Clement) a delicate looking teacher who only thinks she can contain Steve.One thing about Mommy: Even when Dolan hits you over the head with his themes, he puts on a show that burns in the memory with images that are unforgettable. Pilon is firing on all cylinders, but it's the tour de force from Dorval that transcends language and cultural barriers. Hers is a performance that dares you not to watch.",

    "review": "  +Nothing annoys me more than walking out of a movie annoyed at the director and screenwriter and here I am, three hours later, still annoyed at the director and screenwriter of \"Mommy\", both being Xavier Dolan who also edited it.The basic story is interesting in that it deals with a mother whose son has been kicked out of a juvenile facility after causing a fire burning 75% of another boy's skin. The mother, Diane, nicknames Die and played by Anne Dorval, has been a widow for 3 years and the son, Steve, played by Antoine Olivier Pilon, hasn't accepted his father's death and had been previously diagnosed with ADD and/or possibly also being bi-polar. They are both capable of moods swinging form high highs to low lows. One moment he can be choking her and the next moment kissing her on the lips while she can be as tender with him as any mother can be and in the next moment bashing him over the head with a framed picture.Both the mother and son lean on their neighbor across the street who lives there with her boyfriend? Husband? And their young daughter. She, Kyla, played by Suzanne Clement, had been a high school teacher but due to something--a nervous breakdown?--has stopped teaching and she can barely talk in full sentences and stutters horribly except around the mother and son.Both mother and son are foul mouth speakers along with being flirtatious whenever the opportunity arises or, sometimes, instigating sexual innuendos. The language, in some instances, is definitely R rated.It is a good straight told story of a subject that isn't often a theme for movies, mainly in the first half but then the director/screenwriter/editor enters the picture. I want to excuse him because he is 25 years old but this is his fifth picture so he should know better. The film is mostly in a 1 to 1 ratio so most of the time you feel as if you are looking at it on a large cell phone. The screen is widen a few times but only effective and noticeable the first time. There are one too many blurry collages not too mention choppy editing that I guess is suppose to be 'artistic'. Also the screenwriter leaves way too many questions unanswered that are an important part of the story.Anne Dorval, Suzanne Clement and Antoine Olivier Pilon give excellent performances, especially the latter who has to handle showing all sides of a teenager with mental illness that changes him constantly.Aside from running far too long--two hours and 20 minutes--I felt frustration at how Dolan was taking a good story line and getting excessive with the camera. I found myself going from being interested to being bored and back and forth all during the movie and, finally, leaving annoyed.",

    "review": "  An emotional experience that I haven't had at the movies in quite a while. This is a film of intense beauty and incredibly dimensional characters. Mommy envelops you in the world of its characters and depicts the power of human connection like no other film I can remember.Xavier Dolan films Mommy in a 1:1 aspect ratio, which you've likely never seen before. It seems that this would be jarring, but not as much as you'd think, and works extremely well, in fact. Cutting off the wideness allows the characters to accompany larger portions of the frame, their bodies and heads are unobstructed by their surroundings. This is a film about deep human connection between a mother and her ADHD son, and they later welcome a neighbor into this world. It really is a whole other world that these characters occupy. One that's sometimes like a fantasy, or an escape, but one that's full of love. The square frame boxes us into their world.Watching these characters thrive in their world is a wonderful thing to see. The acting in this film is astonishing. The connection between the mother and son would not be so affective without the performances of Anne Dorval and Steve O'Connor Despr�s. These actors create strange, four-dimensional characters whose remarkable chemistry makes you feel like they've experienced the world together. Their connection is its own language. From far away they might look unstable and strange, but from up close we can see that no relationship is more loving or beautiful. Also great is Suzanne Cl�ment as the neighbor who finds herself becoming an unexpected part of this family. Dolan uses music in a unique way, with pop songs representing these characters lives. This is not Dolan putting in his iPod, as it might first seem, but is instead what the characters would play. Other noticeable stylistic choices are his use of slow motion and montage. These are used to capture the moments, or the essence of the moments of the characters, which is what Dolan is all about.The relationship between mother and son is important for the plot, and the film certainly tributes it, but the emotional power of the bond can be applied to any relationship. Dolan's film is like an homage to isolated human connection and spirit, but it's also tragic how this connection struggles to work with the real world.Although the aspect ratio and artistic style might lead some to think that this movie is not accessible, the storytelling is plenty decipherable. Anybody can enjoy this movie. It doesn't matter what films you like, or what you think you like, this film is driven emotionally, and everyone has emotions, so everyone can enjoy, and I think everyone will. I can't recommend this movie enough. You'd be doing yourself a tremendous favor to see it wherever you can, I guarantee you. It's the most exhilarating, unforgettable, filmgoing experience to surface from 2014.",

A furious and loud film, Dolan also has a sense for the tender to make Mommy heartbreaking as well, and finds sublime chemistry in his trio of actors. The movie can often encroach on maudlin in it's more indulgent scenes (the soundtrack of 90's songs is admittedly quite bad) and Mommy's tone can be erratic, but it works overall, and houses some fairly innovative filmmaking. Filmed in a 1.1 ratio, it's unclear if this filming degree is truly necessary for the film, but it does allow for great close-up shots that show the emotional aspects of the characters.

Once again I am thrilled to celebrate a filmmaker who really captures who we are today. This film has the pulse and sensibility of 2015 without trying desperately in any way to be hip or cool. In fact, the film ain't hip it all. It just is TODAY! MOMMY blew me away.",

    "review": "  For the fifth time in five years, now 25 year old wunderkind Xavier Dolan delivers another cinematic masterpiece. \"Mommy\" is in many ways a companion piece to Dolan's directorial debut \"J'ai tu� ma m�re,\" the semiautobiographical tale of the then teenaged actor-turned-director's difficult relationship with his mother. The mother is still played by Anne Dorval. Whereas \"J'ai tu� ma m�re\" had a note of immature vengeance in it, \"Mommy\" is much more compassionate, nuanced and open to a point that makes it a bit difficult but ultimately rewarding to penetrate. The point of view is the mother's this time around.The film is set in a fictional Canada where parents are allowed to hand their children directly and completely over to state care citing financial reasons or threats of violence. Diane \"Die\" Despr�s (Dorval, explosively alive), a middle aged widower has to contemplate the possibility when her teenaged son Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon) is thrown out of a facility for troubled youth. Die is broke, doesn't feel confident in her ability to raise her erratic, often dangerously violent son. She drinks and is volatile herself. Now she has to assume direct responsibility of Steve's actions again.For me, Dolan is the most interesting director working today. I'm so glad he's been so prolific, because I anticipate every one of his films more than any others. In the beginning of this, his so-far greatest film festival success, I began to worry. The realistically shot scenes of Die and Steve building a life together were good, but they didn't completely enchant me the way I've come to expect from Dolan. Also, this is the director's most direct attempt at comedy, a difficult genre for me and again a good but not phenomenal effort during the first act. Was Dolan letting me down, or just my overgrown expectations of apotheosis?Throughout most the film I was unsure if \"Mommy\" was Dolan-phenomenal, just normal-phenomenal or just good. The director excels in depicting conflict and melodrama in ways that most filmmakers would turn off-putting or annoying. This film is at times off-putting and very annoying. Both Die and especially Steve are very difficult to like. The script is so daringly unpredictable it begins to border on incongruous. But it all grows, and after contemplating the film as a whole I was completely sold. The characters feel completely flesh-and-blood real, the melodrama turns effectively allegoric and the tonal confusion rewards the viewer after being processed.The key ingredient in making \"Mommy\" a true masterpiece is Kyla, a woman who lives across the street from Die with her family. Kyla is a teacher who is recovering from a heavy stutter brought on by an unspecified breakdown and resurfaced shyness. Kyla is injected into the story just as the relationship between the protagonist mother and her son turns dangerously violent. She befriends the disastrous duo and balances the dynamic.Kyla is played by Suzanne Cl�ment who portrayed a similar teacher in \"J'ai tu� ma m�re\" and a vastly different character in Dolan's 2012 tour de force \"Laurence Anyways\". She shows her amazing range again in a role that defines the drama, offering a reflective surface to the otherwise numbingly fierce exchanges between Die and Steve. In the end Steve and Die may be the main characters, but Kyla is our companion as viewers, the silent focus point that brings the emotional cacophony together into something tangible.As always, cinematography and music are Xavier Dolan's allies even more than they are in an average film. This time, the soundtrack is actually quite bad for my taste; emotional pop from the 90's mainly, but the director makes it work. In a Dolan scene, even Celine Dion has an impact. Trust me. The cinematography gets more experimental as the film progresses, forming yet again a unique, exceptionally beautiful language that takes us within the characters. Some frames are so tenderly beautiful they make you want to cry.What \"Mommy\" is most notably successful in is the melancholy, deeply felt presentation of youth, mostly from a parent's perspective. Pilon's Steve is dangerously volatile and dangerously fragile, explosive, infuriating, but so very real. I remember being told as a kid by some relatives that teen years were hazardous, that people often messed up everything during that period of flux. I was dead afraid of my own back then. I thankfully never got or wanted into any trouble, but now I'm glad this film didn't exist when I was that timid child afraid of growing up. If I had seen \"Mommy\" then, I wouldn't have been just afraid, I would have been in panic.",

They are white suburbian underachievers, they speak quebecquois patois, a mix of french and english expressions and insults. Those people are pretty intense but we get attached to them. This movie explores social and psychological issue with at its core a very strong mother-son relationship. It's very emotionnal but also interesting and original. The music plays a role of paramount importance. Some scenes are beautiful, rare moments of joy and happiness, where Dolan's virtuoso makes the camera fly around and shoot in slow motion.",

Anne Dorval is amazing as the fierce and wacky Mommy who improvises her parenting and providing skills as a recent widow without much going for her but looks and love. Pilon is amazing as the explosive adolescent Steve, a singular creation for such a young actor.

At times there are peaks where the film manages to stimulate the pulse of the narrative, but it seems to have trouble maintaining that trait. Dolan has failed to structure a solid film which could've been a potential masterpiece, it's time for him to consider polishing his storytelling technique to render his creative capacity into a more compelling talent. A few touch ups in the script would've also boosted up the quality, however the use of visual techniques and musical montages resinates very adequately and raises the mood thoroughly of the movie. I, however, always fill sufficed when analyzing Dolan's movies, as they possess a very personal bond with their director. Ultimately I would recommend the film, but a better experience is assured if costumers wait until it's released on demand and they can enjoy it home where they can take rests and wear off the tediousness that is sometimes build up.",

He has all of this with the scenario and afterwards, it's just showing off his talent in a great fashion.

Well, Mommy is a near masterpiece that proves to be one of the greatest foreign language films I've ever seen.The story follows a single mother who must raise her very troubled teenage son, who finds hope when their neighbour comes into her life. The story in this movie is detailed and terrific. It begins fairly slowly, but it speeds up and never fails to interest. The characters are amazing, too. Each character is relatable and perfectly realized. There are only about three important characters, but that makes allows the movie to expand on their personalities. Even with a massive runtime of 2 and a half hours, the movie never gets too slow and you barely feel the length.The acting in this movie is some of the best of the year. Anne Dorval gives an amazing and Oscar worthy performance. Antoine-Olivier Pilon gives a brilliant performance as a teenager with severe ADHD. Suzanne Cl�ment also gives an excellent performance as a wonderful neighbour. I would love to see all three of these actors in more movies, because they were all fantastic!The directing in this film is just...wow. Xavier Dolan proves to be one of the most unique and brilliant directors working today, and this is only his second film! The way frames were used to effect the audience was just brilliant, and some scenes were visually gorgeous. I was constantly interested in the story and the characters throughout. The writing in this movie is also brilliant, with great uses of extreme profanity and some very touching moments. There is also a bit of comedy that hits pretty hard and balances out the heart-wrenching moments. My only small problem with the movie is that it feels like a bunch of short films bound together. Some plot elements were dropped and completely forgotten at some points. Other than that, though, this movie was nearly perfect.Overall, Mommy is a must-see for all film lovers alike! It has brilliant performances, a wonderful story and terrific direction! Please, run out and see this ASAP!RATING: 9.75/10",

    "review": "  xavier dolan has arrived. oh my god was this film magnificent. dolan has really come into his own as a filmmaker and this film is a testament to all the work he's done in his astoundingly young career. he has reached an equilibrium both in his visual style and as a storyteller, creating a film that is equal parts human, humorous, devastating and ethereal in its unconventional aesthetics. this film is proof that even the simplest stories, in the hands of a master, can be extraordinary.",

    "review": "  This film is gritty, moving and emotionally draining. The majority of the film is in the tone of shouting which is like an onslaught that it's meant to be. Performances are great and believable. It's rather a depressing movie as it deals with difficult themes. It doesn't divert into cliche which is good. Also, the music choices are great and suit the film really well.",
