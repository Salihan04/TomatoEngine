    "review": "  In an unknown place in the world, and after the loss of his family, young Agu runs off only to find a clan of young ones lead by a Commandant. As they teach him to hold his own in the war and kill, the raw human emotion begins to leap off the screen. This Netflix released picture really shows that they know how to find quality content for their streaming service, because at one point this film was being considered for Oscar buzz. Not only is this a powerful story, but Idris Elba really makes you believe this clan exists and the way he forces his kids to do things is brutally realistic. \"Beasts of No Nation\" does suffer from an extended running time and a slightly over calculated screenplay, which to me felt a little tame compared to it's subject matter. I felt as though the film explored more than it explained, which was a very odd thing to do in my opinion. In the end, this is a very solid film that can be hard to watch a times, but I would still highly recommend. Very well-executed picture!",

    "review": "  Unflinching yet elegant in its craft, BEASTS delivers through its powerful and weighty performances, its carefully designed visuals (and camerawork), and its bold depiction of the atrocities of war without relying on exposition. Though the voiceover distracts at times, Abraham Attah and Idris Elba carry this film and are both gripping to watch. The lack of any particular powerhouse scene however prevents the film from being as memorable as it could have been, though it is still one of the most daring and intriguing films of the year.",

    "review": "  Building a near-Perfect Beast, screenwriter-director Cary Joji Fukunaga charts a harrowing war-is-Hell portrait of a boy that feels blisteringly real even though it's set in a fictional African Nation. Sporting no flies in its barbed mouth, this heavy drama pulls no brass-knuckle punches. Even though this coming-of-age occasionally tends to weigh filmgoers down to near-dismal depths (purposely, mind you, but it takes a toll regardless), a note of hope nonetheless rings through the funeral dirge.In this R-rated drama adapted from the novel by Uzodinma Iweala, a child soldier (Attah) fights in the civil war of an unnamed African country and falls under the watchful eye of a sadistic commandant (Elba). In this, the first film released on a wide scale by a streaming service and not exclusively in theaters, Netflix makes a great case for the future of distribution. As unflinching as Fukunaga's adaptation and direction (it helps that he helmed the GOOD season of HBO's Hard-R crime saga True Detective), Attah and Elba's award-worthy performances ground the action all the more. Bottom line: Bout of Africa",

    "review": "  Devastating brutal, and unflinching, Beasts of No Nation is an honest look at the horrors of a civil war conflict in Africa. It's a film of violence and repulsiveness, such as can only be witnessed in such carnage. Following a young boy who becomes conscripted in to rebel faction of a resistance group, Beasts of No Nation transports us in to a tragedy that is all too real, yet little talked about.The film's uniqueness has largely been focused on its release venue through Netflix, which is proving to be ingenious, yet one must also acknowledge the achievement by Cary Joji Fukunaga, the director. He brings to life what could be any number of war-torn regions, and focuses his craft on conveying the sheer emotion and the stupendous brutality of the situation. That is to say, it's not the fact of who's fighting or why that's important, all of that is mostly irrelevant; it's the toll that the war has that's important. That is follows a child-soldier makes it all the more impactful, and Cary brings a very talented cast together. This cast, of course, is headlined by Idris Elba, who deserves a nomination for his performance.It's a film that is hard to watch, yet necessary. Bleak, yet honest. If there's a criticism, it's that the underlining humanity is perhaps lost a bit, it can be very difficult to enjoy without an emotional undercurrent for the viewer to follow. Yet it seeks to challenge the viewer and does so unapologetically, with strong performances, a smart script, and all-too realistic execution.4/5 Stars",

What makes this movie different from others? Because it takes place in an unidentified sub-Saharan African country? Since the country is not named, the implication that this could happen in any of the nations in such a large continent strikes me as a too broad.But maybe the movie isn't necessarily about Africa. It's about all the wars throughout history that have used children as soldiers to do horrific things. It is about how allegiance falls to charismatic and imposing figures, and there is none more suited to this role than Idris Elba. Elba's physical presence and performance allows us to see how one man can convince others to do unspeakable things.",

His family killed and nowhere to go, Agu is captured and then manipulated by the sadistic Commandant (Idris Elba) to become a child soldier bent on vengeance.It's a disturbing look into the horror of genocide, civil war and the loss of adolescent innocence that occurs every day in war torn African countries.Elba nails the African warlord and Abraham Attah turns in an impressive debut performance. Emmanuel Nii Adom Quaye was also good as Agu's best friend, Strika.The movie itself was good, but dragged at some points. It could have been about 20 minutes shorter.",

I guess the \"child soldier\" genre is much like the \"political prisoner in jail\" genre for me - you've seen one or two, you've seen 'em all. I suppose that's very jaded of me, and Beasts of No Nation is very well made and all. Idris Elba is great as always and the main boy was good, too. I just didn't think the movie built to much. For me its my least favorite Cary Fukunaga movie so far, as I loved Jane Eyre and really liked Sin Nombre (and of course, the 1st season of True Detective was great). I wish we had gotten more perspective on Elba's character.",

When the military chases him off into the bush after killing his father and brother, he comes across a band of rebels who take him in and transform him into a child soldier and, in effect, a killing machine. The film is based on a book by Uzodinma Iweala. According to Wikipedia, the book was an expansion on the thesis he wrote while attending Harvard. And while the book and the film are fictional, they fit firmly in the 'docudrama' category. That is, a fictional character or story dropped in to a real setting or conflict. And with Beasts, you buy every minute of the story that unfolds before you. Of course, this is Africa. Google the top ten most war torn countries in the world right now and a good half of the list will be African ones. The destruction and devastation that has gone on in parts of Africa for so many years is more or less unfathomable to people lucky enough to call places like Canada or the U.S. home. And director Cary Joji Fukunaga, who directed the similarly brutal and touching film Sin Nombre, about the Mexican cartels and the warring at the Mexican/American border, approaches Beasts with the observant eye of a documentarian all the way. A lot has been made of the performances of both Idris Alba, who plays the charismatic and dangerous leader of the rebel group Agu joins, and who we know from classic shows like The Wire and Luther, as well as a bevy of popular films. And of Abraham Attah, who plays the very difficult and important role of Agu. Abraham was born and raised in Ghana in West Africa and this is his first acting gig. The character of Agu goes through a great many changes throughout the course of this film. As the poster above shows, he goes from child, to captive, to killer. He encounters great atrocities and causes great atrocities himself. Agu's character is changing in every scene. In every scene, he is learning and growing and becoming something else, sometimes better, sometimes worse. It's a tremendous arc and Abraham Attah deserves an Oscar for the naturalism, maturity and bravery with which he pulls it off. He's already won an award for his performance in Venice, I hope he and Alba, who is also brilliant and puts in his best performance to date in this film, win many more. Beasts of No Nation is a tricky film to recommend. On the one hand, I recommend it whole heartedly and cannot compliment the efforts of the filmmakers and cast enough in bringing this story and vision to life in a such an honest and effecting way. On the other, it's not an easy film to watch. But it isn't supposed to be. Death, rape, destruction and devastation in parts of Africa are a real problem and child soldiers doing and seeing things no child should see or do is a real thing in these places. In some cases whole armies are made of kids who aren't old enough to ride in a car without a booster seat in North America. And Fukunaga doesn't shy away from the hard stuff. If he did, if he watered down the realities of these civil wars in these poor countries, he would be doing them and us a disservice. This is the way it is. It isn't pretty, because it really isn't pretty. But there's no glorification here. Nobody will walk away from Beasts of No Nation thinking 'damn, that's cool. I wish I lived somewhere like that.' So if you're sensitive to these depictions of violence, this won't be an overly enjoyable couple of hours. But I would still recommend it, because I think it's an important document of a real crisis and a very well made and executed (no pun intended) work by a talented group of people. If nothing else, it will make you First World citizens grateful for the country you live in and that dead bodies and the popping of machine guns at all hours of the night isn't an everyday part of life.",

    "review": "  I just finished watching this. I wanted to like it... but this film was terrible. Part of why film works is that it dramatizes and exaggerates emotions and events to give the desired feelings more punch/relevancy/staying power in a shorter amount of time. This movie was 2 hours and 17 minutes long... and I was bored during the entire thing. There was no plot, it was just random stuff happening. It took a good subject matter and painted it as flatly as possible. This war and child solider crap is real and it is real problem, but no one is going to care when, more likely IF, they watch this film. There wasn't anything meaningful going on narratively or thematically. No clever ideas or connections to be made; not even any good dialogue. I was surprised to read that Idris Elba received a Golden Globe nomination for this. His was bland, generic performance. Certainly not his fault however. When the script says you are generic, African army commandant, there isn't really much to go on.Beasts of No Nation takes important, moving subject matter and material and fails to be compelling in any way. It is unremarkable, fails to make a statement and was made seemingly for the sake of being made. This movie was like slowly emptying air from a dry whoopee cushion.",

We get to see what happens to him as he descends deeper into the brutality at the hands of the rebel army he's apart of. Beasts of No Nation is a war movie, with a really sharp edge to it. Remember when everyone was mad about KONY 2012? Yeah, that whole movement sounds like a total farce today. But this film, to me, gives the cause a face. This is what it was about. The violence that continues in Africa, by rebel armies, is unfathomable. In this movie, we see it's evil personified by Idris Elba, who gives the best performance of his career yet as the Commandant. He's just a monster.",

As they teach him to hold his own in the war and kill, the raw human emotion begins to leap off the screen. This Netflix released picture really shows that they know how to find quality content for their streaming service, because at one point this film was being considered for Oscar buzz. Not only is this a powerful story, but Idris Elba really makes you believe this clan exists and the way he forces his kids to do things is brutally realistic. \"Beasts of No Nation\" does suffer from an extended running time and a slightly over calculated screenplay, which to me felt a little tame compared to it's subject matter. I felt as though the film explored more than it explained, which was a very odd thing to do in my opinion. In the end, this is a very solid film that can be hard to watch a times, but I would still highly recommend. Very well-executed picture!",

Since the country is not named, the implication that this could happen in any of the nations in such a large continent strikes me as a too broad.But maybe the movie isn't necessarily about Africa. It's about all the wars throughout history that have used children as soldiers to do horrific things. It is about how allegiance falls to charismatic and imposing figures, and there is none more suited to this role than Idris Elba.

I'm gonna start by touching on the one thing that everybody unanimously is the best part of the movie and that's Idris Elba. Idris Elba as Commandant was phenomenal. He was charming, he was terrifying. This might be my favorite Idris Elba performance of all time. I'm not sure if the Academy will recognize this movie, they should, but if they do I Idris Elba should and will get nominated for best supporting actor. Abraham Attah also gave a great performance. He did a good job conveying this normal boy turning into a monster. Cary Fukunaga did an excellent job at adapting this novel for the big screen and at directing. This movie is superbly directed and superbly shot. Watch out for Cary Fukunaga in the future. Him and Ryan Coogler 2 guys who broke out this year and have bright careers ahead of them. In the end short review but, This movie is great, Idris Elba gives the best performance I've seen from him and one of my favorite performances of the year.

    "review": "  A heartbreaking and a chillingly gripping war-drama, Beasts of No Nation is a hard-to-chew, provocative and shockingly brutal movie. A powerful depiction of what war enslavement of children looks like, this delivery is not only an early Oscar would certainly capture your attention throughout all its 120 minutes and it would make you feel quite uncomfortable while sitting in your sofa. The story takes place in West Africa where Agu (Abraham Attah) witness the slaughtering of his father and brother, and the separation from his mother by an assault of government troops on his peaceful village. While running from the troops he is captured by the mercenaries of Commandant (Idris Elba) and forcefully enlisted in their ranks. Trained, abused, but also integrated, Agu becomes a ruthless soldier who slowly loses the innocence of a young boy. Visually disturbing, and yet beautiful, this uncompromising movie is not an easy art-house delivery to watch. Its content would challenge you while the performances of Idris Elba and Abraham Attah would definitely energize you to a level where you would be ready to cast an Oscar vote for them. In conclusion, Cary Joji Fukunaga's masterpiece is one of the highlights of 2015 and it deserves at least several Oscar nods as well as to be on everyone's \"to see\" list. Its earlier release date and Netflix release would most probably have huge negative effect on its Awards chances, but nevertheless this is one of the best movies of 2015.",

    "review": "  Building a near-Perfect Beast, screenwriter-director Cary Joji Fukunaga charts a harrowing war-is-Hell portrait of a boy that feels blisteringly real even though it's set in a fictional African Nation. Sporting no flies in its barbed mouth, this heavy drama pulls no brass-knuckle punches. Even though this coming-of-age occasionally tends to weigh filmgoers down to near-dismal depths (purposely, mind you, but it takes a toll regardless), a note of hope nonetheless rings through the funeral dirge.In this R-rated drama adapted from the novel by Uzodinma Iweala, a child soldier (Attah) fights in the civil war of an unnamed African country and falls under the watchful eye of a sadistic commandant (Elba). In this, the first film released on a wide scale by a streaming service and not exclusively in theaters, Netflix makes a great case for the future of distribution. As unflinching as Fukunaga's adaptation and direction (it helps that he helmed the GOOD season of HBO's Hard-R crime saga True Detective), Attah and Elba's award-worthy performances ground the action all the more. Bottom line: Bout of Africa",

It took me about 3 tries to get to this movie, due mostly to how successful the first act is at establishing the film's protagonist, Agu. Seriously, he is so adorable and full of life that I had to walk away at the moment I sensed the film would devolve into a nightmarish child soldier war film. I liked him that much and so did not want to see it happen to him. That said, I don't think it strikes the nerve quite as deep as other films in this genre. Given its subject matter alone, this should show child soldier warfare as the most horrific possible outcome of civilization, I have seen movies that make Vietnam seem like more tragic affairs.",

Crud�sima historia sobre un chico que es alejado de su familia para convertirse en un soldado de la milicia rebelde en un pa�s sin nombre de Africa.Beasts of No Nation es un valiente intento de mostrar un tema del que nadie gusta ver ni comentar. Pero tambi�n es una magistral obra de autor, de la mano de Cary Joji Fukunaga (1er temporada de True Detective). El realizador llev� el triple trabajo de dirigir, adaptar la novela y realizar la fotograf�a de una pel�cula visualmente impresionante. Tanto la fotograf�a como la banda sonora rodean al film de una atm�sfera por momentos super realista y por momentos fant�stica. Lo cual hace que sea una pena que haya sido estrenada de forma limitada en cines, porque es definitivamente un film que tiene que ser visto en dicho formato y no por tv.Abraham Attah (14 a�os), como el protagonista Agu, presenta una de las mejores actuaciones que v� por parte de un chico en a�os, e Idris Elba como el cruel aunque car�smatico Comandante, brilla en cada momento que aparece en pantalla. (Segura nominaci�n al Oscar a mejor actor de Reparto para Elba).Tal vez hacia el final de Beast of No Nation, se tarde un poco en redondear su descenlace, pero esa es pr�cticamente la �nica cr�tica que se le puede hacer a un film muy relevante y aunque crudo en cierto punto esperanzador.A tener en cuenta para los que buscan lo mejor del 2015.Disponible en Netflix.4,5/5*",

Cary Fukunaga brilliantly directed this movie and he's also the same director of the first season of True Detective (Just in case you didn't know). Idris Elba delivers a menacing performance that's one of his best. Abraham Attah stole the show for me, I mean he was so freaking brilliant in this movie and he deserves an Oscar nomination (In my opinion). The movie is shocking and very real with some of the scenes which I liked, because it never hold anything back and not once tried the Hollywood way of getting out of danger. Movies like this are great examples of film making. Now for the flaws: I liked this movie, but I honestly can't see myself watching it again. It's one of those movies that you think it's good and well made but never again will you see yourself re-watching it. But that's just me and who knows, you may have watched more than once.Overall Beasts of No Nation is a chilling and depressing war drama that really gets to you. The performances, the visuals and the shocking scenes in this movie are unforgettable.",

    "review": "  **** GoodWriter-Director Cary Joji Fukunaga, the acclaimed director of the \"True Detective\" series, has demonstrated that he could be a beast in Hollywood director nation with his latest gripping movie \"Beasts of No Nation\". The film stars child actor Abraham Attah as Agu, a child whose family is murdered by an oppressed army of an unnamed African country. Agu is then sort of rescued by a rebellious group led by the domineering commander subtly named Commandant played fiercely by Idris Elba. Agu then transforms himself into a child soldier and is forced to kill many by the Commandant. That is a killer childhood no child should experience. Funkunaga transports us into a brutal African society where survival is just the matter of life, and rebellion forces becomes an unwelcome necessity. My only flaw of \"Beast of No Nation\" is that it was maybe twenty minutes too long. But the beastly performances from Attah and Elba more than make up for that matter. \"Beasts of No Nation\" is not the feel good movie of the year, but it just might be the feel important movie of the year.",

The acting, directing, and writing are all phenomenal in this movie. Idris Elba is fantastic as the leader of the rebellion, and would not surprise me if he got nominated. The boy is fantastic as well. The first act of this movie is downright intense, and hooks you from the start. The second act, while a bit slow at first, is where the movie turns into more than just the story of a boy orphaned by war. The second act is filled with many emotionally brutal scenes that had me speechless. The third act is my least favorite, but is still good. The final scene with Elba's character is great, and the end overall is a solid end to the movie. The movie did lose me at times, some scenes felt unnecessary, and it is hard for me to understand some of the people, as they speak in thick accents. However, the movie overall is fantastic, and deserving of its potential nominations. 9/10",

Agu becomes a soldier in the Commandant's army and spends many of his childhood days learning to be a soldier in an army of mostly children.Things I Liked:Idris Elba. Elba is a powerful actor and this is not exception to that. His work as the Commandant is both charismatic and off-putting. He becomes both the mentor to all the younger characters as well as the antagonist to all of them. His work shows his talent as he navigates many complex moments and makes them all mesh incredibly well. A stand out performance.Abraham Attah. Attah plays Agu and his journey is harrowing to watch. He goes from a playful and fun loving young boy into a true soldier with all the emotional weight that comes from that lifestyle. By the end of the movie you almost forget that this young man was the same boy we saw gleefully playing at the start of this journey.The Tone. The movie has this bleak tone that really sells the warn torn feel the movie is going for. You feel the struggles and the pain these young men are forced to go through. You see the lack of hope that they all have. And by the end you see them wrestling with the idea that they may never escape this life they have come to know. It's a tough movie to get through but one that is really well created.Things I Didn't Like:The Pace. The movie has a few moments that really work and then some that just feel superfluous to the overall story. They just add time and while they do remind us of the world we are watching they do little to improve the story or the characters at the end of the day.Overall:Overall the movie is a dark, bleak, tough slog through a harrowing world. The lead character show this journey from two very different perspectives and they both do a remarkable job of it! The story, while long at points, is a powerful tale of struggles we don't even dream of on this side of the world. The movie isn't one that you want to pop in and enjoy with your friends on a Saturday night. But it is one that sends it's message and sends it in a way that makes you take note.

The film's script contains no surprise, the character development is a little bit weak (in comparison with the similar film \"Cidade de Deus\"), but the directing, editing, and colouring are all so good that the film seems to be new and thought-provoking. Fukunaga should continue to stick with this cinema format, the long format of TV series will only kill off his ideas and strong start way before the end of the series/season. Also, Idris Elba is another proof that English actors are superior in every way possible.",

    "review": "  After directing last year's lauded first season of True Detective, director Cary Fukunaga returns to territory similar to his 2009 film Sin Nombre. Beasts of No Nation is a sobering war drama, that utilizes Fukunaga's trenchant for long takes and atmospheric wide shots. It's a film that sets out to de-glamorize every aspect of war, and in that regard it's fully successful. As brutal and well-crafted as Beasts of No Nation can be though, there's also something distressingly missing. The film's story is built from war tropes that we've seen before, and its themes concerning child-soldiers have been better addressed in movies like City of God. Still, it's a strong war picture, and hopefully a call for more good things to come from Fukunaga's career.",

His family killed and nowhere to go, Agu is captured and then manipulated by the sadistic Commandant (Idris Elba) to become a child soldier bent on vengeance.It's a disturbing look into the horror of genocide, civil war and the loss of adolescent innocence that occurs every day in war torn African countries.Elba nails the African warlord and Abraham Attah turns in an impressive debut performance. Emmanuel Nii Adom Quaye was also good as Agu's best friend, Strika.The movie itself was good, but dragged at some points. It could have been about 20 minutes shorter.",

I guess the \"child soldier\" genre is much like the \"political prisoner in jail\" genre for me - you've seen one or two, you've seen 'em all. I suppose that's very jaded of me, and Beasts of No Nation is very well made and all. Idris Elba is great as always and the main boy was good, too. I just didn't think the movie built to much. For me its my least favorite Cary Fukunaga movie so far, as I loved Jane Eyre and really liked Sin Nombre (and of course, the 1st season of True Detective was great).

    "review": "  Kids with guns. So this is about a young African child (Abraham Attah) who loses his family. There are a number of children without parents in this unnamed country, and one commandant (Idris Elba) recruits them to become soldiers, with the intention of not only fighting battles with them, but winning. I really think this movie will be looked back upon as a game changer, and it has very little to do with the movie itself. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful film, and I will touch upon that in just a moment, but this is going to be remembered for changing the business model of theatrically released films. Coinciding with a limited theatrical release, this got released immediately for streaming on Netflix, which is noteworthy because this film is a worthwhile Oscar contender, and people want to see it (it's only been 12 days, and it has been reported that it currently has over 3 million views in North America alone). It really is the route that I feel films of this ilk are destined towards; the smaller, more personal films will make big splashes on the home market, while the bigger blockbusters with the scope of a spectacle will continue to rule the theater chains. When I call this film beautiful, I am referring to the way it is shot. If you worked up the nerve to brave Oscar winner 12 Years a Slave, it's gorgeous in the same way. It doesn't invigorate you in the manner that City of God does, it horrifies you like Hotel Rwanda. The subject matter is as disturbing as ever, and it is made exponentially worse when you take into account that this is about children. You get introduced to little Agu, and while he is in war-torn Africa, he is still just a rascally child, getting into your typical mischief. Even throughout the ambushes and the violence, you never forget that these are children, which is both disturbing and mentally taxing. That said, it is easy to see why these orphaned kids are drawn to this lifestyle, which brings us to the biggest star of this film: Idris Elba. He is playing this monster of a man, but he also provides these adolescents with the family system that they crave. Elba delivers a powerful performance that speaks for itself, and it is one that demands to be seen, whether it be on the big screen or the small screen. This is a horrific movie that is a lot to deal with. Even though it isn't based on a true story, it feels all too real, and I'm sure events of this nature do happen all the time in Africa. It is directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga of True Detective fame (he directed the entirety of the first season), and he has the knack for getting some breathtaking shots. It's something that you should definitely check out, but just go in prepared that you are about to take in something that is awfully hard to watch.",

Idris Elba is an absolute powerhouse as the commandant, the warlord of a rebel army of child soldiers. He has taken on a new recruit in Agu (Ghanian actor Abraham Attah, a genuine find), a boy who witnessed his family slaughtered. His army indoctrination includes heroin ('brown-brown'), sexual abuse and learning to kill with a machete.In adapting the novel from Nigerian-American author Uzodinma Iweala, writer-director Cary Joji Fukunaga (Sin Nombre, Jane Eyre, True Detective S1) is absolutely unflinching in the way he fleshes out this timely, horrific subject matter. Elba (The Wire, Luther) imbues the commandant with a deadly swagger and hints of a long-buried conscience that makes his brutality that much scarier. The Oscar for Best Supporting Actor belongs firmly in his hands, but its' the superb Attah, whose young face is etched with the scars of a hellish joruney, that make this film an indelible achievement.",

    "review": "  A poetic and beautifully shot look at a child soldier in Africa brought into war without a choice. This is a brutal watch that will leave audiences speechless in a way that few films do. It's one of the most unforgettable and powerful movies of the year. Cary Fukunaga takes a quiet and meditative approach to the subject that lets actions speak for themselves. The editing style is loose, sometimes montage-y in a Terrence Malick kind of way, but it's not at all an imitation. The poetic style makes for a unique experience where we are at once put right in the center of the action through the protagonist's perspective but are asked to stand back and contemplate what we're experiencing. This is a winning combination, orchestrated masterfully by Fukunaga. Everything is filmed beautifully by Fukunaga himself, who neatly highlights the of the African forests and villages. These are the only locations in the movie, so what I'm saying is that every shot looks great. The prettiness of the shots adds to the poetic feel of the movie, contrasting beauty to ugliness, reflecting the confusion between the two that Agu feels. The ambient score does this as well when it floats blissfully above the brutality. I appreciated that the film feels so authentic in bringing you into Africa despite it being an American movie. It really immerses you in its location and lets you taste the atmosphere. It's not surprising that this was a difficult film to sell, but it's great that Netflix picked it up, and that we may see marketability get less important if this trend continues. Abraham Attah is insanely good in the lead role. Mostly without words, we witness him become one with the war due to brutality and manipulation. Idris Elba thankfully doesn't stand out as the one non-African actor in the film, immersing himself into the world of this war as the commandant. His character makes the soldiers feel like they're apart of something great, but later on Elba lets us see that he is a damaged and vulnerable being, struggling for power and a feeling of importance. The film shows how child soldiers are manipulated into feeling powerful and part of a group that's fighting for a good. The damaging effects that the war has on Agu are revealed as he and other soldiers eventually discover the emptiness of it all. This isn't a perfect movie, however. It's not quite as dense and ripe for discussion as it feels like it should be, especially for its runtime and poetic nature. Because of this, it's not quite on the pedestal of other brutal films like 12 Years a Slave and Schindler's List, but it's not terribly far off. Without question, this is an important movie that masterfully depicts the effects that war has on a child.",

The story did feel a bit muddled in parts, but it was told in a dark and uncompromising way that was definitely engaging. Whoever was in charge of casting the main kids in the movie, Agu and Strika, deserves a raise, because they were phenomenal in their parts. Idris Elba had massive charisma as the Commandant; you both hated him and couldn't stop watching him at the same time.",

    "review": "  Beasts of No Nation is one of the most powerful films I've seen in a while. For a Netflix original film they did a great job with this movie. Cary Fukunaga is one of those directors to look out for. Both the directing and cinematography is the best part of this film. Now the film is really disturbing and it's very brutal. What I liked about this film is that Fukunaga isn't afraid to go beyond and show how brutal this film is. He catches the realism of war. Also the acting of this film is great. I do think Idris Elba is Oscar worthy for his performance. His character was scary and very mysterious. One negative I had with this film was the 3rd act it started to lose its momentum and pacing. Overall if you have Netflix this is a film that I highly check out and I can't wait to see what Netflix has with their own movies in the future.",

    "review": "  Idris Elba proves himself to be a chameleon once more and is perfect in his role as the charismatic Commandant, however, it is Abraham Attah who is simply nothing less than a revelation in Cary Fukunaga's \"Beasts of No Nation\". Attah's heartbreaking portrayal of a small boy thrust into the violent landscape of war is moving, steeped in realism and treated with the most delicate sensitivity. Attah's performance and the poignant loss of innocence depicted on screen is by far the most engaging aspect of the picture even though the film's structure and narrative is nothing wholly unique. Cary Fukunaga not only takes on the writing and directing of this picture but is also his own cinematographer to which he takes to his task with ease and crafts beautiful shots of lush African jungles to war stricken ghost towns with vibrancy and an eye for the desolate. The score serves it's purpose and fits to the images yet unfortunately as a whole there is nothing all that memorable about it. All in all, Beasts of no Nation is a fine piece of work that can often be really quite harrowing and dark but never so much so that it could equally offend or dazzle audiences. It can be watched on Netflix right now so stop watching Damages and Orange is the New Black and get on some sadistic military shit!",

    "review": "  Led by True Detective's Cary Joji Fukunaga, slapped with the \"A Netflix Original Film\" brand, swarmed by the boycott controversy by major cinema chains in America, and along with its heavy subject matter, Beasts of No Nation is a tough watch, as beautifully shot and powerfully acted as it may be, the latter of which is - oddly - not carried solely by Elba's presence on-screen, but even by the non-actors Abraham Attah and Emmanuel Nii; the latter of whom plays Strika, a mute child soldier and friend of Attah's Agu. Taking on the role as the film's cinematographer, and utilizing his fascination with tracking shots, Fukunaga's Beasts of No Nation could very well be mistaken as being shot by a veteran cinematographer, particularly a 3-minute tracking shot of Agu's group storming a building and the infrared sequence of the Commandant's entire battalion massacring a village.Narrated by Attah, Beasts of No Nation follows Agu from his village in an unnamed African village, as he is torn away from his family as the war envelops his once safe village, to the moment he meets Elba's Commandant, the beret-wearing leader of a rebel faction waging their own war against the government. And it is at this point that it becomes evident that the Commandant is a vector of many cult icons from the past, particularly Che Guevara. Performed by Elba's natural commanding presence and voice, the Commandant leads his unit - or 'family' - of mostly children and teenagers into life-and-certain death skirmishes under proxy orders of his commandant. But as previously mentioned, Elba's performance is accompanied by those of Attah and Nii's, both of whom lack any experience in acting; the former smiles and hides the pain in plain sight, while Nii delivers a quiet, physical performance, as the performances of both rival those of seasoned actors.Though by no means ground-breaking or revolutionary, Beasts of No Nation nonetheless lives up to expectations, delivering a gritty, dark tale of child soldiers birthed through Africa's unending civil wars, and with Fukunaga at the helm - adapting Uzodinma Iweala's novel -, the film effectively delves into both wrenching and repulsive subject matter as it attempts a hand at deconstructing the power of cult figures and the ravaging effects of war on a child's psychology. Even as the film, chucking one atrocity after another at the viewer, glamorizing neither, comes to a standstill in its finale, Fukunaga opts out of \"Hollywood-izing\" the ending, and instead settles on framing the series of end sequences on the true reality of war; Beasts of No Nation is by no means American Sniper.",

Abraham Attah plays the young boy and acquits himself well, but Elba is the one you can't take your eyes off of. Equal parts menacing and hypnotizing, Elba gives a fantastic performance reminiscent of Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York. Director, Cary Fukunaga, of True Detective fame -the good season- brings the same breathtaking camera work he used on True Detective to this film. Go to the movies or watch it on Netflix, but see this movie.",

Just like \"12 Years a Slave\", at moments, it was hard to watch but not forgettable. The images and scenes remind us all about the ugly truths that go on in the world that most of us may chose to ignore. Idris Elba is just brilliant as the Commandant.

I knew it wouldn't be easy: after all, it's about African child soldiers. Agu (the non-actor Abraham Attah), the lone survivor of a family massacre in a brutal civil war, is press-ganged by rebels led by the charismatic Commandant (Idris Elba) of a ragtag army of gun-toting boys. Agu quickly adapts to his new surrogate family and is soon tested by having to kill an innocent civilian up close, in cold blood. Of course, I knew this was coming. There can be nothing more depraved in our sick world than forcing a child to kill. Ironically, child soldiers are feared as ruthless fighters, since they have become morally numb. Emmy award-winning director Cary Joji Fukunaga has recreated the ultimate failed state in ramshackle Africa.",

    "review": "  In a year packed with so much cinematic content and block busting franchises, who would have thought that one of the most powerful and provocative films would have came from streaming service Netflix. Netflix has been on the up as of late, especially with their televised outings such as Bloodline, Bojack Horseman and Orange Is The New Black gaining critical praise and huge fan admiration. Now comes a monumental feature length from mastermind Cary Fukunaga, the visual revolutionary behind the first season of True Detective and what else can I say about it than it is without a doubt, not only one of the best films of the year but quite possibly up there with some of the best movies of the last decade. Based on the critically praised book, Beasts Of No Nation follows the life of Agu, a young child living in Africa, caught up in the middle of a brutal war, where any rules go. After being forced to flee his home, Agu is soon taken captive by a power hungry, detestable Commandant, who is raising a child army, fighting the military and trying to reclaim what he feels is his own. That's all I'm going to say about it because the less you know about this film, the better. I spent the entire 2 and a half hours with my heart in my mouth, completely stunned and completely in the dark with what was coming next, its rare that a film can hold that power over an audience for that length of time, but Beasts Of No Nation is a visual and emotional roller coaster, that will leave even the hardest soul a quivering mess. Fukunaga adapts the screenplay here and his script is just full of flavour and content, Agu will find himself being dragged through a huge array of situations and each of them are 100% relevant and well realized, the material never feels preachy, it doesnt take sides, it shows the horrors of war and huge slabs of it are done with little to no dialogue. What dialogue there is, is presented wonderfully by Idris Elba and Abraham Attah the 2 leads of the piece, Elba has always been a force to be reckoned with, his turn as the Commandant may be his strongest and most layered. Elba manages to make what could potentially be an extremely one note character and gives him so much depth, weight and connection, the lines are always blurred with his characters motives, you understand his motivations, his patriotism and his thirst for success, but by understanding it makes his abuse of children all the more harrowing and uncomfortable. Attah makes his debut and what a stonking debut it is, its not often you can storm through your first outing and pretty much be forced to carry the hefty weight on your shoulders, but this child does it, this young boy shames most adult actors, who are payed millions more than he is. His transition between cheeky young boy to child soldier is heartfelt and terrifying and I will be extremely shocked not to see him pick up an award and continued fame after his turn as the lead in this behemoth of a film. The rest of the cast are utterly terrific, yet again its odd to see such a huge ensemble cast with every actor being utterly hypnotic, but here everyone is alive, everyone has their own character and everyone is equally as important and watching as the trials of war push these children to the max can be an extremely tough thing to do. Visually this film is utterly ground braking, you will be hard pushed to find something so visually prominent and lush, aside from maybe Macbeth. Every single shot, is composed beautifully, utterly important and full of brilliant colour. Africa has never looked so gorgeous and so fierce. Fukunaga also steps into the DOP position and his eye is close to perfect, Beasts Of No Nation just continually assaults you with visual delight after visual delight. The jungles of Africa are dense and vibrant green, the costume is multi coloured and full of contrast and during some sequences the entire grade is taken to the next level, bringing a palette to the table my eyes have personally never seen before. He also gets creative, knowing exactly what atrocities to show and how to depict them, he understands violence and action, making any battle sequence or torturous moment heartfelt and immersive, this man has seriously crafted a masterpiece here. As for downsides, the film doesnt really have many, it could be argued that the final moments of the film dont really add a solid conclusion to the proceedings, but in retrospect its as human an ending as one could expect, refusing to succumb to wildly glossy and happy endings. Beasts is also huge, not only is it lengthy but it is packed to the brim with content, visual and thematically and this film is not something you can just slap on and expect to turn your brain off. Beasts deserves everyone's time and effort, its a huge achievement and will open your eyes to another side of war and for anyone with a Netflix account, which would be around 70% of people, it would be a crime to miss this utterly tremendous piece. Must watch.",

    "review": "  While his early films Sin Nombre and in particular Jane Eyre marked him as a talent to keep a keen eye on, it was last year's first season of True Detective that catapulted young director Cary Joji Fukunaga to not only be one of the brightest young filmmakers in the industry but a unique storyteller with more than enough artistic vision to boot.Riding the tidal wave of the HBO backed show's success, viewers have been eagerly awaiting Fukunaga next move, a move which has now been finalised with the Netflix led release of Beasts of No Nation.A confronting, immaculately filmed and feverish war set tale that spans one of the many conflicts that has occurred in the heartland's of Africa, Beasts is very much a tale cut from the same cloth as war films Apocalypse Now and Platoon, no mean feat yet comparisons Beasts deserves.Not only directing the film but working on script duties, taking a producing credit and doing his own cinematography work, Beasts is for all shapes and purposes Fukunaga's film. It's an impressively constructed effort and for all those that may have worried Fukunaga's work on True Detective was but a flash in the pan, they can rest easy on the basis of the product he has delivered here.There's a wild, almost nightmare like quality to how Fukunaga captures much of the goings on in Beasts; from the jungle set camp of the warring soldiers, the fighting scenes (in particular a mind altered look at a village battle) and the way in which our main protagonist and child soldier Agu delivers a voiceover to let the audience into his inner mindset set, Beasts is a beast of its very own, and it's all the better for it for not conforming to usual resolutions or plot progressions.At the very heart of Fukunaga's film also is the delivery of one of the best child performances your likely to ever see and another feather in the cap of Idris Elba whose quickly becoming one of his generations most powerful performers. For all of Beast's artistic merits it would've fallen short at the finish line had the acting been sub-par but thankfully Fukunaga shows himself to be not only a director of skill, but a director of actors.Abraham Attah as Abu is Oscar worthy, there's no two ways about it. From mischievous child to cold blooded murderer, it's an incredible turn and a haunting one. Attah's intense final scenes in the film show an ability far beyond his 14 years and to think he was plucked from a school yard for this role just makes his turn more mind boggling. Alongside his seasoned co-star in the form of Elba's charismatic yet vulnerable commandant, Beasts features some of the year's best performances and it wouldn't be surprising to see these two at next year's Oscar ceremony.Beasts of No Nation marks the beginning of a brave new world, a Netflix led charge on feature film watching and while it's a shame many of us will never get to see this devastating beauty on the big screen, we should be more than excited for what the future holds on the basis of this no holds barred tale that shows the loss of innocence in the midst of chaos and death.One of the year's best films and in many ways most shocking (a few scenes are almost unbearable in subject matter and intensity), Beasts of No Nation is yet another reason to suggest Fukunaga could well become not only one of the best filmmakers of his generation, but one the most accomplished filmmakers in many moons.4 1/2 screen-free TV's out of 5www.jordanandeddie.wordpress",

    "review": "  Devastating brutal, and unflinching, Beasts of No Nation is an honest look at the horrors of a civil war conflict in Africa. It's a film of violence and repulsiveness, such as can only be witnessed in such carnage. Following a young boy who becomes conscripted in to rebel faction of a resistance group, Beasts of No Nation transports us in to a tragedy that is all too real, yet little talked about.The film's uniqueness has largely been focused on its release venue through Netflix, which is proving to be ingenious, yet one must also acknowledge the achievement by Cary Joji Fukunaga, the director. He brings to life what could be any number of war-torn regions, and focuses his craft on conveying the sheer emotion and the stupendous brutality of the situation. That is to say, it's not the fact of who's fighting or why that's important, all of that is mostly irrelevant; it's the toll that the war has that's important. That is follows a child-soldier makes it all the more impactful, and Cary brings a very talented cast together. This cast, of course, is headlined by Idris Elba, who deserves a nomination for his performance.It's a film that is hard to watch, yet necessary. Bleak, yet honest. If there's a criticism, it's that the underlining humanity is perhaps lost a bit, it can be very difficult to enjoy without an emotional undercurrent for the viewer to follow. Yet it seeks to challenge the viewer and does so unapologetically, with strong performances, a smart script, and all-too realistic execution.4/5 Stars",

    "review": "  [8 outta 10] ~ 'Beasts Of No Nation' just hammers you with raw and brutal imagery/story. The horrors of war-stricken third world life are front and center, definitely not for the faint of heart. It has joined 'The Road' and '12 Years A Slave' on my most emotionally exhausting movies list.Very well written and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (who also made True Detective); excellent performance by Idris Elba, though his character wasn't as savage as I thought he'd be; superb work from the main child actor, Abraham Attah, you felt for/with him completely (though I wish the narrative for his motivations for becoming a child soldier was a little more impactive); his comrade-in-arms \"Strika\" (Emmanuel Nii Adom Quaye) was just as good and his will hit you hard; \"Tripod\" (Annointed Wesseh) stood out despite being a minor character; it was tough to avoid getting invested in the movie because the writing, directing, acting, and atmosphere sucks you right in.Netflix done good... but we all knew that... so worth the $10/mth subscription.",

    "review": "  From Cary Joji Fukunaga, director of Sin Nombre, Jane Eyre, and the 1st season of True Detective; comes a gut-wrenching, powerful film about an African boy getting tangled up in a civil war. Featuring sublime work from the likes of Edris Elba, and the always gorgeous direction Fukunaga brings to the screen; Beasts of No Nation is difficult to enjoy, with its shocking violence and atrocities (all at the hands of children), but it's a powerful film that brings an all too real story to life with darkly poetic writing, and impressive filmmaking. It's not a perfect film. It does seem to drag a bit in the second half, but it's nevertheless one of the best films of the year.",

A post-modernistic synth score underlines the numbness of Agu's journey, and provides the perfect counterpoint to the beautiful, thoughtful cinematography. Elba delivers a grounded, intense performance as the despicable yet charismatic Commandant, but the real star here is Abraham Atta, whose portrayal of Agu is frighteningly believable. Cary Fukunaga is breaking the Hollywood mould, and is certainly a director to watch over the coming years.",

A lot of that comes from the same nature of this story being found in other movies like Hotel Rwanda, Blood Diamond, and The Last King of Scotland just to name a few. It just doesn't bring much new to the table. The performances are fine but I don't think they are stand outs. Many are lauding Idris Elba for his performance being his career best (they didn't see Mandela) and a sure fire Supporting Actor nominee come award season but I don't know about that. The lead actor newcomer Abraham Attah is fine and I'm sure he'll be getting a lot of work after this movie but like I said, no one was really a stand out. I respect this film for what it is but I just didn't get any new experience that was already covered in those past movies I mention that deal with similar themes. Cary Fukunaga does a good job directing this as well but it doesn't have that same unique touch that he brought to True Detective. Once again, I respect the movie but it's not my kind of movie",

Allot of the scenes I felt were extremely dragged on to give something similar to The Thin Red Line's background dialogue, but with this film it only made it feel longer than its already two hour playtime. In the Thin Red Line you would have dialogue during the heat of combat, but here you would be presented with empty scene after empty scene that really dragged the entire thing. Though there were many gripping moments and great visuals, I felt as if it didn't keep the entire picture from leaving drag marks on the floor. Even with an emotional concept I feel as if it spent the entire feature speeding up on the runway and just as we are about to take off it slows down and taxis back to the concourse. As for character development I was very disappointed, as it seems Agu's only major change is when his family is killed. After that it is almost as if he follows this path of gloom through the rest of the picture that he simply fails to avert from. If it wasn't for the background dialogue that allows him to express his thoughts I would have thought he was lobotomized somewhere and I just somehow missed it. Overall I do not think this film is worth the 2 hour sit and is a let down when it comes to the gold Netflix has released previously.",

    "review": "  Beasts of No Nation is a horrifying film to watch, but at the same time it is an important film to watch. If this movie is not nominated for Best Picture, even though it is a Netflix movie, there is something seriously wrong with the Academy. The performances in this film make it more than just a movie, it brings the horror of war in Africa to live as realistically as possible without being in the situation yourself.",

    "review": "  Startlingly grim with breathtaking action sequences that grip your nerves with shaking fear, very real and surfaced emotions from the central child actor, and the in-your-face nature of the dark reality behind violence and corruption, this film is sure to please those looking for the facts of our world and not looking to sugar coat topics with dramatic flare or fake sentiment.",

    "review": "  Notable as Netflix's first movie production of their own, and what a good and important one it is. \"War Witch (Rebelle)\" stands as the better of the two, but this is a gripping tale nonetheless.",
