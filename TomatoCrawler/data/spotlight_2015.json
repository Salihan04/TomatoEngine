    "review": "  Spotlight is the true-story behind the 2002 expose into the Catholic Church's cover-up of decades of sexual abuse and it is unflinching in its focus and animated by its outrage, which is the best and worst part of this awards-caliber movie. Writer/director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, Win Win) is a splendid curator of unlikely movie families, and with Spotlight he follows the titular investigative team (Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, Brian d'Arcy James) at the Boston Globe as they go about their jobs. That's really about it. Over the course of two tightly packed hours, we watch as the Spotlight team chases down leads, goes through archives, interview subjects and know hen to push harder and when to fall back, and day-by-day build their case to expose the massive corruption within the Church. It's invigorating material and worthy of the careful and sincere reverence that McCarthy and co-writer Josh Singer have afforded, though the flurry of names can be difficult to keep track of. However, that's about the extent of the movie. We don't really get to know any of the journalists on much of a personal level or as a character; they are defined by their tenacity and competence. We don't get much time for reflection or contemplation on the subject, especially its psychological impact on a majority Catholic city/staff, and the culpability of those within systems of power that chose to ignore rather than accept the monstrous truth. I don't need more \"movie moments\" or emotionally manipulative flashbacks, per se. With its nose to the grindstone, Spotlight is an affecting and absorbing news article given life but it feels less like a fully formed movie of its own. It's confidently directed, written, acted, and executed to perfection, and I feel like a cad even grumbling, but the ceiling for this movie could have been set higher had the filmmakers widened its focus.Nate's Grade: B+",

    "review": "  When a stellar cast is assembled for any film, immediate interest ensues (for me at least). Even with a bad script and a terrible story, a cast can make something watchable. Luckily, this is a story worth telling, with a smart script and terrific performances all around. \"Spotlight\" revolves around the true story back in 2001, when a newspaper investigated the story of multiple priests that had been accused or assumed child molesters. This film keeps you engaged the entire time, but the main gripe I think many moviegoers will face, is that it has a slow pace and seems to go on a little too long to hold everyone's interest. What helps the pace is that the story always stays interesting and I was always enthralled with the story. Whether it was a brutally honest and tragic scene or some comedic relief, this film had it all. From a story and acting standpoint, this is a stellar film all around. The pacing is really what bogs this film down. In the end, \"Spotlight\" is a terrifically made film that I definitely recommend for people who are intrigued by this story. I do not think it will gain an audience outside of that crowd. \"Spotlight\" is a great watch.",

    "review": "  ALL THE RESIDENT'S BOYS - My Review of SPOTLIGHT (4 Stars)Investigative journalism seems like such a thing of the past in our current quick soundbite, click-bait culture, but SPOTLIGHT deftly and understatedly makes its case for slow, steady, methodical grunt work. Perhaps eclipsed by the events of September 11th, the film looks at how the Boston Globe's 4 person Spotlight Department worked their butts off to expose the sexual molestation cover-ups within the local Catholic church. In doing so, they ignited a worldwide scandal by clearly demonstrating an outright conspiracy to protect their priests while hushing the victims and their families. Director Tom McCarthy (THE STATION AGENT, THE VISITOR, WIN WIN) is having Sandra Bullock's 2009, the year she won the Oscar for THE BLIND SIDE and the Razzie for ALL ABOUT STEVE. For him, he has one of the year's best with his latest film and one of the worst with THE COBBLER, further proving that you CAN win them all! Along with co-writer Josh Singer, SPOTLIGHT feels deliberately artless and unfussy. It opts instead for a large ensemble style of storytelling, drab settings such as government buildings and blue collar homes, and a laid-back, 70s style of framing. Many films have tried to emulate ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, from ZODIAC to TRUTH, but SPOTLIGHT comes the closest to that understated masterpiece's aesthetic and passion. Having said that, I'm not sure it's a compliment to say there isn't one memorable shot in this entire film or that anyone gives a standout performance. Everyone does their job really well, ensuring that nobody pulls focus from the real story. John Slattery, Rach McAdams, Brian d'Arcy James, and Mark Ruffalo make a cohesive team as the main reporters, and John Slattery, Live Schreiber and Michael Keaton ably carry most of the exposition as their superiors. Only Ruffalo gets a loud, shouty scene, but it felt appropriate after the ridiculous amount of obstacles his character had to overcome just to gain access to a sealed file. I would have definitely had one of those \"Let me speak to your Supervisor!\" meltdowns too. For anyone who has ever rushed to get somewhere before they close and gets tripped up by slow drivers, pedestrians, or bureaucrats, these scenes will ring true.What this film truly excels at, however, is its steadily building sense of dread. Despite the fact that we all know where the story's going, seeing it through the eyes of these reporters has its own power. About midway through, there's a stunning, jaw-dropping scene between McAdams and a priest where all of the cards get laid on the table. Because the entire film is told from such a specific point of view, I felt her quiet, perfectly calibrated reaction. This is one of McAdams' finest bit of acting in her entire career...ok, maybe with the exception of her MEAN GIRLS \"I love your skirt!\" scene. Eschewing what could have easily been an endless series of maudlin confessionals, the film favors phone messages, evasions, scrawled notes, microfilm, and lots and lots of closed doors. Without hitting its audience over the head, we see children at play in the corners of frames, to subtly remind us of what's at stake. Sure, the journalists, while quirky or downright odd if you happen to be Live Schreiber here, come off as purely heroic, but it seems earned. Its quiet power may ultimately be unmemorable, but there's something beautiful and rare in seeing hardworking people professionally doing a good job.",

    "review": "  A stellar ensemble sells a strong script that doesn't bop the viewer on the nose with the enough-said obviousness of the injustices at work here. It's a nice ode to the elbow grease and determination of journalism and the forces that beat on integrity along the way. It also humanizes the focal journalists enough to see how a story that big - the now infamous child abuse scandals in the Catholic church - affects each one of them in different, jarring, personal ways. With that grounded approach for our protagonists and the narrative momentum inherent with needing to pull the curtains back on this awful phenomena, the movie was engaging and mostly stirring throughout. Strong film.",

Aside from all of this, both the creative force and the true facts behind it, Spotlight is simply a terrific cinematic story about the truth, getting closer to the truth, and the collective efforts that it takes to get to the truth... or not. Regardless of background, regardless of beliefs, and regardless of how much you do or don't care about this story... this is a film that is absolutely worth seeing. It's by far one of the best of 2015.",

    "review": "  SPOTLIGHT is that rare film that takes a true event and delves into it with razor-sharp focus while employing a straightforward no-nonsense approach; it refuses to resort to ubiquitous movie-like scenarios - there is no fluff, no dazzle, no unnecessary drama, no corny subplots, and none of those moments we have come to associate with \"cheesy\" and \"Hollywood.\" Instead, what Tom McCarthy has brought to the table is a tightly written script about work and process - the ensemble is excellent as they merge into their real-life counterparts and bring to life the strategies and dedication and sacrifice their characters must go through in order to reach their desired outcome (while fighting against the Catholic Church, no less). This is easily one of the least flashy but most thrilling and rejuvenating films of the year.",

    "review": "  A prestige picture of the first order, Spotlight concerns the real life story of a team of investigative journalists from The Boston Globe and their efforts to uncover the cataclysmic sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church. Spotlight is primarily a character study and uses its runtime to showcase the talents of its ensemble cast. Of particular note, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, and Mark Ruffalo present relatable human characters whose motivations and backstories are unraveled in parallel with the abuse scandal. The central theme is the power of intrepid, probing journalism in the face of overwhelming opposition, so in a sense it bears much in common with All the President's Men. The heavy subject matter may shock some, but the presentation is quite objective and tasteful. It does suffer from some overly indulgent and pretentious moments, but solid dramas can be forgiven for those. I personally did not find it to be the year's best film, but I suspect it will be widely credited as such.",

    "review": "  A vital presentation of vital moment in modern reporting, this expertly made film perfectly Spotlights the uncovering of a national travesty with minimal - if any - yellow journalism. Comparisons to All the Presidents Men are inevitable. The utmost of compliments, it just makes sense. That chronicle of the hard-hitting workmanship of two attack-dog reporters unraveling a duplicitous office break-in that ultimately topples a presidential administration defined straight-ahead storytelling, never discoloring their efforts by discussing home lives or their feelings on the politics of the institution itself. Likewise, Spotlight rarely - if ever - bends to subjectivity. The success of both films can best be summed up by the oft-quoted catchphrase of Sgt. Joe Friday (played by jack Webb) in Dragnet: \"Just the facts, ma'am. Only the facts.\" Spotlight dwells very little on the private lives of the reporters in question. When these straight-shooting characters do voice their indignity, it comes off as an authentic venting of frustration when they disagree on when to go public with the truth brought to light by their investigation. Their quest is not a takedown of religion, but of the many community institutions that helped to bury a nefarious conspiracy-not just the Catholic church.This R-rated drama presents the true story behind how The Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core. Tom McCarthy, the writer-director behind beautiful character pieces The Station Agent The Visitor, provides filmgoers with a riveting tale that tries not to editorialize the despicable events at its center. The reporters themselves get handled in the same fashion, neither heroes or villains-just people. The A-Level lived-in performances behind these characters make this all the most a heartbreaking work of genius. Even though one name after another boasts marquee star power (Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci), this ensemble honors their craft by making this dastardly affair unsettlingly real.Bottom line: Right Hand of God",

From a journalist perspective, Spotlight is an incredible achievement, showing the power and importance of real journalism in the modern world. In many ways, Spotlight is a much more difficult film to digest than its main Oscar competitor, The Revenant. Not to take away from Alejandro or Leo, but Spotlight is by far the most important and powerful film of 2K15. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo prove once again that they are forces to be reckoned with.",

    "review": "  This journalistic drama recounts a pivotal 12 months of an investigative research team from the Boston Globe, who uncovered decades of systematic abuse against children by the Catholic Church. With subject matter so infuriating and gut-wrenching, it would have been easy for writer-director Tom McCarthy to create a good versus evil arc and give the audience a clear-cut bad guy to despise and deplore. But McCarthy opts for a more intelligent route and keeps the individual offending priests faceless (barring one unsettling and revelatory scene), instead homing in on the atrocities committed by the institution. Unravelling like a journalistic thriller sans the glee, Spotlight is an insightful, methodical and utterly compelling film that provides a window not only into the earth-shattering monstrosities at its core, but also into the mechanics and minutiae of old-school reporting. Understanding that the interactions between the key players is critical to maintaining a level of reality in what would otherwise seem completely unbelievable (despite being true), McCarthy keeps his direction unflashy, allowing the high calibre cast to flourish. Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Brian d'Arcy James, Live Schreiber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci are all at the top of their games with fleshed out and layered performances that favour subtlety over grandstanding. Spotlight is a brilliantly told true story that captivates from beginning to end, deserving each of its six Academy Award nominations and a place on everybody's must-see list.",

It primarily focuses on a group of 4 following the leads for the paper but it also follows the changes and shake ups further up the chain of command. One of the best films of the year.",

As a lapsed Catholic, it's a little disheartening to see what you've heard or read, on screen. The details of abuse are not the story here, it's the systemic cover-up and that's what these guys went after. Definitely another great Oscar contender.",

    "review": "  A hard-hitting, factual, and emotional ride that doubles as a look into how the field of investigative journalism for print used to work. The Spotlight team (a four person intensive investigative journalist team for The Boston Globe) stumbles upon the conspiracy/cover-up of the century when they investigate a sexual abuse claim involving a catholic priest and discover that this kind of thing has been going on for decades, involves many more priests than originally expected, and it goes all the way up to the top of the Catholic church. This is more of an ensemble film, and our leads do fantastic jobs. Mark Ruffalo (Who slowly boils over into a raw, intense, driven, emotional performance) is Mike Rezendes, Rachel McAdams is Sacha Pfeiffer, Michael Keaton is Walter \"Robby\" Robinson (the editor and head of the Spotlight team), and Brian d'Arcy James (Who also portrayed Shrek on Broadway. He blends seamlessly into his role here) is Matt Carol. They all shine as our Spotlight team. Liev Schriber as new editor Marty Baron (The man who sets it all into motion by assigning the Spotlight team onto the story), Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian (A lawyer who had filed some of the first claims of sexual abuse against the catholic church), and John Slattery as Ben Bradley Jr. are fantastic as well. Some of the imagery is a bit haunting (plenty of shots of Catholic churches that loom over both our heroes and suburban houses), and there are a surprising amount of moments where the floor drops out from under you as the true scope and extent of the damage is revealed (A great example is the closing text crawl that left my jaw dropped in horror). Spotlight sheds light on one of the most important news stories of the past several decades, and it is to be commended for tackling it's subject material with passion while still remaining faithful to the truth of the story. Simply put: Spotlight is an incredible film. It's enough to make you mourn the death of print journalism.",

    "review": "  I've never been to Boston, but I've always thought it a c**t of a city. Not just because of its sickening support of the terrorist murderers of the IRA, or its overly-sentimental dewy-eyed oirish heritage, but because its fans and adherents always seemed the sort of people who are long on arrogance and short on morality, and this film kind of sets the record straight. As one who was at a school loosely linked to similar scandals in the UK, it is important that a decent account is made of these disgusting clerics and their corrupt church. Spotlight is well-meaning and although almost marred by Ruffalo's insufferable scene-chewing performance, makes a decent fist of telling the story but with notable omissions in that we see few survivors and - apart from one jaw-dropping all-to-brief scene - no abusers. But although it rattles along, it doesn't climax and there's nothing here that comes close to All The President's Men, the benchmark by which such a movie has to be set.",

    "review": "  Just 3 minutes into this film I was hooked. Every performance was excellent. They don't dwell on the details of the abuse or exploit the brave victims. The movie speaks more to the systematic cover up not only by the church but also by the judicial system and pretty much everyone else involved which for me was even more disturbing. One moment in the film really struck me - a victim explains that they didn't just lose their innocence, they lost their faith. For me that was so powerful. I also appreciated that they showed what a personal struggle it was for the reporters involved to reveal something so disturbing about the church they had all been raised in. As a Catholic I was concerned that the movie would turn out to be a condemnation of Catholicism as a whole but it isn't. This is a film worth seeing for anyone irrespective of their religious affiliation.",

Not the acting tour de force I was hoping for, but the film will blow you away, based on the content alone.It is a well made, well executed film. Keaton, Ruffalo, Mc Adams amd Tucci are solid as always and a film based on the molestation of children by priests and the mass cover up involved is heart breaking. The film is solid in its depiction of the events and the journalists who uncovered the truth. My only problem with it is- it just too damn humorless. Forget the fact that the subject matter is extremely relevant and humorless. I just don't think that a film as well made and as well acted as this one- has to be without humor- in order to be taken seriously. The film itself needed an extra zing, and not just rely on the story to get you there... especially when you have actors of this fine caliber. Either way- regardless of my opinion- I prefer the movie to the Revenant as an Oscar Contender any day of the week and it should be seen by all. I highly recommend it.",

But for what it lacks in \"happy feelies\" it makes up for in the cold-hard truth of the hardships endured by victims of sexual abuse, as well as the incredulity of how long such incidents were swept under the rug for decades. The cast portraying the dedicated \"Spotlight\" team is the best I've seen since films like \"Argo,\" \"The King's Speech,\" and \"The Social Network.\" Each person feeds off of the next with seamless fluidity. It's surprising that the cast standout, Michael Keaton, hasn't gotten more recognition compared to his puzzling role in \"Birdman\" - though Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams did a very commendable job to earn supporting nominations. As a Christian, seeing stories of widespread exploitation condoned by a church institution leaves me nothing short of frustrated, disgusted, and disappointed. Nonetheless, I highly recommend more people of faith to see this film... for the sole reason that we need to understand and take ownership of such injustices if we're ever to be effective witnesses for His Kingdom.",

    "review": "  Poignant, horrifying, outrageous, and all done using almost purely non-artificial storytelling techniques. They tell the story as it is, taking few risks but in this case, no risks were needed. The performances are pitch-perfect all around, ranging from understated from Liev Schreiber to more focused performances from Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo. The film is shot in a very lifelike manner in terms of the way its captured, in terms of what its capturing it is clearly very reverent towards the city of Boston in a way that quickly gets you to relate to these characters as we get to know their hometown. The characters are well drawn not only by its specific performances but also to its screenplay by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, which in my opinion does not put a foot wrong anywhere. Here we get proper people to engage with, people who make mistakes and do bad things just like the rest of us, but are doing their best to rectify these mistakes while making sure that justice is served properly. When a character goes off his rocker temporarily, I instantly felt the same way he did and wanted to jump through the screen and join him in his rage. It is everything including sad, scary, white-hot-anger-inducing and ultimately bittersweet as we get a list of all the cities worldwide where these scandals happened right before the credits roll.",

Everything here feels organic, director and co writer McCarthy once worked as a journalist, and everyone is on point. The main cast fit their roles nicely but it is the actors who portray the emotionally destroyed victims that McCarthy picked who are just as good. Watching them spill the darkest parts of their lives to the reporters is, at times, bone chilling. An important journalism film that is a must see for those interested in the genre or interested in the blood, sweat, and tears of the career.",

There was no conflict in the Newsroom everyone just agreed with each other which missed a trick I think - and mark ruffallo's performance was highly distracting he wasn't warm or engaging and I felt the other actors had to act around rather than with him, he seemed so engrossed in his character acting he couldn't truly interact with the others, who, by the way, all did a great job. I didn't like the way this film handled itself at all - it was like a bad TV show. McCarthy and Ruffallo ruined this for me, and as the director and an actor with the most screentime this was bad, everyone else did the best they could. I'm not giving this extra points just because of the subject matter which every other critic seems to want to do.",

I looked up what the film was about, without looking over specific details, so that I wouldn't get too lost or confused. Even that, it was still hard to follow. But after watching the film, I put together all the events that happened in the story and try to comprehend what I saw. The actors in this film were portrayed perfectly as the team, and their performances are so well executed. That goes for the writing in the script too. It is extremely well-written. The dialogue and how the actors execute it makes for a really interesting and somewhat disturbing story. I also love how the movie was shot. It looks a lot less polished than many films we see today, depicting that it takes place in the early 2000s. I could only think of one flaw in this film. Since it has such a well-known cast, it can be a distraction as we notice who these actors are. But you almost don't notice because they play their parts so well as they don't feel like they are acting, they are real people in this event. I can see how this film is getting a lot of praise and has been receiving multiple movie awards and nominations. But it is a little disturbing at some parts and it is very hard to follow. It's not one of my personal favorite movies of the year, but I acknowledge that it is one of the best of the year.",

Nonetheless, there's nothing remotely cinematic about it, and the cast of premium cable stars (Slattery, McAdams, Schreiber) just enhances the perception that this only made it to the big screen because one of last year's best actor nominees agreed to take part. Leaves a couple of intriguing plot threads dangling (like McAdam finding a priest who happily admits to committing child abuse, only for everyone to forget the whole thing within five minutes); that's a problem in a film where the climax is so obvious at the outset.",

The brisk pacing combined with superbly executed disclosures made for a nail-biting rollercoaster. When the film ended I could hardly believe that 2 hours had just passed. \"Spotlight\" may have the flair of a made for TV movie, but it's ability to coerce emotional resonance out of it's viewers by simply telling the truth is highly commendable and can easily be regarded by this reviewer as one of the best films of the year. 4.5/5",

Instead, \"Spotlight\" makes itself about the work of news reporting, and is refreshingly subtle and nuanced in both its tone and its mise en scene. A superb, \"textbook\" drama.",

The best praise I could give this movie is that it plays like All The President's Men. The film shows the nitty, gritty of investigative journalism and it does so with zero fanfare or pompous preaching. These journalists are simply doing their job and attempting to tell a vital, damming story. Even when it's characters get overworked and angry about the various road blocks in their way, it's always in service of the story they are working on. They aren't looking to change the world or get credit for exposing a story that needs exposing. They simply want this story told for the victims' sake and sanity and to deter future victims.",

    "review": "  'Spotlight' and 'The Big Short' will forever be linked, which speaks to their quality - both based on true stories that effected lots of people, both great dramas, both Oscar-nominated films out within weeks of each other. 'Spotlight' has some laughs, but not as many as 'The Big Short', mostly due to the dark nature of the material - the uncovering of Catholic priests molesting and raping young children, for over four decades. The Boston Globe investigative journalism team (\"Spotlight\") - from when newspapers were still relevant, in 2001 - consisting of Mike (Ruffalo), Sacha (McAdams), Matt (d'Arcy James) and their editor, Robby (Keaton) are tasked with finding out if an accused priest is in fact guilty of child molestation. This comes about when their bosses, Marty (Schreiber, still looking like Sabretooth) - new at the newspaper - & Ben (Slattery) try to shake things up when they smell a cover up. It turns out there's far more than one priest and one victim - some of the true stories told by the victims as the reporters uncover the facts are truly horrendous and gut-wrenching. Definitely not easy to hear, as you know it has happened in real life, and probably hundreds of thousands of times over the last century.How Ruffalo is only up for Best Supporting Actor, and not Best Actor, is past me! McAdams, on the other hand, is not that utilised - both due to the ensemble cast, I guess. Keaton and Schreiber are good, as is Tucci as the crusading small-time lawyer, but Ruffalo really steals the show, with his heart on the line and it shows in his performance. It's really a great film about newspaper reporting, but is told so well and deals with such an important topic that it is actually enjoyable to watch everyone excel - including director McCarthy, who already has form with 'Win Win'. Certainly not \"fun\", but a great film.",

Spotlight is a research team for the Boston Glove that investigate things in more depth. When new editor in chief Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) comes to the Globe he wants the newspaper to mean something again. He instructs Spotlights chief Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton) along with his team made up of the veteran Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James), the only female on the team Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and then the one always looking for the truth Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo). Together Robinson has them look into the molestation charges and cover up by the Catholic church in the Boston area. Soon enough they begin to uncover more and more leading to an ever bigger issue that doesn't just affect Boston, but possible the whole world. The film also stars Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian a lawyer that is fighting the church and also John Slattery as a fellow editor named Ben Bradlee Jr who helps to uncover what's going on. The movies performances are absolutely fantastic. You feel for the characters and the pacing moves it along quite well.

    "review": "  Journalist have been the inspiration of numerous films, going from the best of them \"All the President�s Men\" to the dark and overlooked \"Zodiac\", so what does \"Spotlight\" offers that would make it stand out? The answer is the shocking/disturbing nature of its subject matter. The film tells the true events that lead up to the publication an investigation regarding numerous Catholic Church child abuse cases in Boston, by the investigation team \"Spotlight\" of the Boston Globe Newspaper. Just by taking a look to the cast this film has, I was interested in watching this film as most of these actors I really like, and this film didn't disappoint me. \"Spotlight\" counts with solid acting by its entire impressive cast (even though most of them are wasted in bland roles) with the standout being Mark Ruffalo stealing every scene he is in, a sharply written screenplay that never loses its realism, some good doses of comedy, a simple piano based score that works when its used, a flat but beautiful cinematography, McCarthy's directing is focused and straightforward, which is exactly what's need in this story; the story is shocking and will send chills to you spine as it goes along, a slow pacing that's allows the audience to understand the magnitude of the subject, editing that keeps you wanting to know more, the characters come across as real people, and the way they handled this extremely delicate, shocking, disturbing and extremely important subject matter is remarkable as they don't overplay it and they don't go to graphic scenes, they just say what's relevant and show how it destroy hundreds of lives. But even if this film has a lot of greatness, it's greatest element (the storytelling) is also is biggest flaw as the characters are forgettable and most of them lack personality, thus making this film a hollow film to watch.\"Spotlight\" is a well-made, and engaging film but is overall forgettable. It handles its subject matter wisely and will start interesting conversations. Undeniably one of the best films of 2015 (possibly the best), it is definitely worth watching.",

Pitch perfect acting on all fronts, and some of the shots in the film say more than the words and actions of characters do. The emotional ramifications of the church's actions are kept at an intellectual arm's length, which dulled their impact somewhat.",

All performances were excellent, led by Keaton, but Oscar worthy is debatable. All the unknown actors and bit roles very much out-shined the bigger performances. Oscar nod for Rachel McAdams for mostly taking notes on a pad is perplexing to say the least. Overall did not live up to the hype based on nominations. Direction was excellent and worthy of nod but could not create the tension it needed. It was easy to lose track of all the names and characters that are mentioned in rapid-fire fashion throughout. Most dissapointing was Liev Schreiber in a very under developed role.",

    "review": "  Spotlight is the polar opposite of The Revenant when it comes to storytelling, and that is not a bad thing in the least. The two films act as pillars of filmmaking in 2015. One uses visual splendor to draw the viewer in to the film, while stark violence and raw emotions allow the audience to relate to the characters. The other builds up a rapport with the viewers through realistic and relatable dialogue, about a subject that needs to be talked about and explored with characters that we genuinely like based on their personalities and not their actions alone. Both are excellent, they just differ greatly. Spotlight covers the topic of the journalism team that uncovered the sexual abuse cover up taking place in Boston churches and the importance of investigative journalism as a whole. With a cast lined from back to front with top performers such as Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and John Slattery, it is brimming with characters that we root for, but also believe to be real people. The story required a grounded approach, one that wasn't heavy handed, and Spotlight delivers. You won't find a grandiose score, or long takes to emphasize moments. Everything here is earned based on the performances and subject matter alone, and it is refreshing. In a season filled with Oscar hopefuls, this film feels genuine. If you haven't already, put Spotlight at the top of your must watch list. 5 out of 5 stars.",

The realism & intensity of the plot is a stunning trace. It's like a tense documentary with these diverse & well visualized characters that, tries to bring this incredible story to life, a story that will bring both suffering and horror to them. It's a pure dialog-driven film that might be too plot-centric, and due to that fact are characters not given that much playground for any depth nor development. A fact-based drama like this flick isn't for everybody, but it is based on a true story -- just the realism, clever and flawless directing, might bring an Oscar to the 'Spotlight'.

So, my wife and another couple who we are friends with decided to go to the movies, and my wife says let's watch this one I heard it was good. I had not even seen the trailer for the movie, all I knew was that it had a killer cast. Needless to say I went with no expectations, that is until I read what the movie is about while I was in the line.This is a movie about journalists. I say this because movies about journalists tend to be boring and tedious. Never in a million years I thought that a movie about journalists (other than \"All the President's Men\") would be so exciting, engaging, thrilling, and powerful.Lets start with the cast. This is a stellar ensamble. First of we have a fresh off an Academy Award nomination Michael Keaton (Robbie Robinson) doing some great work as the head of Spotlight. You have Rachel McAdams, Bryan d'Arcy James, Liev Schrieber, and John Slattery, all ding great understated work. It is not showy, it is just so good that you forget they are actors and you actually think this is a documentary. Stanley Tucci with the small amount of screen time he is given manages (again) to pull you in to the point where you can't wait for the next time he is on screen. Tucci truly is one of the best character actors there is. The real standout of this movie is Mark Ruffalo. Oh my God, what a performance! This is not a showy movie, so there isn't a lot of scenes where the actors can get all dramatic and showy, but he has three scenes near the end of the movie that take you from cheering and thinking \"YEAH!\" to welling up from the rawness of his performance. Close to the end of the movie, the character having lost his faith we see him at the entrance of a church watching a choir rehearse and the look that he has just breaks you down. All of the cast does great work, but he gives an award worthy performance.",

    "review": "  Spotlight is the true story of an investigative branch of the Boston Globe who unearthed a massive cover-up among the Catholic Church and the astonishing number of child-molesting priests that were never brought to justice back in 2002 and with intense acting and riveting storytelling, it may be the best film based on journalism of all time. Directed by actor/writer Tom McCarthy with gusto, he certainly made a bold move taking on this project that paints what many go to for guidance in a really ugly light and you cringe more and more as you learn just how many priests were involved in this scandal. The Spotlight team is made up of character actor Brian d'Arcy James, and big-hitters: Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, and Mark Ruffalo in one of his strongest performances to date remaining subdued and believable with a boiling intensity in his vendetta for justice. The other supporting players are just as great with an unrecognizable Liev Schreiber, Mad Men's John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, and many others, rounding out a terrific ensemble cast that is more quality than quantity. If journalism interests you, this is your home run right here because it is not a flashy film at all and takes its time with the characters researching, interviewing, and writing this case for their paper and it's a great indication of how journalism can do some good as well! The film also plays fair and while it chastises the Church for burying it's secrets, it also shows that the reporters aren't perfect either and have made a few mistakes of their own, it would've been too easy to make this a witch-hunt film, but they thankfully don't go that route. This is a tense, realistic, and brainy drama about getting the facts straight and taking on one of the biggest cover-ups in history and it is immensely satisfying by the end and it's re-assuring to see the media in a positive light for a change.",

    "review": "  I read a book recently about evolution and religion. In the book the author states that while religion can help people and has the capacity to do good, we must first look at all the bad it has facilitated and then place those two considerations on a scale to weigh them out. For example, without religion, the twin towers would still be standing and all the people who lost their lives on 9/11 would not have died that day. Religion was behind the crusades, it has been behind school shootings and serial killings and the recent Paris tragedy and countless civil (and world) wars. And without religion, there would not be an epidemic of biblical (no pun intended) proportions concerning twisted, pedophile priests using their holy anointing to prey upon their underaged congregation. An epidemic that has only relatively recently come to light, but one which has been raging for as long as priests have been donning their clerical collars. Spotlight is about the Boston Globe uncovering and reporting on the sexual molestation of children by priests in Boston. Although the paper only starts with a single reported offence, the Globe's Spotlight team eventually uncovers that over two hundred (!) Boston area priests were involved in over a thousand (!) reported cases of sexual abuse towards minors over the past thirty years. Over a thousand. By priests. Holy men of God, spiritually anointed by God Himself through the archdiocese to care for and lead their congregational flock in a better understanding of, and a closer walk, with Thee. Is there anything more twisted, more purely deranged, than that. And that's just Boston. After this story broke, thousands of priests all over the world have been accused of molesting by many tens of thousands of people. To the casual observer it looks as though the Catholic church is running a birthing house for pervert criminals. And it doesn't help that the Church itself has been so aloof in taking responsibility for its clergy. As the Spotlight team uncover more about the story, they uncover more about the cover ups by the Church to keep these stories under wraps, when they are well aware of these heinous goings on. So aware in fact that they actually have a number of full time treatment centres around the world, always operating at full capacity, solely for pedophile priests in need of 'spiritual realignment'. And are the priests then stripped of their collars and sent to prison or at the very least to live in exile somewhere nowhere near a church or a child? No, they're sent right back out into the world to another church with another congregation full of children with innocent lives to ruin. And I do mean ruin.As the Spotlight team investigate, they speak to the survivors. Considering all the many thousands of incidents of sexual abuse within the Catholic church, it isn't easy at first for Spotlight to track down a great many survivors to talk about their experiences. This is because many, if not most, survivors of clerical molestation are either unwilling to talk about their experiences, or they are dead. Dead from suicide, dead from drug or alcohol addiction, dead, essentially, from an inability to function in a normal healthy way. Think about that and then consider what I said earlier: thousands of priests the world over have been accused in tens of thousands of cases. And the accusers are the lucky ones, the ones who made it, how many more cases will go untold by the ones who didn't? Director Tom McCarthy directs Spotlight with a very matter of fact approach. The film is dry, stubbornly paced and presents the facts without any interest in a poppy visual style or expressive angles. In essence: this is the way it was. Good for him, this story is too important for those distractions. The same can be said for the acting. The film boasts an impressive roster of seasoned actors and all of them do well to get the job done without a bit of scenery chewing. I was particularly impressed with Liev Schreiber, who's understated performance here is also one of his best. I recently watched two documentaries on these scandals: 2012's Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God and 2006's Deliver Us From Evil. If there's one qualm I have with Spotlight, it's that for anyone who has seen these doc's, the movie doesn't have much to offer you won't already know. In fact, if you haven't seen these doc's, whether you see Spotlight or not, I highly recommend watching them as they paint an even fuller picture than the one you'll get with this film. Spotlight is an important movie, it's a brave movie and it's a movie that needs to be seen. People need to be aware of these atrocities being committed in God's name and the Catholic church needs to do something about them already. The world is losing its religion at a higher rate today than ever before and with all the horrible things being done in God's name these days, it's not hard to imagine why.",

    "review": "  I think it's crazy how many films are starting to come out about failures in trusted systems. It's so interesting to see this new information age we live in bring everything to light. Corruption can't hide anymore, not for long anyways. Interesting stuff.I found this film to be really thought-provoking, and thrilling especially, based on the performances. Mark Ruffalo, in particular, really killed it - bringing so much passion and explosive energy to his character.The story unwraps in such an intriguing way; the audience is placed in the same arena as the journalists and we remain gobsmacked throughout the entire uncovering of the church's exploitation of children in what seems to be such a trivial and primal urge. You really feel that betrayal that so many characters in the film express.These \"based on true story\" films are so interesting, because it makes you wonder what the other side is, but something like this is painted so evenly that you wonder what the Catholic church's interest is in abusing adolescents and proceeding to protect such a widespread controversy, rather than eviscerating the offenders and trying to change the image. Maybe we're reaching a point that things are better now, but that's all thanks to the story in the film and the Boston Globe's bravery in standing up for others who were afraid to do so.Definitely a rock-solid drama. Expect some Oscar noms.",

This film shows how professional journalists work to uncover a tremendous story - said professionalism so sadly lacking in today's media world - with hard work, dedication and honesty. How finding out the truth and exposing it was crucial to bringing hard to grasp facts to the focus of the entire world. I see Oscar winners written all over this picture. Best Picture right on to Best Male Actor - and two of them should be nominated here, Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton. Terrific performances by both. This movie moves right along, bringing it all together in a way that almost numbs your mind by the time it's done. When the end credits roll and it shows how this single story brought out atrocious child molestation scandals, not only in America, but all over the world, and you see the long, long list of places, you can hardly manage to get up from your seat and walk out into the world. You are stunned. This is not a spoiler, but I have to say, at one point in this film, without a word spoken, you watch the camera scroll down pages of names and facts, and in the background you hear a chorus of innocent young voices singing a Christmas carol, the hair on the back of your neck rises....you KNOW you are watching something brilliant. And that's what this production is, brilliant. Without question one of the best pictures you will ever see. And the one that will have you thinking and talking about it for a long, long time after.",

    "review": "  Review: SpotlightThis seems to be a Winter movie season full of topical films with tough subject matter. Movies like Room, Concussion and The Danish Girl are already making waves. So is Spotlight, director Tom McCarthy's (The Station Agent, The Visitor) account of the Boston Globe journalism team that took on the Catholic Church and helped uncover decades of child abuse at the hands of priests. Understandably, Spotlight is one of hardest movies to watch this year simply because the subject is so unsettling. Hearing detailed accounts of child abuse isn't supposed to be easy to hear, and while the film thankfully doesn't spend enormous amounts of time wallowing in those details, it doesn't pull its punches either. McCarthy and co-writer Josh Singer deserve a lot of credit for writing what I believe is the best script of the year. It's a talkative movie, for sure, but the dialogue doesn't feel phony or unnatural, and wise decisions were made in choosing exactly what details to include to help create a motion picture that would be informative but also intriguing and well-paced.Of course, a good script is useless without a talented cast and this one sure is a line-up: Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup round out an amazing cast supported by a who's-who of veteran character actors, not to mention an uncredited voice performance by Richard Jenkins. This cast shines, and even though the nominations haven't even been announced yet, it's difficult seeing any other movie taking home SAG's Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture award. The reason I'm making this prediction is because this is a rare film where every actor is so essential to the movie's success. Nobody feels tacked on. Nobody feels like a cameo. I also don't pity SAG nor the Academy because picking who from this cast deserves nominations is not going to be easy. Attention seems to be focused on Michael Keaton as far as awards buzz is concerned, and that's fine. He has rarely been better. If I was able to pick, however, I might shine that Oscar light on Mark Ruffalo or Brian d'Arcy James if only because their characters seem more emotionally invested in the investigation than the others and this gives both actors lots of chances to shine. Spotlight really is a master class in acting and it can't be denied that these actors have raised an already great script to an even higher level.As I already mentioned, the film is well-paced. At just over two hours of talking and talking and talking, some movies may have become boring or repetitive, but Spotlight avoids this pitfall. Editor Tom McArdle has trimmed whatever fat there may have been well and I really can't pick out any scenes that I would have left out.I have always loved movies about journalism. There usually seems to be a real sense of urgency to them and they usually bring out the best from their casts. Spotlight excels in its genre. I've said many times that my favorite thing to see on screen is great actors performing great scripts-but add to that a movie that is really about something important-you just can't beat that. Spotlight may not have been on everyone's list, but it should be. This one is a major contender for best of the year. 9/10?",

From a journalist perspective, Spotlight is an incredible achievement, showing the power and importance of real journalism in the modern world. In many ways, Spotlight is a much more difficult film to digest than its main Oscar competitor, The Revenant. Not to take away from Alejandro or Leo, but Spotlight is by far the most important and powerful film of 2K15. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo prove once again that they are forces to be reckoned with.",

    "review": "  Yes, it's a lot to deal with. So this is about a specialty team of journalists that work for the Boston Globe in 2001. When they decide to run an expos� piece about the high number of reports of child abuse within the Catholic Church, the entire system is in for a big shake-up. Now being that I am in my Oscar crunch, I have a very high intake of films and not a lot of time to sit down and crank out these reviews (also, downtime at my day job has all but disappeared entirely, thus making this a twofold problem). I actually watched this film over a month ago, but I can tell you one thing: it has stayed with me wholly and completely, which isn't something that I can say for a lot of other films I have taken in. I will say that I felt like this took a good 15 - 20 minutes to get going, which is fine, as you are just getting a non-glamorous introduction to these characters before they get into the full swing of their investigation. Once it does get going, it holds on to your attention without letting go. It's such a tremendous ensemble performance from this all-star cast, and you really get a sense of what it is that all of these people do for a living; even if they weren't working on a piece of such high importance, their demeanor wouldn't change all that much because this is people just doing their jobs and trying to do what is right, and the film as a whole never loses grasp of that feeling. Even the no-name actors that you haven't seen before give complementing gut-wrenching performances, and Spotlight makes you feel like a journalist, sparking your interest in the process of it all. I have to give a very high commendation to Spotlight because where most films like this would go for the jugular at a moment's notice given the topic at hand, director Tom McCarthy approaches this with a tremendous amount of subtlety, which is something that is becoming increasingly rare to find in film these days. Spotlight is an excellently made film that is quite hard to watch, given the despicable nature of the subject matter. This year, I've now seen movies about child abuse and animal abuse, and it will never be something that is an easy thing to get through, so I honestly don't know how much repeat viewing one can get out of this. For the story it tells, you experience the full spectrum of emotions; you get excited as a promising lead turns into something more, you get upset when you learn about a grown man's previous experience with a priest, and you get downright angry when you see the church trying to sweep this under the proverbial carpet. I promise you, when you reach the end of this and you get to see a giant wall of text of affected cities, you will have an involuntary reaction in the pit of your stomach. It's a very good thing that this movie exists, and it is utmost effective at telling a story that needed to be told.",

Here the quiet nature of the film isn't so much an admirable trait as much as an arbitrary characteristic of the proceedings, a subdued piece rather than a subtle one; the central search for evidence often feels less like McCarthy is deliberately seeking to make his own \"important\" film and more like he's diligently following the blueprints of other, similar, better movies, All the President's Men in particular. These quibbles aside, Spotlight is an excellent work dealing with an important subject, and while it's not the best film of the year, it definitely deserves to be included in that conversation.",

    "review": "  SPOTLIGHT is an undeniably powerful film, one whose subject matter is absolutely infuriating and disheartening, though if I'm being honest, it kind of coasts on that, and on the strength of the acting on display. The filmmaking is very solid and workmanlike, but nowhere near the kind of bravura effort some in the critical community have argued it is; to me, it feels like an HBO movie, and you can take that any way you want. Now, one could certainly make the case that to turn this story into some kind of flashy cinematic showcase would have been absolutely tone-deaf, and on a certain level I agree. Yet, I still think the movie as a whole is a bit too restrained, a bit too low-key; I was captivated by the material, not so much by the cinema of it all. The strongest element of the movie (unquestionably, in my mind) is the screenplay, which handles an insane amount of information, dates, names, and locations with apparent total ease, and it presents this information in ways that do not allow the facts to become jumbled up in the minds of the audience. Just below the screenplay in importance are the cast members, each of whom do exemplary work, to a person being grounded and real. Some might jump to Keaton or Ruffalo as the standouts, but Schreiber could be the movie's quiet MVP. It's hard not to bring your own baggage to this story, and as a Catholic, it brought back all those things I felt when the actual story broke; the film is a powerful reminder... and also one I have no great desire to revisit.",

    "review": "  Journalism in films is a great subject because the movies explore the process of a investigation, the main characters, ethics and also the power of the system. So many movies have done great work: Michael Man's \"The Insider\", Alan Pakula's \"All the President's Men\", George Clooney \"Good Night and Good Luck\" Ron Howards' \"Frost/Nixon\" James L Brooks \"Broadcast News\", Roland Joff� \"The Killing Fields are among those films.In Spotlight directed by Tom McCarthy journalist is questioned on his core. In 2001 The Boston Globe hires a new editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) with the promise of searching for better stories and more solid journalism work. Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton) is the head of \"Spotlight\" team a group of journalist of the Globe whose articles are investigative nature, but can take up to a year to publish. The film start with an incident of a priest who is be taking a police precinct in Boston for allegedly molesting a kid from the parish in the 70's the case seems to go under the table when the archdioceses gets involved to solve the problem. Tom McCarthy set the foundation of the story by proving that this is lawless crimes that can be hide so easily in front of the police. Back to 2001 Baron reads a small article that talks about a pedophile priest John Geoghan and how the archbishop of Boston knew about it and did nothing to stop it. The spotlight team is been asked to start an investigation about the peophile cases in the church of Boston.The spotlight team start to work Michael Resends (Mark Ruffalo) Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) with a lot of skepticism but quickly revealing shocking information about the victims, their abusers, and how the elite was forced to hide the truth to keep an image of a perfect clerical society in Boston. The film is powerful with strong performances by all the cast, Thomas Newman deliver a compelling original score, Tom McArdle gives the film the perfect pace on a outstanding editing.Spotlight is not about journalist who becomes heroes, is about the power of ethics and the search for the truth, it's also about mistakes made and when you search for that truth you have to risk so many things in your life.",

Its such a delicate and pretty disturbing subject to put on the screen but the movie executed it so well. I really enjoyed this film. Its star filled cast including Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, Liev Schrieber, and Stanley Tucci, bring expeirence and add class to the film. Every individual gives a great performance and makes their character very believable. But Mark Ruffalo stands out the most. I felt his was more ecstatic and flowing. Another Oscar worthy performance from him. The direction in the film is great. Behind a strong screenplay, Tom McCarthy does a stellar job at creating a lively atmosphere about the world of journalism. It's compelling sorry really keeps you concerned with that matter at hand. My biggest issue with Spotlight although I wasn't completely bothered by it is the pace. I felt the film had a lot of incidents in which there were big scenes the movie slowed down. It couldn't keep a steady moving rate of intensity. Audiences will also have trouble keeping track of numerous names that is hard to follow. Overall Spotlight was wonderful. It told the story so well that it made the movie very intriguing. This is definitely one of the best all around films of 2015. If you're looking for a movie that is well written, acted and has a meaningful story, watch Spotlight.",

    "review": "  \"Spotlight\" Cast a Shadow on the Catholic ChurchWith an all-star cast and a compelling story, \"Spotlight\" delivers a blandly straightforward telling of the priest sex-abuse scandal and cover-up through the investigative story featured in the Boston Globe in the early 2000s. The city of Boston was torn apart by the scandal that had lasted for decades, and according the film, many people worked to shield the Church from the consequences of the scandal. Without the cover-up, the scandal would not have lasted so long. However well done and easy to follow the story was, it was predictable. Few revelations were made for me. Certainly, it is an important story to tell, and I am glad I saw the film. However, none of the characters lived up to the power of story itself and the actors adding little to its telling. This may be the case of too much story, too little screen time. The film attempted in a couple of cases to make the suffering of the survivors real, but it played like an episode of \"Law and Order: Special Victims Unit\" and not like a feature film. It was too small for such a lofty topic. In the film, they often mentioned that people died, but it seemed unreal. Examples of that were need to bring it home. The film covered too much time without making the connections for the audience. I really want to like this film more, but it fails as cinema in too many ways. It would have made a better Lifetime Channel Drama as it was written. ??Rating: Matinee\"Spotlight\" is good but not great. After a while, Mark Ruffalo's (playing lead reporter Mike Rezendez) pained expression wears thin. Does he have any other look? Not much in this film. Stanley Tucci puts in a good turn as a lawyer working with the survivors, but the rest of the cast is pedestrian. Perhaps it was the writing, but the film and characters didn't greatly impact me despite the best intentions of the filmmakers and the tragedy of the true story. Peace,Tex Shelters",

No unnecessary melodrama, no exploitation of the subject matter, just straight ahead honest to goodness stuff. Which was, fittingly, just like the real work was done. Yes, as a journalist I take pride in seeing these things. But how often is it done this well? ... Beyond that there is the sheer nauseating reaction to seeing what took place, not just in Boston, of course, but all over the world. Though The Globe was the first to so dramatically link the scandal way up the Catholic Church food chain. Also, Boston being so overwhelmingly Catholic, and really such a \"small town\" for such a big city - the movie did a good job conveying the dynamics of Boston which makes the situation there a bit unique. ... I also, however, despite loathing the Catholic Church as an institution, understand the allure the wanting to believe something and be part of something, and so the disillusionment felt by everyone involved was very touching as well.",

It's remarkable that a story centered upon almost unspeakable crimes -- the sexual abuse of thousands of young boys (and some girls too) by members of the Roman Catholic clergy -- is really a mystery story about finding the proof that will expose the monsters in the church hierarchy who knew about the crimes, covered them up, then lied about the coverup. Virtually everyone in the story in Catholic Boston knows each other and is steeped in the culture that made such venality possible for so long -- the priests, the church administration, its influential supporters, the cops, the prosecutors, and indeed, the leadership of the Boston Globe. Except for two outsiders, an Armenian-American defense attorney and a Jewish editor who pushed the investigative unit, known as Spotlight, to dig, and then dig harder, at immense personal costs to the members of the team. Like the films of Frank Capra, Spotlight brings the story to a rousing finale -- you want to stand up and cheer, were it not for the horror that remains at the center of the story, to this day.",

    "review": "  Yet another astounding piece of cinema making its way to us just as the year comes to a close. Spotlight is the slow burning but riveting tale of the monolithic Boston Globe, based on a true story, when a small team within the paper, called Spotlight, are forced to drop their current investigation and their laid back attitude, in favor of a more audacious and high pressured investigation into molestation in the catholic church, they soon find that not only are their fears true, but uncover a plethora of cases and resistance from the church itself. Spotlight could easily be a David Fincher moment, brimming with brilliant character pieces, rooted in american style and oozing intrigue from the work go, and Tom McCarthy even borrows from Fincher's, Zodiac, in one or more shots. However McCarthy decides to fight back the darkness, somewhat, and leave us with a daunting but uplifting piece, that by the end will completely envelop you. Its a slow burning affair, with not a lot going on, subdued performances, with the exception of Ruffalo and nothing to flashy in the visual department, McCarthy is clearly letting the story and his script do all the heavy lifting and for the briefest of moments the film does feel a little lost to begin with. By the time the 2nd act comes around, not only have we lost ourselves in a weighty investigation, but there is a fare share of excellent drama and performance to go about. The cast are all terrific, everyone from Keaton, Schrieber, Crudup, McAdams, Tucci and Slattery all do some solid work, grounding the lifeblood of the Globe and making the piece feel extremely human and unlike an Oscar nomination, however its Mark Ruffalo's completely riveting and game changing performance that turns this cast and indeed film from a good time, into a great time. He just becomes a character, even with his, huge stature as the Hulk, Ruffalo is fearless and capable of completely bypassing any connection with his CGI counterpart, by just deeply rooting himself in good old fashioned performance, from mannerisms to accent, really lending a sense of realism to the whole affair. Its a great picture all around, and thats Spotlights biggest flaw, if you can call it that, it appears to play it safe. The film takes quite a bit of time to start leaving you a little more time than you want, to begin to pick apart the film itself, by the end you will really love the final product but will not be able to shake the feeling that McCarthy may have played this one, just a little too safe. Its understandable given the content but in this case the careful approach can be felt by the final frame. It's a solid effort, a film more subdued and down scaled than a lot of others on offer this year, strongly recommend.",

    "review": "  Spotlight is a gripping drama of real-life people braving a storm in search of the truth. It's story is at times difficult to believe was based on facts, but with a captivating screenplay, a no-holds-barred approach to the harsh reality of said story and committed performances by all its players, you believe that you could watch a documentary or video-journal of the events as they took place. Set in in Boston in 2001 right before and going through 9/11, Spotlight's much discussed story is thus: for over 30 years, priests of the Catholic Church have been abusing children without law officials doing so much as letting people discuss it. Such a story in this day and age could sound like a punch-line for a joke, but at the time the story was breaking, it is easy to see how jarring this was to realize. In such a tight-knit community as in Boston, it would be easy for priests, the high and mighty disciples of God who the common folk look up to and strive to please, to cover something up like this. Something had to be done as demonstrated in the film. The performances are all of the charts and very well thought out. There isn't anyone to single out really because of how much of an ensemble piece the movie is, with all these distinguished and recognizable actors losing themselves in their roles, which is a testament to the commitment put into this project. A brilliantly conceived and executed film with an instant draw.",

    "review": "  VIEWS ON FILM review by Jesse Burleson\"I wanna keep digging\" quips the character of Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), a well respected reporter at Beantown's most heralded newspaper. What can I say, I \"dug\" all 128 minutes of the vehicle I'm about to review.Anyway, for all Academy Award purposes and historical insight, Spotlight is the quintessential best picture nominee. It's secure, by the book filmmaking and that doesn't hurt it in any way. 1976 had All the President's Men, 1981 had Absence of Malice, 2007 had Zodiac, and now 2015 brings us \"Light\". All these films have one thing in common. They are dialogue-driven, feed off paranoia, and resound in crowded newsrooms. \"Nose goes\" gets a nose for the news. Natch!Taking place in the early 2000's and helmed by director Tom McCarthy, Spotlight moves along like a jack rabbit. Yeah this flick is talky but it never comes off as insipid. There are a lot of continuity cuts between scenes, ensemble acting (where everyone helps each other out) of the highest order, and crackling intrigue inhabiting every frame. Alongside his previous endeavor Birdman, \"Light's\" lead in Michael Keaton, is now two for two. His co-star (Mark Ruffalo) who got nominated for a supporting role via 2014's Foxcatcher, is also batting 1.000.So yeah there might be a repetition in Spotlight involving every (news reporter) caricature interrogating a victim and/or a suspect. No matter. This Open Road Films release rings true because Josh Singer's screenplay is tight and engrossing. What we have amongst the muck, is the best movie of the year (so far). And just like one of my other top picks (2015's Black Mass), the city of Boston swallows the proceedings whole as if Michael Phelps decided to inhale tons of hot dogs. You want to see actual events depicted that involve a massive cover-up among the Roman Catholic priests? You'll get that in \"Light\". You want the 9/11 attacks to be used effectively as a backdrop? You'll get that as well. You wanna witness a small investigative team unravel the secrets behind so many young churchgoers getting molested? It's all there. And do you want to revel in having the Boston Globe be the locale where all the news shtick goes down? Prego. Finally, do you want a cast that includes Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, Rachel McAdams, and Billy Crudup? Who wouldn't.All in all, Spotlight involves behind-the-scenes preoccupation in small rooms and quiet, open spaces. Every nuance between the troupers sticks. With its disciplined magnetism and critical darling demur, \"Light\" shines brightly. Rating: 4 stars.",

    "review": "  Spotlight is outstanding in terms of acting, Keaton and Ruffalo are impeccable, but not just them, all the cast including extras. And also is great in terms of writing.It shows you in a very realistic way the journalistic process, and thats could cut both ways, if you are curious about that process, or about the subjects treated in the film, you would enjoy it; but if you are not, then you would notice that the pace is not right for a movie, and probably you are going to get bored. But there's something that must be clear, it's a true story and they are not always exciting and fast-paced.Anyway is a great film, with a complicated subject but centered in the journalists and the work they do (and not in criticizing the church).Spotlight es excepcional tanto en escritura como en actuaciones, Keaton y Ruffalo son impecables, pero no s�lo ellos, todo el elenco incluyendo los extras. Muestra de una manera muy realista el proceso period�stico, y eso termina siendo un arma de doble filo, si eres curioso acerca de dicho proceso o si te interesan los temas tratados, te va a gustar esta pel�cula; pero si no es as�, entonces te daras cuenta de que el ritmo no es el adecuado para una pel�cula y, probablemente, te vas a terminar aburriendo. Pero hay algo que debe quedar claro, es una historia real y no siempre son emocionantes y de ritmo r�pido.De todos modos es una gran pel�cula, con un tema complicado pero centrado en los periodistas y el trabajo que hacen (y no en atacar a la iglesia).",

It follows a team at the Boston Globe in 2001 who starts to look into the sexual abuse cases in the catholic church. The cast is great and everyone does a great job. Because this is an ensemble cast with no real lead I can see many supporting acting nods coming to this movie come oscar time. My particular favorite was Mark Ruffalo who really gives it his all. It has a few slow moments but I never really got bored and this felt like a very realistic take on what was going on at the Boston Globe in 2001. Definitely worth a watch at least once!",

I like this kind of movies, about journalism as a profession how they go and discover, unravel the truth and inform the public no matter what... for Spotlight they deliver that as they go against Church, I though there would be more from the other side, trying to bury or at least fight it but we end with the release of the story and that's enough!!! All the cast did an amazing job, that made the whole thing feel real... Mark Rufflalo performance was great, he had couple of stellar dialogues, I would like Ray Donovan/Liev Schreiber to have a bigger role in here but :/ he did great, but it would have been amazing to see him deal with this in other manners than putting a bullet through one of them and bury him in the ground :p Now waiting for the other newspaper story with Christian Bale in The Big Short :) I'll give it an 8.5-9/10",

    "review": "  A prestige picture of the first order, Spotlight concerns the real life story of a team of investigative journalists from The Boston Globe and their efforts to uncover the cataclysmic sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church. Spotlight is primarily a character study and uses its runtime to showcase the talents of its ensemble cast. Of particular note, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, and Mark Ruffalo present relatable human characters whose motivations and backstories are unraveled in parallel with the abuse scandal. The central theme is the power of intrepid, probing journalism in the face of overwhelming opposition, so in a sense it bears much in common with All the President's Men. The heavy subject matter may shock some, but the presentation is quite objective and tasteful. It does suffer from some overly indulgent and pretentious moments, but solid dramas can be forgiven for those. I personally did not find it to be the year's best film, but I suspect it will be widely credited as such.",

Is there more to this story? What other stories were written by the Spotlight Team? If a movie gets you interested like this, then you know you watched something of quality and even importance. The premise itself is simple. The Boston Globes \"Spotlight\" team gets the assignment to invistigate a story, that builds up as they are making more and more progress and ultimately blows off the lid of an unprecedented scandal. Just like \"All The Presidents Men\" about the infamous Watergate Affair, \"Spotlight\" grips you with the perfect combination of writing and acting. The technical aspects of the movie, like directing, editing and cinematography are all really good, but it all stands on the shoulders of the performances and the script.Spotlight starts pretty slow and it took me about thirty minutes to get into it, but once they are on the story, it never once loosened its grip on me. It actually tightened its grip throughout the rest of the movie until the very end.The whole cast starting from Michael Keaton to Liev Schreiber is phenomenal, but Mark Ruffalo manages to stand out a bit with a fantastic performance. He may be The Incredible Hulk, but for me he always shines in smaller movies like \"Begin Again\" or \"The Kids Are Alright\". There is a scene during the last act with him that should create some oscar buzz.As great as this movie is, it is definitely not for everyone. It is purely dialogue and performance driven and you really need to pay attention, otherwise you might get lost amidst the waves of different names and new details.If you are up for it, then you will get a fascinating lesson on investigative journalism and on how important it is to break the silence, when the voices need to be heard.",

From the word go to the stunning facts shown at the end credits, Spotlight never loses pace, grittiness or it's ruthless approach. There's not a single dull moment anywhere whatsoever. Sticking to it's guns and based on cold hard facts, it re-enacts the sheer professionalism Boston Globe guys showed during their gruesome discovery and does so with impeccable grace and every emotion shown in the screen hits home with absolute precision. But all of these looked so spontaneous, seamless. Well, having Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton. Rachel McAdams. Liev Schreiber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci in their ranks really helped the cause. Especially Mark Ruffalo. Steals the show time and time again.Tom McCarthy's direction seemed lucid and vivid. In a film where you are working with facts and dialogues, you probably should never let the pace down or let the grip loosen even when it is so easy to do just that(Fincher's Zodiac, arguably, is a good example of a dialogue based, fact ridden film going slow, take it easy, yet making an positive impact. But that's probably always not the case.). Tom McCarthy recognized this and took the high road.With two Golden Globe nominations, Spotlight surely will have more accolades in it's way.

    "review": "  This is a film I will come back quite soon. It's intelligent, the acting is very good (with the Keaton and especially Ruffalo being the MVP's, but Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber and Stanley Tucci doing great work) but what I really respect about this film is its ambition to focus on the work done, on the issue at hand without glorifying the journalists and without making a fuss about their big victory. I, as a viewer, felt as close to unearthing the scandal and realizing its scope and the personal tragedies related to it as the journalists on the Spotlight team. I also responded to the economy of the cinematic approach (there's not one wasted scene, not one wasted shot) and the refusal to allow sentiment and big dramatic moments associated with such films to make it into the film and turn it into an overblown self-congratulary melodrama.",

    "review": "  \"Spotlight\" is about the team of investigative reporters of the Boston Globe that goes by the same name who uncovered the child molestation and cover up scandal by the clergy of the local Catholic Archdiocese. The reporting won the team the 2003 Pulitzer Prize.\"Spotlight\" is an ode to investigative reporting that focuses on accuracy, fact checking and restraint in publishing a story until all the facts and circumstances have been fully covered. It is a discipline and an art form that is almost lost in today's world of journalism where the focus have been subverted to get higher ratings (TV), keep subscribers and maintain readership (print media) or to please advertisers (both).The film features a superb cast that includes Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci, to name a few. The ensemble acting is magnificent. As to the story, it is told with meticulous attention to detail.\"Spotlight\" reminds us of \"All The President's Men\", the 1976 film that focused on the Watergate scandal. But more importantly, this film shows what true and hard-working journalists can accomplish when the focus is on the victims - even if it means taking on an institution that has power, money and resources. It is about performing due diligence and telling an accurate story that, in the end, looks at a system that allowed a cover up to happen.",

In this case, it is the buried for too long story of the sexual abuse scandal that originated in Boston which is a huge catholic hub that latter spread around the whole globe, at the beginning of the last decade and the Boston Globe Spotlight researchers who ended up picking up the story by their new editor when it was a much smaller case. Very much about the writting and the ensemble cast with very award worthy performances by both Keaton and Ruffalo, Spotlight gradually unfurls all the story threads as the case develops from one possibly lead to many without overplaying its hand and doesnt make things too showey with music, letting the emotion and information pretty much speak for itself as the audience discovers the scope of the misdeads by the church. A for sure Academy Award contender and was very worthy of being a contender for the audience award at TIFF 2015. A great return to form for Mccarthy after the stumble that was the Cobbler.",

    "review": "  Journalism can be a hard topic to cover in film without adding a bunch of unnecessary drama to make it interesting. But Spotlight has the benefit of a great script with very natural dialogue. Nothing here feels forced of feigned. It immersively chronicles the Boston Globe's long-time investigation into the Catholic Church sex-abuse scandal.As a guy who grew up in the Catholic Church, it isn't easy watching this film and knowing that it's the Catholic Church who is to blame. But like any place where you have people in a position of power, you're going to have those who abuse that power. The Church is no different. And just like not every cop is racist and not every black person plays basketball, not every priest is a child molester. Although I was an alter server as a child and luckily never experienced or heard of anyone personally who suffered through this tragedy, I do shake my head at those who tried to cover it up. Although the sex-abuse issues were nationwide, the film focuses mostly on the staggering numbers in the Boston Archdiocese. Catholicism in Boston has been known to be more of a culture in that city than most other places in the country. Their dependence and wholehearted belief in the Church made for a much easier target for predators. It's one thing to idolize God and hold true to your religious beliefs, but it's another to idolize other human beings. To idolize is to believe that one is not capable of fault. Well, the people of Boston held true, more than anyone, that these priests were godlike figures who could do no wrong. It was a sentiment that exuded from everywhere in that city. In California, where I live, I've never experienced anything quite like that in the 26 years I've spent as a practicing member of the Catholic faith. Not to say that these priests aren't expected to lead a holier life than most of our own, but then we look back to that whole abuse of power thing. As for the movie, it's very well done. The acting is superb. Director, Tom McCarthy, gets the very best performance out of each of his actors. Especially Liev Schreiber, who does his best Steven Wright impression, always remaining soft spoken, yet intimidating. He never overplays his character, which isn't necessarily easy for an actor to do. Mark Ruffalo is perhaps the biggest standout. He's an absolute phenomenon here. He commits so much to every one of his character's idiosyncrasies that it's truly hypnotizing. The script is also great, doing well to explain and give background on a lot of the more convoluted details of the story. It can, however, be hard to follow all the names that are being spewed at you, remembering who everyone is. The story moves along briskly with only a slight thinning out for about 10 minutes towards the end.But the one thing that Spotlight does pretty poorly at is depth, almost as if it's deliberately trying not to have any. It's anything but a character study. There's a lot of implied background for the characters, but you can't help but want a little more. Even in the macro sense, it has several perfect opportunities to explore the psychology behind these child molesters, but the film never really takes advantage of them, thus leaving a few scenes feeling unnecessary.Despite making unbiased claims, the film does have a bit of an agenda of its own. It tells of certain characters' stated struggles with their faith, although they had already admitted to being lapsed. While it never shows how the Church's scandal would affect actual churchgoers.Although I'm not commending any of it, I know why Cardinal Law chose to cover up all of those scandals. When you have a society that is full of ignorant people who constantly generalize everything, then you are going to have other people who try and cover up these instances in fear that the general public will, indeed, generalize. And so it happened anyway. Those who aren't Catholic go into this movie and may look at the Church in a negative light. But like I said, people love to think in absolutes. I, myself, don't idolize anyone, but can totally recognize that these are definitely horrible tragedies to be ashamed of.Twizard Rating: 94",

    "review": "  Spotlight is directed by Tom McCarthy, and this film stars Mark Ruffalo , Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and pretty much many great actors. And this movie is about a scandal that involves the Catholic church, and there are these reporters played by Ruffalo, and the rest of the actors who are trying to write a story about the scandal, tracking people down. But there are obstacles in the way. When I first heard about this movie, I had a feeling that this movie has some potential. The trailer looks good, and all I knew is that there is this scandal, and there are these reporters trying to put it together and expose the truth. That was all I knew. So I knew this movie was going to be good. And it is. I'm very impressed. This is one of the best movies I have seen this year. And it's all done by its incredible acting, incredible script, and incredible directing. This movie deals with a subject matter involving priests and children. There are victims. And these reporters are just out there collecting information from the people who were involved with it. And some of the victims and their siblings have different reactions, and it could be pretty heart breaking too, because these are people who had to put up with it. And it messes them up psychologically. And to make matters worse, this issue has been going on for a long time, and people already knew about it. But they didn't take the time to speak about it. and throughout the entire movie, you are just watching these reporters, doing their jobs like real people, collecting information. And we as an audience are finding some shocking information that we don't see coming. Some information that makes us cringe, because this is based on a true story. And you just want our reporters to get this clear out of the way, and expose the people involved in this scandal. And then it gets to a point where you feel like that this is not a movie. Sometimes when we watch movies based on true events, we know that it happened. But in the end, you think to yourself, it was just a movie. But in Spotlight, you feel like you are transported into the year of 2001 and 2002, where the movie takes place, and you see our reporters doing what they have to do. And it all helps with our characters. Everyone did a flawless job in this movie. All of the characters felt very realistic. There wasn't a scene where I felt like I was just watching an actor. You feel like these people are just real life reporters. Michael Keaton,. First you got Birdman, and now this? You just love seeing him on screen. And you just love some of his scenes. and then you got Mark Ruffalo , who did a mind blowing job. He is the one in the group who wants to get this story out there the most. he is running around, going into buildings, getting documents, writing down information, and you just feel the passion of his job. He is the one affected the most about this case. There was this scene, where he and Michael Keaton has this argument, and Ruffalo and his performance was very outstanding. This movie is about mystery, and it really really works. Guys, go and check this movie out. It has outstanding and great performances, and great direction. It's one of the best of the year. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out. This movie is pretty flawless...for the most part. There were a few times where the story drags, but you are going to enjoy watching this film.",

    "review": "  This film is based on the true story of how an American publication, the Boston Globe eventually broke the story of the widespread abuse of young children by Boston priests while the Catholic Church stood by and covered it up. After watching this film yesterday at the Dubai International Film Festival 2015, I felt heartbroken, disgusted and furious. It's challenging to make a movie that is as well-made as this one, while also being as difficult to watch. We know the story, we even know how it snow-balled globally, but the raw emotions of disgust and sheer anger permeate much of our being as we watch it unfold on screen. Director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, The Visitor) co-wrote the script with Josh Singer (The Fifth Estate) and it's worthy of favorable comparison to other investigative newspaper films like The Insider (1999), Zodiac (2007), and even the All The President's Men (1976). The film defines the misuse of faith, which can be either trust or belief. Faith can also be defined as religion and ideology. The story broke the faith that so many once held, and started a global (as evidenced by the closing credits) reckoning and awakening that was desperately needed. The film offers a line of dialogue, \"It takes a village to raise a kid ... or abuse one.\" In other words, it took the often silent actions of so many to allow this despicably evil horror to continue. In a tribute to the newspaper profession, it took a small group of dedicated reporters to pull back a curtain that should never again be shut. Let's have faith in that. The film does sound like a simple story, but its script is much deeper than that. The film has a heavy subject matter, and thanks to its dialogue, the subject matter becomes more engaging. This is because the story that the characters are trying t0o make big, becomes really disturbing and you, the viewer, will definitely not feel good, whilst watching this movie. The script also not only develops the characters, but shows the passion of trying to spread, as news. The story follows an investigative journalist team called \"Spotlight\". It's led by editor Walter \"Robby\" Robinson (Michael Keaton) and his three reporters: Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). They report to Ben Bradlee Jr (John Slattery), whose father was the editor of The Washington Post. Under a new editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), the team begins to unfold a horrific pattern of child sexual abuse by the church that was muted and covered up by high priced lawyers and payoffs to victim's families. As Walter probes further and further into the events (the setting is after the events the 9/11) the investigation reveals layers and layers of injustice of Catholic Priests that were aided by the highest powers of the church in an effort to keep the story muted. What is most fascinating about the movie is that it focuses on the investigative aspects - just how diligent the reporters were in putting the story together - and how fluid the process was ... the story led them, not vice versa. There was no media agenda to \"get\" the church. Instead, the reporters experienced natural shock as each piece of the puzzle was discovered. One of their key sources was a priest-turned-psychologist (voiced by Richard Jenkins) who helped them put scope to the numbers. Another was Phil Saviano (Neal Huff), the leader of a victim's group, who had tried before to provide documentation to the press. Saviano is the perfect example of how someone so passionate about a cause can be viewed with such skepticism ... right up to the point when they are proved correct. Three attorneys add perspective to the cover-up. Eric Macleish (Billy Crudup) made a career of settling cases (and silencing victims) for the church. Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) is the polar opposite - he fights vigorously to get the victims heard, while Jim Sullivan (Jamey Sheridan) is caught in the middle - settling cases for the church and struggling with his conscience. Other interesting characters include Paul Guilfoyle as Pete Conley, a smooth-talking power-broker for the church, and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law - the man at the top who eventually apologized and was rewarded with a high-ranking position at The Vatican. Where you must begin, with any praise for the film, is the audacious and fortifying script by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer. The two create cinematic magic in their articulation of words, characters, and narrative storytelling. Each person feels authentic. Each scene feels rich and equally important as the last. Director Tom McCarthy does a great job behind the camera, making the audience feel disturbed by the subject matter of the film. You also feel the determination and passion of these characters, thanks to the direction. I also love the cinematography for looking very realistic, up to the point where the locations, such as the office, looked real. The film is so well crafted and acted that it features more than a few \"best scenes\". Sacha has a brief encounter with a former priest on his front door stoop. The priest freely admits to molesting kids and his rationalization will certainly deliver chills to most any viewer. Being that the investigation lasted well into 2001, it's quite informative to watch a news agency shift directions for the September 11 tragedy, and along with the nation, put all else on hold. Finally, there is a point in the movie where we as viewers have just about had our fill of extreme emotions - we either need to hit something or throw up - and reporter Rezendes comes through with exactly what is needed: an emotional outburst and release of exasperation rivaling anything previously seen on screen. It's a wonderful moment for Ruffalo as an actor, and a peak moment for viewers. Ruffalo exhibits his best screen performance to date, and makes a stake in his claim for the Oscar this year. Ruffalo builds his 'Mike' from the feet up, giving him his own characteristics that I'm not sure McCarthy and Singer set out to do. His expressions in words, mannerisms, all encapsulate the magnitude of his work, including an explosive scene that brought tears to my eyes. Think back to Emma Stone's acclaimed work in \"Birdman,\" and the scene that made everyone notice. I wanted to simply applaud. Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams, are attune with their characters and destinations. Each bring strong sensibilities and sensitivity to their roles that desperately call for them. Hotly worked into the story is Liev Schreiber as a newly appointed Editor, that in the little screen time he's given, makes a long-lasting impression. Stanley Tucci is also afforded the same opportunity, and gives one of the film's best monologues. On the whole, 'Spotlight' is a very clever movie, with an immensely important topic and near-perfect dialogues, crafted both by amazing actors and great screen writing. If you like seeing a cast keeping things grounded and realistic, and yet have moments of powerful drama and conflict that cuts at a lot of corners of society (especially, also, involving class as this is also a class issue involving low-income families having kids who were molested/raped), this is a film to see. It doesn't exactly leave you feeling all that 'good', but it does celebrate what journalism can do in an non fussy, unsentimental way that is refreshing too. Plus the awards season may just have found its first forerunner. This year has been average at best without any standout films initiating awards conversation, Tom McCarthy's Spotlight rising above the heap to assert itself as one of 2015's best.",

    "review": "  There are some really good movies that you simply like to watch over and over again, and then there are some like Spotlight while very good, I don't think I want to see ever again. Spotlight is very well written and acted and directed, so much so you feel like you are back in 2001 when this behavior by some priests was uncovered by the Boston Globe. As the husband to a Catholic wife and father to Catholic children and son to a Catholic mom, I grieve alongside them at all that came forward through this investigation, and is why I don't think I want to sit through this movie again. I was riveted and engaged was the story unfolded and surely sympathized with the victims as their stories were told. However, the pure subject matter is hard for me to handle more then one viewing. It's not that any of the behavior was shown on the screen, just the knowledge of the subject matter is enough for me. This is a worthy best picture candidate, but I sure don't want it to win.",

    "review": "  Inspired casting and pitch perfect scripting make Spotlight an astounding achievement. Spotlight adds to a long list of great investigative procedurals such as All The Presidents Men, The Insider and Zodiac. This film however, gets at something more profound, and that is journalism as moral imperative. What obligations do journalists have to investigate a possible story? If the press fails to act on possible leads or to take a story seriously or take on a story because it might be too difficult, are they culpable for any harm that is done? Where is that line drawn? Spotlight invades a small investigative unit of the Boston Globe during one the city's most damning hours, the possible high level cover up of the molestation of thousands of children over the course of several decades by dozens of local priests and clergy, to answer these questions. What really makes the film great is how Michael Keaton deals with the dilemma of bringing the story to live, while trying to square with the fact that the newspaper, under his watch, failed to uncover and report the story for decades despite mounting evidence of wrongdoing. Its a truly dynamic piece of filmmaking that should find itself in the drivers seat for best picture, screenplay and supporting actor come Oscar time.",

    "review": "  From time to time, if we are so lucky, a movie comes along that stands out among the rest. Not because of how big the special effects are, how many jokes it has, or because of how many different groups of people took a liking to it because it pandered to their ideals; but rather because of how simple it is and how complex subject matter elevates it to a higher level of social prominence. This is the case for the new independent film Spotlight; a riveting story that shows how The Boston Globe brought to light one of the darkest stories in recent memory. I wont spoil too much about this film but I will say that this deals with the discovery of child molestation in the Catholic Church and how one newspaper fought to bring light to this horrific issue. There is simply not one thing I could see wrong with this film so lets dive in and talk about where this movie excels. The main area this movie succeeds is in how subdued the acting is as well as the major scenes. The cast here includes award worth performances form Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAddams, and Liev Schrieber. They make up the primary cast here and their performances are above exemplary. Each actor delivers strong performances and never brings the element of melodrama to their scenes. It would have been easy for them to scream and shout to the news they discover but they all show multiple emotions at the same time that makes this movie feel more real than any other movie I have seen since 12 Years a Slave. The writing here is equally powerful highlighting terrific dialogue as well as scenes that will crawl under your skin and keep you invested throughout the film. The big scenes in the film are very subdued in their delivery. The lack of musical score in some parts even elevates them to new heights as they let the dialogue sink in rather than musical swells. The dialogue also carries weight with every scene that we as movie goers simply aren't used to anymore. The climax of the film in particular comes form the dialogue rather than set pieces of arrests or anything else. Director Tom McCarthy also delivers some of the finest scenes shot this year. His direction, along with outstanding cinematography, blend together perfectly for a crisp view of the Boston Globe building as well as Boston as a whole. This movie's setting in Boston also serves as a strong point here. We are constantly reminded of how tight knit the city is and even goes as far as to why a story like this is so prominent and elevates the film even further in terms of drama as well as suspense. Overall I can not possibly praise Spotlight enough. It takes on of the darkest story and handles it with care and delivers one of the finest films in years. Everything works here and I implore all of you to go and see this film when you can.",

This is a movie for grownups on a topic (predator catholic priests) that will educated, outrage and satisfy audiences. The acting was superb (a powerhouse cast) and despite the subject matter, the conclusion was not without its positive conclusions. This dramatic true-life drama set in Boston is quite a palate cleanser from all the bubblegum superhero flicks we've been OD-ing on lately. A special note to the two christian, senior citizen women who had the nerve to berate us after the movie because we laughed too much throughout the movie. Keep your judgemental pointing fingers in your pockets. Of course it is a serious topic, but that doesn't mean the humour was to be endured in silence. And frankly, the hypocrisy and irony presented throughout the movie could have you shaking your fist at the movie, weeping and laughing. The movie was that good with its ability to touch on so many emotions. I will not apologize for laughing at the outrageousness and irony that carefully peppered the film to break various tense scenes. I've never considered giving two old ladies a good shove down a set of stairs, but last night (with the insults by two women who \"go to church every sunday\" - more hypocrisy) it was as close as it gets.",

It also reminded me of a movie released in 1975, Three Days of the Condor, which in spite of it's one similarity to this movie, was indeed Great. What did they have in common? In both cases they promulgated a big lie, by sanctifying the New York Times (or in this case, it's subsidiary, Boston Glob) and it's 'journalists' as constituting the last line of defense of our civil-liberties in this country. What it clearly demonstrated: if someone happens to be on the list of people that Liberals and Leftists despise, these so-called journalists will leave no stone unturned in their attempt to discredit, defame and if possible destroy that person professionally and personally. However, if you happen to be on their list of people who can do no wrong -- they will do whatever is necessary to prop up whatever lies, half-truths, or popular prejudices they can to prevent an inconvenient truth about that person from seeing the light of day. So, for those who prefer to think of this movie as pure fiction, taking place on a planet nowhere near our solar-system, I gave it 3-starts. !;)",

    "review": "  A vital presentation of vital moment in modern reporting, this expertly made film perfectly Spotlights the uncovering of a national travesty with minimal - if any - yellow journalism. Comparisons to All the Presidents Men are inevitable. The utmost of compliments, it just makes sense. That chronicle of the hard-hitting workmanship of two attack-dog reporters unraveling a duplicitous office break-in that ultimately topples a presidential administration defined straight-ahead storytelling, never discoloring their efforts by discussing home lives or their feelings on the politics of the institution itself. Likewise, Spotlight rarely - if ever - bends to subjectivity. The success of both films can best be summed up by the oft-quoted catchphrase of Sgt. Joe Friday (played by jack Webb) in Dragnet: \"Just the facts, ma'am. Only the facts.\" Spotlight dwells very little on the private lives of the reporters in question. When these straight-shooting characters do voice their indignity, it comes off as an authentic venting of frustration when they disagree on when to go public with the truth brought to light by their investigation. Their quest is not a takedown of religion, but of the many community institutions that helped to bury a nefarious conspiracy-not just the Catholic church.This R-rated drama presents the true story behind how The Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core. Tom McCarthy, the writer-director behind beautiful character pieces The Station Agent The Visitor, provides filmgoers with a riveting tale that tries not to editorialize the despicable events at its center. The reporters themselves get handled in the same fashion, neither heroes or villains-just people. The A-Level lived-in performances behind these characters make this all the most a heartbreaking work of genius. Even though one name after another boasts marquee star power (Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci), this ensemble honors their craft by making this dastardly affair unsettlingly real.Bottom line: Right Hand of God",

    "review": "  What made the priests' crimes so profoundly evil was that they KNEW the giant power structure -- of the Catholic Church -- would protect them, which ultimately, gave them the ability to then groom and rape even more frequently. The movie explained how many of the abused children (as young as 4) later became so depressed that they killed themselves or died from substance abuse. What the movie didn't say: All those who were complicit to the crimes will one day have to FACE GOD.",

    "review": "  This film was really good, and arguably one of the best this year. What is astonishing is this film is just acting. There are no actions scenes to speak of, and every scene is carried by the actors and actresses' performance. In a sense this film is very similar to \"All the Presidents Men\" in regards how the reporters pursue a story, and showing the amount of work it took. This scenes are mostly carried by the reporting crew, and each person did a great job portraying their characters. Beyond the main reporting crew, the supporting characters were amazing as well. Despite Liev Schreiber and John Slattery getting limited time, but both of them put in amazing performances in their respective roles. The only complaint, and it's not a major complaint at all, is the movie starts out slow. It takes about 20 minutes for the movie to get moving in regards to pursuing the story. Overall it works, but it does start out slow. Finally as a Catholic I should mention this, but the movie did a great job not bashing the religion or making it into a 2 hour anti-Catholic piece. It simply portrayed what happen as it did without an additional narrative added, and the movie was more about the actual reporters trying to make sure what they report is the entire truth.",

    "review": "  Spotlight is a superb presentation of a story everyone ought to understand.I'm an ex-Catholic Atheist, and I saw this movie with a Jewish friend. When it was over, I told him, \"I can never understand what it's like to be Jewish, and you can never understand what it's like to be Catholic.\" I was not comparing the darkness of my bruises with his, I merely meant that we all carry our own special forms of spiritual burden. The impact of the parish priest on a faithful Catholic child is profound. These men were our spiritual heroes. I recognized on a deeply resonating level the impact of the depth of betrayal and scarring these monsters perpetrated on thousands of innocent children. I mean like burn victim-level scarring. The only question was how graphically this movie would portray the predations of these priests. Spotlight is actually quite restrained in this regard. Although the movie is essentially about the journalistic process - \"how I got that story\" - director Tom McCarthy could have easily gone whole hog with vivid flashback scenes. Thankfully, he didn't. He told two stories - two out of thousands - with simple, fact-based spoken descriptions of the priestly predations. It was restrained, and more than sufficient. After all, it's unlikely anyone seeing the movie doesn't know about the scandal. We come to this movie with ready fury, we hardly need convincing. Excellent performances across the board. This story could not have been told more clearly and more effectively. I think the moviemakers approached it with a sense of obligation to history to tell the story as truthfully as possible, without varnish or hype. The truth is unthinkable enough.",

Once I got engaged with the material and the characters I never questioned what was happening, it felt like I was watching history of the Catholic church abuse scandal unfold before my eyes.This is done primarily through the world class talent that delivers on all fronts: Keaton, Ruffalo, Tucci, McAdams. I was particularly impressed with the smaller role of Liev Schreiber as well, perfectly portraying a hesitant yet poignant leader. The only thing that detracts from the entirety of the film is the length, it felt long and a slew of characters made me notice the chair discomfort eventually. However this is still a gem of a movie that should be experienced not only because of it's superb execution, but because it tells an important story of real life events that affect the human beings that live around us in your community.",

Michael Keaton does an excellent job demonstrating the emotional complexity in handling this kind of case. It raises questions of religion and belief, why some stray from our religious upbringing while others hold onto it. The minor characters, the victims of the story, are real stars and bring amazing performances. My only issue (and this is a personal one) is that it is fast-paced and drops a lot of names early on, so it took me a while to catch up.

    "review": "  Every Wednesday \"The Cinema Arts Theater\", a nearby movie theater, offers seniors over 65 entrance to any movie for $5. Though low budget & completely independent (it was started by 2 retired Foreign Service Officers in the 1980s) the theater has a surprisingly strong line-up of movie choices. This week they are showing 8 movies, including \"Spotlight\", \"Room\", \"Bridge of Spies\", Brooklyn\", \"Specter\", \"Suffragate\", that \"Hunger Games\" flick and a few others. Anyhow I went to the 2:30PM showing of \"Spotlight\" because a) it received a 98% from critics and 96% from audiences on the Rotten Tomatoes\" 'Tomato-meter' ... and b) because I was raised in Catholic schools. Apparently many other seniors in our area had gotten the word that it was/is a good movie because about half of the seats in the theater were filled with seniors like myself. I attend maybe 5 movies a year at this theater during 'seniors' day', but this was the first time that the audience spontaneously clapped and cheered at the conclusion of the film. The movie is riveting. Like \"All the President's Men\", it tells the true story of a newspaper's investigative reporting of a major scandal. But unlike \"All the President's Men\", I did not know in advance the ending or \"the rest of the story\". [I also did not know that Ben Bradley was at the Boston Globe in 2001 supervising the development of this story as he had done at the Washington Post during the Watergate scandal that brought down Nixon.] \"Spotlight\" was the name of the little, 4 person investigative unit at the Boston Globe that broke the story of rampant, criminal sexual abuse of minors by Boston area priests ... and, more importantly, the criminal cover up of the abuse by the Catholic Church and Boston city government authorities. The casting, acting, direction, editing, etc. were all excellent. I didn't even notice the music, but that suggests it didn't get in the way of the intense story which is the center of the film. A few times I caught myself tensed up, and I had to remind myself to breath.For me the most shocking revelation came after the film concluded, and the screen was filled with a written narrative that explained what happened after the Boston Globe published it's revelations.I highly recommend it, especially for anyone raised as a Catholic.",

    "review": "  Spotlight tells the story of an investigative reporting team named Spotlight, that is a branch of the Boston Globe. Under new direction from editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), and superviser Ben Bradlee (John Slattery) the four members of Spotlight Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sasha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Caroll (Brian d'Arcy James) take off investigating reports of Catholic Priests molesting young boys.Things I Liked:The Cast. This movie has a stellar cast and they all give brilliant performances. In addition to the people who work at the Boston Globe, there are fantastic supporting performances from a number of other cast member including Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup as lawyers Mitch Garabedian and Eric MacLeish. And a number of great performances from people who even I don't recognize. If there hard to be a standout it's Mark Ruffalo but the entire cast in this movie really works.The Poignancy. The longer the movie goes on and the more you learn about the conspiracy the more startling it is when you realize that this is a true story. The other part of that is before the credits roll they show what other cities have been affected by the corruption in the church and it's startling to see the city you are currently living in on the list. The movie really hits home in those final moments and the entire thing speaks out about how even the most sacred of institutions can be corrupted.The Story. The investigation is impressive as the whole thing moves along. The movie has a tension and an excitement and you really find the entire thing interesting which is impressive for a movie that does nothing but show conversations between people. The movie is not one for people who need explosions, or stunts, but the movie has a phenomenal use of story to keep readers interested. It's a great thing to watch.Things I Didn't Like:No Comment. The movie is solid. I personally didn't have anything about it that really dragged it down. They say this is one of the heaviest hitters in the Oscar race and I can see why. It's a solid movie.Overall:Overall the movie is really well done. It tells an interesting story. The cast all deliver great performance. The movie really tells an important story that hits home even if you don't have any true personal connection to what has happened. It's a great movie that really works on every level and I am predicting this one is gonna be heavy contender come awards season. A fantastic piece of cinematic storytelling.",

    "review": "  Did you know the Catholic Church has been complicit in thousands of sexual abuse scandals? If somehow that's news to you, then the movie might be riveting, but I can't help but feel the drama is supposed to come from the revelation of information that's been common knowledge for over a decade. I feel like a dunce any time a movie seems to get unanimous rave reviews while I remain unaffected, but I'm just not sure how this was supposed to be interesting. Despite what almost everyone says, the acting is not electrifying; it is, like everything else in this movie, simply competent and functional. (Rachel McAdams's delivery seems particularly forced.) The standout, however, is Liev Schreiber, who paradoxically generates the most interest and charisma through a character who essentially has no personality.But where was the drama in this movie? The Spotlight team makes a lot of phone calls, conducts a lot of interviews, and looks over a lot of documents. That's the movie. There's no arc. As it unspools, you find that the sexual abuse scandal is massive and involves more and more people, but again, we already knew that. There isn't any story telling to speak of, just procedural what-have-you to reach a foregone conclusion.So if your idea of a taught thriller consists of characters talking to other characters whose identity and/or importance isn't really described; or if you like seeing people read documents, the contents and importance of which aren't fully explained; or if you're in the mood to see characters tackle a big problem that honestly doesn't really affect their welfare and puts very little at stake...then for you, this may be Best Picture 2016.",

A group of Boston Globe reporters, led by Michael Keaton, try to get to the bottom of the cover-up. What ensues is a provocative but admittedly fascinating look at how the molestation plague was endemic to the entire Catholic Church from the top-down. The film manages to address this sensitive subject matter without resorting to heavy-handed directing or confirmation bias, The film is a bit slanted against the Church but does so in a way that maintains journalistic integrity and sticks to the facts, not speculation. It is also interesting to see how a story is put together and how sometimes pervasive subject matter has to come to the fore to keep the masses informed. A smart look at the ethics of journalism and sure to turn heads come Oscar time ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A-",

I left off a star because I felt after the long build up and crescendo to the big moment of finally putting the story out - I was left wondering where the climax was - the ending seemed rather chopped off. They released the story, went into the office to discover calls ringing off the hook, and then the movie was over and the lights came up. Maybe a little more of the explosive reaction of the public and the way the news hit everyone (possibly the church's reaction too?), rather than just phones ringing? I felt like it was an ending more reliant on the audience supplying their own climax by recalling each in our own minds and emotions the way we remember the news exploding on the scene at the time, rather than actually depicting it. There was a lot more intensity, drama and emotion displayed in the reporters and others on their way to discovering and producing the expose than when they finally unleashed it.",

It reveals a shameful secret of the Catholic Church; not so much in the acts themselves (that are bad enough) but in the institutional cover-up by the hierarchy that good Catholics expect to guarantee the church's integrity. At the same time, it is a story of the tenacity of a major US Newspaper, the Boston Globe. In largely Catholic Boston, taking on the Catholic church is no mean task, but the paper does so. All of the performances are done with dedication and care--not with the over-acting that some of the actors have portrayed in other films. One of the truly good films of 2015.",

    "review": "  November 20, 2015One of the most brutally effective films I've seen is the 2006 documentary, \"Deliver Us From Evil,\" Amy Berg's haunting and infuriating examination of a Catholic priest who admitted, somewhat casually, to molesting and raping over 20 children. However, it wasn't simply a blatant condemnation of its primary subject, Father Oliver O'Grady; it sought to explore why so many Catholic priests resort to such behavior and the potential psychology behind their motivations. It also provided a history of the Catholic Church and its role in trying to conceal its priests' transgressions, all while informing us of the victims' struggle to find peace years after they were violated. \"Deliver Us From Evil\" was so striking I had to watch it in stages, which I suppose is a testament to its efficacy.Now comes \"Spotlight,\" the sort of Hollywood version of \"Deliver Us From Evil\" that chronicles the Boston Globe's efforts to uncover the Catholic Church's deliberate cover-up of incidences like Father O'Grady's, specifically those within the Boston Archdiocese. It's a completely different narrative compared to \"Deliver Us From Evil,\" but both films share the same intention: to bring to light a horrifying truth and scandal that was, sadly, systemic and went on for decades with far-reaching, traumatizing effects. One might say \"Spotlight\" makes some of the subject matter of \"Deliver Us From Evil\" more accessible to general audiences.But subject matter aside, and despite it being \"based on actual events,\" \"Spotlight\" is also, at its base, a thoughtful, intelligent and well-made drama. We wish it wasn't based on real events, but if any film is going to inform us about them, this is an entertaining way to do it, if \"entertaining\" should even be used in this context.The film centers on the investigative team known as \"Spotlight\" at the Boston Globe, which, in 2001 when the film takes place, only had four staff members: Robby Robinson (Michael Keaton), Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). They're all nervous because the Globe has just hired a new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), who's Jewish, not from Boston originally, and not really into baseball. These are three preemptive strikes against him because, after all, this is Boston, a prideful town ruled by Roman Catholics and die-hard Red Sox fans (although, to be fair, Baron is trying to get a feel for the city by reading \"The Curse of the Bambino\"). But it's not Baron's religion or hobbies that make the Spotlight team uneasy; they're worried he might inflict the same layoffs he did at his former paper in Miami.So Robby takes Baron seriously when he suggests Spotlight should follow up on an article written by one of their fellow columnists, about a Catholic priest who molested kids in several different parishes. However, Baron stresses that neither the priest nor his victims should be the story. Rather, it should focus on the fact the church knew about it but still didn't take any action to stop it, instead using its social, religious and financial leverage to cover it up, including hiring lawyers to settle with the victims outside of court in exchange for their silence; listing the accused priests as being on \"sick leave\" in the Catholic directories (this way, they wouldn't be found); and ensuring documents that prove the priests' wrongdoings, such as letters from the victims and their parents, are made unavailable to the public. Baron tells Robby the story is revealing this high-level, intricate \"system\" the Church has in place and that it's been in operation for decades, all without its parishioners, or the general public, privy to it.And so, over the course of the next year, amidst other major news events like 9/11, the Spotlight team works tirelessly to connect all the dots and threads behind this conspiracy, gaining a newfound perspective of just how much power and influence the Catholic Church wields, and not just in Boston, but all over the world.For the most part, \"Spotlight\" unravels like most investigative thrillers and its tactics aren't anything we haven't seen before, but this traditional approach by director Tom McCarthy works well because it allows us to pay close attention as events unfold and the characters speak key dialogue. His and Josh Singer's screenplay finds a good balance of plot and substance and we really come to empathize with the Spotlight team as they research and orchestrate their story. Just as they do, we grow frustrated by all the bureaucratic and logistical hurdles and we recognize the emotional and moral dilemmas the story poses, especially since the investigators are all Catholics themselves. There's also a fair amount of tension as pressure mounts on Spotlight to break the story first. These moments are followed by deep, personal reflections as each staff member considers his and her own devoutness and longstanding history with the church. The underlying question they all ask is, why hasn't anyone done anything about this? (Robby's transformation is particularly hard-hitting because he learns this story was brought to him years ago but he buried it in the metro section.)Because \"Deliver Us From Evil\" was so compelling and draining, I actually hold it in higher regard than \"Spotlight.\" Berg's film certainly wasn't pleasant viewing but it was, I feel, essential and I think watching it first will make \"Spotlight\" seem like a reward and an earned break from material that's already hard to accept. But even if I hadn't seen the documentary prior, I would still recognize the virtues of McCarthy's narrative. It gives us a real sense of what Spotlight had to do to reveal the truth. The direction is sharp, the storytelling is rhythmic and flows easily, and the performances all hit a genuine note. An added bonus is one need not watch \"Spotlight\" in stages, and although that might not make it as indelible as \"Deliver Us From Evil,\" it's still a film that will have viewers talking about it long after they leave the theater.",

(I assume all the journalists are already on it.) For one, it's just an excellent movie. But more importantly, it shows how great journalism is done. It's not flashy or glamorous; it's hard work. It's making phone calls and knocking on doors and tracking down information and poring over records. This isn't something aggregation news sites or bloggers are going to do. You're not going to get it from sources' tweets. It takes time and resources -- something fewer and fewer news media organizations are willing to invest in. And that's troubling for all of us because people and institutions who are allowed to operate in darkness (even those as venerated and trusted as the Catholic Church) are likely to abuse their power, sooner or later. Those abuses can cost anything from taxpayers' money to people's lives. We need good journalism to help keep officials, institutions and governments accountable. This movie helps show how that's done and why it's so important for us to support such journalism.",

The victims aren't exploited for audience-tears and their pain isn't put on display to shock you. But it's the handling of the Catholic church's role in the investigation/cover-up that Spotlight nails. Not at any time does the film damn the Vatican or Catholics for the actions of its clergy, but neither does it excuse the actions of the guilty parties.Make no mistake: This is not a thriller, nor is it docu-drama.

Keaton, McAdams, Ruffalo, that other dude, Stanley Tucci, John Slattery, even Live Schreiber, what an amazing cast. There's only like 2 showboaty Oscar bait scenes, which is pretty good. But goodness if the piano score wasn't consistently generic and unnecessary. Really sticks to the script and doesn't meander much. Refreshing to see something so un-visceral.",

    "review": "  One of the most riveting, devastating, and powerful films of 2015, and by far the best film about reporting and journalism since 'All the President's Men'. Spotlight is filmmaking and storytelling at its finest; a landmark film driven by the top-notch cast's exceptional performances, Tom McCarthy's spot-on script and flawless direction, and a fighting spirit that refuses to be swallowed up by darkness. Now both 'Room' and 'Steve Jobs' have a strong competitor for Best Picture.",

    "review": "  This is easily one of the best live action films of 2015. At the end of the year this movie will likely get a lot of Oscar attention, and it truly deserves it. Spotlight holds nothing back, features an ensemble of amazing performances, and tells a haunting true story. This story is recent enough that many people probably still remember, but old enough that many people will probably find it educational. Perhaps the film's greatest strength is it's story, which is incredibly dense with information. Not to spoil the film, but to give context the film is about a large scandal involving the Boston Catholic Priests in 2001. The story is so dense that it would have been easy to hold back information or gloss over plot elements, but somehow the filmmakers behind this film were able to fit it all into the film, in just over 2 hours. The film is unapologetically real, despite the occasional moments of theatricality, which all films have. The entire cast is magnificent in this film, lead by Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton. Both of which will probably receive Oscar nominations for back-to-back years. In a film that relies on a slow-burn approach, with a more emotional grip on the audience, the acting was paramount, and the entire cast delivered. It's most impressive, because they are able to every moment and make it feel important through their portrayals. These performances also help to make the characters feel more real, and relatable. The performances support one other major strength of the film, which is the haunting tone of the film. The film is scary in an very real way, as the film showcases that even in large hubs with millions of people, massive secrets can be hidden. At a time with drones, and widespread public mistrust it makes the film even scarier. It's the haunting story and tone that helps elevate the acting, to form a truly great film. In the end the film tells a relevant story that every american should know, without compromising its source material. Spotlight is a film so good that even the churches it condemned had to admit that it was great. The film will likely receive a lot of award recognition, and rightfully so, as it stands as one of the best movies of 2015. It's a haunting film that tells a story so compelling and unbelievable it becomes a must see film.",

    "review": "  An earnest, efficient, and always engrossing drama involving the investigation of the priest sex abuse scandal in the Catholic Church by the Boston Globe. (The investigative reporters won the Pulitzer Prize for their story.) Written by Thomas McCarthy and Josh Singer and directed by McCarthy, it's a superb presentation of journalism but inadequate as drama. As in \"All the President's Men,\" there is a lot of information amassed involving phone calls, interviews, conferences, and fact checking that draws us into the process, but in a way that sacrifices characterization and suspense. It lacks the emotional and moral complexity of the documentary \"Deliver Us From Evil,\" which dramatized the plight of the victims and their families affected by a predatory priest. By minimizing these personal stories, the overall emotional impact is muted. McCarthy's filmmaking is methodical and enervated, but he gets solid performances from an impressive cast. With Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, and Billy Crudup.",

Just like All The Presidents Men and The Paper, this movie is about journalists seeking the truth of something much bigger. The film is a straight-laced movie. There is nothing fancy about its directing or dialogue. It is almost watching a procedural episode. It feels like we are watching a real newspaper work in their normal environment. The cast is all-around amazing and picking just one performance that stood out would be unfair to the talent cast.

    "review": "  What do you know? It's a simple question that is asked nonchalantly in the beginning of the film, but a question that holds heavy over us as we begin to question who knows what. In 2001, the Boston Globe began a piece on the countless uncovered molestation cases within the local Catholic Archdiocese. Using the papers Spotlight investigative team, the Globe would go on to expose and reveal the immense corruption that riddled the churches, rocking the foundation of the entire Catholic community. Heading the Spotlight team is Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), who with fellow journalists Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy Robinson) begin unfolding the layers of sexual abuse that have gone ignored and unheeded for almost thirty years. Director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent) creates a meditative film with dark roots that builds up a steady pulse, knowing when to pace itself as to keep from exhausting its subject matter. The offices of the Boston Globe lay thick with a soft, pastel hue that harkens a commonality within the paper, prominently citing the latest Red Sox game with no real focus on journalistic content. It's a view that runs parallel to the Catholic Churches flippant behavior, tossing aside anything paramount that might disrupt the nature of things. Howard Shore (A History of Violence) works to emphasize the immediacy within each scene, as he creates what becomes background noise; it's a score that glides rather than soars, which is exactly what our focus needs. We witness what is only important to the story, to what's being investigated as we follow in front of our journalists; when they move the story we move. Unwrapping each layer of the investigation brings a different shade to the Spotlight team, with the sympathetic core stemming from Mark Ruffalo's Mike, who presses matters with an urgent and motivated hand that stands out amongst saltine performances from the rest of the Spotlight team. Ruffalo makes Mike his own, embodying a demeanor and emotion that helps shed light into the heart of the scandals while fidgeting and insisting his way around the city. There's a sense of flaccidness that permeates within the remaining Spotlight team, as findings are read and reports are exclaimed, though the only sense is urgency and necessity. The pace is urgent thanks in part to Tom McArdle (Station Agent), who never quite rests on a scene too long before cutting to the streets, then back to the office. It's an arrangement that spotlights the necessity of bringing this scandal to light, but along the way refuses to shine much focus on the grief, a choice that is both mindful of its perpetrators yet neglectful of its victims. Spotlight is a small film posturing as something bigger, highlighting a momentous period in journalism and the Catholic community that can't quite reach the pinnacle of cinematic storytelling, leaving us knowing a lot yet feeling little.",

Every other film I've seen this year has had at least one part that I didn't like, one scene where I wasn't convinced, one performance that bothered me. But Spotlight has none of these things. It is constantly engaging, smart but not so much that it makes the audience feel dumb. It has a perfect balance of emotion and procedure, shining a light on the Spotlight team itself as well as letting the audience feel for those affected by the molestation they are investigating. It is an ensemble piece, and boy does everyone shine - Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo both give Oscar-worthy performances, but every single person on screen rises to the occasion and gives noteworthy and admirable performances. Thomas McCarthy directs the hell out of the film, too. Every stylistic choice resonates, and he is amazing at finding the human in every character, from giving them personal ticks to representing their motives without directly stating them to a potentially overwhelmed audience. The editing is fantastic, the score understated but perfect in tone, the cinematography non intrusive but effective. Spotlight may not be the most emotionally resonating film of the year (though it does invoke a lot of great emotional response), but it is the most expertly made, directed, and presented film in years.",

    "review": "  Spotlight is the true-story behind the 2002 expose into the Catholic Church's cover-up of decades of sexual abuse and it is unflinching in its focus and animated by its outrage, which is the best and worst part of this awards-caliber movie. Writer/director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, Win Win) is a splendid curator of unlikely movie families, and with Spotlight he follows the titular investigative team (Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, Brian d'Arcy James) at the Boston Globe as they go about their jobs. That's really about it. Over the course of two tightly packed hours, we watch as the Spotlight team chases down leads, goes through archives, interview subjects and know hen to push harder and when to fall back, and day-by-day build their case to expose the massive corruption within the Church. It's invigorating material and worthy of the careful and sincere reverence that McCarthy and co-writer Josh Singer have afforded, though the flurry of names can be difficult to keep track of. However, that's about the extent of the movie. We don't really get to know any of the journalists on much of a personal level or as a character; they are defined by their tenacity and competence. We don't get much time for reflection or contemplation on the subject, especially its psychological impact on a majority Catholic city/staff, and the culpability of those within systems of power that chose to ignore rather than accept the monstrous truth. I don't need more \"movie moments\" or emotionally manipulative flashbacks, per se. With its nose to the grindstone, Spotlight is an affecting and absorbing news article given life but it feels less like a fully formed movie of its own. It's confidently directed, written, acted, and executed to perfection, and I feel like a cad even grumbling, but the ceiling for this movie could have been set higher had the filmmakers widened its focus.Nate's Grade: B+",

    "review": "  +\"Spotlight\" is a MUST SEE for many reasons first being that if you think you know everything, or just a lot, about the cover-up regarding the Catholic church and the pedophilia priests this film will show you that you don't. This is the best, if not better, newsroom movie since \"All The President's Men\" and shows investigative reporting as it is done and what it accomplishes. The cast is an evenly matched crew of actors in their prime and though all should get an Oscar for best ensemble, there is a scene with Mark Ruffalo that will make you hold your breath not wanting to miss a word.Ruffalo is one member of a team consisting of editor Michael Keaton who is the leader and Rachel McAdams along with Brian d'Arcy James who answer to managing editor John Slattery and they all have a new Jewish, single, editor-in-chief previously of New York and Miami Live Schreiber.This is not a pounding on the desk, \"STOP THE PRESSES\" but an even moving film of reporters doing research, asking inquisitive, invasive questions. There are quiet but very effective scenes like that between Schreiber and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law or the reporters interviewing survivors such as Neil Huff , or Richard O'Rourke, a priest who molested children but saw nothing wrong with it and in both cases no histrionics. Whether it is lawyers like Jamey Sheridan and Stanley Tucci or members of the church like Paul Guulfoyle or supporting players such as Billy Crudup and Michael Cyril Creighton among others all deliver the goods.Screenwriters Josh Singer and Tom McCarthy, the latter also directed, make a mystery and create suspense tale of a fairly well known Pulitzer Prize winning story that will get you deeply involved.\"Spotlight\" is definitely one of the best movies of the year!",

    "review": "  if you want to understand the process by which four investigative reporters - each with his/her own expertise - function as a team working for the \"Spotlight\" unit of The Boston Globe's newspaper in 2001, exposing what will become a Pulitzer Prize (2003) winning probe of the Catholic Church's furtive silence and the Boston Archdiocese's cover up of pedophile priests who molested guileless young boys and girls in their Massachusetts' parishes, see the movie SPOTLIGHT, a docudrama written and directed by Tom McCarthy. A film that is not histrionic in its presentation, but slowly and methodically builds a case which unearths the horrific breach of trust between \"believers\" and those who are anointed as their spiritual sentinels in the secular world. The aftermath of the newspaper's disclosures reverberated beyond its local sphere of examination into an international autopsy exhuming shame and dishonor upon the Church and its leaders.SPOTLIGHT opens with a feeling of tension; we sense the apprehension of a close-knit circle of reporters - the Spotlight investigative division of The Boston Globe - a small corps of journalists who focus on one important story oftentimes for over a year - when an \"outsider\", Marty Baron (a self-possessed, beautifully understated performance by Liev Schreiber) is recruited from The Miami Herald to become their new Editor. Baron realizes the potential of Spotlight to substantially examine an issue and shifts their target unto a story that over the years had been buried deep into the paper, occasionally surfacing to be interred again - eruptions of accusations appearing in print expeditiously extinguished. Marty Baron understands the need to look at the Institution itself - not just pinpointing individual perpetrators and victims, but examining the Catholic Church and its powerful influence on other authoritative organizations in predominantly Irish Catholic Boston, well aware that there will be attempts to stifle any exploration that cuts deeper into the skin of corruption.The meticulous and disciplined search for the \"truth\" of a story involves interviewing victims now in adulthood, who reveal lacerating facts on their loss of innocence at the hands of the very people they trusted most to protect them - a spiritual shock as well as a physical one. Sacha Pfeiffer (a non-glamourous Rachel McAdams who is turning into a wonderful actor) conducts many of the painful interviews excavating devastating memories - her empathy and concern are both convincing and authoritative. One weeps for the hidden secrets that are divulged and the overwhelming feeling of powerlessness that these young people must covertly endure. Michael Keaton, who stars as Walter \"Robby\" Robinson, communicates through expressive facial nuance, and the hunch of his shoulders, the conflicted burden and courage that being leader of the Globe's coverage exacts on his innate view of himself - an Irish Catholic member of the church; a man who rubbed shoulders with the Cardinal and other politically connected elite Church officials; a person who despite the distressing revelation that while he was Editor of the Metro Section years before - the glimmerings of this scandal were literally kicked underground into files gathering dust in the storage bins of the newspaper.Mark Ruffalo, another terrific actor is frenetic as Mike Rezendes - a Spotlight columnist who is in constant motion, a whirlwind of physical movement - ascetic in his dedication to spending long hours following leads, questioning defense attorneys, ferreting out important documents, petitioning court papers, and at the same time imbued with an equally impassioned integrity in lifting the lid on this pressure cooker of deceit. I responded to his innate decency and inexorable belief in the need for Spotlight to yield a scalpel of precision in cleansing the fetid decades old duplicity of the Church.The fourth participant of Spotlight is the numbers man, Matt Carroll, (Brian d'Arcy James,) an individual who makes sense of the mounds of accumulated data, once the stick has pierced the hornet's nest. Carroll intuitively makes necessary connections and has the tough \"unglamorous\" job of putting fact to \"fiction.\" SPOTLIGHT has an ensemble cast ie: Ben Bradlee Jr. (played by John Slattery of Mad Men fame), son of Ben Bradlee of The Washington Post Watergate scandal fame) supervises the Spotlight team; Stanley Tucci excellent as Mitchell Garabedian who is portrayed as a querulous, cantankerous attorney whose firm to date has represented more than 1000 victims and survivors of clergy abuse. In 2001 Garabedian played a pivotal part in The Boston Globe's explosive revelations. What sets SPOTLIGHT apart from other movies that dramatize political \"cover-ups\" is the directness and restrained tone of its presentation. There are no \"deep throats\", midnight trysts lurking in the background, but rather a deliberate, efficient system of operation which slowly yields results that withstand legal scrutiny - conclusions backed by strong research that will detonate Institutional complicity and dissimulation - echoing around the globe generating further investigations like a chain of illuminations in a tunnel of obfuscation, lighting up the shrouds of darkness.",

    "review": "  ***** Excellent You spotlight up my life, you give me hope, to carry on... Sorry to get all Debbie Booneish on you in my intro on my review of the spectacular movie \"Spotlight\". Director Tom McCarthy's movie about the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese is shaking up to the be the frontrunner of the Best Picture Oscar, and why not? McCarthy's meticulous direction of the film and his layering of its expose was a sermonial, I mean a ceremonial piece of mastery. The Boston Globe's investigative \"Spotlight\" department shined on unveiling this disturbing truth. What was not disturbing was the exemplary acting performances from the actors playing the \"spotlight\" write players; including Mark Ruffalo as the emotional Mike Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as the conflicted Sacha Pfeiffer, Brian D'arcy James as the cerebral Matt Carroll, and the \"Birdman\" himself Michael Keaton as the group's leader Robby Robinson. Keaton and Ruffalo were the standouts here, but all should be given the proper spotlight for their commendable acting. Other fine thespian turns came from Stanley Tucci as the counsel Mitchell Garadebian, Liev Schrieber as the paper's new editor Marty Baron, and John Slattery as the associate editor Ben Bradlee. It will be very sad if this acting group does not get the SAG Best Acting Ensemble Award. McCarthy's script with fellow screenplayer Josh Singer had all of the write stuff of a multi- dimensional narrative covering an uncomfortable subject matter. Sure, the film does depict journalists as literary superheroes, but their procedural process workings was their greatest weapon to get rid of the darkness of the subject they were investigating; and it isn't that what superheroes do? or something like that? Anyways, I pray that \"Spotlight' receives many Oscar nominations, as it should. So, it's now time for you to see and then share the \"Spotlight\".",

However, Spotlight is not just a movie with a great cast, it is a movie with a great story.Based on a true story, Spotlight is a team of four journalists, played by Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, and Brian d'Arcy James, who work for the Boston Globe newspaper that specialize in detailed investigations. Throughout the movie their job is to uncover a single story, the involvement of the Catholic Church in a huge sexual abuse scandal.However, even though the movie starts as an investigation, it becomes much more than that. Director Thomas McCarthy manages to turn Spotlight into a personal matter without forgetting about the importance of the movie. As the Spotlight team unravel more and dig deeper, they change their views and feelings, all while keeping the news story and research going, and that is what draws you in.With a superb cast, director, and screenplay, Spotlight does more than tell a story. It draws the viewer's attention to the issue, to the research, to the journalistic process and not to the people around it. There are no specific heroes, the article is what triumphs... because that is what journalism is about.",

    "review": "  The front-runner for Best Original Screenplay in just about every award show this year is Spotlight. the riveting, frighteningly accurate story about the cover-up and exposure of the pedophilia scandal that nearly destroyed the Catholic Church during the 2000's. As the statistic was at that time, nearly 6% off all catholic priests in the world were accused of sexual assault. Yes, it's far too painful to want to believe, but this is true. A noticeable amount Catholic priests were guilty of this, and many more may exist to this day. The truth is, these things happened, and the Church did next to nothing to stop it. It caused many people, like myself, to become lapsed Catholics, and some became not religious at all. Thus, Spotlight, a film about journalism, is a microcosm of journalism in itself. It's the truth that you don't want to hear, but you really should hear. Tom McCarthy brings the story to life with an unbeatable cast. The standout star is Mark Ruffalo, who in this, gives a raging monologue that has easily sealed him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The best scenes are, without a doubt, the interviews with the survivors. You'll be left stunned, that's all I have to say right now. Theres not a moment of drag in this picture. Spotlight hooks you in to the very last frame. It's screenplay is the heart of it all. It reaffirms you how intelligent a film can truly be. If this doesn't win any awards for Best Original Screenplay in the coming season, I'd be flabbergasted. Spotlight absolutely delivers as an engaging drama, a loud advocate of free speech and a relentless call for criminal justice everywhere.",

Spotlight is a pretty decent movie that covers one of the most horrific stories of the last 25 years. The film covers the investigation of the child abuse victims and perpetrators in Boston, though in fairness this was a worldwide phenomenon, not a local issue. The movie is 1/2 about investigative journalism and 1/2 about the disgusting abuses and cover ups from the church. How this could have happened and been swept under the rug for so long is a vulgarity.While this is a really good movie it's perhaps 20 minutes too long and it could have been a bit tighter.",

The quality of American films has been degrading in recent years. \"Spotlight\" is a vivid exception to that unfortunate trend. It is thoroughly engrossing, with numerous stellar performances, a total absence of conventional Hollywood melodrama, it is far and away the best movie of the year, and the best new movie I've seen in many years.",

The cops, played artfully by an ensemble cast that is stellar in every way - dogged, conflicted, on the right side of truth and faced with an adversary of humongous proportions robbing children of their spirit, and a town of its responsibility toward them. The reporters were blocked at every turn, and subtley interrupted in their quest for accountability and justice. I was there at the time the story was written, know some of the protagonists, and can attest to what they faced. The movie is brilliant in its unraveling, the tension is tight, the storyline unambiguous. For someone like me who spent so long in Boston, Catholic, and on the police department, I can attest to the clutch-hold that \"Lake Street\" (the Archdiocese) had over the legal, financial, and cultural aspects of the city. What these reporters faced by way of resistance, barriers, and subtle threats cannot be understated. The movie made me reminisce for the good old days of investigative journalism. That nothing was noted at the end of it about the numerous Pulitzers they received kept it pure, their motives altruistic. They not only uncovered hypocrisy and corruption in the church, but in the legal community, the law enforcement community, the legislature, and yes, even in the Globe itself. Everyone--parishoners and Catholics especially--was forced to take a good hard look at their part in the widespread abuse of innocents. Go see it. We can all use the reminders now and again.",

    "review": "  I like the moment when the journalists are on their very last nerve. The scene arrives toward the end of \"Spotlight,\" and it's a moving one, in an investigative film of nail-biting scope. These writers, Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), employees of The Boston Globe, have been tirelessly probing, for the past year or so, cases of sex abuse in the Catholic church by priests, a scandal which, as it turns out, does not just consist of a handful of instances but an abominable reach stretching continents.  The two, part of a larger staff of journalistic detectives known as the Spotlight Team, are close to making their breakthrough - they have uncovered thousands of cases spanning several decades - but a hitch, known to many as 9/11, interrupts the process. Audiences don't want to read about religiously guarded crime soon after a devastating terrorist attack. And so the story is put off for months, with worries that entail that maybe another newspaper will discover the foul play for themselves, that maybe the scandal will never be published, that maybe abuse will go on with no one aware of what's actually happening. This deeply disturbs Michael, not just on a professional level but also on a personal one. In frustration, the sequence finds him arriving at Sacha's doorstep on a cold, winter night, ready to talk to someone in a way not necessarily occupationally related. He is shaken, depressed even, by the fact that religion is never something that will not be tainted to him ever again. He always figured that, if times got rough, he would always be able to turn back to his Catholic upbringing for answers. Not anymore - things are too complicated, too repulsive.  It's moments like these that make \"Spotlight\" so personal; when headlines finally did come out, exclaiming what seemed to be the impossible, it turned the world upside-down. Here, we see a man so closely connected to the case that his blood may as well be on the pages. The fact that even he, a professional determined to allow an important story to see the light of day, left the investigation a changed person, a more cynical one, proves just what a valuable vocation journalism is, how much we underrate the people who put their own interests on the line day in and day out in hopes to stand for what's right.  \"Spotlight\" is one of the finest journalism films ever made, next to \"All the President's Men\" and \"Good Night, And Good Luck.\" Compelling in the most thunderous of ways, it is burdened by, and succeeds in consideration to, the difficult task of being entertaining, by the book, and humane. It has a story consuming enough to grab our attention for a century - but what takes it to electric heights is just how far it takes its human level tweaks, taking the time to establish its characters as real people, not untouchable everyday superheroes, and how it avoids sensationalism, making its frequent jaw-dropping pieces of evidence stop by not with the opera of a Hollywood plot twist but with a realistic damnation. McCarthy's direction and screenplay (co-written with Josh Singer), so highly attentive and so patient, makes us feel as though we're living through the case just as Spotlight did over a decade ago. It's movies like this that make me excited to go to the movies in the first - having an experience, not merely going through the throes of escapism, is a celluloid derived feeling unlike any other. In a film as subtle as \"Spotlight,\" it's easy to forget that the top-notch cast is performing: so painlessly natural are they that journalism seems like their calling in life, not acting. Michael Keaton, in his follow-up to the audacious \"Birdman,\" is excellent as an editor forced to tone investigative zest down for the sake of keeping ethics in check; Ruffalo, uniformly impressive, becomes Rezendes whole-heartedly, echoing his bear-like qualities with effortless determination. McAdams furthers her status as one of film's most dependable actresses; Liev Schreiber, perhaps the definition of understated here, is the film's backbone as the guiding light of the case. Come Oscar time, \"Spotlight,\" without a doubt, will be a contender for several major categories. Films as sharply drawn as this one are rare, and I can only be thankful that an \"All the President's Men\" of the digital age is able to stop by without causing us to remember that \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2\" is playing next door.",

    "review": "  Tackling subject matter like Spotlight does is very difficult to portray on film. You have to accurately tell the story enough to not create outcry while also not relying on the weight of the source material in order to induce emotion. It's difficult, but certainly not impossible and Spotlight did pretty much everything right. The acting from one of the best ensemble casts of the year is phenomenal. Everyone gave such a great performance that no one ended up stealing the spotlight, pun intended. The directing is top notch as Tom McCarthy perfectly weaves between scenes without any wasted screen time.Spotlight is based on the 'Spotlight investigative team at the Boston Globe and their uncovering of the Massachusetts Catholic sex abuse scandal. I think what I was most impressed with was that it by no means was a catholic hate fest, and it definitely could have been. In fact, several moments throughout the film it is shown that even the Spotlight team made many mistakes during the course of this piece. I really appreciated the way everyone was portrayed.The performances are all incredible. I'm sure the film will garner many awards come a few months, but it was the chemistry between the entire group that was most impressive. There isn't really a lead, the whole team should be honored. But if I had to pick, I think Mark Ruffalo deserves the most recognition, in large part due to the writing, but it's his subtly emotional sequences that are most effective.When you think of investigative journalism films, All the President's Men certainly comes to mind for most people, rightfully so. But I think Spotlight may this generation's version of that. There are plenty of moments in which it's obvious is inspired from that film, and they both do a great job at making a film without any action, very interesting. I'd be shocked if this doesn't get nominated for a ton of Oscars and possibly even win best picture. Spotlight is extraordinary.+Ruffalo+Ensemble cast+Tight script+Meticulous directing10/10",

    "review": "  The politics in this movie will probably earn it some Oscar nominations, because if there's anything we know about the Academy it's that it loves historically or politically significant movies (The Imitation Game, American Sniper, The Theory of Everything as nominations for Best Picture just from last year). This movie will be a shoe-in for the nomination, but more importantly it deserves the nomination.The issue depicted in the film may seem a little dated (the story takes place in 2001) but it is nonetheless an important issue to discuss. The movie is somewhat aware of this as there are constant references to the fact that The Boston Globe could have exposed this issue of priests molesting children years ago and it is a mystery why they did not.Most people would probably describe the film as being slow-paced, to which I would respond that the movie wouldn't accomplish anything more than if it was edited to have a faster pace. This film needs to fill the audience in on details, and the audience is aware of that. It allows the audience to get the full impact of what is at issue here if we follow the journalists' investigation step by step.Spotlight has an ensemble cast of A-list actors including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and John Slattery, who all deliver great performances. I predict that Ruffalo will be nominated as Best Supporting Actor for the second year in a row. There is a moment in the film when his character has to show determination and frustration simultaneously as his suggestion is denied by Keaton's character, and at this point in the story we are forced to side with Ruffalo and the scene is heartbreaking.While the cast as a whole is great, we only get tiny insights into other characters' motivations and perspectives, but these glimpses still illustrate who the characters are perfectly. For example, one of the team members realize there is a pedophile priest living just a block away from him, and his first thought is to protect the children of the area. He cannot warn the children, however, until the story is released, once again making us question the decisions made by the executives at The Boston Globe.My last comment is that this film is never visually interesting, but political dramas like this are not meant to be great works of art; rather, they are meant to create a cohesive story with well-developed characters to root for, and the film does exactly that and more. These types of film rely on realism, and while they are not necessarily documentaries, they need to inform us of real-world issues, and Spotlight never fails at doing so.3.5/4.0",

It's done in a rather thrilling way, evoking similar feelings to various political thrillers of the 70s. This works to the film's advantage as we the audience learn just how bad things get at the same time the characters do. It's really well done.There isn't really a true lead in this film. It's split pretty evenly between Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, and Michael Keaton as our main three reporters. All three do wonderful work, though it is Ruffalo who gets the film's biggest moment. Luckily, he nails it. If anyone is MVP of this film, it's Ruffalo.The film does a great job of hooking you in and never letting go, which is good considering the film has no weak points.

    "review": "  ALL THE RESIDENT'S BOYS - My Review of SPOTLIGHT (4 Stars)Investigative journalism seems like such a thing of the past in our current quick soundbite, click-bait culture, but SPOTLIGHT deftly and understatedly makes its case for slow, steady, methodical grunt work. Perhaps eclipsed by the events of September 11th, the film looks at how the Boston Globe's 4 person Spotlight Department worked their butts off to expose the sexual molestation cover-ups within the local Catholic church. In doing so, they ignited a worldwide scandal by clearly demonstrating an outright conspiracy to protect their priests while hushing the victims and their families. Director Tom McCarthy (THE STATION AGENT, THE VISITOR, WIN WIN) is having Sandra Bullock's 2009, the year she won the Oscar for THE BLIND SIDE and the Razzie for ALL ABOUT STEVE. For him, he has one of the year's best with his latest film and one of the worst with THE COBBLER, further proving that you CAN win them all! Along with co-writer Josh Singer, SPOTLIGHT feels deliberately artless and unfussy. It opts instead for a large ensemble style of storytelling, drab settings such as government buildings and blue collar homes, and a laid-back, 70s style of framing. Many films have tried to emulate ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, from ZODIAC to TRUTH, but SPOTLIGHT comes the closest to that understated masterpiece's aesthetic and passion. Having said that, I'm not sure it's a compliment to say there isn't one memorable shot in this entire film or that anyone gives a standout performance. Everyone does their job really well, ensuring that nobody pulls focus from the real story. John Slattery, Rach McAdams, Brian d'Arcy James, and Mark Ruffalo make a cohesive team as the main reporters, and John Slattery, Live Schreiber and Michael Keaton ably carry most of the exposition as their superiors. Only Ruffalo gets a loud, shouty scene, but it felt appropriate after the ridiculous amount of obstacles his character had to overcome just to gain access to a sealed file. I would have definitely had one of those \"Let me speak to your Supervisor!\" meltdowns too. For anyone who has ever rushed to get somewhere before they close and gets tripped up by slow drivers, pedestrians, or bureaucrats, these scenes will ring true.What this film truly excels at, however, is its steadily building sense of dread. Despite the fact that we all know where the story's going, seeing it through the eyes of these reporters has its own power. About midway through, there's a stunning, jaw-dropping scene between McAdams and a priest where all of the cards get laid on the table. Because the entire film is told from such a specific point of view, I felt her quiet, perfectly calibrated reaction. This is one of McAdams' finest bit of acting in her entire career...ok, maybe with the exception of her MEAN GIRLS \"I love your skirt!\" scene. Eschewing what could have easily been an endless series of maudlin confessionals, the film favors phone messages, evasions, scrawled notes, microfilm, and lots and lots of closed doors. Without hitting its audience over the head, we see children at play in the corners of frames, to subtly remind us of what's at stake. Sure, the journalists, while quirky or downright odd if you happen to be Live Schreiber here, come off as purely heroic, but it seems earned. Its quiet power may ultimately be unmemorable, but there's something beautiful and rare in seeing hardworking people professionally doing a good job.",

    "review": "  I had been seeing the previews for the movie \"Spotlight\" runningin theaters for a while. Based on the true story and with a terrificcast, I was extremely excited to see this film. It just had to begood.Of course I went opening day and I wasn't disappointed at all. ThoughI was very tired and my eyelids were closing, I kept staying awake becausethe entire film were riveting.Set in passionate Boston with their heavy Catholic population, theChurch is extremely cherished, honored and we learn too, protected.The internationally recognized Boston Globe newspaper paper has a legendary investigate reporting division called \"Spotlight\" (hence themovie's name). This film does a fantastic job highlighting professional,diligent, credible investigation and reporting they did (say compared to the recentfilm \"Truth\" where 60 Minutes rammed a major story together in justa few days vs. this story which took months).The rumors had been present in Boston for a longtime but essentially buried by all parties by either the fear or respectof the church. The Globe decided to look much deeper into the allegations of disgraced priest John Geoghan and the accusations his molesting over 80 boys.This crackajack investigative team including (Mark Rufalo, Rachel McAdams,Michael Keaton and Brian d'Arcy James) and their bosses John Slattery andLive Schreiber are remarkably focused and diligent in their gathering ofevidence, quotes etc.The Spotlight division began their focus in 2001 and zips along till 9/11hit (as that city has its own relation to that days tragic events). Aftera 6 week hiatus, the team hits the ground running again the story and thenumbers (villains and victims) just keeps growing substantially.Cast also includes Stanley Tucci, Len Cariou, Billy Crudup and JameySheridan and folks this is one \"tight\" piece of movie making based on a true story.There are a ton of good movies out on the big screen at the moment. \"Spotlight\" is the winner to see. Stay for the credits which sharesthe lists of cities domestically and internationally have documentedClergy abuse. It is a SHOCKINGLY LONG LIST.",

    "review": "  First-rate drama that works thanks to a pitch-perfect cast and keeping the story grounded in reality. The acting is superb, with Keaton continuing his career renaissance Walter Robinson, a man who is a part of the Catholic community but not blind to what is going on when the evidence is presented to him. He is matched well by Ruffalo, who gives a twitchy & excited performance Rezendes, a reporter who knows a big story & it's consequences. Behind the camera, Tom McCarthy keeps the story grounded, not showing fancy tricks but reporters doing leg work & real investigating. Plus, he shows the problem with the scandal was there no real bad guys (outside of the priests themselves) but a lot of normal people who either looked the other way or when they tried, hit a wall & gave up. Overall, one of the best dramas of 2015 and up there with \"All the President's Men\" in films about investigative journalism.",

That means lots of whispering and other noises; the nice old lady next to me hummed and actually sang along with a choir scene. Anyway none of that ruined the film for me. This is a terrific ensemble cast all going full blast; hardly a wrong note in the entire movie. No big action scenes at all and the suspense if subtle but you get the idea. The movie is about the Boston Globe's exposure of the Catholic Church coverup of child molestation. Not an easy film to watch, but still very important.

This is a great ensemble drama, where every one is doing their part, however, no one gives a showy Oscar performance in the film. For me, one breakout of the movie is Brian d'Archy James as one of the reporters. I could not take my eyes off him since he's a major unknown. However, it switches to Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton as they pick up the information. As for flaws, the major one is that (spoiler) the post-9/11 world is less shown. Also, the movie does not get going until the first half hour. Still, I left the film less dark and more understood about the damaging world of institutions.",

    "review": "  This is a pretty captivating movie that involves no explosions in terms of the performances or any stunts but is guided along with a very strong screenplay and a strong ensemble to play it out. Mark Ruffalo is great, Rachel McAdams is great and I hope people will see this and finally take her more seriously as many have just written her off in the past decade, other great performances include Brian D'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, Billy Crudup, Len Cariou, Jamey Sheridan, and Michael Keaton who does a good job here but I have 0 clue why he is being propped up as this year's Best Supporting Actor winner when he does nothing really to qualify him for even a nomination. The two particular stand outs from the supporting ensemble are Stanley Tucci and John Slattery and Sheridan and Crudup get really great scenes to shine as well. The movie is like a train. You start to get on board in the first 20 min or so and then once the main focus of the story in presented, you are in for the ride until the very end if not even further than the end. I actually kind of want a spinoff TV series with this cast because they were so great together as a team. There were even moments that I needed to use the bathroom but couldn't allow myself to do so because I didn't want to miss a bit of info. Thomas McCarthy has been an impressive director in the past years (I have no comment on his last movie The Cobbler that was panned since I haven't seen it yet but The Visitor and Win Win are really strong movies) and this brings a lot of his talents together in a well oiled machine. It has the simplicity that Win Win and The Visitor have but blending it in with the amazing script and the great ensemble, the machine works excellently in unison. I think my minor quibbles with the movie is that it does take some time to really get captivated with stuff that really didn't need to be explained to me for 20 or so minutes with minor character developments between these character's work relationships and how the whole office works together, I think it could have benefited by jumping right into the action. I also had issues with some of the framing of scenes that ended up with Mark Ruffalo only being scene from his nose down it just looked really awkward but that isn't something too bothersome of an overall strong movie. The movie is quite devastating as it develops more and more into a powerful final sequence showing how many places all over the world have been found guilty of the same things unraveled here, some closer to you than you think. Like I said earlier, this is one of those rare films that you kind of want to do some homework afterwords to discover for yourself if something like this ever happened with your archdiocese, I was a bit reserved on the amount of praise this movie was getting from critics and being lauded as an awards frontrunner because the movie is about journalist and critics (for the most part) are journalist so it is a bit bias but I believe them though I don't know if it will go all the way. This is a must see movie that will make you shake your heads and interject throughout.",

    "review": "  In January, 2002, journalists�at the�\"Boston Globe\"�published�a lengthy expos� of the long-term abuse of children by Catholic priests in the Boston Archdiocese. Though the Catholic Church had long denied that it had a problem with pedophiles, claiming that the occasional�molestation�cases were merely the results of actions by individual priests, the depth of the reporting in the�\"Globe\"'s series proved otherwise, and led to�a global�realization that the Church had long covered up a culture of sexual abuse of minors, spawning articles in publications far and wide. Dawning horror rightly followed, and we have seen, since then, a lessening of the prestige and�infallibility at the root of the Church's power. Less than a year after the first article ran in the�\"Globe,\" Boston's Cardinal Law - once seen as infallible, himself - resigned. True, he quickly found a home at the Vatican, but for him to step down in disgrace in a majority Catholic city speaks to the power of the press ... at that time, anyway (ah, 2001 was so long ago ...).And now we have a film about this epic piece of journalism, directed by master independent filmmaker Tom McCarthy (\"The Station Agent\"), who actually starred as�a reporter, himself (albeit an unscrupulous one), in Season 5 of HBO's \"The�Wire.\" With great patience and attention to detail, McCarthy chronicles the hard work done by the four-person investigative team known as \"Spotlight.\" The look and feel of the film�mirrors the day-to-day drudgery of the research these men (and one woman) needed to go through in order to dig up the necessary materials for the piece. The procedural nature of McCarthy's direction is almost pedestrian�- this is unsexy stuff, folks -�which would qualify as a negative if that aesthetic weren't so essential to this particular movie. From the way the journalists dress�to the no-nonsense camera work that refuses to draw attention to itself, this is quality filmmaking that places the facts and emotions of the story front and center. The only thing I didn't like was Howard Shore's score, which was mostly distracting and not at all needed; these scenes require no soundtrack.The ensemble cast is excellent. Michael Keaton (\"Birdman\"), Mark Ruffalo (\"Infinitely Polar Bear\"), Rachel McAdams (\"Southpaw\") and�Brian d'Arcy James (\"Smash\") all star as the members of the Spotlight team, while John Slattery (\"Mad Men\") and�Liev Schreiber (\"Ray Donovan\") are the editors. Schreiber is Marty Baron, the first Jewish editor of the�\"Globe,\" a fact stated a few times in the film and used to imply (by his detractors) that, of course, this man would have it in for the Church (it's Baron's idea to pursue the topic in the first place). Boston, like most big cities, merely masquerades as a cosmopolitan place; at its heart, it's as insular as any small town, and as protective of its own. Stanley Tucci (\"Julie and Julia\") shows up as a lawyer representing the victims, and, as an ethnic Armenian, drives this point home again: only an outsider would be able to take such a hard look at the facts.\"Spotlight\" is a movie that not only tells us the important story of how one driven group of people took down a major institution, but also makes the case for why journalism matters in a democracy. As we have seen since 2001, our major newspapers have suffered major decreases in subscriptions and have yet to find a truly new way forward - in terms of earning revenue�-�in the digital age of the internet and social media. Clickbait is the word of our day, and while the Church's abuse scandal is just as lurid as any headline you might see in your Facebook \"trending\" feed, the reason why the�\"Globe\"'s�reporters were able to make such a difference is because they had the full support of�their superiors, who at that time could afford to�pay the salaries of four people dedicated, over many months, to uncovering the truth about one topic. As we move forward, it's worth considering the price we pay, as a society, for the free content we access every day online. Truth is worth paying for.",

    "review": "  Faith, religion is at times is the most powerful thing a person has, faith at times can regulate a persons whole life,some peoples whole life is just about god, and these people look up to certain god men, them being priests, popes etc but at many instances we see these men take advantage of there power and place, and do things that are unmentionable. Spotlight highlights these unmentionable acts that many churches were hiding to keep there dignity intact. I am not questioning any religion, but what these priests did in 2001 (and before and after that time) was absolutely sickening. Spotlight is based on a true of how priests across America but specifically the Boston area, tracing back to the the 1960s sexually assaulted children from the ages of 5-13. These Roman Catholic/Christian priests of Boston/America were supposed to spread the word of peace and goodness of the lord, but they took advantage of there power and did something unforgivable. Spotlight is one of those rare films that completely shocks you, makes you think, and leaves very uncomfortable. Spotlight is realistic cinema at its best, this is one of those most superior films I have seen this year, its a film that makes the viewers feel uncomfortable, mad, and in it will move you to tears. I don't have enough adjectives to explain Spotlights brilliance, it 2015's best film till now, and I have no doubt about this. The film has no flaw, the ensemble is brilliant, the films well researched, etc everything is superb. But its film you wish that was never made, because you wish these incidents in the film never occurred. But how long can the truth be hidden for. The film is very disturbing so watch with caution but it completely thought provoking.Story wise Under the direction of new editor Marty Baron , the Boston Globe's elite investigative team, Spotlight, is tasked with delving into decades worth of child abuse claims against the Catholic Church. Lead by Walter \"Robby\" Robinson the journalists begin to uncover a massive network of sexual abuse and willful ignorance perpetrated by the Church within the city of Boston. Facing political opposition and resistance from the far-reaching influence of the Church, the reporters undertake an explosive expos� on the corrupt system. This year we have seen many great ensemble casts, but Spotlight has the best ensemble cast by far. Michael Keaton is simply amazing, he gets totally into character, and never acts a false note. His pre climax scene when his old buddy from college tells him to drop the case, and Keaton says Ill quote on what you said, is one of 2015's best sequences. Its a slap in the face. Mark Ruffalo, is a man on a mission in the film, and he steals the show in the film. His relentless act will get him an Oscar nominee for sure.Rachel McAdams gets one of her most acting orientated roles, and she is superb.Lev Schreiber character is a silent one, but when he speaks, he is the most powerful person on screen.Brian d'Arcy James underplays his role superbly.There a couple of things that I will take back from Spotlight, that will continue to disturb me for awhile, its rare that a film affects me so such that it haunts my thoughts for so long. I just can't understand how so many churches that spread across the world, would let priests sexually assault children, for centuries, CENTURIES!!! It's absolutely sickening, how Church Leader's tried to hid these sins, by using there power influence, money, and by using the name of the lord. And then these used churches to make money off, by helping them get off cases. Did any of these people have a soul.Thoughts like these keep wandering in my mind. The film leaves you with a eerie feeling that you just can't let go of for awhile. Nevertheless Spotlight is complete brilliance. The films story and screenplay are superb. The film is not glamorized at all, the film is very gritty and real. Its a film based on real, and true facts. Its realistic cinema at its best. The films location, settings, etc are top notch, and nothing feels out of place for 2001. The film has no blemishes at all. The film is a investigative thriller, and it works in all accounts. You are at the edge of your set the whole time, and by the end of the film you are rotund for the Spotlight team. The films highlight is in its superb performances for its ensemble, and being so superbly informative, and so accurate in every aspect of how law works, how the investigation took place.Overall Spotlight will sweep the Oscars this year because there is no film that stands a chance next to this classic. Its a film which I could call one of my favourites, but I don't know if I want to watch it again, because the stories of those innocent children still haunt me.5/5* or 10/10",

Luckily, this is a story worth telling, with a smart script and terrific performances all around. \"Spotlight\" revolves around the true story back in 2001, when a newspaper investigated the story of multiple priests that had been accused or assumed child molesters. This film keeps you engaged the entire time, but the main gripe I think many moviegoers will face, is that it has a slow pace and seems to go on a little too long to hold everyone's interest. What helps the pace is that the story always stays interesting and I was always enthralled with the story. Whether it was a brutally honest and tragic scene or some comedic relief, this film had it all. From a story and acting standpoint, this is a stellar film all around. The pacing is really what bogs this film down. In the end, \"Spotlight\" is a terrifically made film that I definitely recommend for people who are intrigued by this story. I do not think it will gain an audience outside of that crowd. \"Spotlight\" is a great watch.",

    "review": "  At its heart the quintessential ensemble film, McCarthy is very much focused on the investigative journalistic process circa Y2K, which shapes the very plot-driven film. The screenplay thus leaves very little in the way of character development, keeping the action rather continuous and sweeping. There is at times moments for actual contemplation about the whole weight of the issue at hand (Ruffalo, Keaton and Tucci), but these scenes are more \"breathing spots\" that segue-way to the next path of investigation. Watching the film, one can only wonder how a story (and subject matter) would have been handled just 10 years later in a more digital-based industry (more or less swiftly?). Ultimately, McCarthy wants the viewer to understand that bricks-and-mortar journalism will always have a place in matter regardless of era or issue at hand.",

It also humanizes the focal journalists enough to see how a story that big - the now infamous child abuse scandals in the Catholic church - affects each one of them in different, jarring, personal ways. With that grounded approach for our protagonists and the narrative momentum inherent with needing to pull the curtains back on this awful phenomena, the movie was engaging and mostly stirring throughout.

I don't want to get into too many details, but if you get a chance go watch this. Excellent performances all around, although being very much an ensemble piece it's hard to single out a single member of the core 4 (Keaton, Ruffalo, Adams, D'Arcy) as being the lead. It does a good job of simply portraying the reporters not as heroes, but simply doing their job, and even levels some critiques at them for not spotting the information earlier. Were I to fault this, it's that it's very much an \"Oscar\" movie, but I must stress that is not in and of itself a bad thing. This takes it's story, and tells it extremely well.",

An exceptional film, that will be viewed as this generation's \"All the President's Men.\" It may be the Best Picture Oscar winner for 2015, along with Best Director for Tom McCarthy and Supporting Actor for Michael Keaton. Mark Ruffalo will also be recognized, although with top billing, he may be in the lead category, despite the ensemble nature of the cast work.\"Spotlight\" is superbly written, acted and directed with dozens of actors making strong impressions, even in one-scene roles. It's about a \"big\" issue - the Catholic Church cover up of priests molesting children in Boston. Eventually the scandal rocked the Vatican's reputation worldwide. However, the sordid nature of the topic is dealt with in a dignified & serious manner, so the film is never salacious or exploitative, where in lesser hands, it could have been.The film is also an ode to investigative journalism, a rapidly vanishing profession of going for the deeper systemic story, not just the glossy superficial veneer of today's standard coverage. The four-journalist Spotlight team begins casually on the story only to become obsessed with finding justice as the corruption widens into thousands of victims molested by dozens of priests. Set in 2001-02, the period details are right, although this is not a film that will win Costume or Production Design awards, because it is more interested in the content than the look it's recreating.Because of the subject matter and the serious depiction, this is not a blockbuster film as many Marvel or Disney films are this year. It is a film that will be respected by all who see it, but not adored because this is a topic that makes everyone uncomfortable. But if you like great writing, acting & directing, it is definitely an experience you will find rewarding.",

It views more like a cartoon take-down of the evil Catholic Church (insert cheers here). And the acting is solid wood: The big shot at high emotion is the \"It's Time!\" (to destroy Cardinal Law) speech by Ruffalo's character, and, as Oscar Wilde might have put it, you'd have to have a heart of stone not to laugh at the overwrought dramatics. And some niggling questions remain: Has there ever been an infantile priest like the one in this movie who confesses his crime to Rachel McAdam - on the doorstep in mere seconds! Is Rachel's character guilty of elder abuse when she shows her dear old grannie, a three-times-a-week church-goer, the shocking news about the scandal in her church? That little silent scene must be the most ludicrous polemical overkill in the history of movies. And why is Michael Keaton's character surprised that so many people call in claiming clerical abuse after the big story breaks? Isn't he supposed to be a hard-nosed journo?Oh, Oscar, Oscar!

The reportage this film is based on won the Pulitzer Prize. \"Spotlight\" is a landmark movie that highlights the fighting spirit of journalism and is one hell of a knockout motion picture.This is the best kind of procedural drama, where the director and company tie all the strands of a complex story together without losing the audience for a moment. With six strong supporting actors and not one of them playing lead, this is also the purest and most exciting performance ensemble that you'll find at the multiplex. Facts and clues and victims unfold at a growing pace as you listen in on interviews with corrupt lawyers, pedophiles, and long-suffering victims until It reaches all the way to the Vatican. Spotlight plays like a detective thriller but also succeeds at resonating on a deep emotional level. It's exciting and exquisitely written and directed, but the heart and soul of the film lies in the real-life survivors and the reporters who all put their lives on hold in a desperate attempt to tell the whole truth. Spotlight ranks as one of the year's finest. Highly recommended.",

It has a high-concept story based on real events-reporters exposing the powerful Catholic Church in the most embarrassing way imaginable-and a great ensemble cast. A new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) at the Boston Globe asks the Spotlight team of reporters played by Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams to check out pedophile priests. At first they resist: the paper has covered it before and a former victim with boxes of documentation they dismiss as a nut. Prodded by Baron to stick with the story, they eventually uncover the shocking truth that six per cent of Catholic priests are pedophiles and that the Church simply moves them from parish to parish. Church and civic leaders try to make the story go away. But these same award-winning reporters are hardly blameless: they failed to blow the whistle years earlier.",

    "review": "  The movie (and actors) do a great job of telling the story of Boston, and the influence and awesome power the Catholic church once had in the city.It then shows how the cold and cowardly Catholic church used the \"power of God\" to protect and hide and move known pedophile priests tried, in 100% of cases, and they knew exactly what they were doing. This was organized crime, by the most gutless gangsters.One thing they don't mention is that this is enabled by something Catholics invented called \"confession\", in which a priest can confess his child rape to another and get completely forgiven in 15 minutes (in brutal defiance of Jesus in Matt 18:6, by the way). However, now the new priest that heard the confession knows he can get away with it. This caused pedophilia to run rampant through Boston and the Catholic church, where there were at least 249 known pedophile priests, and over 1,000 victims. However, there were probably at least 1,000 priests that heard these \"confessions\" each time any of the 249 raped a child, so the institution knew, and still does and hides it today.It is chilling to hear the interview with Fr Pacquin, who readily admits to the Globe that he molested a bunch of children, as if it was no big deal because all the other priests were doing it, too.The movie shows how hard it was to get the truth out of the Catholic church, which intentionally protected these pedophiles, moving them to new locations where their evil wouldn't be known, never warning the new community, and sometimes not even warning their own Catholic leaders.This pedophile protection came from the top, from Cardinal Law, (and undoubtedly the pope) and was passed throughout the hierarchy, which worked like the Nazis, just doing what they were told, despite Jesus in Matt 18:6-14.You can feel the awesome power of the Catholic church, which they use at every opportunity to get away with evil, and never to help children. The characters in the movie are sickened by the truth, and the intention of the organization to protect every child rapist, with no regard for the victims.This is an organized crime movie, without the honor of the mafia.",

    "review": "  Spotlight is a movie that is about information, yes it's also about the infamous scandal within the Catholic Church as well as the brave news team (and paper) that decided to against one of the oldest, most powerful organizations in history, but it's also about information. To clarify, Spotlight feels like a film that feels based around facts and knowledge and discovering them, Aaron Sorkin did this sort of thing with The Social Network, discovering new technology or a new world that most people didn't really understand and bringing us into it. Spotlight is similar, but it takes it in a different direction. Instead it takes us into a world that we have all come to know too well, when the evils that the church was covering up were revealed it became everything from the spark of protests to the butt of jokes. Spotlight is taking us back to when it was discovered but also shows us the magnitude of this scandal, the hidden horrors behind every good cause that can be gigantic. Yet it's not just about discovering information and simply about condemnation, but it's also a story about the importance of discovering information. The film mainly follows the Spotlight team, sparing little expense for their personal lives, how could it when there's so much information that needs to be calculated and compiled into the script which plays out everything we need to know and that we find interesting. It follows along the lines of introducing us to fact after fact that the Spotlight team discovers through many different fascinating methods. The screenplay which is one of the best of this year takes a story of such density and such complexity and brings it to life before our eyes, and it does so in such capable hands. The director clearly had this in mind, McCarthy goes for a straightforward style with his approach within the film, it's pace, stillness, and necessity is what guides his film. It's the kind of story that doesn't exactly requires a straightforward kind of presentation, it tries to tell it as it is through it's visuals rather than tell it's story through them. In most films this would be understand as sloppy, poorly done filmmaking but not so here. Looking at the staging, the choice of camera position, and the urge to (as Sasha puts it in the film) to tell the story right. Guided by a stellar cast with few weak points and Keaton who is making his comeback last more than just an under-appreciated performance but now has thrust himself into a role that's the definition of great acting, he doesn't act but allows himself to be absorbed into the film, he's a human being who is almost indistinguishable from Keaton himself. He heads the acting ensemble despite his lack of leading role and is supported by his fellow cast mates. Putting all of this together we get Spotlight, a deftly written, impeccably crafted showcase of modern filmmaking that is easily one of the year's best.",

Dealing with some rather harrowing subject matter, Spotlight refrains from being off-putting by having the riveting nature of a good piece of journalism. Tom McCarthy directs the film with a 70s-esque sense (certain to give it even more comparisons to All the President's Men), and commands great performance from his troupe of thespians. It's too much of a stereotypical \"awards picture\" for me to call it masterful, but it is a fully necessary film that calls for action against the atrocities of the Church.",

    "review": "  Spotlight does justice to an incredible true story through its faith towards and deep understanding of the real events. It's eye opening to witness the discovery of this massive scandal with the catholic church, showing just how important investigative journalism is. The film has quite the ensemble cast with some really good performances. Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo really capture the essence of their characters (I'd know because we saw them at an interview after the screening) and closely embody many details including speech and physical mannerisms. Liev Schreiber and Stanley Tucci were also standouts with their characters. Rachel McAdams was good, too, but she's not doing anything we haven't seen her do before. There isn't quite a main character in the film, and we don't go very deep into any particular character. This is mostly forgivable because what the characters are tackling is much bigger than they are. Even though we don't feel the story much through any particular character, we feel it effectively as a whole. That isn't to say that the performances lack depth, however. Several of the actors do a great job of conveying a passion for justice in their work, particularly Keaton and Ruffalo, who are the clear and equal standouts in the film. Thomas MacCarthy is great at making the audience feel like they're really experiencing this investigation as it unfolds. It's hard to find wasted screen time as the story is constantly moving. The screenplay, which is apparently incredibly accurate, is concise and full of intelligent and witty dialogue that propels each minute of this thriller paced drama. Watching the film, we are put right in the center of several major discoveries like just how big of a problem child molestation is in the Catholic Church and how the church has gotten an entire country to sweep the scandal under the rug. It shows how such a large situation can go unnoticed by the word, despite its massive size, and this is a shocking discovery that we make as the Spotlight crew does. The film is a perfect homage to investigative journalism, honoring the heroes of the Spotlight team and the victims who come forward to help justice surface. Spotlight shows that the time to act is the time when you're told to keep your mouth shut. It would be hard to imagine a film depicting the many layers of how this story was uncovered and celebrating those who sought out the truth better than Spotlight does. The broad approach certainly pays off in a satisfying way, but I can't help but feel that the film may have been even more moving if it took a more intimate approach. It's a slight loss that we don't really connect with any characters, especially when it's clear that the film could have done so without diminishing the overall impact. Still, Spotlight gets so much right that it's hard to complain. This is a really incredible story and it's great to feel that MacCarthy and his crew know it.",

    "review": "  I had the opportunity to catch a sneak screening of this film a week prior to its release and want to draw some attention to it and its undeniable quality as it will likely, ironically enough, fail to ever find the spotlight butting head-to-head with Spectre being released the same weekend. There will always (arguably) be another James Bond movie or over-the-top action film similar to it, but Spotlight is a rare film this year that would be a shame to miss and deserves every bit of attention it will likely receive come award season.Spotlight is a film imbued with an intrinsic sense of subtlety and deference. It doesn't dwell on Hollywood-isms or trick the audience with convenient plot twists and escapist subplots and drama. Spotlight is, at its core, bare-knuckled, by-the-books, calculated, and precisely executed. It only reaches as far as the scope of the story that inspired the film demands. As a minor consequence, it can come off as dry and somber at times, but this film has so many other things going for it that it never really seems to drag.If Spotlight had been told in any other way with any other cast, it likely would have either parted from a truthful, realistic depiction of the actual events or came across as the largest bore of 2015. To be fair, however, the story itself is compelling in its own right and is likely to relate to any audience member bold enough to sit through a film of this type. It was actually a very dense film with little intrigue beyond the cast and premise, but it was told in such a convincing way that to give it anything other than my full attention would have felt disrespectful. It really felt like it was just a few great acting performances away from actually turning into a documentary, and likely would have been just as effective as such.So let's get into what really matters in a film of this style and caliber: the performances. As one would expect given the rave reviews of the film already and the names attached to this title, the performances are spectacular all around. Michael Keaton has toned down from his over-dramatic, schizophrenic Birdman role to a far more calm, self-serious, motivated character in Spotlight. Keaton's character, however, is never really given a chance to shine and pales in comparison to the character played by Mark Ruffalo who, in my opinion, stole the show. He plays his typical investigation-related role that he's played at least ten times now, although his performance reminded me most clearly of not his, but Jake Gyllenhaal's character in Zodiac. Instead of calm and suave as per usual, he now plays the overly passionate, sociopathic type that doesn't seem to get a wink of rest from the start to the end of the film in so desperately trying to uncover the mystery beneath it all. Rachel McAdams is great, too. And it only feels right for her to be in this, immediately following her role in the second season of True Detective which was likewise plagued by the complication of dealing with too many indistinguishable names and characters.I should sidetrack briefly and admit to one flaw I felt fell upon the movie a bit for me and that was the complication of dealing with so many different leads, victims, alleged criminals and so on and so forth. It would be criminal not to include all of these names as they all served as individual cogs used to propel the narrative along. I just almost wish they weren't introduced at such a rapid pace, or at least that each name was given equal weight. I nodded my head at the times where characters would recall details of the person being described to help me remember him or her, but other times so many names of people never physically shown on camera would be thrown in the mix simply for the purpose of reference that I began to find myself a little lost. Perhaps that's just me. I just felt at times characters didn't elaborate upon perceptibly crucial details as well as some procedural films similar to it.Nevertheless, each character portrayed felt human, emotionally charged and vibrant, relatable, and important. Spotlight did such a good job portraying each character and just enough detail of their back stories evenly that it's almost hard to say who the main character of the film really even was. An argument could be made somewhere between Ruffalo, Keaton, and McAdams, but even between the three of them each character is covered to a pretty even degree. I loved that about this movie because it helped everything seem level. No one character was heralded or glamorized above another and each member of the Boston Globe editorial team portrayed contributed to the development of the narrative in their own unique ways, as it would have been in reality.This film is tonally consistent, fair and respectful of its subject matter, emotionally driven, well-acted, thought-provoking, deftly-paced, and even appears to have an exceptional sense of direction both in terms of narrative and style. Director Tom McCarthy handled the true story perfectly in a way that never came off as expository or shameful, but rather enlightening and powerful. All around Spotlight is a well-made, tightly-crafted, and tense drama revolving around a topic that threatens to shake society's faith of the religious institution, as it did for me. They don't make many movies quite like this anymore. With the attention span of much of the modern audience there isn't much room for attention to be drawn to this type of film anymore outside of Oscar buzz, and the box office numbers prove it time and again. So do Hollywood some justice and see BOTH Spectre AND Spotlight on November 6th when they're released in the US.",

    "review": "  Exemplifying the pillars of journalistic integrity, Spotlight provides one of the most intense situations in recent domestic American history, the Catholic church, and multiple lawyers, being questioned in their defense of sanctioned pedophilia and its victims. From the opening shot, the fluidity between actors is well displayed, the spotlight team (comprised of Keaton, Ruffalo, McAdams, and James), working in tandem with one another, the script and performance of each actor giving an eerily natural flow from one scene to the next. Schreiber and Slattery don't have as much screen time as the aforementioned, but their unique characters give enough oomph to the plot line. With a muted piano & bass-heavy score, only the sounds of the streets of Boston as well as the office of The Boston Globe to accompany the sound profile, the film in itself is an edge-of-the-seat dramatic piece. The reason I believe it's one of the best films I've seen in a very long time is resonant in the fact that it characterizes the sheer tenacity of integrous/virtuous journalists, rooting through the murky legislation and human will that surrounds this scandal.
