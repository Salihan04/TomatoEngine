    "review": "  Extraordinarily faithful to the tone and style of the originals, The Force Awakens brings back the Old Trilogy's heart, humor, mystery, and fun. Since it is only the first piece in a new three-part journey it can't help but feel incomplete. But everything that's already there, from the stunning visuals, to the thrilling action sequences, to the charismatic new characters, has reawakened and solidified my love for the series. This film deserves a Best Picture nomination.",

    "review": "  Rey, a young smuggler, is thrust into a battle between the First Order and the resistance when she teams up with a storm trooper who suffered a crisis of conscience.The new entry into the Star Wars universe is profoundly derivative, essentially an updated retelling of A New Hope, and while ignoring the backstory about the First Order largely mutes the events of Return of the Jedi, the new characters are interesting enough that J.J. Abrams has successfully made me excited about the new installments, rather than cringing, as I did after The Phantom Menace. It's a fun, popcorn film, returning to its roots, and this isn't all bad, even if it fails to advance the scope of the original films.I especially like Daisy Ridley as Rey. Ridley gives Star Wars a feminist character, one whose hand should never be held and whose life isn't dependent on others, but the film doesn't allow Ridley to explore enough of the character because it withholds so much information in the name of suspense.Also, Star Wars as a series is based on the struggle between good and evil. In the original trilogy, we accepted the empire as evil and the rebellion as good - the bad guys had red light sabers and the good guys had green or blue light sabers. In the second trilogy, George Lucas bungled a political plot, which by necessity forced the film to explore intricacies of good and evil and descent into evil. Obviously that failed. In order to deal with the rise of the First Order, we needed a political plot, but yet the film disavowed itself of this responsibility, and as a result, the film's antagonists are hollow and the series doesn't hold together as a narrative whole. Star Wars has to get better at politics, not just for the sake of Episode VIII but for the continuity of the series as a whole.Overall, I liked this newest film if only because it manages to return the franchise to the rails; now if only Episode VIII can get the train moving again.",

    "review": "  JJ Abrams is very good and knowing what his audience wants and giving just that to them. He is not great, however, because he rarely shows us something we didn't know we wanted. This film derives a lot from the first Star Wars, and just goes along as you might expect, yet it is still very enjoyable because it's Star Wars. The old faces were cool to see, and the new ones do very well. As a standalone film there's nothing great about the plot, directing or dialogue, but the hype, nostalgia and sentiment made this a great movie going experience.",

    "review": "  Well, I always thought A New Hope was the best Star Wars movie... Episode 7 has kept the style of the original movie, its soundtrack, not just the score - the entire sound scape, but it should have left it at that. What we have feels like a fan remake of the original; re-hashing every plot element, every character, every scene, even ripping off several lines of the dialogue directly. I was half-expecting Rey to do the Obi-Wan sound diversion trick at one point. Alas, the new plot seems like it's in far too much of a rush at times, and thus each re-hashed scene fails to deliver the impact of the original whilst also feeling unoriginal. The characters' journey's don't touch you as much, and there's no strong emotional scenes such as when Luke stood watching the two suns rising over his home world in the first movie. Still, it has a strong female role and it was fun to see the old Star Wars well and truly return to continue the story; hopefully the next movie will do something original and do it well!",

    "review": "  \"The Force Awakens\" is a good and enjoyable film with all the excitement of the original, but without the poor script writing. Unfortunately, \"The Force Awakens\" overuses references to the original film -- meaning that nearly every plot twist is telegraphed almost from the first 20 minutes of the film for anyone who has seen the original. Liked the Death Star in the original? We got it -- but different! Liked the cantina scene in the original? We got it -- but different! Liked Darth Vader in the original? We got it -- but different! Liked the Jawas scavenging droids? We got 'em -- but different! Same goes for the \"I am your father\" moment, the Luke Skywalker character innately strong with \"the Force\", the entire plan for attacking the new Death Star, R2-D2, \"emperor\" communicating only via hologram, and smuggling messages in droids to keep them from the \"First Order\" (it's the \"Empire\" -- but different). Heck, nearly the entire original cast and the Millennium Falcon itself make appearances! It's hard to argue that \"The Force Awakens\" isn't largely a remake of the original, but somehow, it's still effective. It's certainly a galaxy far, far ahead of the previous lame trilogy. Seeing \"The Force Awakens\" is worth your while, just don't expect any surprises.",

    "review": "  May 19,1999 is a day that lives in infamy legions of Star Wars fans. The day hoped died. I remember trying to convince myself that The Phantom Menace was good but a second viewing confirmed my earlier fears. These movies were not going to be the same as the original trilogy, and George Lucas confirmed that with each successive release. I've had debates with teenagers who swear that the prequels are better films. They aren't. This isn't a matter of opinion; this is fact. After Revenge of the Sith was released in 2005, you could sense that Lucas was burned out and had no desire to further awaken the ire of the fandom. Then in 2012 he surprised everyone by selling the Star Wars empire, along with other properties like Indiana Jones, to Disney for four billion dollars. Immediately Disney let it be known that they wanted to get new Star Wars movies into production ASAP. They tapped J.J. Abrams to spearhead the first steps in a new direction. No other movie has felt the weight of hype and expectation like Episode VII: The Force Awakens. Fans don't want to be hurt once more by someone they loved. For millions of fans that grew up on the original trilogy, The Force Awakens will be the Star Wars movie they have long been waiting for. It erases the bad feelings of the prequels and recalibrates the franchise. However, it is also flawed and seems too indebted to nostalgia. It's certainly good but I cannot put away my nagging reservations (far, far less than what I felt with the prequels).Thirty years after the events of Return of the Jedi, the First Order has risen in place of the evil Empire. The First Order is lead by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and aspiring sith lord Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). They're searching for the droid BB-8 and its own, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). The droid has a map that leads to the whereabouts of the last known Jedi - Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil). A Stormtrooper who adopts the name of Finn (John Boyega) runs away from his mission and joins forces with Rey (Daisy Ridley), a scavenger waiting for her family to return to her world. The duo finds BB-8 and seeks to return the droid to the Resistance. They run into Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and a few other familiar faces on their journey to the Resistance base and to escape the reach of the First Order. Abrams has captured the essential magic of what made the original trilogy so enjoyable and timeless. The prequels carried the burden of setting up characters we had come to love, and so as we watched younger versions of them or characters integral to their development, it was hard to ignore just how little we cared. It didn't feel like Lucas himself cared that much, more content to direct his green screens than his actors. The special effects had improved but for much of the three prequels it felt like watching disinterested actors recite poorly written lines while they run around fake environments with no semblance of reality. The details that Lucas emphasized were ones that were unnecessary, like treaties and trade tariffs and the notorious midichlorians, which made the force into a blood disorder. The prequels harmed the legacy of the franchise. It takes only seconds for you to feel like you're in better hands when you read the opening text crawl. No trade disputes. No galactic senate. It sets up its central chase and the important players in three brief paragraphs. And then we're off and the movie rarely lets up.We pass the torch to a new generation of characters and it's here that Force Awakens is able to leave the large shadow of the original trilogy. The characters are great. Finn gives the viewer an entry point into a world we've never explored onscreen in any real depth, the life of a Stormtrooper, the cannon fodder of the series. He has moral crises and goes AWOL from the duties he has been raised to do. He doesn't want to be a mindless killing-machine and forges his own destiny. Watching him embrace a sense of individuality is entertaining. He's charming and excitable but also fearful of what may catch up to him. Then there's the hero's journey with Rey, a plucky heroine who comes of age over the course of the movie's 135 minutes. Ridley has the presence and poise reminiscent of Keira Knightley, and the screen just adores her. It also helps win her character is easy to root for. Boyega (Attack the Block) and Ridley are terrific and even better paired together. They have a great chemistry and much of the humor is born from the characters rather than lame visual gags like in the prequels. It's fun to hear characters verbally spar with actual good dialogue. Driver was the first actor hired and it's easy to see why. If you've been watching the man on HBO's Girls, you'll know that he has a magnetic presence that separates him from the herd. He plays a villain that so badly wants to follow in Vader's footsteps but the thing that holds him back is the \"temptation of the light.\" In one moment, a badass and imposing villain with super force powers had now also become an interesting character wrestling with his influences. Isaac (Ex Machina) is suave and cocksure as an ace pilot. His affection for the other characters is touching, particularly the robot BB-8. This little guy is going to be the toy that every child on Earth demands for the holidays. BB-8 is adorable from its first moment on screen and made me forget about R2D2. The big worry with Force Awakens was that its new characters would be compelling on their own. After one movie I'm looking forward to more adventures with the new kids on the block. Abrams has restored the sense of fun and awe that resonated from the original trilogy and the biggest compliment is that Episode VII feels like a Star Wars movie (more on which below). The action sequences are quick and filled with great visuals and shot arrangements. For those worried about Abrams' penchant for lens flairs in the Stark Trek reboots, they are completely absent in Force Awakens (Fun fact: for Star Trek Into Darkness, computer effects had to go in and take out lens flairs because Abrams later admitted he had gone a bit overboard). There are some beautifully orchestrated shots and sequences all around here. The first 40-minutes is the best part of the movie, before the older stars come back for their due. The rest of the film is enjoyable, no doubt, but I was more pleased with the original material. The technical expertise has never been higher. Like Mad Max: Fury Road, there's a joy with watching characters interact with a real world of practical effects. Watching the characters run around real environments and real sets rather than immense green screens just makes it feel more real and vital. I enjoyed how worn and weathered the technology in this world comes across. The special effects are judiciously utilized and are excellent as anticipated. It's easy to sense the reverence that Abrams and others have for the series as well as their determination to not repeat the mistakes of the prequels. The first mission for Episode VII is to reset the course, to wash away the bad taste of the prequels that haunt many. Abrams has gone back to what works with these movies and recreated the playbook. It's a movie that will satisfy the hardcore fans and reawaken their love for the series. And yet it almost feels like Force Awakens is a swing too far in the other direction, an overcorrection to the prequels that turns a reboot into a loving homage that approaches facsimile. I was amazed at just how closely Episode VII follows the plot beats of A New Hope (mild spoilers to follow - for real, if you don't want to be spoiled in the slightest, and I'm no monster and won't dare include anything that would substantially deter your viewing, skip to the spoiler safe area). Here goes: once again we start with an escape from an evil starfleet ship, only to land on a desert planet. The hunt is for a droid with valuable information. Our dispirit band of characters collect on the desert planet and flee, only to be eventually pulled back to the evil base of operations, which once again is a giant floating orb that specializes in planet destruction and this orb seems to have the same pesky design flaw that plagued Death Star 1.0 and 2.0. How does this one design flaw still exist? Are there not backups and redundancies? It would be like Titanic 3.0 going down by hitting another iceberg. There are more parallels involving the characters and personal revelations that mirror Episode IV but I won't go into detail on those (end of spoilers). Suffice to say, it felt like I was watching a cover act remind me how much I enjoyed the first Star Wars release. Perhaps Abrams felt his rabid audience needed to go backwards before going forward, pay homage to what had been built by practically reliving its plot in a galaxy not so long ago as it once was (it still is likely the same distance: far far away). It's a movie that cannot escape the nostalgia of its predecessors, and so it indulges it instead. In deferring to fan demands, Force Awakens has moments that waver into the dangerous territory of fan service. This will harm its overall staying power once the glow wears off from audiences overcome with fan relief. Thankfully, the new main characters are compelling and I'll be happy to follow their continuing adventures with Episodes VIII and IX and who knows. Abrams and company have set up the next generation of fan favorites that have the chance to grow out of the sizeable shadow of the original cast. However, not all elements are given that same nurturing care. The Force Awakens is so briskly paced that it rarely has time to establish the new history of its universe. We get character relationships and reunions but I couldn't help but feel that the larger plot they inhabited felt rushed. The First Order seems rather vague and their rise to power needed at least some explanation. Instead we're dropped right into a timeline with an Empire knockoff. It's just easy fascism placeholder. Why are the Republic and the Resistance two separate entities? The villains with the exception of Kylo Ren are pretty one-note and also callbacks to the bad guy types from Episode IV. Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) is in the movie for a lousy three minutes. I'm also not a fan of either of the two motion-capture performances from Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave) and mo-cap pioneer Andy Serkis (Rise of the Planet of the Apes). I hated Nyong'o's character and her performance. The character design for both of those creatures is rather weak and weirdly unimaginative. There's also a habit of characters being naturals at things that would ordinarily require expertise. The worlds we visit and the creatures we encounter are all a bit too similar to earlier sources and distinctly unmemorable. We don't learn much via our locations and geography and so it feels a tad interchangeable and meaningless, which is a shame. The Force Awakens is a mostly exciting return to the rich world of Star Wars with characters we care about, old and new, lively action that feels substantial and real, and a sense of fun that isn't at the expense of your full brainpower. Abrams had two missions: 1) eliminate the disappointment over the prequels, and 2) set up new characters and stories for future installments. Both have been accomplished. Abrams may have been the perfect candidate to restart the Star Wars series as he has a history of making films as loving homage to his cinematic influences. Super 8 was Abrams' homage to Spielberg and Episode VII is very much homage to Episode IV. The well-trod story allows for the series to reset comfortably while setting up its new characters to take a greater storytelling burden from here on out. I hope future installments give us more development to make the worlds and the history matter just as much as Rey, Finn, Kylo, Poe, and BB-8. This may be an unpopular opinion but I feel that Abrams' rollicking 2009 Star Trek reboot is a better Star Wars movie than The Force Awakens. Abrams and company has proven you can make a new and good Star Wars movie. Now my own new hope is that writer/director Rian Johnson will be able to steer the franchise into a fresher direction with Episode VIII. In the meantime, fans can sleep well once again.Nate's Grade: B+",

This feels like the original trilogy, which is both good because it feels like it belongs and bad because they literally rehashed most of the plot points from the original trilogy. That would be my biggest complaint. It was exciting to reunite with the original cast and also see how they will transition to new characters. I am excited about the prospects of where they are going to take this story now that the setup is out of the way. It wasn't perfect, but it was a nice start to a new trilogy.

    "review": "  \"Star Wars\" is back! Walking out of the theatre, there really is not much else to say until you give it quite a bit of time to sink in. As a starting point for these new characters entering this universe, I really do not believe (give the story at hand) that it could have been handled any better than it was. Beginning right off the bat with fresh faces and hilarious comedy, we were given a glimpse at what is to come in this new trilogy. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" follows Rey, as she uncovers a droid owned by Poe Dameron, an X-Wing pilot whom he forms a bond will ally Finn. These three catalysts of this new trilogy are all incredible characters and I cannot wait to see where their adventures lead. Kylo Ren is amazing as the new focus, even though there is much more to the dark side this time around. With more character depth than I was expecting, this film soars on multiple levels. If I had to complain about one aspect, it would be that when familiar elements come into play, calling out moments from the past or nearly copying them, it felt a little risky; However, they make everything work and I bought into everything. Once you can get past that this film is just a starting point and of course there will be similarities, then you will have an experience at the movies unlike anything in years. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" is Hollywood at it's absolute best and J.J. Abrams has definitely brought us back into a Galaxy Far, Far Away, in more ways we could have ever asked for. I can praise the hell out of this film all day, because that is just what this film is. A crowd pleaser all around, it welcomes newcomers with it's fresh characters, and it will blow minds of the die hard fans. It really is everything fans have been asking for. There are so many spoilers to be said by talking about the plot, so I will simply say this... This film does not disappoint. In the end, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" is amazing entertainment, and even though things may feel familiar at times, there is no denying the sheer greatness that this film truly is. Amazing comeback! Big screen filmmaking at it's finest!",

    "review": "  Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is the continuation of the saga started by George Lucas almost forty years ago. Since then the franchise has grown beyond its beginning to crave itself out a huge place in popular culture not only in the United states, but across the globe. There have been dark times for this franchise when it has lost its way (Episodes I, II, and III), but it has continued to thrive with three generations. The Force Awakens signals the start of not only a new trilogy, but new creative forces and new ownership of the Star Wars universe. The film follows a trio of new characters Poe Dameron, Finn, and Rey (Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, and Daisy Ridley) each coming from a different background, yet they all find themselves on the same quest. Along the way they encounter heroes from the previous films such as Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) as they come in conflict with The First Order, a resurgence of the ideals of the Galactic Empire. Led by the Force wielding Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) they continue terrorizing the galaxy in that classic Imperial way. There are many winks and nods throughout the film that doesn't seem like blatant fan service except at a few points in the film. The Force Awakens is the film that we had hoped the prequels would be. The audience genuinely cares about the new characters as opposed to Episodes I, II, and III. People in this film are not as wooden as they were in those films and there are many contribution factors that could affect that fact. Poor acting, poor writing, performing in front of nothing but a green screen probably all contributed to that fact. This film harkens back to nonstop action and adventure that doesn't turn down at all during its 2 hour and 15 minute running time. The story is a great continuation of Star Wars lore that develops patterns in the story, just like human history. We all keep making the same mistakes over and over again. The question is did we learn from them? That will be seen as this trilogy plays out.",

    "review": "  Sorry to say, I found the movie to be a bit lacking. Still a good movie, but in my opinion it was barely better than Jedi (thanks to the stupid Ewoks) and not as good as Sith (fight scenes were the tie breaker for Sith). That puts it #4 on my list of all Star Wars Movies.There are a lot of small issues such as how adept new users can be with, well everything. However of these minor issues, the biggest issue was with the light saber. Apparently training isn't necessary. With that said, instead of listing the remainder of my minor issues item by item, I'm just going to touch on my two biggest irreconcilable issues. First and biggest of my issues is that in their attempt to go back to the \"winning formula,\" they \"borrowed\" too much from previous movies. There's good familiarity that makes you feel warm and fuzzy. Then there's been there done that, got the t-shirt familiarity that makes your commitment to the franchise feel insulted. If you've seen all the movies, you know what I'm talking about.**SPOILER ALERT**Second major issue was how easy a storm trooper could just break away from the First Order during his very first battle after being taken as a child, brainwashed, and reprogrammed. Some would argue that scene somehow humanizes the Stormtroopers. OK let's go with that. So you are asking the audience to then believe that this human character, who drank the kool-aid his whole life, but had an epiphany after seeing one of his brothers in arms killed, then had no problem killing so many of them moving forward? #nofriendsgrowingup. Beyond that, the rebels just welcomed him in without question or suspicion? #nospiesinspace.Sorry JJ Abrams, I am disappointed. It's sad that I could be disappointed in a good movie. But you had a great franchise, and a great track record, so yeah, a good movie is a disappointment. You did such a masterful job with the revisioning of the Star Trek franchise that maybe I was expecting too much. I will submit that I'm as much of a Star Wars fan as I am a Star Trek fan so there is no bias here. My litmus test is simply that if I'm not ready to leave the theater and immediately get back in line for a movie from the biggest franchise in history, you have failed sir.",

Kylo Ren, although perceived as deadly, turns out to be a character with great depth and surprising explanation to his actions. The dynamic between Po and Finn is electric, providing a familiar taste like Han and Lando in the prequels. Rey's story is unfinished and thrilling, a rags to riches story actually worth watching. I would definitely recommend.",

    "review": "  \"Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\" is about Rey (Daisy Ridley), a poor hard-working young woman on planet Jakku, who is doing what she can just to get her next meal. Her life changes when she encounters a droid, a secret Storm Trooper, and a broken-down hunk of metal that is the Millennium Falcon.Rey lives on a dangerous planet, and in a dangerous universe, a universe where the new dominant power is not a force for good but a force for evil. It is called the First Order, and it is the spiritual and political successor to the Galactic Empire. It is headed up by a mysterious figure named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who is the primary agent of an even more mysterious figure who calls himself Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis).The droid she encounters has within it a secret message for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the Rebel alliance's \"only hope\" to save the galaxy. Rey makes it her mission to get this secret message to Skywalker, who has been missing since the rise of the First Order.This film is almost as great as \"Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), and yet still crucially depends on that film and the original trilogy for its understanding. Nevertheless, a newcomer to the franchise will no doubt enjoy this film, which hopefully is the inauguration of a whole new beautiful trilogy.",

    "review": "  \"Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens review The Good, The Bad, & (in some cases) The Greedy\" IntroductionIt's here! Finally! Star Wars: Episode VII. 32 years after the release of Return of The Jedi, and 10 and a half years after the release of Revenge of The Sith. It's next to impossible to be excited for this release, or go to the theater without having any sort of expectation. For the last year, I've ignored all rumors surrounding The Force Awakens. I only pay attention to trailers, posters, and TV spots which have all been promising. JJ Abrams takes over the director's chair, promising classic return and old school style approach to making Episode VII. Also including some original cast members, writers, and crew members. Less use of heavy CGI, and more focus on using practical effects, costumes, makeup, models, and real sets. Before even being released, The Force Awakens was already a breath of fresh air to the Star Wars series, which has unfortunately fallen victim to its prequel trilogy amongst most fans and audiences. However, The Force Awakens comes with a lot of nit picking, but the fact that you have to nit pick the film says it's a really good film. Really good!The Force Awakens StorylineThe Force Awakens takes place 29 years after the fall of Galactic Empire. The film opens with a new evil force in place of the fallen Empire, called The First Order. Led under the guidance of the evil Kylo Ren, a fallen Jedi apprentice who desires to be Darth Vader. The First Order and Kylo Ren are under the leadership of a new mystery Supreme Leader by the name of Snoke, who wants the Jedi destroyed for good. In light of everything Luke Skywalker, the last of the Jedi, has gone into hiding, leaving Kylo Ren in desperate search for the map pieces that lead to Skywalker's location and ultimate demise. Also searching for Skywalker is the Resistance. A Republic military group deep in the fight against The First Order, and led by General Leia Organa. The missing map piece is in the care of a droid, BB-8, on the desert planet of Jakku. He's rescued by Rey, a scavenger girl who was abandoned on Jakku over 20 years ago. She remains hopeful that her family will return for her one day. Rey and BB-8 cross paths with Finn, a young ex-Stormtrooper who abandoned The First Order and their cause. Finn agrees to help Rey return BB-8 to The Resistance, and to make sure the map to Skywalker doesn't fall in the hands of Kylo Ren. However, in the shadows of the galaxy The First Order have completed their new ice planet star base called Starkiller. A planet like Death Star with the capability to drain the power of near by stars. Thus using that energy to destroy multiple planets with one single strike. Along Rey and Finn's journey they receive help from Poe Dameron, the best fighter pilot in the Resistance, as well as Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, and many other new and old familiar faces. On their journey to not only finding Skywalker but also stopping The First Order, Throughout the course of Rey's journey to delivering BB-8 safely to the Resistant she discovers a hidden power in her. The Force. Rey is strong with the Force, but this power and her family past remains a mystery best saved for Episode VIII. The Force Awakens, as said by a very old familiar voice in the film (Obi-Wan), is Rey's first steps with letting the Force in. The Pros The Force Awakens comes at you bursting with Star Wars excitement and thrills. JJ Abrams stood his ground strong from day one of Disney and LucasFilm hiring him to take on the great challenge of being the film's director. Disney originally slated Force Awakens for a May 2015 release, giving Abrams only a year and a half to complete a script, cast new actors, find locations, build sets, shoot, post-production effects, editing, scoring. Abrams demanded an extra year from Disney to avoid a rush production and to ensure a spectacular new chapter. Disney gave him 7 extra months, which was the absolute right decision. Can you image what Episode VII would've looked like if it had been released back in May? A mess! In the wake of Return of The Jedi's conclusion, we lose some major players of Star Wars, mainly Darth Vader, Darth Sidious (The Emperor), and Yoda. The Force Awakens does welcome back old familiar names and faces, Han, Luke, Leia, Chewie, Threepio, R2, even Admiral Ackbar! The real joy of Episode VII is in the enjoyment of the new additions. Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo Ren, Snoke BB-8. The new characters of The Force Awakens are a key element to the start of this new Star Wars trilogy, which was missing in Episodes I-III. Not to say I did not like Ewan McGregor or Liam Neeson or Natalie Portman. Unknown to most audiences who are too quick to highlight these A-list actors with their acting in the prequels with, \"They were so wooden. Lacked depth. Their scenes were too one dimension\". Yeah, these poor actors were A) Not allowed to see the script until the day of the shootB) Were only allowed to access to the scene they would be shooting, not the complete scriptC) Were only allowed 3 takes for each scene. D) People seem to forget. Star Wars is a space opera. AKA, a soap opera set in space with loads of action! Soap operas are cheesy, campy, and filled with terrible acting. These limitations in the production of the prequels were to avoid crazy fans leaking out details about the films. However, The Force Awakens has more mystery and sets up for more future surprises the previous 6 films combined! I'm sure the actors of The Force Awakens had some restrictions with access and details to the plans of the new trilogy, but their performances are good. Really good! In fact, it's the best performances Star Wars has ever had! Believable, genuine, character depth, and yet there is still a touch of the old school space opera acting we grew up watching. However, despite all the security measures taken in production, I expect Abrams to allow his actors more scene takes and more script time. Every performance looks, sounds, and feels like time and thought was carefully executed. One of the biggest surprises in The Force Awakens comes from the character side of BB-8. Yes, a droid, which has also been a major marketing symbol for the film. It's hard to even think of replacing C-3PO and R2-D2, let alone have one single smaller droid stand in for them. BB-8 is not only a great addition to the Star Wars saga, but he is a wonderful character who alone can re-create the same charm C3-PO and R2-D2 displayed in the deserts of Tatoonie in A New Hope. The promise return of practical model effects, make-up, alien costumes, and real sets rather than just all out green screen with CGI left and right in The Force Awakens was the absolute right decision and best way to get fans back on board with continuing the Star Wars saga. Abrams admits to being a long-time fan of Star Wars, and his execution to story, characters, and details proves his childhood love. The Cons Which Should Never Have BeenThe Force Awakens is bursting with excitement, thrills, and great fun. It's a worthy new installment into the Star Wars film franchise. Was I completely satisfied with the film? No. The problem lies in the bar level The Force Awakens has long been aiming for. The target is to be on the same level of greatness as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. The prequels never had this in mind which made them easy for me to come out of the theater saying, \"That was great, I loved it so much!\" The Force Awakens has had it sights on being a return to a similar level of greatness, which has made A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back timeless, unlike the prequel and even Return of The Jedi. However, whenever a film aims to be great, you find yourself noticing every little detail and nit picking. This is not nit picking such as, \"Why did they make Snoke CGI, he should've been more realistic looking\" If your critique of the film is picking at something like this, then your not standing back and looking at the whole picture here. I have little nit picks, but also some that may end up being greater than just a little nit pick.1. Slightly disappointing editing which drops the Star Wars scope 2. So many unanswered questions & the Disney problem3. Leave the damn mask on!4. The musical score lacking the Star Wars magicEditing Leaves Out Star Wars ScopeMany will argue that The Force Awakens has a thin plot, yes but so does A New Hope. Or that The Force Awakens also has a lot of unanswered questions, true but so did A New Hope. Do you think anyone in 1977 knew what the hell the Clone Wars were? Most of the answers to The Force Awakens will come in Episode VIII and IX. My biggest dissatisfaction comes from the film's editing and the scope of the film, something that should've never been a problem. JJ Abrams and his team have come through on their word of using practical effects and going back to the elements which made Star Wars so classic, but why was The Force Awakens not fully edited to the scope of Star Wars? I'll be the first to admit this, but I preferred so many of the shots in the trailers to the ones used in the theatrical cut. Trailer 1 - the beautiful shot of the 3 X-Wings flying across the water. Trailer 2 - the wide shot of the Tie Fighter tied up in the Star Destroyer hanger while flying around and blasting Stormtroopers, one trooper even gets tossed into the air. Key shots like these completely sold me on the studio's promise to film Force Awakens in the same scope as the original trilogy. They looked and felt like classic Star Wars and old school Lucas filmmaking of the 70s and 80s. The decision to go with lesser impressive angles and shots was not only a distraction, but also slightly upsetting. I am not saying I did not find any joy or magic in these scenes, I still found myself smiling from the visual thrills. However, I would be lying if I said that I was satisfied with the scope, editing, and pace of each flight action sequence. There are too many action sequences in which shots jump too quickly without giving the audience time to process the grand imaginary. The already fast pace dogfight battles were too rushed. The shots of the Falcon being chased by Tie Fighters on Jakku were paced perfectly in the trailers. TRAILER 1, the first time we got to the see the Millennium Falcon dodges out across the sky then dips down to avoid a pair of in-coming Tie Fighters. The exact same sequence was in the final cut, but the frame rate was sped up greatly in the film making it difficult to even know what was going on. TRAILER 2, the shot of the Falcon flying inside the engines of the crashed Executor Star Destroyer was trimmed down a few frames making it a quick flash of the Falcon followed with immediate explosions, rather than cut to a single shot looking down the long engine shaft with the rear of the Falcon flying out while laser blasts from the pursuing Tie Fighter hit parts of the old ship creating head-on explosions. Why??? The editing of the dogfighting scenes was not edited with the scope of original Star Wars trilogy in mind. The trailers clearly showed us months, even a year ago, these spectacular widescreen scope shots done for the film, only to be thrown onto the cutting room floor for less impression replacement shots. In the final film, early scenes on Jakku had the scope I'm referring to. However, the dogfighting action scenes suffered tremendously from using more quick cuts, sped up frames, and shots which would rather put us as close as humanly possible rather than sit back and watch in awe all the visual splendor happening all across the screen in one grand sensational shot. This is not a small nit pick, this one is crucial, because it makes the film feel less like Star Wars. The same can be said about seeing the film in 3D. The 3D for The Force Awakens is good, but having the 3D makes the film feel less like Star Wars and more like Iron Man. Plus, add in the editing changes of speeding up frames and making cuts quicker than they originally were make watching The Force Awakens trickier to watch in 3D. You can't easily sit in the movie theater and process what it is your seeing in the film's action scenes.  Another technical flaw in the film, which was explained to me before my second viewing of the film comes in the director of photography (DP)/cinematography department. For the scenes inside the space station Starkiller, the film's DP crafted and used a special lens filter to help make give the space station a similar gritty, steel, and hazy gray look to the space station environment. However, because of DP's self-satisfaction with the final result of those scenes, he applied the same filter to the scenes with The Resistance. The result had many of these scenes looking out of focus and fuzzy. The biggest stand out involved Leia being completely out of focus when she approaches Han to talk about his involvement in the assault on Starkiller. Unprofessional. Completely unprofessional. The DP used filters designed for a completely different location involving the film's villains, and decided to use for something completely opposite in the film. Was there no testing prior to shooting dates to see if this would work? Rather than assuming everything be great looking in the end? I have to be upset with this, because the cinematography's job is highly critical. Why do you think Scotland looked so stunning in Skyfall? Why do you think Hoth looked so cold and desolated in Empire Strikes Back? For the amount of money a DP would make on Episode VII, and trust me it's an insane amount, this was not a professional grade A job. So Many Unanswered QuestionsThe Force Awakens does have a lot of unanswered questions. As it should have, but there comes a point when around every corner of the film is yet another unanswered question.How and why was The First Order able to achieve and pick up were the Empire left off? (This question kills me) Can the giant Starkiller planet actually move? After it drains up the power of all nearby stars can it travel to a new location? It's a planet, how can it travel? If it can't move, how is it able to re-locate to other stars once it drains up all the nearby stars? How was The First Order established? When did The First Order rise into power?Why are they supported in the galaxy when they directly stand on the same practices as the Old Galactic Empire?Who started The Resistance? Is the Republic without an army or is The Resistance their army? The Rebel Alliance was started by a band of militia style fighters and those committed to the Old Republic, easily explained in A New Hope, not so well in The Force Awakens. Why did Han leave Leia and the Resistance? I assume it was because of Kylo Ren? For Han to abandoned everything when the conflict involves him seems very unlike Han Solo. The film made it seem like there was another reason for him leaving. How did Supreme Leader Snoke come into power? Who is he really?How was Kylo Ren able to be seduced to the Dark Side by Snoke while being trained by Luke Skywalker. Did Kylo and his Knights of Ren kill other Jedi Knights?Darth Vader was the evil Sith Lord who redeemed himself by saving the Jedi and destroying the Sith Emperor, so why does Kylo Ren want to follow in the footsteps of Vader so bad?Is Captain Phasma important? Why was she only in the film for about 5 minutes? Maz is an old friend of Han Solo, but how and from when? One line of dialogue would've solved this.How was Maz able to retrieve Anakin and Luke's lightsaber, which fell from Cloud City? I loved that Maz acknowledged that the answer to the saber's discovery will be saved for later. Is Rey related to Obi-Wan or is she a Skywalker?Say what you want about the prequels, but the prequels properly set up the birth of the Empire. The Sith tricked the Republic into having a Galactic Empire, by using pawning the Trade Federation into a dispute with the Republic over the layout trade in the galaxy which led to war and their formation of the Separatists droid army which led to the great Clone Wars. The Force Awakens does more than slightly ignore, the film does very little to explain how we've arrived to the point in the saga's timeline. 29 years after the events of Return of The Jedi is a pretty big gap to cover, and to not explain anything and skip over 29 years to pick up Episode VII here is unfortunate. I'm all for mystery and letting things go unsolved until the following Episodes. However, there comes a point where I should not have a pile of bothering questions while watching the film, take for example the new Starkiller planet base. I like Starkiller, but while it's bigger than the previous two Death Stars it's place in Episode VII is minimal and does not give it the impact or nearly as much dread as compared to the first two Death Stars. Both previous Death Stars were mobile space stations which could travel to a near by planet and destroy it with the station's core firepower. Were over halfway through the film and within 10-15 minutes of the climatic finale assault by the time we fully see Starkiller and its full power potential. And as I said before, can the giant Starkiller move? This is question I should not have to ask, which bugs me to death! After Starkiller drains up the power of all nearby stars can it travel to a new location? It's an ice planet converted into a space station, so does it have the ability to travel? If Starkiller can travel, we never hear this mentioned or see this happen. If Starkiller is not able to travel, its pointless once all the nearby stars have been drained. Another possible reason for the massive pile of unanswered questions, and probably the main reason why is Disney's greed. Before The Force Awakens was released Disney announced their intentions to make Star Wars the first ever forever franchise. Sounds awesome! Until you hear what that entails. Disney plans to release a new Star Wars movie every year. Whether it is another spin off film or another official Episode in the Star War cannon. You would think I would as excited as a kid on Christmas morning upon hearing this. I wasn't. In fact I was disgusted. In the past, the time span of the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy was a new Episode every three years until the trilogy was done. Disney plans to release a new Episode of this trilogy/saga every two years with spin off films in between. The marketing for The Force Awakens was the biggest movie marketing ever. There was not a single place you can be without seeing something Star Wars related. TV, radio ads, Malls, grocery stores, department stores, billboards, pet stores, everywhere! It got to a point where I just wanted the film to be released so things would calm down. I was finding myself a little tired of being a fan. A Star Wars movie every year! I don't think I can take this every year. Disney does the same with Marvel films, and I've been sick of those for the last two and a half years. Disney will do to Star Wars what George Lucas never did. Disney may end up killing Star Wars not just for me, but also for everyone. Leave The Damn Mask On!With the redeeming death of Darth Vader in Return of The Jedi we lose one of the greatest villains of all-time. That's a lot to live up to. Enter Kylo Ren a mystery-masked villain of The First Order with Jedi-like training and strong training with the Force. Kylo is the body and fighting skills of Darth Maul with the mask, voice, and temper of Darth Vader. Midway through the film it is revealed that Kylo Ren is the son of Han Solo, trained by Luke Skywalker, turned to the Dark Side by the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke, and desires to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather Darth Vader. Why follow is evil grandfather when he actually redeems himself by destroying the Sith Lord/Emperor and saving the galaxy? No clue! However, Kylo Ren is a pretty badass villain. His dark shadow of mystery and anger is intension and fun to have back in Star Wars. However, Kylo Ren removes his mask, twice in the film. The second time he removes the mask is 100% fitting. The scene has him and Han Solo, face-to-face, father and son. The removal of Kylo's mask to reveal is undamaged young adult face would've bettered this scene if he had not removed it earlier. During an interrogation scene between Kylo Ren and Rey, he removes the mask. No! No, No, No! The minute the mask comes off and his face is revealed, Kylo Ren is less of a villain. Which makes perfect sense when he displays his struggle to his father. However, having him remove his mask makes him a wild card young adult playing dress up and trying to be something he's not. What if Darth Vader revealed his Anakin face in The Empire Strikes Back? The Dark Side has taken him, and Anakin Skywalker is lost. He would be less Vader. Once he takes the mask off in Return of the Jedi to be face-to-face, father and son with Luke, he's no longer Darth Vader he's Anakin Skywalker once again. The decision to have Kylo Ren remove his mask a few scenes early when it wasn't critical was wrong, very wrong.The Hardest Comment to MakeOne of the biggest problems I have with The Force Awakens is one I never thought in a million years I would be down on. John Williams' is the simply the best, I love everything this man does. Even his scores for films like Always and 1941. I hate to admit this was even a problem, but it was. The score for The Force Awakens is missing the thrill, the excitement, the joy, the triumph, but most importantly the magic heard in every prior Star Wars score. Not saying the score here is not good at all. It's a good and solid score for an action adventure, but this is Star Wars Episode VII and it's missing all the wonder and triumph of the epic space adventure. The score is more suited for a series like Indiana Jones, or a film like Hook. The key musical factors missing are themes and dominating action music. Don't freak out, the music has the classic Star Wars theme, the Force theme, Han and Leia love theme, but the original material here is a little flat. Take Episode I, you have Duel of Fates, Anakin's theme, the Droid Invasion March, Jar-Jar's theme. Episode III, you have General Grievous theme, Battle of Heroes, Anakin's Seduction and Betrayal. The Empire Strikes Back, you have the Imperial March, Han and Leia's love theme, Yoda's theme, Cloud City's theme. With The Force Awakens you have Rey's theme, the Resistance March, maybe possibly a theme for Snoke, and this is pretty much it. No Kylo Ren theme, no First Order theme, no themes for Finn, Poe, Maz, or even BB-8! In every Star Wars film the score has been fantastic in every scene, with new original material in each Episode to add a great finishing shine to the visuals. This time around the score is not very memorable. The music sinks in without jumping out at the audience, unless a classis theme suddenly comes up. The score often carries a repetitive non-pulse feel from scene to scene. If you listen carefully the music is different throughout the scenes, but it does not sound any different. In other words the score does not aid in telling the story at key times. In every previous Star Wars Episode you could listen to the soundtrack and knew without seeing the film what kind of action was happening, or what the characters were feeling. Duel of The Fates - a grand lightsaber battle. Anakin's Betrayal - the destruction of the Jedi.Anakin's Dark Deeds - the complete fall of Skywalker into the power of the Sith. The Pit of Carkoon - feelings of intensity for our captured heroes until they break free and Luke unleashes his Jedi training for the heroic rescue. The Force Awakens' key action scene is the Millennium Falcon's chase on Jakku, which returns us to the old gunner nest of the Falcon from A New Hope, as well as the classic feel of the asteroid chase in Empire Strikes Back, and yet the music has none of that sensational thrill to light up the screen with the sound of adventure. At the very least someone should've added a nod to The Asteroid Field track as the Falcon races through the wreckage of the upside down Executive Star Destroyer. No Star Wars film would be complete without a climatic lightsaber battle, and The Force Awakens does have a solid saber duel. However, the music playing with the duel goes unnoticed. Williams has always scored big with creating a grand lightsaber duel music track. Episode I - Duel of The FatesEpisode III - Battle of The HeroesEpisode V - The Clash of LightsabersEpisode VI - Vader and Luke's Final Fight (track \"The Battle of Endor II\") For the climatic lightsaber duel in The Force Awakens between Kylo Ren, Finn, and Rey the music on the soundtrack comes and goes without the listener even realizing what they just heard was a duel. This was the first time I walked out of the theater after seeing a new Star Wars film and had no idea what the music was during a fight scene. John Williams has always been brilliant and consistent with his scores. The first act of Force Awakens has a solid score, with the exception of the Falcon's chase on Jakku, but the score for the last half of the film becomes almost completely forgettable. What happened with The Force Awakens? Was it his old age? Is Williams tried of doing these scores? I don't believe it to be any of these. What was missing was his collaboration with George Lucas. Yes! Lucas and Williams have collaborated on the musical score for all 6 previous Star Wars films. The Force Awakens was scored without Lucas' involvement. Which not only greatly shows, but also adds something greatly disappointing to George Lucas not being involved anymore. Some magic has gone missing already in Star Wars. The music of Star Wars has always been a factor. Whether the film was good or bad, the music was always masterful! The score for Episode VII is the weakest of all 7 films, and makes viewing The Force Awakens feel less Star Wars.  ConclusionFor better or worse I have a love/dislike for The Force Awakens. So many of the promising shots I saw in the trailers were substituted with lesser impacting shots, the film presents too many unanswered questions, the collaboration for the music of The Force Awakens was not there. However, I love the characters of The Force Awakens. The acting is some of the strongest I've seen out of 7 films. In the end the film is fantastic. Did The Force Awakens miss its mark of being as great as A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back? Yes. The beauty of a film like The Empire Strikes Back wasn't to be as great as A New Hope, but to continue the story in superior fashion. The Force Awakens overall production was spot on with how to return to the fun old school cinema approach of shooting Star Wars. However, Disney and the modern style of movie making need to be more mindful for the scope and magic of Star Wars for Episode VIII and IX.Where does Episode VII fall in the rankings of Star War films?1. The Empire Strikes Back2. A New Hope3. Revenge of The Sith4. Return of The Jedi5. The Force Awakens6. The Phantom Menace7. Attack of The Clones",

The whole time I was watching it I couldn't believe I was watching another Star Wars movie! Everything works, the story, the new characters clashing with the old characters, the special effects mixed with practical effects, the music, the humor and the action scenes. J.J. Abrams nails everything and still remains one of my favorite directors working today. John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, and BB-8 are perfect and you love their interactions and look forward to seeing them in more Star Wars movies. The ending is fantastic and you wish the next movie was out! I loved this movie and can't wait for the next one!",

I really loved how Abrams brought the film back to its roots with the retro sci-fi setting and periodic goofball humor that made the originals so addicting. Cast members from the original movies returned to the screen and set the stage for a new era of star wars characters. The movie is an ode to the first film, following a very similar plot line. Although, the similarities are predictable, the movie remains captivating. That being said, if the series continues to follow storylines of the original movies, it will quickly become a flop. Hopefully, Abrams and Disney can come up with a more original storyline for the 2nd movie.",

What few effects there were lacked professionalism, modernization, and any sort of epic feel.There were only a handful of characters, way too many close ups. The movie felt confining, claustrophobic, and narrow. It was very slow paced, and failed to keep my attention. Moments were so slow I thought it was for comic relief, when it was actually being serious. The acting was forced and awkward. I think I saw Harrison Ford's pain in his eyes at how bad Leia's acting was. The plot was weak, with a sudden \"New Order\" evil appearing. Somehow they already secured a planet sized superweapon, aimed at a solar system conveniently next to where the heroes were staying and with the first firing of the weapon just so happened to destroy every other planet filled with people except they one they were staying. Episode III was much better. I have no plans on seeing Episode VIII or IV, and if I by chance do, it certainly won't be in theaters. I had set my expectations much higher for Disney. This movie was terrible. 1 out of 10. I want my money back.",

    "review": "  George Lucas can rest easy after passing the lightsaber on to cinematic genius J.J. Abrams. Abrams has created a masterpiece that left me with the same feeling I had after exiting \"Star Wars\" in 1977. It lives up to all of the hype leading to the premiere. From the first frame, with the sound of John Williams' rousing score, to the final fade out, there's not a moment of disappointment. Thrills, chills, action and many surprises (no spoilers listed here) are scattered throughout this exciting roller coaster ride. While the energetic young cast members are terrific, it's Harrison Ford who steals the show - many times with just an expression. For the legions of followers, this brilliant new chapter in the series is FANtastic. There are many references to the past classic films, but they cleverly fit into the plot and never get in the way. This can be credited to the screenplay written by Abrams, Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan (who wrote \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\"). Of course they've included R2-D2 and C-3PO, but there's also a lovable new droid named BB-8. This stellar tribute to the best of the matinee adventures of long ago is also visually stunning, but the audience will be too caught up in the plot to appreciate it - making this one of those rare films that will happily require repeat viewings. The spectacular \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" provides a new hope for future generations of moviegoers.",

So I'm not just a cynical idiot. This is just my opinion.The fever had hit me by this point and I had just re-watched all of the original unaltered Star Wars films from 1977-1983. So I was primed. I saw it with family and everyone was stoked to return to one of our favorite universes. SO what happened? This movie fell on its face, it limped, it crawled, it tried in vain to recapture the magic and the awe. This was 95% failed remake and 5% spectacle. Other then some small throwbacks and homages, plus some epic battle sequences, nothing in the film excited me, impressed me, inspired me, or elicited any emotion that could be categorized under \"positive.\" Mostly I was feeling disappointment and disbelief. The appropriate adjectives for the movie are \"safe\" \"stale\" \"unimaginative\" and \"predictable.\" The convenience of the scenes, the ease of the struggles, the pathetic backstory and undelivered promise of a saga continued instead of repackaged. So many plot holes, illogical concepts and uninspired backstory. Even individual lines felt on the nose. Abrams keeps a pace that is too fast, too fast in that he just wants to get it over with rather than let the weight of the moment consume the audience.How I appreciate the pace of the originals. The characters, the vision of such a good vs. evil story. Luke, Vader, Obi-wan, Yoda, the Emperor, Han, Leia, Chewie, OHHHH so good!!Kylo Ren is trying to be Vader. Fail. Rey is trying to be Luke and Han. Fail. Finn is trying to be - something. Fail. By the way, although I liked Finn, his turn from a stromtrooper is unrealistic and unmotivated in any universe. Rey pretty much is perfect at everything and being left behind by her family was executed poorly though it's a great backstory - except it's been done before. I did like her self-sacrifice towards BB-8.Snoke is - come on. A CGI projection of a deep evil that came from???Kylo Ren kills every other Jedi apprentice, forces Luke into a depression and exile and yet is beaten by Rey who uses a lightsaber for the FIRST time! He doesn't even look like Han. The coolest story is lost in the decades since Return of the Jedi and reduced to flashbacks.Han dies in one of the most predictable scenes in history, plus Harrison wanted out! I didn't even care about his death and I blame that blasphemy on the movie forcing me to know what will happen before it does. R2 wakes up conveniently when the battle is over to reveal the map. Rey finds Luke in 60 seconds. BB-8 is no R2. 3PO adds nothing. Leia and Han have a weird and lazy history. The Empire pretty much wasn't beaten, bigger death star, more planets destroyed, have to destroy the energy shield, I could go on. The General even gave a speech that was part Nazi part why was it in there? This film could have been so much better and different but AT LEAST different.I feel for Abrams because I think Disney enforced a rapid timeline and the script that maybe began as something great was red-inked until it was safe enough to release.This is a return to the Star Wars universe but it offers me nothing I haven't already seen and loved. I didn't like anything that was happening and I will defend any criticism I have. If you enjoyed it, more power to you. Keep enjoying it and DO NOT wake up to the critiques that will surely come with time. I pray Episode 8 is awesome!",

    "review": "  Star wars The Force Awakens has been the most hyed about movie of all time pretty much, it certainly was for me. I have been a die-hard star wars fan all my life and The Force Awakens did not disappoint. Episode VII is not the most original film in the series that is for sure, but it did not have to be. It borrowed many plot lines from A New Hope and even Return of the Jedi, but that is what we wanted isn't it? The prequels were too different aesthetically and therefore JJ gave us something that looked and felt like we were in a galaxy far far away. The new characters, Rey, Finn and Poe are fantastic. Kylo Ren is awesome and is not just a rehash of Darth Vader, he is the most unique villain there has ever been in Star wars. His emotional state is a great element to his character and he is menacing. Supreme leader Snoke is a mysterious but promising character with a great voice. General Hux has some fire to him and also isn't exactly like Tarkin from A New Hope, he gives an epic speech in the movie that fills us in with some backstory as to how the resistance is related to the Republic. Daisy Ridley is a star in the making, her performance is amazing and will be a great face of the franchise for the rest of the trilogy. Now some of the negatives to this film are that there are a lot of unanswered questions, i mean a lot! this movie does not really work as a standalone movie like A New Hope did, i understand this is a new trilogy but i was hoping for some more resolution than we ended up getting. Starkiller base is another death star pretty much and it was not very menacing at all, i did not fear it in any way like i did with the first death star. JJ played it safe and it worked, this is the best film in the series since The Empire Strikes Back and is a great start to the trilogy 4.75/5",

No doubt in the hope no-one would notice). This reached a truly farcical climax when one of the rebel generals felt he had to explain that it really wasn't a Death Star. Why? Solely because it was much much bigger.Virtually the only points of difference are that the Darth Vader character seems to be played by Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and the Emporer character by Gollums grandad.Lazy, cowardly writing with no cliff hanger ending.At least Mark Hammil learned his lines.",

    "review": "  Fear not, young Padawan. The force is back. In style, and with the integrity it has been missing for decades.I cannot have been the only one whose immense anticipation for Episode VII of the Star Wars saga was only matched by the apprehension that it could turn out to be another colossal let down. George Lucas, in more than one way, had lost the legitimation to be the guardian of the Star Wars universe long, longs before he eventually abdicated. Even though his successor in the directing chair, J. J. Abrams had already demonstrated his ability to reinvent a science fiction series with his excellent work on Star Trek, it was not clear whether he would have the sensibility required to resuscitate the magic of the original Star War trilogy from the ruins that Lucas left with his prequels. For those whose young minds were irreversibly formed by the original trilogy, the term \"prequel\" is synonymous with \"misdeed\" and evokes notions of denial, abjuration, self-doubt, screenplay 101, and 'green screen'-coloured sputum. Having thoroughly flatlined through the prequels, the force has at last been resurrected with \"The Force Awakens\" and I cannot wait to see the Episode VIII which hopefully will mirror Episode V to bring more feel and depth. Are there grounds for nit-picking? Yes, a few. I was happy with all the references to the previous films but found the actual storyline elements being reused verbatim a bit too many for comfort. For viewers new to the saga, this won't matter a bit, though. Why the long pause between Han Solo being stabbed and Chewbacca deciding to revenge him? It only seemed motivated to allow the drama to linger on the screen. Why not have Chewbacca arrive late to the scene in order to avoid this unmotivated delay? At least for me, John Williams' scores no longer are as effective as they used to be. While the score is undeniably very good and significantly contributes to setting an authentic \"Star Wars\" feel to the movie, Williams seems to shy away from committing to new strong and recognisable themes. The new themes are good but not as divine as previous work for Star Wars. I found Harrison Ford's acting to be weak at times and actually did not mind his character falling out of the storyline. To claim he only has two speed -- \"Jaded\" and \"Not quite so jaded\" -- would be unfair but isn't that far from the truth. Carry Fisher looked like she was nailed to the ground and would not have been able to walk if her life depended on it. However, and more importantly, all the new actors are great (even though some of their earth-bound accents feel definitely out of place in a galaxy far, far away) and they fully deliver, showing the old cast the door. Also, humour has been brought back in the way it is meant to be, as a relief born out of natural reactions (as opposed to the embarrassing slapstick Lucas became infamous for). Overall, this movie did the saga justice. Thank you, J. J. Abrams!Here's what I expect some of my favourite film critics to say:Jeremy Jahns: Awesometacular!Tony Zhou (Every Frame a Painting): Abrams is a visual storyteller par excellence and masters the Spielberg Oner to perfection. Mr. Plinkett: This is how it's done, a**holes!EDIT: Now that the Academy Awards nominations are out, I'd like to comment that I believe the movie was justifiably nominated for an Academy Award for editing. The editing is very well done, but so are the choices when not too cut. Not only because of the latter, i.e., Abrams' great ideas for combining many shots into one, I feel the movie was snubbed for best director. Finally, in no way does \"The Martian\" deserve to be nominated for \"best picture\" if \"The Force Awakens\" is not. \"The Martian\" is OK, but nowhere near Ridley Scott's best work.",

It conjures nostalgia for beloved characters from our younger days, but tries to sell the same story, with better special effects and fresh faces. The acting, cinematography, screenplay, etc are all top notch, but the movie doesn't wow all Star Wars fans, as you may have thought reading the reviews. The plot is somewhat predictable, and the climax reminds you of the original Star Wars. At best, this is a re-make of the original with a few minor plot twists.While George Lucas would be licking his lips with the expected billion dollar payoff, I do hope he does not succumb to bland for his next edition. Incidentally the villian in that movie is slated to be Benicio Del Toro - that is formidible. Worth a watch, but not worth a second visit to 3D or IMAX 3D.",

    "review": "  The Force Awakens is about a scavenger (Daisy Ridley) and a renegade stormtrooper (John Boyega) and together they enlist the help of legendary smugglers Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca to transport a droid carrying information regarding the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. Let me start off by saying that I am and always will be a huge Star Wars fan. The characters and the story has always intrigued me. The Force Awakens is a stunning sequel that arrays a perfect mix of new and old. This movie is everything that you hoped and dreamed that it would be. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley shine and have great chemistry together, as well as Adam Driver perfectly portraying the sinister Kylo Ren. Don't be alarmed, all of your favorite Star Wars characters are back as well. They aren't, however, just in the movie for nostalgic value. All of the classic characters we know and love still bring so much to the table plot wise, and they still deliver key performances. When you put all of these actors and iconic characters under the direction of J.J Abrams, you have what I believe to be the best Star Wars film in the saga. However, the acting/direction isn't the only thing that we must give credit for. John Williams is still composing and his music score is just as powerful as it was when the first movie was released back in 1977. The music gives the movie so much feeling and the score blends perfectly with both the acting and the cinematography. I also must give props to Daniel Mindel who did a fantastic job on the cinematography. He made the movie seem so much more realistic and made it very exciting. Everything in this particular Star Wars movie just seemed bigger and better. Overall, The Force Awakens lives up to the previous films making this a near perfect seventh installment.",

Luckily the movie actively encouraged that participation by giving us an enjoyable briskly paced story that kept me engaged throughout the entirety of it. The acting here from everyone is top notch, the new characters with Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Issac, but my personal favorite of the newbies is Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. There are moments in this movie where you can feel his passion and anger leap off the screen, creating a villain you are invested in. However the best overall performance is from Harrison Ford, who brought back Han Solo, with all the quips and charm from the original trilogy. Any drawbacks of the movie are small enough to not affect me in any major way, but after 3 viewings I would some of the pacing is off. The beginning is slower and then it never looks back from there, when maybe it should have. I believe this also plays into the humor of the film, which for the most part was spectacular and surprising, but some jokes were given too much or too little screen time. Overall though this is a favorite movie of mine because it is Star Wars, it feels like Star Wars in every aspect, the characters, the locations, the spaceships, everything just felt like a return to the original trilogy. And that is the most I could have ever hoped for, bring on Episode VIII.",

    "review": "  When I first heard that there will be a new trilogy for Star Wars, I just jump and scream as high and as loud as I can. As you can see, I'm a BIG BIG FAN of the Star Wars franchies. I used to watch the previous 6 films EVERYTIME I just went home from school. I would watch it over and over again until the DVD cracked or lost. Since then, Star Wars will always be part of my childhood.So let's get to the movie.The movie is good. Just good. Not perfect. There are things that bothered me and maybe it will be kind of strange for some Star Wars fans. They say the film was the best amongst the others. I don't agree with this. Episode 7 seems to be copying the original Star Wars (1977) formula. When I went to the theatre, I wanted to see something new and fresh - yes, there are but not too convincing to me. They teared up the 50% with the new things, but left the 50% of the original formula. I wanted 75%-80% of new things.The film follows 3 new characters. Those three new characters would be the main protagonists in the new trilogy. Do I hate them? No, I love them! But, Poe should have more screen time. Rey is amazing. There hasn't been a lot of convincing female jedi in the film. Now this is one of the amazing new ideas in the movie.The story lacked of information. Who is Supreme Leader Snoke? Where have Han Solo and Chewie been in the lost 30 years? How does Maz Katana get her hands on Luke's lightsaber? Etc.But as I said, the new ideas were very fresh. You can see the new lightsaber, the new X-Wing, the new characters, and Kylo Ren. Oh, I haven't talked about Kylo Ren.Kylo Ren has a good character arc. Though he was not as strong as Darth Vader, we love his inconsistent emotion and way of thinking. We identified him easily because we too are like Kylo Ren. We are human beings who can't decide which to do and which to think. We sometimes chose the right one, but we also sometimes chose the bad one.The final lightsaber battle was the best in the movie. It was motivated. We don't know if Rey was going to defeat Ren or not. Rey doesn't have any training skills. Because of the motivations behind the battle, we sit with hard tense from your feet to the tip of you hair.But, there are a lot of things that really need to be answered in Episode 8. So... we'll have to wait until 2017.The verdict:The film wants to draw attention to new audience, I understand that. But it lacked a new formula - FORMULA, not ideas.",

    "review": "  I must admit, I was disappointed when I first saw The Force Awakens. The poor pacing, the plot holes, and lack of originality gnawed at me. I have since taken my kids twice (they love it). But that's the point, 8 year old's don't care about 1977 nostalgia or what's canon. This movie is for the Disney generation, not 40 something Star Wars geeks. I watched the movie for the third time this weekend. This time I loved it. I watched it through my kids eyes. No expectations, no preconceived notions of how I felt the story should go. It is a great science fiction action movie. Star Wars worthy? I will reserve judgement until I see Episode VIII. Three nagging issues still stand out for me: 1) No embrace or acknowledgement between Leia and Chewie after Han is killed. That's just floors me. I blame the director for that. 2) Han and the others seeing the Hosnian system being destroyed by the starkiller weapon from Maz Kanata's planet, and in broad daylight no less. I can overlook the starkiller draining suns and shooting it's beam via \"hydra-space\", it is science fiction after all. But seeing another solar system being destroyed in real time in the sky like watching the Death Star explode over the Endor moon is just plain insulting. 3) The First Order and the villains are weak and poorly developed. Hux is too young. Snoke is not scary. Phasma is incompetent to say the least. And Kylo Ren's powers appear to be inconsistent. I don't care how injured he was, by the end of the movie he seemed weak and pathetic. If he's the leader of the Knight of Ren. I'm not scared (yet). Thank you for reading.",

    "review": "  A couple decades ago we received three Star Wars prequels! Two of them were disappointing and the third one was good but not given the care that was given to the originals. 10 years later we have booted the CGI defecating George Lucas out of the directing chair and replaced it with J.J. Abrams. And let me tell you that Mr. Abrams and Disney have really delivered, I was super impressed by the job they did on this film. Is it a perfect Star Wars film? No, but it was closer to what a Star Wars film should be like. So what did I like and what problems did I have with it.The New Characters are very well written and performed very well; the imagery and effects are spectacular with the use of both practical and computer-generated effects, John Williams score is always on point, and the action scenes are beautifully shot. To my surprise there was a lot of humor in the film, however it is done brilliantly and subtly which is an immense improvement over Jar-Jar Goddamn Binks from the prequels.  So that was the good now on to the flaws, to begin the story while good, borrows way too much from episode IV A New Hope. Both films involve the opposing forces interrogating the protagonists for some important Data, which is given to a droid, which comes into possession of a force sensitive protagonist who ends up helping the rebellion destroy a space station and becoming a hero. Now I am going to excuse this for the fact that this is only the first movie of what is suppose to be a new trilogy, and because the story for the two other films is unknown at this point its not fair to hold this against it.However what I can hold against it is continuity errors. Now there aren't that many of these, but the few that there are, are serious. For example, the character Rey comes in contact with a lightsaber That Luke lost when his hand was severed in Bespin during his duel with Vader in Episode V, which you all know took place on a giant catwalk over a giant pit that leads to the outside of the building which is up in the clouds. Now again maybe they will explain this later in the story, but even then it is a little too convenient that the lightsaber was actually found.With my complaints aside I really enjoyed this movie and am looking forward to watching the next movie when it's released. I rate this film 4.5/5 stars.",

    "review": "  I think Disney and JJ focused far too intently on bringing Star Wars towards a modern audience and \"rebooting\" the franchise, largely ignoring what they should have done which is provide a standalone story with the components of a good Star Wars movie. Too much of it was rushed, so much so that most of the film's major plot points (including the Starkiller Base battle) was pretty anti-climactic. In fact everything about it seemed rushed, making it appear like they tried to squeeze everything about what's to come in the newly rebooted series into one \"preview movie\". Force Awakens was essentially: \"Look who we're killing off, look who we're keeping, this desert-dwelling loner girl who already knows how to use the Force is going to be the next super-awesome jedi, and there's this Nazi-like group who scraped up what was left of the Empire. By the way, you won't ever see the fruits of the Rebel Alliance's labor in reforming the Empire into the New Republic. These new guys' sphere of death is so awesome it destroyed EVERY major New Republic population center in ONE shot.\" Short version: They really need to follow this movie with more than two films; it's just too much of a two-hour long trailer rather than an actual movie.",

The strengths of the film are certainly the strong cast of new and old, the feeling of nostalgia and frantic pace, all of which keeps the audience stuck to the screen and wanting more. However some elements of the plot have born too heavy a likeness to the original Star Wars screenplay of which most notably the attempted Death Star revival in Star Killer Base is the weakest example. The film does also suffer from its breakneck pace at times, with some of the more poignant and dramatic moments harried over in order to maintain the speed. Overall this does not damage the tone of the film and one can conclude that this while not likely to be the strongest piece in the Star Wars Franchise, has certainly laid down a powerful framework for the remainder Disney produced entries. May the Force be with you.",

    "review": "  Abrams has nailed the old feeling of the originals with one hell of a cast. Seriously, everyone here, new and old, is just fantastic. Ridley and Boyega are perfect leads that will carry these new movies. One of the better performances of the movie comes out of Adam Driver, who gives his character such depth for someone who is behind a mask most of it. The decision to go back to practical was a wise one. The universe feels lived in and makes it seem like you can go back there anytime. The story is promising but the movie felt, at times, like a rehash of some of the older films, specifically from the old trilogy. Still, it is better than the last three prequels and offers a promising start. Breathe easy, JJ did it.",

I compare what was new in the original trilogy and what is new here... well. I have to say I am sure the story will really develop in episodes VIII and IX, but utnil then... Good performance by Harrison Ford, who seems to have resisted better than others the time flow. Daisy Ridley is great, and John Boyega well suited for his role. Adam Driver acts well, but I felt his face just doesn't fit. Watching the movie the second time in IMAX 3D made me enjoy it more. To be continued......",

However, I do have one pet peeve with The Force Awakens. Kylo Ren, a fully trained Jedi now turned to the dark side, should not have any problems in a lightsaber duel against Finn and Rey, who both have had no training whatsoever. But in this case Finn and Rey both hold there own very nicely against Kylo Ren and even Rey is able to injure him. This does not flow with previous Star Wars logic. Luke Skywalker could not even touch Darth Vader in their first duel and Luke was trained by Yoda before hand. Besides that oversight, everything else is perfect.",

    "review": "  The latest return of the most iconic space fantasy franchise was anticipated with mixed feelings. Star Wars had returned once before with awful results when George Lucas, the director of the original beloved trilogy of adventure flicks, resurrected his greatest money maker in 1999. That trilogy of prequels has often been called a series of commercials meant to boost toy sales.After this cinematic disaster, the franchise was kept off the silver screen, until Lucas decided to gather his winnings and sell the exclusive SW license to none other than Disney Pictures. The most critical viewers foresaw more toy commercial material, but Disney seemed to know they had something to proof. J.J. Abrams, the guy who managed to resurrect cerebral Star Trek as a goofy slapstick extravaganza in 2009 was assigned to do- financially, at least- the same trick with Star Wars.He succeeded. Not only did \"The Force Awakens\" make unimaginable amounts of money, it isn't an awful film by any means. It's about the safest bet Abrams could have made, but he managed to concoct a reasonably entertaining piece of harmless entertainment even under overwhelming pressure from a passionate fan base.The approach here is extremely retro. Everything from lighting to framing to sound design is pure late seventies, making \"The Force Awakens\" feel quite like \"A New Hope\" all over again. The same is true for the script as well. Abrams was criticized heavily for using too many familiar elements in \"Star Trek: Into Darkness,\" but here he basically remixes \"A New Hope\" right down to structural detail. The clear nostalgia-over-anything -mentality might have made this film a sort of non-movie, but all the channeling is done with care and precision.Then the problems. Hollywood spectacle scripts are plagued by incongruences and conflicting details, which is more of a crime when the story as a whole doesn't set out to do anything on any deeper level, as seems to be the case here. The second act has some easy emotional moments but kind of falls apart into a sequence of aimless action sequences in familiar Abrams- and, yes, Star Wars- fashion. But the beginning and the ending entertain well enough for me to forgive the lazy writing midway through. Also, the dialogue is okay, which is the clearest improvement to all the previous installments.Another resurrection of the \"A New Hope\" approach is the decision to use relatively unknown stars in leading roles. All of them do well enough if not excellent. I hope there will be some involved character building in the future, because so far the new characters don't have that much meat around the bones yet. The supporting characters known from previous films still steal the show just because of their history.We begin the saga with Finn (John Boyega), a soldier of the Empire who decides to switch sides as he witnesses military atrocities in the field. There's bound to be some internal conflict here in the future, but not much is seen yet. Boyega doesn't have much to work with as it stands, and that shows a bit.The major hero this time is a more kick-ass version of Luke Skywalker, Rey (Daisy Ridley) who gets caught up in the conflict between the rebels and the Empire and happens to have a natural mastery of The Force bordering on the Deus ex machina. I'm hoping for more nuances here as well- Rey is even more of a Mary Sue than Luke was, and that's too much. Ridley spends a bit too much screen time simply looking astonished, but she fares well in the end. There's a physicality to her that suits the two-dimensional action hero Rey still is.The most tragic character failure is the antagonist. Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver. He is very difficult to take seriously. His arch has mirrored that of Anakin Skywalker, and there is way too much gothic emo angst and hair products involved in the character design on every level. His scenes came across more parodic than nostalgic.At times, the parody feel is also present because of the music. John Williams returns with a score that nicely plays into the retro feel, but at times the melodramatic strings just make a scene feel like a spoof. The melodies aren't horribly memorable either.In hindsight, the original Star Wars trilogy seems to thematically announce and reflect the Reagan era. Militaristic bravado, religious war romanticism and na�ve hero myths abound. In 2016 the very same ideology persists in the franchise, but it presents itself as less influential as it just blends in with all the nostalgia. Abrams inserted a same sort of hard values -romanticism into his first star Trek film and it was painfully ill-fitting inside a franchise known for its soft values and logical non-romanticism. Now he gets to do what he wants in a franchise where it all fits, and seems to make the assumed fanboy enthusiasm work in the movie's favor. Now that he's won approval for a remix, he has the opportunity to take risks and take a worshipped mythos further. I hope he will.There are some Daesh similes here to make it all a bit more current, though. And overall the conflict between the Empire and the rebels is presented more as a holy war. The original trilogy- in its time of libertarianism and Reaganomics- presented the Empire vaguely as a communist state, but it is more clearly a church here. The war among the stars might be less about ideology than about scripture.",

    "review": "  Star Wars, all in all, is one big hype train fueled by the dollars of loyal fans. Keep in mind, I have almost NO bias here, as I only recently saw the original trilogy, and find it hard to get invested in the universe surrounding these movies. Who knew that the movie that dumped the internet on it's side, the movie that had everybody discussing whether it should or should not happen, the movie that many internet critics are saying is one of the best, if not the best, film of the year, the movie that has people up in each other's throats for saying those 3 dreaded, spoiler-y words, would be the movie I find to be OKAY... but not much else? I did, because I do not buy into hype trains that rely almost entirely on nostalgia. Star Wars has always been an enigma to me: how can something so interesting, but nowhere NEAR perfect have such a major cultural impact? Word of mouth. And that's what got most people interested in this one, word of mouth. I knew I was going to see it, but not at first sight. So, when I went to see this in December, like every other insane person did (those of you who did see it in December, don't be a scumbag, just because it's been out for a month does not give you the right to spoil it!), I had next to no expectations. I walked out almost 3 hours later, with a debate in mind, whether what I saw was worth almost 3 hours of my time. On the cinematography side, yes. The Force Awakens is well shot, and the action scenes are VERY well done, but, this does not excuse the story. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT one of those films where you have hard times holding your suspension of disbelief... it's one of those sequels where you can't help comparing it to it's predecessors. This is basically a newer version of A New Hope, or the OG Star Wars as the Die Hards will often know it as.Without further ado, here's what basically happens. Now, keep in mind, if you have not seen SW:TFA yet, please, by all means, skip this next, overly long paragraph. I will be talking about the main plot, and sideplots that take place here, and what I feel works, and fails. The movie begins decently enough, by jumping right into the action, as a rebel planet is attacked by the Empir- Err, I mean The First Order. Some rebels escape, but the rest of the village is slaughtered by Clone Troopers. However, one of those Clone Troopers refuses to end the village, as he has become traumatized by the death of another, fellow trooper. He and rest escape from the planet, some leader in a suit made of tin barks at him for taking off his helmet (to reveal he's black, but this is only really an issue if you're racist/bigot), and one of the escaping rebels is captured. The black storm trooper frees the rebel, and escape using a ship. The two of them flee to the planet that was used in the beginning of the film, as the rebel is trying to get back his droid, BB-8, who has the map to find Luke Skywalker. It is here that I began to notice the similarities, as the planet could easily be a variable, sent in to replace the ship that A New Hope begins on. Anyways, on the way to the planet, the Storm Trooper gets a name: Fin. The 2 of them crash, and the perspective changes to Ray, a trader who sells all things metal to get weird, slimy cash. She finds BB-8, who tells her everything she needs to know plotwise, and he follows her home. BB-8 is almost sold, but does not give in. Here's where I'm going to get lazy and skip the details: Fin meets Ray, helps steal the Millennium Falcon, which then gets captured by Han Solo and Chewey. They look at the incomplete map, visit the rebel base and learn about the 4th iteration of the death star. At this point, the lazy writing kicked in. For the life of me, I could not understand why going for another death star was worth it, especially considering they've overused the death star so much, to the point where they might as well go ahead and build one on somebodies trousers. Anyhow, they learn about Kylo Ren, Han Solo's goth son, who has the dorkiest face I've seen in a while (despite the actor actually being really good). Anyhow, Fin finds a lightsaber, Ray learns the force somehow, and they go over to the death star planet thing currently being powered by the sun. It is here where the only words to spoil this movie kick in: Han Solo dies. This is one of the strongest parallels to the Episode IV in the entire movie, but is only marginally beaten by the Death Star's 4th appearance. Anyhow, Fin gets injured by Kylo Ren's claymore lightsaber, but Ray gets him. They escape the death star, in it's whole blowy-uppy sequence, Fin begins to get treated, and they find Luke Skywalker. The End.I guess something else that's cool is the performances, which, as expected, are outstanding.All in all, Star Wars is not perfect. If you love it depends on if you won't think about the comparisons while watching it.Now, please, PLEASE don't attack me Star Wars fanboys, this was an honest review about MY thoughts on TFW, not YOUR thoughts.",

    "review": "  TFA was a great movie that helped bring the Star Wars franchise back to life from the let down that is the prequels trilogy. At times the call backs to previous movies get a bit annoying and the MCU styled jokes seem a bit \"forced\", but all-in-all this is a great film to expand the Star Wars universe. The film has spectacular action sequences, a happy medium between practical effects and CGI, excellently composed and lit shots, and most importantly this actually FEELS like a Star Wars movie.",

    "review": "  At first, I thought this movie was going to be terrible like The Phantom Menace, but it surprised me. The film is kind of a reboot of A New Hope, but it works, and unlike the prequels, less is more. The overall plot is good, the characters are cool or tolerable(My favorite new characters are Kylo Ren, Rey, and Poe), and the pace of the movie is fun, action packed, and at one moment, shocking. Even though there are some things left unexplained and the fact that one character learns something way too quickly, it is a fun film and a worthy Star Wars sequel.",

    "review": "  I thought this movie was a colossal fail. While arguably slightly better than its modern day predecessors, its at times glacial pace, often unsubstantiated plot progression, and absurd 'deus ex machina' moments destroyed its unlimited potential. Without getting too much into spoilers, the idea that (a) character(s) in the movie were able to (without training) defeat obviously far more practiced baddies struck me as inane. I understand it was an awakening of the 'force', but there is absolutely no premise to support anyone exercising advanced abilities without training whatsoever. Especially when considering the demonstrably powerful opponent's skills. This along with the film's glossed over and at times completely unexplained plot progression, delivers a film rife with forced tributes to Lucas lore and sporadic, incomplete character development that ultimately begs the question: What exactly just happened?I'll obligingly see the second hopefully more finessed sequel in hopes that it at least somewhat makes good on its promise to elevate the quality of the franchise. Disney purchasing the rights to Star Wars should have provided a clear step forward from the modern Lucas generation tragedies. Unfortunately it was at best, mildly better than its antecedents, and at most partially delivered upon its massive prerelease hype.",

    "review": "  This film is profoundly OK. Among critics and fans alike, it seems to be benefiting from a hefty dose of low expectations brought on by the prequels. Half the scenes were lifted straight from A New Hope, the story-line was painfully simplistic, and the main \"bad guy,\" Kylo Ren, is disappointing (he went from intimidating to weak and laughable way too fast). There are some notable bright spots here. The new characters (Finn, Rey, Poe) are good although their dialogue relies a bit too much on cheesy comic relief (so, you're telling me that a guy who was born and bred as a storm trooper from such a young age that he doesn't even have a name--only a number--somehow talks like a wisecracking fanboy on Reddit.

The main reason for that is that is was mostly predictable and frankly too much like the original. While I understand the desire to get back to the magic of the first movie, I don't think a slightly different version of the same plot was the way to go. I'm hoping for a few more surprises next movie. I also hope they are not afraid of deeper character development which is what makes \"Empire\" the best of the entire series.",

Memorable characters, brilliant practical effects--though they only make whatever CGI there is in the film stand out more--fast pacing, and gorgeous cinematography are just a few examples of what the film does superbly. Not to mention the fact that the film is absolutely worth seeing numerous times and even somehow manages to get better with subsequent viewings. Though it can feel a bit too similar to Episode IV at many points and though some parts weren't really necessary (Starkiller Base, anyone?), Episode VII still nonetheless succeeds where previous film-based attempts in the franchise failed and manages to take the series back by force.8.6/10",

    "review": "  NO SPOILERSLike pretty much everyone else, I love Star Wars and I was so excited to hear that they are going to be making a sequel trilogy. As time went on, I got more and more excited as we were getting to know who was going to be involved in the film. J.J. Abrams did a fantastic job with the new Star Trek films and knowing that he's going to direct the next Star Wars film, there was almost no doubt that this film is going to be good. And I am so glad to say that Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is a fantastic addition to the saga! It gave me everything I wanted to see in a Star Wars film and more, and I'm not just saying that, it really did!Probably the strongest aspect of the film is the characters. I love virtually every single character in the film; Finn, Poe, Kylo Ren, and especially Rey! They're all so interesting, they are set up in the film very well, you know where they have been, you understand their motivations, you feel for them as well the chemistry between them, and you can relate to them. I love how we also get to see some old favorites like Han, Chewie, and Leia. They aren't there to make pointless cameos just to make you remember them, they have important roles in the film that are supportive to the new characters and give more meaning to the film's story. All the actors deliver very believable performances that help make you care for each character. The special effects in the film are so well done. It's a perfect blend of practical and computer generated effects, along with absolutely beautiful cinematography, that makes the film feel more real. The action scenes are some of the most fun I've had in any Star Wars film, or in any film more that matter. The iconic musical score from John Williams, which is so refreshing to hear again, really adds to the thrill and fun of the action. The film is also hilarious, maybe the funniest out of the entire saga! The humor they throw at you is spot on and it never feels too forced. It's awesome to see the humor incorporated with the villainous characters as well, which I don't think we've seen that in a Star Wars film before. They balance out the humor with a perfect amount of genuine emotion and drama. I was a little worried about the little robot, BB-8. He seemed too cutesy, he had the risk of being very annoying, and I didn't think he would fit with the film's tone. But nope, the little guy is awesome, cute, and funny in just the right ways.That all being said, is it a perfect film? As much as I want to say it is, I do have some complaints. Without giving away any plot points, my main issue is that I thought the story of the film felt a little too familiar and mirrors a lot of plot elements from Episode IV - A New Hope, which I think everyone has that same issue. But I felt like they had to do that because we wanted to see and feel the old magic of Star Wars again, and we missed out on a lot of that with the prequel trilogy. Though the plot felt familiar, they had a new director who created different themes and tones that made it feel like a continuation of the saga. However, it would've been nice if they came up with a more original story, even though the story was told extremely well. I also thought that there wasn't quite enough exposition for me to understand how the film progressed from the original trilogy. But again, maybe that was the point because they probably want to leave us wondering how the rest of the new trilogy would play out. I would rather have a film give little exposition than have a film give too much exposition like what the prequels did. Just like what they say, less is more. One other small complaint is the computer animation done on Supreme Leader Snoke. When comparing the CGI done in the rest of the film, I thought he looked pretty bad. Thankfully, he was in a small portion of the film and maybe the animation on him will improve in the upcoming films.But those flaws never disrupted my enjoyment of the film, I enjoyed every minute of it. I had a huge smile on my face the whole time. It brings us right back to the magic of the original trilogy that we all love and fans of the saga will be more than satisfied. I cannot wait to see Episode VIII. Star Wars is back!",

Mostly being that there's no way I can objectively look at something Star Wars related and not get a bit giddy and feel like a kid, which in fact is the beauty of this franchise and this film. What JJ and co have accomplished wonderfully is the simple fact that they made a movie that feels like you're watching \"A New Hope\" all over again. It's quirky, a bit odd, exhilarating, and simple. There are still flaws, the story isn't bulletproof, JJ still relies on too many conveniences and the occasional shoddy character motivation to move the plot forward, and perhaps the main plot sticks a bit too close to \"A New Hope\", but overall this movie feels like a new Star Wars movie should feel. It looks stunning, the practical effects really take it to the next step, and they give the movie a personality that is missing from the prequels. Another thing this movie gets right is the characters. It doesn't focus too much on old faces, and the new characters (Fin, Rey, BB-8, Kylo Ren) are personable, interesting, and engaging. I'm excited to see them grow and progress as humans, which something I haven't felt from these films in a long time. Overall, The Force Awakens may play its cards a bit too safe, and instead of trying to be great, it simply tries not be bad. Which it's not, and for Star Wars, that's more than enough.",

A New Hope and Return of the Jedi were probably the best of the series in terms of story, tone and humour. Thats until now. Screw nostalgia, the only thing which made the originals good is the time of its release and how revolutionary the trilogy was. The Revenge of the Sith had far much more action and story progression. But The Force Awakens blows it out of the water for action. Humour is a little more grown up and much less cheesy. It does seem like the same old rebels attach the spaceship scene which was the focal point of new hope and empire strikes back. And another lovechild turns bad so for originality its lacking in the plot. It does have a good tone in terms of the legend of the force and all the stories of the great battle. The First Order has emerged welcomingly however and I look forward to a much more grown up series with action like this one.",

He is probably the weakest and most pathetic Sith I've ever seen. First impression = his walk was not Sith-like and his outfit was unimaginative (and actually pointless). The Sith usually have an arrogance and elegance in the way they walk but this guy \"struts\"! They are usually feared but he is more of a nobody except for the fact of who he truly is. He can't \"sense\" where people are and is probably the worst person I've ever seen wield a saber. Speaking of the saber I'm not a fan of this new saber design. Honestly there was a lot I saw wrong with this story but like I said I'm biased so I still love it. I don't understand why there is still a \"resistance\" after the fall of the Empire; technically the new bad guys should actually be the resistance because they don't want to fall under the New Republic but anyhew... The story was pretty good, just not great, and the humor was quite good (and totally different from all other Star Wars films). The graphics and nostalgia is what really gives this film it's punch.",

I find that at the end of the movies, there's no emotional investment to any of the characters really...other than the ones we've seen in older movies.

    "review": "  This would probably be a two star movie if I hadn't gone in with such high expectations after reading the near universal praise. I just can't believe the praise being put on this film. The writing was just awful. It just lacked any cohesion. Absolutely nonsensical. It seemed like a Michael Bay movie. That being said there were some good things. Many scenes used special effects like the original films which were clearly more realistic than the prequels. However there were still scenes of pure CGI that had almost no realism. Especially bad -and pointless- was the scene on the falcon with the escaped creatures. Just awful. Death planet - awful. Bad guys - far too weak. Good guys/women - far too strong. The writer clearly has no idea that you actually have to take the time to train to be good at something. A huge change from the originals that focused on teaching and training. The senseless action scenes just ruined it for me. I did like the idea of a stormtrooper becoming good but it could have been done with more realism. I thought this was pretty bad. I hate to say it because I wanted it to be good. I'm not sure there is much potential for the next two given how weak the bad guys are in this movie. I'm just glad Michael Bay and/or JJ Abrams is not directing.",

    "review": "  Laughable that this movie has a 93% on this website, sad actually. For all of the flack the prequel trilogy gets they did something right. That was originality, something severely lacking from this movie.Some random thoughts of the movie- Takes place on three planets, Tattooine rip off, Hoth rip off and an endor/naboo rip off.-Technology somehow hasn't progressed in the 30+ years since the OT.-Finn is almost useless, think of him of a less obvious jar jar binks with a slight love story attached to him to make him feel more important to the story.- Poe flat character clearly good at piloting, absent from practically everything with no explanation.-BB8: R2D2 clone although its good to see a different droid in the limelight - Rey is living on a desert planet and seems rather unhappy. (where have we seen this before) somehow can do everything and practically nothing wrong, never has there been a character in Starwars that has been so invincible.- Kylo Ren is probably the most interesting of all the new characters in the movie. Blatantly based off of Anakin but with good reason. Id have to say the best part of this movie is this character i cannot wait to see more of him.- Harrison Ford does his best performance in a long time. A lot of heavy breathing into the microphone though- Any interactions between Leia and Han Solo are cringe worthy and completely detract from the movie. After the first time it happened i found myself wishing for them not to encounter each other for the rest of the film.-Obvious death star clone-Rey: Super pilot and mechanic extraordinaire (ill give that to her she spent her life inside of machines) but knows the millennium falcon better than solo? Ridiculous. Wasn't sure if Jedi were real. 25 minutes later she reads Kylos mind and then uses Jedi mind tricks (which shes never seen anybody do) on a storm trooper. She does this and also defeats Kylo Ren in a duel with absolutely no training whatsoever. Luke trained hard and could barely lift a lightsaber out of the snow 10 feet away from him. Rey accidentally gets the same light saber out of the snow from 20 yards away while at the same time over powering Kylo to get it, again having no idea what shes doing. It took Luke 3 movies of training and he still lost to Darth Vader, she needs none to defeat the master of the knights of ren. I don't want to say it but shes sort of a \"Mary Sue\" I hope in the next film theres some sort of struggle she goes through. I am happy Star Wars finally has a female lead, this just isn't how it should have been handled.- Maz sort of cheapens the Jedi council from the prequels. She talks and says wise things as Yoda did and thus cheapens Yoda and the rest of the Jedis.- Where does Maz get the light saber? It fell into the abyss in Cloud City. \"A story for another time\" is all she says about it. Sounds like lazy plot writing. - why is captain phasma on the poster she does nothing the entire movie- get ready for close ups 50% of the movie is character face shots.The movie is not all bad though and if you're not a fan of Star Wars/ havent seen the other movies id recommend it. If you have any prior knowledge to the series particularly the original trilogy that odds are you understand the gripes i have with this film. I've seen this movie now half a dozen times, i continue to leave the theater with the feeling that JJ Abrams just wanted to make a safe \"reboot.\" If you disagree and love the movie i'm glad, at the end of the day opinions are just that.",

    "review": "  After seeing it twice, I figured I was finally ready to put The Force Awakens into review form. Taking place 30 years after the events of Return Of The Jedi, The Force Awakens shows that not much has changed since the destruction of the second death star. Before too long, characters old and new are teaming up to once again take down the bad guys. It all feels very........familiar. And that's because The Force Awakens takes a large number of story beats from the original movie, A New Hope. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It's been 10 years since the last movie and 30 since the events that precede this movie. it makes sense, then, that the movie would borrow elements from the others to bring us back into the world of Star Wars. What's more, even with all that borrowing, The Force Awakens is a great movie on it's own. The reliance on practical effects and sets give the movie some much needed weight, something the shiny, clean surfaces of the prequels did not try to do. Even better, the new characters are all fantastic. Adam Driver and John Boyega both play interesting, complex new characters (especially Driver's Kylo Ren who I enjoyed quite a bit) but it's Rey, played with fantastic wide eyes by Daisy Ridley, who steals the entire movie. She is the driving force behind the entire plot and I cannot wait to see what future movies have in store. The movie also introduces a whole host of other new characters but many of them have limited screen time so their impact is not as strongly felt. Besides all the new characters, the movie also does a fine job of bringing back it's old characters, especially Han Solo who, other than Rey, is the main protagonist in the show. The biggest complaint I have about The Force Awakens is it's insistence on borrowing plot elements but I will give it a pass this one time simply because it's looking to set up a whole new chapter of this story. Future installments will not get this same pass because they now have more incentive to make something fresh and unique after the resounding success of The Force Awakens.",

Granted, the characters 'Daisy and Finn' were played pretty decently, but I mean, it's not 1990 or 2000... why is it still edgy or groundbreaking that the leads are a woman and a black dude? Like I said, they were the only parts I found decent (and the Rebel Pilot), but what do you think this is, the South in the 1950's? Oh, and if the Rebels won and are now in control... why are they still 'Rebels?' and why is the First order not known as the Rebels? Obviously they had to try and fill some gaps, but how in the hell did Luke lose his nephew to the dark side? And to who? And what?... killing your father is no big deal, but the nephew thing... gotta go into hiding and not face this problem. And how could they think Finn was a Rebel with all his fear and lack of hope towards the First Order? Disney did it though, marketed the heck out of this thing to no end where everyone HAD to see it since they liked the ones before this. Just download this if you haven't seen it, I'm usually against that, but the media hype should be seen as false advertising. Good special effects though. (but that's obvious)",

    "review": "  Abrams and Co. had a large task. Make it fresh, but make sure that there's enough nostalgia to make people cheer (or boo, in a good way). People did both cheer and boo in the theater. This was one of my favorite theater experiences ever, right up there with 'Jurassic Park,' 'Independence Day', and 'Toy Story.' It is not perfect. Yes, the plot-line seems a little redundant: good guys sneak into the bad guys' huge base to try and blow it up, and bad guys are looking for plans/maps that the good guys potentially have. Maybe they could have brain-stormed a little more in this regard. But so what? You didn't fall in love with Episodes 4-6 because you loved how the rebels blew up the Death Star... twice. You could argue that the plot-lines are better in Episodes 1-3, but since the screenplays are weak and you dislike many of the characters (and acting), Episodes 4-6 are far superior. You love Star Wars because of the characters and story arc. This is why you'll love the next three episodes. And no, the characters are NOT the same this time around. Is Rey a little like Luke? A little. Other than that, all of the new characters are original, even Kylo Ren. Kylo chooses to wear his mask BECAUSE of Vader. Kylo is unsure of himself. Vader was one of the most confident villains in history, until good overtook evil in 'Return of the Jedi.' Plus, Kylo is only good with the dark side of the force when he fully embraces it. Vader was much, much more powerful than Kylo when comparing Episode 4 with 7. Vader would have chuckled if Finn approached him with a lightsaber. Overall, this movie perfectly blends the new with the old. I do hope the plot takes us to a place we haven't been before. Regardless, I'll stick around to watch because of Rey, Kylo, Finn, Poe, Maz, and Snoke.",

I cannot remember the last time a fully fledged blockbuster kept me so glued to the screen and enrapt with the story.

Yes the story is not a huge deviation away from the original Star Wars but I don't want a re-imagining thank you, there is still plenty in this plot to keep you waiting for the next instalment and probably to go back and re-watch this one.

Performances from all actors, Harrison Ford aside, feel hammy, twee and sometimes at odds with the brief backstories we have of these characters.

    "review": "  Imagine a world where space travel is a way of life, hyperspace is standard in every ship, jedi mind tricks, you can move objects just by thinking. Imagine the infinite possibilities of writing a story in this world.Instead, the writers chose to recycle episode 4 and 5. The same old story, even though they have infinite material at their disposal. Just playing for the popular vote, making a previously successful formula under a new label, benefiting from the sentiments of the fans to make few quick bucks. So many opportunities of writing a good story lost. The many directions a story could have gone. Even the obvious plots of intrigue and suspense remained unexplored (For instance, why does R2D2 magically comes back to life, for no reason? why not let Rey have a key left to her which brings the droid back to life??) There were certainly some high points though. Han Solo character was portrayed masterfully. It was fun to see the millennium falcon again. Generally speaking an entertaining but a very safe movie. Unfortunately, I expected a bit more.",

    "review": "  The movie the real Star Wars fans have been waiting for. The movie that helps you forget those abominations (Prequel Trilogy) existed. JJ Abrams creates the most visually stunning Star Wars film ever made by making what feels like a Greatest Hits of the Original Trilogy and a sequel to Return Of The Jedi in the same film. I personally loved the film as I didn't like the prequels due to the wooden Hayden Christensen, the awful and boring political plot, and last but not least everyone's FAVORITE Jar Jar Binks.You'll be happy to know that none of the negatives of the prequel trilogy are found in this soft reboot of Star Wars, and will also see that Han Solo was easily the most memorable character in this film. The protagonist Rey (Daisy Ridley) was an interesting character, and she did have some moments that felt very Deus Ex Machina or Mary-Sue ish, but was interesting nevertheless. Poe Damron (Oscar Issac) left a lasting impression, that bigger things were to come of the next film as the Rebels push further into battle as they attempt to thwart the evil empire. If you enjoyed the Original Trilogy, you will enjoy this film as it's easily on par with A New Hope. 4 1/2 out of 5",

    "review": "  Absolutely brilliant! So much better than I anticipated. Visually lush, but it's the pacing that separates brilliant films from the merely good or great. Daisy Ridley, Joh Boyega and Oscar Isaac give great performances, but it's the writing that gives them the opportunity to make us fall in love with Star Wars again. Sorry, George, but the writing and filming of the prequels, the first three chapters, was so posed and stilted, the sets so flat in their CGI iterations, the performances so green screen stultified, The Force Awakens is a refreshing and exhilarating return to dynamic personalities and corny throwaway jokes and references that helped make A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi such touchstones for so many fans. The tone and pacing are just brilliant, the sets so well made, the casting perfect and the writing an amazing balance of reverential and \"oh, let's not take this too seriously\". Kudos to everyone involved in the film and thank you for not allowing the story to leak out in advance of the film.",

And, like everyone who clapped in the theatre, I was super happy when I saw the old characters, and items, from parts 4, 5, and 6! And the action scenes and new characters were top notch! What I didn't love was, in my opinion, the overuse of humor. Some seemed totally out of place for what was happening. I also didn't love that some elements of the story were stories that \"should be told at another time\". I feel that's just a blatant way of saying, \"If you want to know what happened, or how that came to be, you are going to have to buy another ticket.\" And finally, I just can't understand the plot that the Dark Side has the same basic plan of attach for the THIRD time! What, failing the first two times didn't convince you? Geee whiz! But, if you just watch the movie and don't get all over analytical like I did, it's totally worth it! Sooo much better than parts 1, 2, and 3! SOOOO much better!",

What got me was how it was kind of too slow and too fast at the same time. Reams of exposition thrown into dialog that had a LOT of staring in between, instant plot as vehicle coincidences that seemed super fake, instant force mastery based on nothing, and a villain you might as well call Darth Emo. You can get any number of spoilers somewhere else, I'm not doing that, but a lot of things certainly don't add up. It's almost like a paint-by-number in it's simplistic setup for the next one which hopefully will be better.",

    "review": "  Flying in on an unbelievable amount of hype and anticipation, The Force Awakens is surprisingly able to meet and exceed the wildest expectations that fans of the series and general moviegoers could have possibly had. Its villain is genuinely unpredictable and refreshingly three-dimensional, fantastically acted by Adam Driver. Its protagonist is instantly relate-able and worthy to sit alongside the Luke Skywalkers and Obi Wan Kenobis of the Star Wars saga - an instant classic of a character. But most impressive is how the film manages to bring its old characters so seamlessly back to life, keeping them completely true to their old selves while also adding higher stakes to their story - most notably so is Han Solo, who has all the sly one-liners and cockiness of his old self while also being romantic and heartfelt when the situation is appropriate.The film delivers on every aspect a film is expected to. It's funny, often times hilarious. It's cute enough for the kids, but not so much so that the adult audiences are distracted from the story. Its plot reaches a satisfying climax and has many genuinely surprising twists along the way. What most seem to criticize about the film - that it's a \"rip off\" of the original Star Wars - is unbelievable false. Abrams was essentially rebooting the franchise, and wanted it to both be familiar and something completely new. The elements of the original trilogy that he incorporated in this film were deliberate tributes and homages. He was crafting a film for a new generation that welcomed fans of the old generation, and he did so beautifully and flawlessly. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is not only one of the very best Star Wars films, but it is a wonderfully entertaining and fantastic film in its own right - one of the very best of the year, period.",

I am a Star Wars Fan and they could have saved us all a lot of trouble, and them a lot of money, if they had introduced Rae and said: She would be a big star, she I did her level best to drag this thing into the real movie category.Mav is wonderful sorry we wasted the rest of the movie around her and then blew her up. That character needs another movie. Harrison would get his stride about half way through and then -- well we all know what happened to him!The dark side son would be a no chin whimpering imitation of a Star wars character - who thought he was a good idea? He took the helmet off and I almost left the theater. And Princes Leya??? Did she get paid to show up? Was that really her or some fans look alike Gramma who filed in? She looked fine somebody just stole her ability to even remotly act. The person sitting next to me actually said out loud \"Are you serious?\" after a few lines from her.Rea and Han Solo cannot hold a movie Iike that alone and the drone, while cute, was just not enough.Just another note here. I know you have to suspend disbelief for movies like this and it is part of the fun - BUT neither a young storm trooper nor a really young untrained girl can take up a light saber and go against an adversary who has trained for it most of his life. Some alternative talent that got them through this might have been appropriate. At least have them run and the bad guy gets his foot caught so he cannot move around giving them some inkling of a chance. Or Rea's awaking Jedi power slowed him up and makes him drop the light saber??? We are of course ignoring that DarkSon would have just removed the saber from their hand with his mind but I am good with that not happening so we can have the fight.I know - the movie made billions and people loved it and who am I to talk like this? I am part of the paying public that has seen every episode and enjoyed them with my kids and my grandkids - that's who. All in all pretty weak.  There were moments I loved but all in all I an really glad I waited and saw it at a BIG discount, and that I didnt't pay extra for 3 d.",

But I was sorely disappointed to see so many great things (you've heard it all by now) developing during the first 40 minutes and then brought to ruins when the old cast enters from the original sequel entered, followed by a rapidly thinning plot and a befuddling conclusion whereby yet another death star is destroyed by the equivalent of a couple of Chinese firecrackers. Seriously, a moon or planet turned into a weapon of unimaginable power, capable of destroying entire worlds had its shield brought down so easily? What? You'd think the \"Evil Empire\" could think of a better way to protect their assets from the pesky rebels after two previous death stars are brought down by similar methods. Blah. And what about Princess Leia's weird appearance? I found myself wondering about Carrie Fischer's personal life right in the middle of the movie. I understand a StormTrooper could suddenly develop a need to defect, but the way it was done made me think that thousands of others would eventually do the same. So much is missing from this movie. Rottentomatoes critics gave it a 93% rating and this is surprising. What was J.J. Abrams and his Co. thinking? Perhaps they were trying to appease too many different fan groups. This movie had the makings of a great turnaround story, but it fell flat on its face. The true winners are the moviemakers, toymakers and the entire Disney franchise as they cash in on this clunker. The good news is the original cast work and cgi of the first 40 minutes could bode well for a fantastic second film next year. Even so, I will temper my expectations for the next one.",

    "review": "  If you're a star wars fan... skip this one. If you're a person who claims to be a star wars fan but has only actually seen the movies(an not all of them, just the primary trilogies), then you'll love it. If you go in there expecting a great movie full of Jedi and Sith, and epic battles, you will be disappointed, unless you find a light saber wielding prince Caspian with daddy issues to be ominous and threatening. The whole thing is literally a copy of episode 4, with very little variation on that plot, except that R2 did it better, and C3PO was a far better companion to our protagonist than a fumbling bumbling failed storm trooper with a moral dilemma. Heil Disney I guess... Thanks for ruining my favorite thing in the world... Jar Jar was way better than all of this, and that's really saying something.",

(the good ones) Han became Obi one, Luke became Yoda, they had to travel to a planet to remove a shield and something like the Death Star was destroyed. There was not an ounce of originality present, it was if the writers sat down and watched 4,5 and 6 and took note of key plot developments. The force feed PC propaganda chocked me with each spoon full. The CG characters were unbelievable cartoon characters, the short orange creature was on a level of Ja Ja Binks, severely annoying (the muppets worked dammit!) and the new Emperor did not strike fear like the old. And last of my gripes is the new Darth Vader, (I forget the forgettable characters name and do not care to look it up) the new Darth Vader is a sissy! A punk! Keep that dam helmet on that geek!! Harrison Ford should be happy he's rid of the franchise, Chewy may be the only reason I watch the next one.",

At last the spirit of the original movies has returned. Not since 'Return of the Jedi' have I seen a Star Wars which felt like a Star Wars film. Not to say the prequels were terrible (which they're not), but they felt too polished. Star Wars is a movie that although is set in space with lightsabers, Jedi's, monsters and laser guns, they still felt real in a weird way. The prequels were too CGI driven... 'The Force Awakens' feels like something you can reach out and touch, similar to the original trilogy. Story wise, yes there are big similarities to 'A New Hope', but that doesn't take away the amazing effort that JJ Abrams did to give the movie that special touch. Star Wars is back in top form, and I can't wait to see what happens next in Episode VIII.",

The acting is great as we have some fresh blood by the likes of John Boyega (Finn) and Daisy Ridley (Rey) and not to mention Adam Driver, they did a great job on playing their characters and actually made us care about them, unlike the prequels. Of course Harrison Ford gives a great performance as a mature and wise Han Solo. The special effects are completely out of the charts, it's no surprise it got nominated in the Oscars on that department, and the story is great, though I found starkiller base completely unnecessary. The film is well written and directed and beautifully shot, props to J.J Abrams and his crew. Star Wars the Force Awakens is a great movie that recalls the sagas glory while having a new formula and fresh blood. It's worth seeing on any time of the day and that is why I give it an A",

    "review": "  So as far as hype goes, Star Wars: The Force Awakens really takes all the cake and credit, and so it should, considering the hype and fan base it has been rolling with for well over 30 years. With its name being recognized world wide as a creative masterpiece into the futuristic world of Sci-Fi and even benefiting science in many ways by fueling ideas and technologies which could in fact appear in a very near future of our own and not so far far away. But is the latest Star Wars movie really all its hyped up to be? Does it fit with how you'd imagine a present day Star Wars film to be? Does it engage and applaud its predecessors? Does it fill you with excitement?For me I found, not really. Don't get me wrong here, I'm a Star Wars fan, the movie was great! It had great moments with figures like Maz Kanata and even bringing back Han, Leia & Luke to add a strong backbone and familiarity to the movie as well as increase its potency and flow. Some of the planets showcased for example the Resistance based planet of D'Qar with its outer asteroid ring showed the beauty of Star Wars that I loved. Yet after all this hype I've seen the movie receive, I couldn't quite help but feel that my expectations hadn't quite been met, it lacked so much that a true Star Wars film imbued, and no I'm not talking about Jar-Jar Binks. As a child, like most, I grew up watching it and living with it and even experiencing with it the changes and excitement it brought to our senses and to the world. It brought ideas and creation, it in total brought the future to us. Star Wars always had a knack for being far far, but in fact not so very far away. The future they showcased seemed quite believably close indeed, with an exception of force abilities, but then again who knows what the future might hold in that retrospect. With the new movie i felt like it didn't quite capture this at all, with the director choosing to lower the use of CGI and incorporate more realistic stunts and scenery, which i felt gave the movie a more mundane appearance to its predecessors that George Lucas brought to life. It lacked the visuals in which Star Wars used to bring with city gargantuan planets like Coruscant, seeing only remakes of old planets like Tatooine (Jakku), Hoth and the rebels base on D'Qar - Which in turn just looked like a casual country side in England. If Jakku wasn't so similar to Tatooine I would have been impressed, but then it does make sense that Tatooine isn't the only desert planet amongst so many worlds. Might I add that the world at the end was literally our own, yes Iceland got an appearance in our 'futuristic' films with no incorporation of otherworldly creatures or scenery flying past, apart from the Millennium Falcon that is, to give it a Star Wars nostalgia, instead they just cropped a scene from right out of National Geographic's Channel and oddly lacked a voice over by David Attenborough. It gave an impression that the directors lacked new material, and in turn decided to reproduce many things in this movie, one including the large similarities between A New Hope's plot and scripts entirety, not just planets. Many unanswered questions about the might of the Rebel Alliance at the end of Return Of the Jedi, being so powerful and full of capitol ships, with thousands of worlds under their belt and space combat, now being reduced to smaller planet bases, and even less so after the Death Star: Mark III weapon attack. Will the Empire ever learn??The carefree use of Supreme Lord Snoke's name became cringe worthy as the film progressed, using his name frequently throughout, like uttering such words had no consequence to anyone. He wasn't the 'New Emperor shrouded in looming shadow', he was 'SNOKE the well known leader of the First Order'. There was no secrecy, no hidden agenda's, no scary mystery shrouding this new Sith-like figurehead that the late Palpatine had had whom managed to infiltrate the senate amongst other things. Because one thing I'd learnt from practitioners of the Dark Side, is that they like to remain hidden. Even more so the mystery was shattered when they outright showed him in his entirety, face, voice, convictions and all.New characters like Rey, Poe Dameron & Maz Kanata really brought a shine to the new generation of Star Wars and the movie, I must say. Rey literally, with her pleasant acting was a pleasing little ray of sunshine that made you feel like you really wanted to care for her, like you were there in the movie with her. She also showed small psychical appearances to a young Anakin Skywalker from The Phantom Menace, it only gives you ideas of where they are going with her character. Poe with his die hard skills and charming antics that linked a similar resemblance to a young Luke Skywalker with features of Han Solo. Making you wonder if he has any perception of the force with his skills, but probably not considering he fits the bill of the scoundrel. And of course Maz Kanata with her wise mentality and feel like that of a female version of Grand Master Yoda, you could feel the knowledge about her. Disappointment struck to learn that many scenes of Maz Kanata, one in particular showing her using the force to bring down rubble over Storm Troopers, were removed before the movies screen debut, which would have only improved the movies core, but would have potentially brought up questions truthfully as to why she couldn't train Rey in her knowledge as she knew she was force sensitive.Characters like Finn, Kylo Ren, Captain Phasma & even General Hux really let down the movie in more ways than one, whether it was due to the writers or directors their characters really lacked on screen and gave the movie a hindrance more than anything.Finn the young Storm Trooper whom as a child was taken into the First Order displayed too many traits of that of a typical street kid or smuggler, not something you'd expect from a brain washed Storm Trooper trained and conformed into a rigorous society of order and dominance at such a young age where most of his teachings from before being taken would have been wiped clean, yet looking at Captain Phasma that probably explains it.Kylo Ren, the mysterious yet not so mysterious dark padawan and son of Han and Leia Solo who when angry manages to destroy everything around him in anger fits, which for a part was humorous and amusing, was known from the get go, his evil antagonist role had no mystery or backbone to stand up with. His boyish and awkward acting skills really didn't do the character much justice. (And people complained about Hayden Christensen acting as Anakin!?) But I must applaud that he did portray conflict in his mind quite okay. Showing no remorse with the murder of his father Han Solo at his hand gave his character more build and further into the ending battle with him, Finn and Rey finally gave his character the justice it deserved, scarring his face at the end Rey set us up with a meaner potential Sith for Episodes 8 and 9.Captain Phasma was just the saddest of them all, whether it was the directors placements of her character or to her lack of lines in the movie her character had no purpose accept to stand in the background looking shiny and being partly responsible for destroying her own planetary base for the Resistance. Was I not the only one who was expecting her to be a Boba/Jango Fett like character that had a large kill record? She didn't quite fit the bill of bad ass in my opinion, which you'd certainly expect from someone who is classed with the grand title of Captain amongst fellow Storm Troopers. She showed no strength or skill, being just a figurehead that walks around with a gun 24/7 that might I add am under the impression is made of plastic, doesn't seem to have any ammo and is just for show. She has no real purpose other than to tell others to keep their helmets on and fire their weapons. Even the mysterious Storm Trooper that Finn confronted at Maz Kanata's Castle who countered his light saber had more pizzazz!And lastly the young General Hux who's appearance and age didn't quite sit right with me, making me think that maybe all the older more wise Generals and Imperialists were killed back on the Death Star at the Battle of Endor some 30 years beforehand. But he did have skill enough to escape the planet with Kylo's wounded body before explosion, so we have to give him props for that right??I would have loved if they incorporated scenes from The Battle of Jakku, starting instead the movie with the war between the remnants of the Empire and the Rebel Alliance 29 years ago, showcasing the calamities and losses in which both sides received. The idea of seeing Star Destroyers drop out of the sky and large scale planetary combat would have been delicious icing on a beautiful cake and taken me back to the Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith days.I'm hoping the eighth installment of the Star Wars franchise will improve, with rumors speculating that it will be a much darker film. Slightly worrying me to the point that the script could mirror The Empire Strikes Back, but honestly I just want to see more 'bad assery', space battles with capitol ships and most certainly more Jedi's. And certainly a less predictable script. With a new director helming this movie let us hope his understanding of the Star Wars Galaxy is much more in-depth than the last!",

Even though it's been years I remember being entertained more by the prequels, than with the Force Awakens.It was predictable and the fast pace didn't allow me to soak it in. I've seen more entertaining movies than this.People will probably be surprised at this, but I just wasn't impressed. It was still a good movie, but I didn't feel like a kid again. I mean, I liked Avatar better.Now it could have been my expectations were high, and the hype was a bit high with this movie...but seriously this is Star Wars.Now, they could have used this movie to set the stage for the rest of the series. I do feel the next installments will be better. But as the first entry, I just didn't feel it.",

It's not a perfect movie, but I can look past that, because I really loved meeting all the great new characters. The ONLY major nitpick is one of the subplots was underdeveloped, so when a major, significant moment happened, it fell flat for me.

    "review": "  WHAT I LIKED: A film with so much hype rarely lives up to expectations - but the 'The Force Awakens' exceeds them all. It's just truly amazing. Watch brilliant characters in a film that credits the originals whilst moving forward in the most exciting way possible. We've never seen a film that encompasses so much in terms of tone and emotion, that still pulls it off with such continuity and sensitivity. You can really tell everything was beautifully crafted by every hand in it's making; 'Episode 7' is beautifully acted, directed, scored and shot to the most incredible standard. But there's more to this than all those achievements, Abrams pulls off a movie that genuinely makes you feel every emotion. It makes you laugh, cry and despair, gives you chills and makes you grin from ear to ear. And what's more, it FEELS like Star Wars (which is sadly why it's getting the criticism it is.) The visual cues, the score, it all harks back to a long time ago in a galaxy far away. Everything about this, the new characters and the old, is everything I wanted it to be and so much more more. Whether you're a Star Wars fan, or not - this is the must see movie of 2015.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: The odd clunky scenes are there, and whilst I don't agree it was too formulaic, the Starkiller ending is a little bit of a rip off of 'Episode 4.'VERDICT: History is made. 'The Force Awakens' is a spine-tinglingly beautiful piece of film that does so much so sensitively. Star Wars is back, crowning Abrams as the new king of film.",

    "review": "  Star Wars Episode IV the remake: best way to describe this. 80% of this movie is a copy and paste of the original trilogy's first film the New Hope.There are good things with this film; the intro and very end scene are suspenseful with nice payoff: but I feel that they stand out because of their originality. Had the film gone that route: to make clearly original scenes and story, it could stand on its own: this film does have 5 star material. But as I said, overall it's a copy and paste of Episode IV.The main reason why I think this is because of the appearance and clothing along with their role in the story. Rey the hero has Luke's desert-peasant attire, Ren the villain is trying WAY to hard to be a new Vader, Hux the general is Tarkin. These characters look almost identical in many ways.Even the story and settings are painfully obvious; the desert planet, the snow planet, the Deathier Star. The x wings bombing the Death Star, the Yoda teachings of the force, the bar scene, the Falcon shooting about 2 Tie Fighters: all clearly present.The characters I will remember are Snoke (very big and intimidating while still old and frail), Maz, BB 8 and Phasma. But again; Emperor, Yoda (both old and short too!), R2D2 and Boba Fett (cold mysterious masked badass that fans will adore despite doing jack shit in the story).But I will say this; who the hell is FN-2199? 'That guy that shouts \"traitor!\"' just shows up with a psudo-lightsaber and fights Finn. I want to see more of this dude. Also some of the new aliens are entertaining to look at.But of course there's more things to talk about;Kylo Ren had some big shoes to fill; considering everyone knows that he's this film's Darth Vader. But his execution is that of Anakin Skywalker; in that it fails. His mask and lightsaber are okay but he clearly shares Anakin's tantrums and wimpiness; making him more of an angsty teen than a scary supervillain. He wasn't as terrible as Hayden Christensen, but the similarities exist. Combine this with the 'daddy issue plot' stolen from IV and being a Vader fanboy, and it makes things worse.Also there are times where the film is either rushed or elements of the film have no buildup; Death Star 3.0 and the planets it destroyed are good examples of this; if I knew about these things I would be preparing myself for the fireworks instead of having them gloss over so quickly.I have no idea who Rey is as a character; in that the film keeps on changing her personality. This isn't character evolution; it's sloppy inconsistency. She starts out as a poor hardworking badass genius, and then is suddenly constantly panicking like a headless chicken, then she becomes Luke. If she evolved, she would still show the traits of her past self, but that is never implied.Han Solo and his sidekick Chewie played their roles fine, afterall they are directly relevant to the backbone of this plot. And it made sense to have Luke have such importance in the plot. However everyone else felt shoehorned in; oh hi Ackbar! Hey R2D2, want to see your replacement?Finn was a breath of fresh air: his character was unique for his normalcy and flaws and his despair in his introduction was very emotional, but he was quite annoying at times. Also the sudden implied romance between him and Rey didn't feel subtitle. Infact the comedy of the film was quite hit or miss, some moments felt so stupid and hammy that they broke the flow of the film sometimes. Though you did have good things as well; like BB's lighter thumbsup.I would say that while this film was entertaining, it was a remake more than it was a sequel. The film was too self conflicted in what it really wanted to be: something new or something stuck in the past.",

    "review": "  ???? 1/2T�htien Sota -tarinana mielenkiintoinen, joskin lainaa aivan selv�sti alkuper�isest� trilogiasta, hiukan liikaakin. esim. autiomaaplaneetta Tatoiine -> Jakku; Empire-Rebellion -> First Order-Resistance; Emperor-Vader -> Snoke-Ren; Vader-Luke -> Solo-Ren; ja lopputaistelu on Death Star- klooni. Onhan t�ss� kloonattu muutenkin aika hurjasti originaalista trilogiasta, jo ihan se idea ett� droidi tuo kartan p��henkil�lle (ekassa leffassahan R2-D2 vie Kuolont�hden kartan Leia Organalle) ja Luke muuten my�s etsii erakkona el�v�� Obi-Wan Kenobia kuten Rey t�ss� uudessa leffassa erakkona el�v�� Lukea. Mutta tosiaan, good artists copy, great artists steal...Lavasteet, planeetat ja maisemat ovat onnistuneita, musiikin vaisuus yll�tti (onhan kuitenkin John Williams kyseess�). Erikoisefektit ovat hienoja yleisesti ottaen, mik� toki oli odotettavissa, olivathan Abramsin Star Trek-leffatkin aivan ensiluokkaisia niilt� osin. Leffana ihan j�nn�, ei pitk�veteinen, tarina etenee tasaisesti.Plussaa olivat my�s Han Solo salakuljettajana, Chewbacca, monstereita, palkkionmets�st�ji�, t�m�puoli j��nyt jopa hiukan liian v�h�lle alkuper�isess� trilogiassa (paitsi Imperiumin vastaiskussa toki). Idea tosi lupaava ja legendaariset hahmot palaavat ja t�m� viritt�� suuria odotuksia t�htien sota fanissa. Mutta.. sitten kauhea j�rkytys ja pettymys, ett� t�m� ei toteudukaan, koskaan. Ilke� yht�kkinen temppu leffan tekij�ilt�, menem�tt� tarkemmin yksityiskohtiin. Toki luova oikeus taiteilijoilla mutta silti.Henkil�t, joita toki paljon, j��v�t hiukan pinnallisiksi. Esim. Solo ja Leia, jotka sent��n antavat helpoimmalla tavalla leffan tekij�ille emotionaalisen syvyyden tunnun mahdollisuutta. Monesti ihmetteli, mist� t�llainen tyyppi on tullut? Ei n�it� kerrota katsojalle. N�it� henkil�it� on k�sitelty Extended Universumin kirjallisuudessa, mutta ei voida olettaa joka katsojan tuntevan ko. legendariumia. Prinsessa Leia n�ytt�� liian monessa kohtauksessa ilmeett�m�lt�. First Orderin �ij�t vain kornit ja hassut, siin� miss� vaikkapa Terence Fischerin esitt�m� Tarkin oli originaalin trilogian 1. leffassa aivan uniikki hahmo. T�ss� sellaisia hiukan pahveja �iji� vaahtoaa.Leffojen j�lkeen on kehittynyt kirjallisuuteen ns. expanded universe / laajennettu maailmankaikkeus, jossa henkil�iden tarinat ovat kehittyneet pitk�lle. Jaina, Han Solon ja Prinsessa Leian tyt�r oli Jedi, leffassa Kylon kanssa samanik�isest� Reyst� tulee my�s Jedi. Olisiko Rey siis Luken tyt�r.. ?Jedihommat onnistuneet muuten, mutta jokin tuossa Reyn Jedi-hommassa h�iritsee. Toki jonkin intuition piikkiin voi t�ss� kohden panna aika paljon; eli miten Rey osaa tehd� jotain Jedi Mind Trickej� ilman koulutusta ja voittaa koulutetun Sithin? Jediytt� olisi voinut koittaa ehti� hiukan enemm�n sivuamaan dialogissa, jotta avautuisi asiaa tiet�m�tt�mille katsojille. Tosin osasihan Lukekin posauttaa protonitorpedon ilman t�ht�ystietokonetta metrin mittaisesta ilmastointiluukusta sis�lle satojen kilometrien tuntinopeudella ajomoottoreilla kapeassa huoltov�yl�ss� lent�v�ss� X-Wing h�vitt�j�ss��n, Vaderin & co. samaan aikaan hengitt�ess� niskaan, melkein lonkalta tuhoten Kuolont�hden, ilman mink��nlaista koulutusta. Kylo Ren on jotenkin lapsipuolimaisen avuton ja kolhon oloinen, mik� v�h�n h�iritsi, tosin mestarinsahan totesi leffassa ett� h�n ei ole viel� \"Dark Jedi\" eli koulutus on viel� kesken. (Lukehan oli Imperiumin vastaiskussa ihan avuton l�htiess��n kohtaamaan Vaderia kesken koulutuksen ja koko homma meni ihan m�nk��n - p��tyi roikkumaan p�� yl�salaisin Bespinin pilvikerroksiin ilman toista k�tt��n, henkisesti traumatisoituneena) Reyt� ajatellen voihan olla, ett� is�papan valomiekan (jolla yll�tt�v�n voimakas efekti Reyhin) k�ytt�minen antaa lis�kykyj�, jos kyse Luken tytt�rest� - muistattehan, ett� t�m� odotti kadonneita �iti� ja is��ns�. Luke Skywalkerkin tulee kuvaan lopussa, ahavoituneena. Ihan hyv�, ettei puhu mit��n, saa fani t�ytt�� tuskaisen kasvojen ilmeen Dark Empiren ja muiden legendaaristen tarinoiden muistoilla. Jedihomma, vaikka hiukan horjuukin, silti toimii, vaikkei mit��n leffassa mainittua jeditemppeli� varsinaisesti esitell�k��n. ps. t�m� Luken tuskainen ilmekin selittyisi, jos Rey olisi tyt�r. Saapas n�hd� miten asia on, sitten joskus jatko-osassa VIII. Kivasti n�kyi n�it� aiemmista leffoista tuttuja juttuja jotka Star Wars fani tunnistaa:Tatoiinen cantinaa muistuttava erilaisine galaksia asuttavine olioineen (jopa monikulttuurinen Cantina-B�ndi l�ytyy soittamasta!); \"Bantha\"-laumat laiduntamassa hiekkadyyneill�; Romunker��j�-\"Jawat\"; Jedien paluu ja muutenkin uskollisesti toteutettu; Millenium Falconin \"vanha romu yll�tt��\"-meininki; Amiraali Ackbar (se joka sanoo Jedin Paluussa \"It's a trap!\"); Star Destroyerit ja AT-AT romut autiomaassa Imperiumin j�ljilt�, joitakin mainitakseni. Ei Abrams minusta liikaa panosta aiempaan ja liehittele faneja (ajatelkaa vain Jar Jar Binksi�), vaan t�t� voi pit�� sopivana \"kunnianosoituksena\" Star Wars-trilogialle (sille oikealle ja ainoalle). Solon tarina olisi voitu hienommin k�sitell� t�ss� kyll�, ja se kirpaisi tosiaan ik�v�sti, mutta ei siit� nyt oikein miinusta voi antaa, kun se on kerran Lucasin hyv�ksym� \"Virallinen totuus\".Ihan hieno leffa, ja ehdottomasti parempi kuin Lucasin prequel leffat, joskaan ei ihan miss��n tapauksessa eeppinen ole kuitenkaan. Tie Fightereista tulee se viimeinen plussa, joka kohottaa t�m�n sellaiselle tasolle, ett� voin sanoa tykk��v�ni leffasta.

    "review": "  I've now seen Star Wars: The Force Awakens twice. I have to admit that I, a Star Wars fan since 1977, felt a bit let down after my first viewing. It was a very good movie, but I wasn't sure if it was a good _Star Wars_ movie. I felt much more positive after the second viewing, when I tried harder to just experience the film instead of analyzing it for its Star Wars-ness. It's not perfect, but I think the franchise is moving in a new and exciting direction.The negatives: the film is just a bit too long. The climactic battle drags on longer than it needs to. The plot is a bit too reminiscent of the first Star Wars. The film is full of dialogue, music, and images that evoke the first film. It's fun in a nostalgic sort of way, but becomes a bit distracting and overdone. Finally, the astrophysics of the movie don't add up. I know this is space fantasy, not science fiction, but planets seem to be too close together and travelling between them seems to take no time at all. Hyperspace travel in Star Wars has always been inconsistently presented, but The Force Awakens takes it to a new level of improbability.The positives: the cast is fantastic. It was great to see the familiar faces blending with new and interesting characters. Although the music and the visuals sometimes harken back too much to the original films, there are still many moments that are fresh, yet still feel like Star Wars. The special effects are astounding. Finally, this movie is just _fun_.Star Wars has been giving me fun for almost 40 years, and it looks like the fun is going to continue for at least a few years more. Impressive! Most impressive!",

Cast was questionable at times, and performances far from plausible (leaning towards bad). Nevertheless, it was fun to watch despite all its flaws, probably just a nostalgic kind of joy :-)",

Why do you mimic everything from the old trilogy???4) Mimic's the classic bar scene but just make it worse?5) Bad guy Kylo Ren was super cool.... until he took off his helmet. From then on he was a whiny Adrian Brody but with a bigger nose. Temper tantrums then loses to a Storm trooper?? Good movies need a worthy adversary, everyone knows that.The writers of this movie need to be thrown in movie writing jail for copying other Star Wars movies.

In the wake of the disappearance of Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi Knight, two rival factions, the Resistance and the First Order, chase after a driod that contains a map to Skywalker's secret location. The plot is quite similar to that of the first Star Wars; changing out the Death Star plans for a map, Darth Vader for Kylo Ren, and a na�ve farm boy for a scavenger. Yet it still has its own style and tone that both homages the original trilogy and does its own thing. Additionally, newcomer Daisy Ridley has great screen presence and gives a strong performance. Also, the special effects are incredibly well-done, as are the sets and costumes. With Star Wars: The Force Awakens, J.J. Abrams has returned the series back to its roots.",

    "review": "  This could have gone so badly wrong. After making such a huge success of reclaiming the characters of Star Trek (along with the complexity of adding in Spock Prime), Abrahms was probably less daunted by reigniting the ensemble cast than how to move on the look of the Star Wars universe without lampooning it in the same way the prequels had. Anyone who reads the concept art book of the Force Awakens will be able to see the fine levels of what might have been, much of which feels familiar but could have quickly gotten out of control. On that basis, the film is closely aligned to the spirit of the original trilogy - close on story - but gets over the establishment of characters and egos in the first film of the new trio. This was an important aspect in the success of the film - unmasking Kylo Ren in the first film and establishing the vulnerability in each characters back pocket. Solo, Leia, Luke, Chewbacca - all perfectly placed and riffing on their original sensibilities. Rey and Finn well matched and strongly diversified from the original cast in tone, banter and acting ability. This was a strong showing from Disney and Abrahms and relights the flame after it was sourly put out by the prequel era. The real world effects and seamless blending of technologies need to produce such a visual spectacle earn it the 5 star treatment and put J.J. into the stratosphere as the successor to Lucas and Spielberg in the craft of big budget story telling for the masses.

    "review": "  O filme realmente � bem interesante: destaque para a aten��o dada �s cenas (efeitos especiais, som, cenas de a��o, etc.) e �s atua��es, que realmente foram boas, especialmente as de Daisy Ridley e John Boyega, os dois novos protagonistas, Rey e Finn, e a do Adam Driver, o Kylo Ren. Contudo, para mim, pecou em um �nico aspecto: as motiva��es de dois personagens, que considero muito importantes para todo o enredo. Achei muito superficiais e il�gicas as motiva��es de Kylo Ren, para aderir ao lado negro, bem como as de Luke para se ixolar. De um lado um vil�o que � uma crian�a mimada e que � incapaz de entender as motiva��es de Darth Vader, e do outro um grande mito, um her�i, que se espelha em seu primeiro mestre (Obi Wan Kenobi) ao se ixolar, mas que n�o o faz por raz�es realmente importantes e fortes. Obi Wan se ixola para proteger o pr�prio Luke e a princesa Leia de Darth Vader, assim como, podemos at� dizer, pelo remorso de que seu discipulo tenha acabado com toda a ordem jedi. Luke o faz porque seu sobrinho destruiu o ressurgimento da ordem jedi, o que at� parece um pouco com uma das raz�es de Obi Wan, mas a diferen�a est� em como � apresentado no decorrer do filme esse fato. Parece que Luke � muito, mas muito froxo. Obi Wan ao menos tenta deter o que Anaquim est� fazendo, o que fica claro logo no espis�dio I (fica claro que Obi Wan se opoz e tentou deter o que estava ocorrendo, n�o diz como ele se op�e, mas fica evidente que ele tentou lutar), e al�m disso ele n�o desiste simplesmente, sua reclus�o est� fundamentada na esperan�a de que Luke se tornar� o jedi que vencer� aos sits (o que tamb�m fica claro em seu reencontro com Luke, j� que fica no mesmo planeta em que o rapaz est�). Luke, do modo como � abordado no epis�dio VII, parece simplesmente ter abandonado todo mundo porque ficou chatiadinho com o que o sobrinho fez. Nesse segundo caso, ent�o, o problema n�o est� tanto na motiva��o, mas na forma como ela � transmitida. Espero que Luke o tenha feito aguardando o momento certo e n�o somente por ter ficado deprimido. E sim estou dando uma avalia��o de 7.5 de 10 s� por isso, pois para mim n�o existe nada mais importante num filme do que a hist�ria, ainda mais quando s�o aspectos relacionados a dois personagens t�o importantes para a trama.",

It was confident, and he was able to successfully create a film that stands as a great film on its own, while also paying homage to the Star Wars films that came before it. Now aside from the cinematography which was quite top-notch, nothing else was really that outstanding. I personally didn't find the film very funny, but at least it did have a light-hearted tone and wasn't completely melodramatic like the prequels, the acting was good but not amazing, the plot was good but seemed too similar to A New Hope and was therefore not really unique, the effects were good aside from the big alien bad guy (which I felt was the least realistic and worst part of the film), and so forth. So yes, I very much enjoyed the film, and it's perhaps even the most entertaining film of the entire saga, and probably the one with the best cinematography, but the fact that none of it was incredible can't let me give the film anything higher than an 8/10.",

    "review": "  **SPOILERS**To begin, I am a fan of the original series. Big time. I grew up with those movies. Great story telling with purpose. I was hesitant to see TFA, but went in with a clear opinion. I mean it couldn't have been worse than the recent prequels, could it? Well, the first 20 minutes had some promise, the actors were excellent, the effects were decent, but the rest of the movie? Simply put, when I left, the theatre I was angry and ranted on the way to the car(waited til I was outside - away from people). The movie lacked soul.I'm just going to rant in paragraph points...Another Death Star - guess the rebels didn't bother to keep tabs on the Empire, they just keep building them. Oh yes, and like the other DS this one could be blown up with X-wings, even easier this time. High five everyone, we did the same thing we've seen in the other movies.Rebels - somehow they went from freeing the Galaxy to hiding on a planet again, while, somehow everyone let the Empire build itself back up to the army it was before.Han Solo and Chewie - though nice to see, why are they smuggling again? Han had a child with Leia, so clearly they had a life for a while. When Han needed \"a break\", did Chewie just sit in a closet to wait for them to resume the life of smuggling they left all those years ago? Chewie never met anyone? Non-sense.Main Villian - somehow, he got his hands on Vaders burned helmet after Luke performed the funeral ritual decades before he was even born. So...who was able to find the Vader helmet in the ashes and why? Anyhoo, so the main villian is Han and Leia's child. Not surprised. The movie says he was under the tutoring of Luke (who was now a master Jedi), but like Vader was turned to the dark side. You mean to tell me, Luke couldn't sense this happening? AND even if he couldn't sense it, wouldn't he be extra paranoid given the history of his own father? Vader wanna be threw two tantrums in the movie, which looked ridiculous. The 2nd tantrum, he was beating up a room, and in the hallway some storm troopers (who were on patrol - to protect the building, you know like their job). Not knowing who or what was going on in the room ahead, one taps the other to walk away from...the noise. Made no sense. Makes me sick to talk about the rest, but here we go. So they show (Vader wanna be) stopping a laser blast with the force early in the movie, but later he has difficulty fighting Quinn and the girl. Neither of them were fighters (heck Quinn was the janitor). Instead of using the force to push them both off the cliff or crush them with some trees, they get away. Oh wait! Sorry Quinn gets stabbed in the spine with the sabre. But don't worry...it was only a light sabre, we see later, he's going to be fine. What else? Oh the (Vader wanna be) wears a respirator type mask (like Vader) most of the movie, but not for health reasons...maybe just for fun? Boring....character.....So later in the movie Han confronts his son on a skinny bridge with no railings, and (Vader wanna be) kills him. I saw Han fall of the bridge dead, Chewie screams, and I just sat in the theatre not giving a crap.C3PO - has a brief appearance, where for laughs I guess, he says to Han Solo. \"You might not remember me because of my one red arm, and then reminds Han of who he is. I guess Han has a poor memory or something. Purely tossed in their for a laugh , as I heard some chuckling behind me. WTF?R2D2 - supposedly powered himself off for decades because Luke vanished. No comment...ridiculous.Map to Luke - The rebels find the pieces to complete the map to Luke, and for the morons, they show the maps coming together like puzzle pieces. I did not understand the straight yellow lines drawn on the space map. Is that how space travel works? Forget the girls name.... (lead character). I liked her charisma and acting, but the character itself was lame. She went from not knowing how to fly a ship to flying like an expert when some tie-fighters show up. She later finds Luke's old sabre in the basement of a saloon. Not sure what it was doing there, and don't care. Lame. Also, she keeps going on about getting back home to wait for her parents. I have news for her...THEY LEFT YOU WHEN YOU WERE A KID!! YOU ARE NOW A TEENAGER, THEY AREN\"T COMING BACK!!!!End of movie - The girl (main character) arrives at the point on the map where Luke now resides. Instead of meeting her ship (because he should have known she was coming, Force or no Force (hard to miss a ship flying your way, when you live on an island). Nope, instead he's standing on a cliff, his back to the girl with a hooded cloak on. When she approaches him, he turns, almost surprised and then stares at the sabre she holds out to him for what seemed like 15 minutes, just her holding it and him staring at it. You mean, a Master Jedi could'nt have built another sabre in that time? Did it really mean that much to him? And....roll end credits....and begin my hot rage.I will not be seeing the other movies. This was a pure marketing machine, which sucked people in to see piece of garbage. When all was said and done, there was nothing new, no characters I cared for (go ahead, kill them all), no thrills, no new revelations, no new story arcs, no suspense. Yep, it was another rehash, almost a remake attempt. Sucked so bad. I'm sticking with the original three as the entire story. It was solid. Nuff said.",

The actors really did do a phenomenal job and it wasn't overly animated. It brought SW back to it's original look in my opinion.

    "review": "  JJ has done a fantastic job with the force awakens. It's as near to the greats as we're going to get. After counting down the days to this film for years I'm relieved I wasn't disappointed. For me The force awakens ranks a very worthy 3rd place behind hope in 1st followed by empire.For the first time since the originals I genuinely felt I was watching a true Star Wars movie. It was all good fun, a great adventure, with both despair and hope reigning side by side. Force Awakens has some truly memorable and classic Star Wars moments.Visuals were stunning, successfully merging new CGI with practical old school effects creating a beautiful piece of art.At its heart the force awakens is a simple story about our new characters who come together to go on an epic journey which allows us to catch up with our beloved Star Wars legends.While a great film it wasn't without its flaws. But the difference here, compared to the prequels, is that it's flaws weren't game changes; they didn't ruin the film. Namely the biggest flaw for me was the rehashing of plots and elements from the old films. The mysteries it introduced, while fun and wet our appetite for future films, meant the film lacked (in places) meaning and context.",

    "review": "  Excitement is too small of a word to sum up the level of enthusiasme this movie was anticipated for, and it delivered with flying colours. The Force Awakens is not only a good Star Wars movie, it is a good movie period. The characters are very likable especially Daisy Ridley's character Rey. The humor is very well placed and absolutely brilliant, it's probably the funniest Star Wars movie without it lessening the tension from the more dramatic moments, the return to practical effects adds a layer of authenticity which unfortunately was forgotten in this age of CGI and digital effects, while some may criticise the derivative story or it's simplicity, i say that Star Wars was so compeling to a great number of people because it's so easy to follow do i regret the way too familiar plotline YES, does it ruin the movie completely ABSOLUTELY NOT. Astonishing performances, thrilling action sequences, tense dramatic moments, interesting old characters, nostalgic old characters, Star Wars The Force Awakens hits on every level and it brought the magic of the saga into the silver screen once more.",

    "review": "  4.5/5 Stars. Let's be honest - this was an impossible task thrust on J.J. Abrams. Revive a franchise who's last 3 films made a lot of people very angry and do it without input from the original creator while also setting up a new trilogy that also pays homage to the original trilogy. Most director's would turn it down and he did initially. Thank God he changed his mind. Many will argue that the plot is too familiar to the original Star Wars. But why shouldn't it be? This isn't so much a formulaic plot as much as it is proof that there's a formula that works. Daisy Ridley and Harrison Ford shine as new and old heroes respectively as well as Carrie Fisher and Peter Mayhew who turn in their best performances for Leia and Chewbacca. The way Luke is handled in this episode is perfect. We've followed his journey as the hero already so seeing in the capacity is a breath of fresh air. While not always given the best dialogue, John Boyega is a welcome addition to the roster as Stormtrooper-turned-hero, Finn. The real standout of the film is still the powerful, moving score by John Williams. I could go on and on about the stunning visuals and the rest of the cast works well with one notable exception which seems to have fans split right down the middle - new villain Kylo Ren played by Adam Driver. I've never seen Driver in anything prior to this but went in with an open mind. The result? When the mask is on, we get an interesting villain shrouded in mystery - the key component that made Darth Vader so intimidating and fun to watch in the originals. However, this intrigue is shattered as soon as the mask is removed to reveal a long-haired pretty boy/spoiled brat with a temper. Now I understand why the mask was removed when it was to give us the battle of wills between Rey and Ren but here's my change: Kylo Ren should have remained unmasked until THAT scene (you know the one if you've seen the film). This would have also been the perfect moment to reveal Ren's history instead of a throw away line earlier in the film (You wouldn't want to learn Vader was Luke's father from a stormtrooper). This scene was also when Driver seemed to really bring nuance to the role, but by that point I was so removed from the character that the performance fell flat in comparison with the other actor in the scene. That's my one big complaint and that's about it. Others will argue that the third act is full of plot holes but they're forgetting one thing: this is the first of three new films. We don't know everything nor should we. How does Phasma play into the larger story? Who is Rey? What about the other Knights of Ren? For me the biggest looming question is who was the old man in the beginning (played by Max von Sydow) who knew Ren, his family history and Leia as a princess (\"to me she's royalty\")? I'm sure all will be revealed in Episodes VIII and IX and it's more exciting to wait and speculate rather than be given quick and easy answers. So is this a perfect film? Not by a long shot. But it's the best we could've hoped for given every requirement Disney and Abrams had to meet. And now we wait in anticipation for May 2017 for the story to continue in a galaxy far far away...",

    "review": "  I'll be the first to admit, I'm not a huge Star Wars fans. I liked the original 3 films, but I wasn't crazy about any of them. I hated the new trilogy, but only because they were awful movies, not because they tarnished a great legacy, since I didn't care enough about Episodes IV-VI to get offended. As a result, I went into this film simply hoping to be entertained, and I was, very much so in fact. It's unfortunately true what many have said about it being rather derivative, and existing as more of a homage to the original movie than as its own entity. The plot is over-familiar, the new villains aren't particularly interesting, and some of the writing stinks of Lucas circa 1999. There were a handful of things that didn't make a lot of sense, and while in the original trilogy the Stormtroopers were famously hopeless at shooting accurately, in this film they're also completely incapable of hiding from opposing gunfire.But with all that said, it's a notable improvement on the prequel trilogy. The acting is better, as are the special effects, and the action scenes are genuinely exciting, definitely the highlights of the film. It may include one too many nods to the older movies, but it's clear that the people who made it have a deep respect for the films that came before, and have done their damndest to honour them. It's not a masterpiece, but if you're just looking to have fun, it's well worth the price of admission.",

    "review": "  The Force Jumps the SharkJJ Abrams is a great action director, but his new super mega hyped film is a crashing disappointment and is downright stupid throughout. So much praise has been heaped on this film, it is hard to take a shot at it, but here goes.No one can doubt that this film looks great, is wonderfully exciting and well paced, etc. But it suffers from two central problems. The first is that it is a crude re-make of the original story in nearly all of its major plot points. That is, a band of rebels have some vital information about a super weapon, and one of it's leaders hides it in a droid for safekeeping. Then a young person gets personally involved in the rebellion and is revealed to have secret powers they don't understand. That young person is helped by Hans Solo and Chewbacca and together, they confront the evil empire and destroy the super weapon. The difference is the young person is a young woman, rather than a young man. This is where my second criticism comes in.Rey, this episode's Luke, is a typical feminist trope ('a Mary Sue'. I believe they are called) who can do anything without struggle. Fix and fly the Millennium Falcon without any experience of being a pilot? No problem. Use the Force with no Jedi training? No Yoda carrying required. Wield a lightsaber to defeat a much larger man in black who has spent 25 years learning how to use the Force and fighting with a Lightsaber? Piece of cake. There is no struggle in this heroine, she can do anything without any explanation - and the audience buys it - because they have become used to 'Mary Sue' and swallow it all whole.Well, I don't. Luke had to train, Anakin had to train, Yoda had to train, Obi Wan had to train - all had to try and fail to become powerful. But Rey? Nothing at all. This undermines the film's credibility at its core - drama comes from struggle and conflict. There is action a plenty, and there is a character journey for Rey, but not one that requires anything other than being a woman doing all these amazing things without any explanation.While Lucas got himself mired in explanation, especially in the much derided prequel trilogy, Abrams doesn't give a damn for reasons why this is all happening. There is no context to his story - there is no Star Wars world, just events. dear viewer.Now of course, Episode VIII will reveal that Rey is Luke's daughter, that she is, of course, Jedi trained, that Kylo and her fought before, that the attempt to revive the Jedi Order by Luke failed disastrously when the cousins competed and Rey won. That is why Kylo turned to the dark side. Or some such nonsense. And defenders of this film will go 'See, it all made sense all along.' Afraid not.Star Wars made sense because it told the story of Anakin, his tragedy, his fall from greatness, his eventual redemption by his son. This is NOT in that classic hero story tragic structure. Rey is really a Disney vehicle - another Princess - I expect her clothes to be for sale in Disneyworld next year. Maybe in Episode VIII she will sing, and we'll have The Force Frozen. So George, you did sell your kids into slavery - Disney has turned Star Wars away from classic myth and into Pirates of the Caribbean. Or Beuaty and the Beast. You can tell it's wrong from the title - the Force cannot sleep and they awaken. The Force is eternal, and people use it if they can.Disney Star Wars - nah!",

    "review": "  Finally, a Star Wars movie that feels like a Star wars movie. Great Characters, good story, and a nice mix of new and nostalgia. ***Slight Spoilers*****What I liked: The Characters. I loved the two characters Rye (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). What's even more amazing is how well each did with not too many large roles in their filmography beforehand (especially for Daisy). Daisy brought with her a much needed female presence to a large blockbuster like this. Her heroine status never seemed forced but instead, seemed to grow along with the character. She also added charm and light humor to the character that helped the viewer connect to her. The other character, Kylo, was nothing close to being a villain like Darth Vader, which is a very good thing. The worst thing that could have happened would have been for them to try and create a copycat of one of the most iconic villains in film history. Instead, we got an emotionally conflicted, tantrum-throwing, violent brat; everything Anakin Skywalker from the prequels should have been. The difference between Kylo and Anakin was that we actually believed Kylo's struggle. We actually feel that this guy is dangerous, both physically and mentally. We also see how vulnerable he is without being told that flat out (see contrasting case in Episodes I-III with Anakin).  Finn (John Boyega) was a surprise for me. I went into the movie not expecting much from the character; that he would most likely be someone just hanging out in the background and \"just there.\" I also had a fear, once into the movie, that they would try to make him into another Han Solo-type character. But he really came into his own and his scenes with Rye showed that they both had great Chemistry together. Oscar Isaac (portraying Poe) seems to always play an intriguing character no matter what film he is in, so I expected nothing less from him here, and he ended up delivering impressively. General Hux (Domhall Gleeson) could have been utilized just a bit more in my opinion, but was still a solid performance and I expect to see more of him in the next episode.  I was glad to see Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher back and utilized in a suitable way. They weren't over used to the point where they drowned out the new faces, but they also weren't just tossed in there as a means to appease fanboys and fangirls. It was great to see Harrison Ford bring back the charisma and cockiness that epitomized the character Han Solo.  Better use of CGI: The special effects were pretty amazing, but what impressed me most, was the restraint in using CGI. What made the first Star Wars films so relatable and made them feel so real was the use of props and real sets, not a banquet of computer images that the audience is force-fed. People can tell when a movie is overstuffed with that kind of thing and it really show through the actors/actresses; especially when you have a sub par director at the helm.  There were a few scenes that really stood out for me in this movie that really pushed me over the line of liking to loving this film. The first one was when Rye is being interrogated by Kylo Ren and takes off his mask. At this point, my mind is filled with all kinds of images of a powerful, possibly mangled, beastly sith lord. The mask comes off though to reveal...just a kid; a punk kid. As he begins to terrorize Rye, you can see he's overflowing with confidence. But then there's a quick moment where he changes from confident to panicked as Rye fights back. Then she turns it back on him and you can actually see his \"oh shit\" moment when he realizes who/what he is dealing with.  The other scene that I loved was, of course, the lightsaber fight scene. It was simple, yet engrossing. Instead of displaying all sorts of ridiculous acrobatics and showy saber swings, the characters focused on one thing, beating the other guy. No jumping through absurd changes in the landscape, no cheesy dialog, no ludicrous surprises. It was a display of effort, struggle, and will and I couldn't help myself getting imbued with a feeling of excitement from it.What I didn't like: One of the few cons I had with the film was the use of yet another Death Star-like object. Although this was a minor negative, it was still enough to make me sigh just a bit.  Captain Phasma seemed like she was built up so much through trailers and marketing that the character really fell flat and it was quite disappointing that she really didn't play any big part of the story. Many will point out how much the movie plot resembles A New Hope. While this is undeniable, I felt that this was perhaps intentional. A way bring together the old fans with the new fans. Besides, the story from a New Hope isn't exactly novel itself. It's the same story that has been told many many times in many many forms. Star Wars' true magic comes from its characters and its worlds. That is why Star Wars has endured for generations.",

    "review": "  Some have complained about the \"recycled\" story concepts found in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. They argue the film lifts too much from the original trilogy and lives in the shadow of 1983. Not only did I have no problem with this, but I would argue it was a necessity. Thanks to the disappointing prequel trilogy, the Star Wars franchise was deemed terminally ill and many fans, including me, had thought it time to pull the plug. Then along comes The Force Awakens, which takes place some 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. In order to take us someplace new, the new trilogy must first remind us of where we have been. The film's familiar story and visuals - and, of course, the presence of the original cast - sparks feelings of joyous nostalgia for the original Star Wars films. The Force Awakens succeeds in reminding us of why we loved Star Wars in the first place. It introduces us to a brilliant new score by John Williams - I dare say it may even be his best ever. It also lets loose at least a half dozen new heroes to love and villains to hate. You'll find yourself cheering on Rey, Finn, Poe and BB-8 as loudly as you ever did for Luke, Leia, Han and Chewie. The legacy of Darth Vader also lives on in Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, who's performance as the surprisingly complex dark-side villain was one of the film's best. With the stage now set and the pieces firmly in place, the Star Wars saga is ready to take us someplace new. As a longtime fan, it feels good to come home. Bring on Episode VIII!",

    "review": "  We waited for years, and it's finally here. At 3 o'clock this morning I entered the cinema wide-eyed, full of hope. As was with many people's childhoods, Star Wars was a staple of mine, and to this day the original trilogy still stand as some of my favourite films. J.J. Abrams famously managed to reignite the Star Trek franchise with two fantastic films, so when tasked with doing similar to Star Wars, some people were sceptical, but nonetheless excited. The main questions is: did he deliver? Yes he damn well did!You know that tight throat feeling you get when you have a sudden urge of adrenaline, for the last hour of the film, I had that feeling, sitting there on the edge of my seat, heart pounding fast. What I was watching was exhilarating to say the least.Let's look more at the film (don't worry, there will be no spoilers featured). First off, the opening - the classic text followed by the panning shot to a planet (or death star) with a Star Destroyer emerging into the frame, it all features, as does the use of practical effects and puppets / robots over the extensive use of CGI that was utilised in the prequel trilogy, thus giving fans the old school style of Star Wars they wanted oh so much. The film is fast-paced, with stunning action scenes and spectacles, but not rushed, the shots linger and the camera moves gracefully, giving us a spectacular view of the situation at hand.The prequel trilogy shunted the franchise on a downward spiral, the overuse of CGI and the introduction of some of the most annoying characters in film (a-hem Jar Jar Binks), but Abrams, the finest choice of a director to reignite the franchise, did nothing more than show pure love for the films and has created a sequel that definitely exceeded my expectations. A film that features endless nostalgia with appearances from Ford (who is beyond fantastic), Fisher, Hamill even Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca and constant references to the original trilogy.The only partial negative aspect is its somewhat lack of originality, it acts more as an homage to 'A New Hope' than an original tale. But if you overthink points like this when viewing it, you won't enjoy it, so just empty your head of that and watch the film for what it is: a space opera that acts as nothing more than a sheer piece of movie magic!",

    "review": "  We all have a duality in us. A moral compass with a needle that wavers between good and evil, right and wrong. It's been in us all along and is part of what makes us what we are. No one is completely good and no one is completely bad, though for many of us our needles spend far more time on one side than the other. This compass, along with our longing to know where we came from and why we're here, has led our species to create policing, governments and religion in an attempt to protect us from ourselves, to govern us and to explain our purpose, to give us a purpose. George Lucas tapped into this very basic slice of our human makeup when he created Star Wars in 1977. Star Wars is essentially a bible story in space. Good vs. evil, light vs. darkness, miracles and magic and murder and sacrifice. With the consequences of this galactic soap opera affecting an entire universe. It was an incredibly simple story on an incredibly large scale. And like a good bible story, it connected with people in a massive and fundamental way and went on to create a phenomenon that has permeated the lives and cultures of nearly every corner of the globe. If that's not religion, I don't know what is.So you could consider the announcement of Episode VII in the Star cannon akin to an announcement from the Catholic church that they will be releasing a new book of the bible during the Christmas 2015 season.Now I'm personally not a very religious person. I like the Star Wars films, I grew up, along with most of the modern world, on the films and their subsequent pop cultural dominance. But they don't represent any particular touchstones in my life and I doubt I would even consider them hallmarks in cinematic history, as far as my list is concerned. I also hated Episode's I, II and the first half of III. But I can get caught up in hype as easily as the next person and my curiosity at the initial announcement of Episode VII two years ago eventually transformed into higher and higher levels of excitement as the release date drew nearer.So now I've seen it. And what do I think? Well, the short of it is, although I haven't compiled my best of list for 2015 yet, I don't think it will be on it. That doesn't mean it's a bad film or that I didn't like it. It's about as good a film as you would hope it to be. I just think I had, or will have had, ten better movie related experiences by the end of the year.Overall there are lots of things I loved about this movie and really only a couple of things I hated. The thing I loved most about it was its aesthetic. This looks and feels like a Star Wars film. Like an original trilogy Star Wars film. Where the prequels screwed up by making themselves look too advanced and too slick, thereby confusing the timeline and making for an awkward marathon, The Force Awakens strikes the perfect balance between a film that looks and feels like a film made in the late 70's/early 80's, while taking full advantage of modern movie magic techniques. Another thing I loved was the tone. This movie isn't afraid to get very dark. And a lot of people die in it, on screen and off. I'm impressed with Disney on this front as the studio is known for shying away from abject noir in an effort to appeal to the widest possible audience. The cast (and casting) is also very good. It's nice to see familiar faces and even nicer to see new ones. Oscar Isaac can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned, but he's really great in this. As are relative newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega (both television actors previously). The Star universe is also peppered with a lot of great new alien and robotic characters, both cuddly and horrific.In fact it is one of these characters that I didn't like about the film. In Episode VII the new evil regime is called the First Order and it's run by a large, wrinkly bastard called The Supreme Commander. Now aside from being the most fake, CGI looking thing in a film filled with otherwise photo realistic special effects, we're given absolutely no backstory on this Supreme Commander whatsoever. Where did he come from? What's his relation to the dark side and why is he in charge of it now? There is also a lot of plot side stepped involving Han Solo and Princess Leia. Given the amount of time that has passed between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, not much is said about the interim. But those issues may be resolved in Episode VIII, which is already in preproduction, or Episode IX, which is sure to follow. All in all The Force Awakens is a great movie and will prove to be a real treat for fans of the series. And the bigger a fan you are, the more you will get out of it, I'm sure. ...I wanted to avoid being superfluous, but to hell with it. I can't think of a better way to end this review, so here you go: Verdict: The Force is strong with this one.",

Some will find a bad thing the \"deja vu\" effect of some scenes or the coming back of familiar faces, but i liked it a lot. Perhaps this will begin a new saga, with new characters and i'm totally fine with it, but watching it made me the effect to pay a visit to a bunch of good old true friends. In this, the movie found the perfect balance between the past and the future of the series. I liked a lot the new characters, the visuals are stunning and the special effects are simply amazing. FX and nice landscapes alone don't do a good movie, but together with good acting and good story it's a killer combo! Of course we are talking about a movie which is pure entertaiment, pure adventure, pure amusement, there's some reference to nazism but more for the visual point of view (this is something Star Wars Imperial soldiers have always had, since the beginning) than other. So, don't look for some inner meaning, metaphors and all that stuff here. This is to entertain old fans and new ones and it does it perfectly. And with all those boring mediocre movies that try in every way to be deep, a fun adventure to watch and rewatch is more than welcome!",

The new characters are quite fun, very well written and portrayed masterfully by the newcomers.But the best thing of this movie, is without a doubt bb8, the lovely new robot that makes the film a lot funnier!The movie has its mistakes, as it follows almost perfectly the plot of \"a new hope\", but it does it so well, and so perfectly that you won�t even care!The old cast brings some familiarity to the film, allowing us to enjoy every moment they�re in the movie! Harrison Ford especially shines one more time as Han Solo. The villain Kylo Ren is also awesometacular, as good as darth vader, and, in my opinion much more menacing than the sith lord! J.J.Abrams did an explendid job with this movie, making it almost perfect! This is one of the best Star Wars movie, and we are off to a great start on the next trilogy!",

I cringed when Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher were on screen. In particular, Harrison Ford was atrocious. He phoned in his entire performance. Thank god they killed off Han so that we don't have to be punished with another appearance of Harrison. I really don't see any reason for their characters to have been brought back other than nostalgia. The story would have been better without them. Right, the story. Too many people apparently haven't seen the original Star Wars in a awhile because this was a regurgitation of it without any of the humor. Although, apparently Storm Troopers still can't shoot and masters of the powers of the dark side are still unable to use those years of mastery to defeat someone who doesn't even believe in, or know about the force. This was worse than the prequels.",

    "review": "  Wow, this episode of Star Wars almost feels more original than the originals. How is that possible? Chewbacca is the same as always, the Millennium Falcon rises from the dust, and Hans Solo is back to his old trade. The dusty desert planet where it begins looks and feels familiar. Several gigantic monsters make a dramatic entrance and exit. Our favorite droids make a brief appearance, although even they are getting replaced by an adorable younger model. The Dark Side is back at it with a bigger badder planet killing device. Star Wars episode VII even had the requisite bar full of goofy looking aliens.Star Wars seems to be unendingly about the struggle between the forces of light and dark, good and evil. It's variations of the same story, over and over. That being said, it works. Somehow, the force of light has chosen Rae and Finn to be its next champions against the champions for the force of dark. Sadly, the force of dark has chosen the only child of the heroic duo Hans Solo and General Leia Organa to be its champion. How tragic!This is perfectly set up for the next episode, where we will possibly find out more on the new heroine Rey's mysterious backstory. We will also surely see the training of Rey as the new Jedi by the long lost Luke Skywalker, and no doubt see Finn develop as well. I'm concerned, however, that Solo's and Organa's son Kylo Ren will be further destroyed by the dark side. He already made a terrible choice. What else is in store?",

    "review": "  Director J.J, Abrams takes over the mantel from George Lucas and, with a generation of expectation, pulls off something extraordinary with the most eagerly awaited movie release of the century.Once again it's \"A long time ago... \" There's a new evil, fascist empire, this time called the First Order, commanded by a shadowy giant, Supreme Leader Snoke (a Voldermortish looking Andy Serkis) and his villainous Dark Vader like lieutenant, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and captain of the Stormtroopers, Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie). The baddies are out to destroy the freedom-loving Resistance but are worried about where in the galaxy is Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who has disappeared, although there's a map to his secret hideaway.Abrams has also brought back original cast members Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia now in charge of the Resistance, Harrison Ford as grizzled but charismatic Han Solo at the controls of the Millennium Falcon and of course there's Chewie and droids C-3PO and R2-D2.He has moved with the times with the new, relatively unknown, young leads, one is black and the other is a woman who is neither a princess waiting to be rescued nor a token female character. John Boyega (Finn) plays a stormtrooper with a conscious who goes rogue and Daisy Ridley (Rey), is the film's heroine, beginning as a scavenger on a remote plane but then becoming the one in whom the force awakens.Whilst talk about the newcomers has all been about Ridley and Boyega, who are both very good, the best of the new generation of actors is Oscar Isaac, who plays smooth talking rebel fighter Poe Dameron. As the self professed \"Greatest pilot in the entire galaxy\" he has naturally drawn comparison to Han Solo because of his one liners, old school charm and unflappable demeanour.Abrams knows what devotees really want and he gives us a cracking space opera packed with iconic glisteningly white and plastically stormtroopers (still with remarkable poor aim), X-wing and TIE figures whizzing round the sky blasting away at each other and lightsabers clashing in a battle of good versus evil.Critics have complained about all the nostalgia of the film. It's all too familiar. The presence of the old crew and even the new script, plot and visuals, all echo A New Hope. Adhering closely to the structure of the original trilogy, refurbished and freshened up, the film serves the older and younger audiences alike.As with his Star Trek reboot, Abrams has done a marvellous job injecting new life into the sci-fi franchise. He has made a film that the kids of today will love as much as we loved the first one. One we always imagined a new Star Wars film would be, the galactic classic fans wanted.",

I also have a problem with the fact that Rey can fly the Millennium Falcon when it has been sitting for 5 years(no maintenance) and she has no training on it. In the first movie Luke(Son of Vader) has to practice with the light saber and in this movie people just pick it up and miraculously know how to fight with it.

I never thought I'd say this, but even Harrison Ford (with his hefty $34 Million role as Han Solo) failed to inspire.

    "review": "  Of all the movies I've had he opportunity to watch this year, not a single film has managed to make me swear off social media, reviews, spoilers of any kind, and even fan reaction like Star Wars: The Force Awakens has. It was well worth the patience and the wait to finally sit in the theater and let the good times roll! I'll keep this short (and spoiler free) so most of you can go out and enjoy the film for yourselves. The film is good. Better than good; and it feels every bit a Star Wars film as the originals did, something the prequels sorely lacked. The new characters are all great to watch and introduces a menacing and fresh villain in Kylo Ren and his master of sorts, Supreme Leader Snoak. We also get the head strong Rey, the courageous (and often hilarious) Finn, and the dashing Poe Dameron as well as a scene stealing BB-8 and a wise Maz Kanata. Canon favorites Leia, Han, Chewie, and C3PO tug on fans heart strings as they appear one by one, with more many more that follow. The plot itself is simple enough and gives us a few twists and turns and some pretty interesting surprises that most fans will deliberate over the course of the next two years until 2017's Episode VIII. The few flaws of the film's plot: it doesn't elaborate on a few key points that would make the story gel better and it is a pretty solid retread of A New Hope (which isn't so much a flaw as it is a nitpick).  In a time when films are following the 'Cinematic universe formula,' it may or may not hurt potential franchises from flourishing into wonderful story phenomenon. In the case of Force Awakens, we are spared due to the rich universe that precedes it, fantastic pacing, a powerful score, and an intriguing idea of where the saga will go from here. So, is it worth your time and money and everything you would have (finally) hoped for in a Star Wars film? Oh yes. And then some.",

    "review": "  Ok my thoughts are pretty succinct at this point; for the record, do yourself a favor and see it in IMAX. That really clarified a lot of my thoughts from the basic projection I saw opening night.That being said: I fucking love The Force Awakens. Characterization is so important in a film to me, sometimes even above plotting, and I'd hazard to say that this film being the INSANE commercial success it is will have at least some effect on the way films from now on are cast. More female leads, more leads of color, and more interesting stories being told.Now, the problem everyone seems to have is that we have a re-hash of A New Hope. Which would concern me... if TFA wasn't BETTER than New Hope. This film is so much more balanced in terms of character backgrounds, dialogue being relatable (thank god they left all the clunky techobabble from Ep 4 out of this script), action (such acrobatic on-planet X-wing fighting and actually sensible lightsaber fighting), and blend of nostalgia with unknowns. The film is thick with referencing to the original films that whiz by so fast you have to watch it multiple times to catch them; it's crazy. It's a thrill ride that not only rewards lifelong fans, but sucks in people who've never seen anything Star Wars before - the double threat!That's the majority of what I have to say about the film and I think once the wave of it being brand new subsides, folks will come to love it and younger crowds will cherish it just like we cherish the original trilogy. Effects have finally caught up to what the Star Wars universe deserves and we've got a great blend of practical and visual effects in TFA: another card in its favor.After catching IMAX last night, I also have to say it's incredible how lodged in my brain the soundtrack is. Not only are the original themes there (and more neck-prickling than ever) but the new themes for Rey and the First Order are also totally incredible. Bravo, John Williams, for continuing to push the envelope when returning to familiar material.Don't miss it on the big screen if you haven't seen it already. That would be quite foolish indeed.",

Especially, when we know that two more of them are coming to fill up part of the blanks and the holes and to develop the overall story. As for now, The premises are good. Lets hope the rest lives up to our expectation. Welcome Back Star Wars!",

    "review": "  Boy was I excited. The last film I'd seen at the cinema was the Deathly Hallows Part Deux in 2011. I'm not a big fan of popcorn, or almost any situation where I have to spend more than two hours without the internet. I'd just finished work for the holidays and was walking back to the station when I noticed that one of my friends had changed her profile pic to one of her with a lightsaber beam in it. I stopped, lent against a pillar and got a ticket to a screening that started in a couple of hours, which would be enough time to get to Marble Arch and eat a pizza.It's difficult reviewing a film when you can't really remember it. It's not that it was boring or anything, I just have a sucky memory.Kylo Ren doesn't have Vader's majesty, only his fashion sense. He's like some futuristic hipster. It's not because he hasn't matured into his totally evil self yet, it's just who he is. Anakin was seriously charming even when he was younger. How did Han and Leia manage to produce such a wretch of a being? He makes me nautious. This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing but I'm struggling to find a character in the whole film that has the type of quality that he lacks.Rey seems very strong but she hasn't fully found her power yet. Plus she's a workaholic. It's understandable because she has always been impoverished but it's unfortunate because neither her, not that noob of a Stormtrooper have any sexual orientation whatsoever. I mean I get it, the film is about the force awakening and probably in the next film, it'll be a bit more awake. My problem is that I can't see any of the characters turning into someone that I could see myself going for a beer with and that bothers me.Don't get me started on the droid that is basically a football, he even ended up in a net at one point, which is enough to keep the majority of Britons entertained for at least 90 minutes.I'm not saying it was a bad movie. It was dark and gritty although part of that might be because I watched it in an old cinema. Sometimes in life, two hours pass and you don't meet anyone you really like. That's realistic. I generally enjoyed it because I was eager throughout, to find out what would happen next, even though it all occurred a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. I'm looking forward to the next one.A lot of my enthusiasm comes from the fact that I love StarWars in general. I'd probably give it eight out of ten. For context, I wouldn't have given Episode One less than seven.",

    "review": "  75%Saw this on 24/12/15After an exhilarating first half, the 7th installment descends into a shamelessly derivative, predictable and overrated opera. The most surprising thing is that the only interesting characters are the new entries, especially Rey and the older cast has nothing to here, even though Harrison Ford does his best. The film has terrific action sequences especially in the first half and the predictability makes the visuals in second half far less effective. The film fails because it creates extremely similar situations from all the other films, prequels and sequels alike. The biggest flaw is with the villain who is nothing but an ersatz of Darth Vader. Overall the entire acting is good, but some comedy aimed pointlessly for the sake of cracking jokes, especially by Oscar Issac stands out like a sore thumb and the romance between Ford and Carrie Fisher seems bad and rather unnecessary. One other main problem I felt is that the film series simply tries to keep the story centered on succeeding generations of it's original characters wherein almost all pivotal characters in here are mostly descendants of the original characters. This is mostly hype and when people knew that Mr Abrams is directing, they just appreciated it beforehand.",

I can say that it looks pretty, makes good use of the soundtrack, and shows Daisy Ridley to be a great actress (albeit, a seeming copycat of the other female protagonists of recent action movies. I can't say it's a terrible thing, just predictable).I am most disappointed in the performances of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, showing that their time away from the franchise ruined both their characters and chemistry together on screen (not to mention the poor dialogue choices they were given).Overall, I don't see what people love about this movie. If I closed my eyes to the title screen and forgot it was supposed to be Star Wars, I might have thought it just another lackluster action film. I don't believe it deserves the recognition it has received.",

It has quite a few components similar to the previous films, namely episode I and VI, that can hit a certain nostalgia yet freshness factor to many. But for me it felt honestly lacking; the villain(s) presence throughout the movie was weak, and the conclusion was similarly weak. The whole thing had what seemed like an unhealthy dependence on story and plot components faaaar too identical to that of episode I (poor, loner on desert planet, force-sensitive)and VI (again, desert planet, droid with precious information, finding a long lost jedi, Death Star [basically]). It's things like this that leave me heavily disappointed. The only thing I love about this movie is the breath of fresh air that is the new leads to the series coupled with some of the more loveable old cast members, and the hopes that episode VIII will be the new \"Empire Strikes Back\" of this trilogy (in other words, awesome). That being said I would recommend seeing it. I may not appreciate the nostalgia factor very much, but I'm sure many of you will!",

Most disappointing was that the familiar characters were a little too self-aware that that were in the previous movies. Corny self-referential lines took me out of the Star Wars reality and more into a wink-wink nod-nod frame of mind. Overall, though, the movie was good. Not great. Good.

    "review": "  The theatrical John Williams's score hits its familiar (and welcoming) cords while being accompanied with an infamous title crawl. When two simple words shoot past us on a black, spacy, backdrop-Star Wars-it will have been a ten-year gap between iterations (the last of which was 2005s Revenge of the Sith) and while the previous film was focused on closing (and linking) two sets of trilogies that were made in a twenty-eight-year span, 2015s The Force Awakens looks in the other direction to where the saga will venture towards-the future-and succeeds in breathing new (nostalgic-infused) air to kick start future episodes. Blending the action, high-intensity style of modern big budget filmmaking with the stylistic aesthetic from that of the original trilogy, co-writer/producer/director J.J. Abrams niftily expands the Star Wars mythos for a new generation of movie-goer while also harkening back to many of the sights, sounds and originality that captivated audiences back in 1977. Abrams and co-writer Lawrence Kasden (back after penning both 1980s The Empire Strikes Back and 1983s Return of the Jedi) recycle tried and true plot beats (coupled with reused shots) that will instantly have one remember the past films. 2015 is an exemplary year with this trend with big-budget reboots/sequels (I'm looking at you Terminator: Genysis and Jurassic World) but The Force Awakens achieved the desired outcome in a tasteful way that serves the overarching story rather than easy reminiscent \"cash\" grab moments. Abrams, Kasden and producer Kathleen Kenedy do an admirable effort in treating the source material with respect and it shows all over the product in the story, the \"feel\" of the film and the characters. And what is Star Wars without the characters? The people (or creatures) we root for-the Luke's, the Han's, Leia's, Chewie's-are ultimately what make each adventure worth going on and what Abrams and Kasden exceeded in is bringing fresh faces to that Galaxy Far, Far Away who we want to see more of (which was the opposite outcome with Lucas's Prequel Trilogy where we didn't really like anyone). As a film that is to entice the past, present and (hopefully) future audiences, Star Wars: The Force Awakens succeeds in bringing an easily consumable adventure that packs the required weight to appeal to many. As a film that is to live up to the namesake, Star Wars: The Force Awakens doesn't hit the bravado heights of both A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back but it was never meant to. As a film that is meant to encompass the joys of cinema-even if it is a familiar one-J.J. Abrams' Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a worthy entry in the famed saga and is a great stepping stone for the future.",

    "review": "  I think it felt too much like one of the original star Wars films! I mean come on, Talk about lazy writing!cute little droid to make people like it. force sensitive kid on desert planet watched over from afar by old man. death star/bigger death star. trench run take 2. falcon and xwing fly away from blowing up super weapon just before it destroys rebel base. old man killed in front of mentioned force sensitive person which will make said person stronger. stormtrooper here to rescue u. im going to have to stop myself though sadly i can go on. sound familiar?It's basically episode 4 with different character names, and the changed the name of the death star, to Star killer, and made it bigger. AND how could Luke leave his family when he knows how much danger they could be in? On that note, how could Han do the same?Explain how Fin, a young stormtrooper janitor, could even last a second in a Saber battle with Ren?Neither Luke or Anakin excelled that fast.Finally, after waiting 32 years to see what happened to Luke Skywalker, they tell us that we need to wait two years to hear him utter a word?!?! Thats borderline cruelty in my opinion. All in all, epic failure",

    "review": "  Overall, I thought this was fine, and certainly an improvement over all of the prequels. Fine, though, is not exactly a glowing recommendation. I can understand why some people love this film. For one, this FELT like a Star Wars film; no political discourse, classic good vs evil story, spectacular visuals, no horrible speeches about love, and some really nice action set pieces that fit with the plot instead of distracting from it, and on a more minor point it was mostly lacking JJ's signature lens flares. However, I can also understand why some people will hate this: the dialog is still quite bad in places, it falls on some horribly overused cliches and conveniences, and while it seems strange to complain about physics in a sci-fi film this does exceed the usual suspension of disbelief in at least a couple of areas. Still, for me, the acting and direction was good enough to overcome these deficiencies, as they still somehow managed to say those bits of bad dialog with enough emotion that it felt genuine, and a lot of the credit for that goes to Harrison, who was wonderful in this. So all that out of the way, there's enough problems here that I can't give this a glowing recommendation, but there's enough good that I still have to say I had fun watching it. I feel pretty much the same about this film as the year's current biggest blockbuster, and therefore it gets the same score.",

    "review": "  JJ Abrams has made a movie that looks better the the green screen prequel, but lacks imagination and is full of more plot hole it could be an episode of LOST. Movies have one Job. Put it on the screen. This movies fails at that simple task. Ford being the biggest actor in the film shows he can do the job but his weight hurts the movie as Abrams gives Ford what he's wanted from the beginning. This acted is poorly used and a waste as the poorly case actor that plays Kylo Ren doesn't have the look to connect him to his parentage. His look has me questioning if his mother had a visit from a milkman while his father was out.  The last act which leaves more WTF feelings and questions also robs the very lame Villian his one goal. Be scary. Giving Rey a victory so easly in this movie franchise, was the biggest an most unforgivible mistake. It's robs Kylo Ren of any fear his character might have had before he took of his mask. This is the reason I feel so many don't like his character and feel he is an emo brat, then a super villian.  Over all the movie is a rental and will be remembered as the worst SW movie to date.",

    "review": "  he worst thing is that its a BAD rip off of E4. The movie has so many plot holes and examples of convenient writing that even it's similarity to E4 couldn't save it. I hated the prequels, but this is a low on a completely different level. *****SPOILERS*******1. Can ANYONE explain to me please why did Han Solo take the droid that THE WHOLE GALAXY is looking for into the most public place possible - the cantina where EVERYONE can see it?? The movie doesn't explain why, Maz Kanata didn't need to see the droid, there is litteraly NO REASON for the droid being there except for the spy in the cantina to see that droid and call the First Order. They even left Chewie with the Millenium Falcon who could have taken care of the droid until they come back... /facepalm2. Can ANYONE explain to me why didn't Kylo Ren use his force powers on Finn when he fights him??? He used the force to freeze Poe in the beginning of the movie, he used the same force ability on Ray in the middle of the movie when he captures her, and then he even knocks Ray out by force pushing her into a tree at the end of the movie! That is 3 times we have seen him use his force powers. But, then when he is wounded and not at his 100%, when using the force would be the most logical option, he decides to engage Finn in melee combat??? Are you fucking kidding me?! If the movie had any logic, Kylo Ren would force freeze Finn and cut his head off in 2 seconds. But fuck logic! We need to have a cool lightsabre fight so the kids are happy!3. Can anyone explain to me WHY does Finn, a storm trooper, who - direct quote: \"has been programmed since childhood to do one thing\" betray the first order and starts shooting at other storm troopers 5 minutes into the movie? I can buy that storm troopers can go rogue, but I cannot buy they would go rogue so easy and so fast! You dont go through 20 years of brainwashing within 5 minutes of the movie! I dont care you just saw a genocide! Where is Finn's moral struggle? Where is his hesitation when he needs to start shooting at people who were part of his life since his childhood? Let me tell you that it doesnt exist! He litterally sees a genocide, breaths like a moron for 2 scenes, and all of a sudden he is rescuing Poe and is just like any other dude in the galaxy. That is COMPLETELY contradictive to the lore they were setting up for the storm troopers!! 4. Can anyone explain to me why did Captain Phasma lower the shields so easily? Or why didnt the command send a batallion of storm troopers to raise the shields again once they noticed the shields were down? 5. Why does the resistance and everyone else just trust Finn??? Nobody ever raises the question if he is a spy, and if that is not bad enough, they send him on a crucial mission to take down the shields just because he says he knows how to bring them down - only to discover he has NO CLUE how to do it!! Wow, the resistance seem to be complete morons who want to destroy a planetsized superweapon just by \"winging it\". So JJ Abrams wants me to believe that a small shield on Endor needs personal attention of a Jedi, Han Solo, Chewie, Leia (all in their prime) + 20 or more rebels + a whole forest filled of Ewoks to bring down a small shield protected only by a few batallions of Storm troppers - YET A PLANET FILLED WITH STORM TROOPERS CAN BE BROUGHT DOWN BY A 70 YEAR OLD MAN, A BLACK DUDE WHO COULD BE A SPY AND WHO HAS NO CLUE HOW TO BRING DOWN THE SHIELDS, AND CHEWIE??? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDDING ME???And i could go on for hours pointing out all the things that dont make sense, but i wasted enough time on this piece of shit movie. Litteraly every scene is a plot hole or doesn't make sense in some way... So, not only did they COPY E4, but they did a BAD copy. Needless to say i am disappointed, but what is even more disappointing are the rabid fanbois who praise this shit as the best thing since sliced bread! 94% on rotten tomatoes????? Are you fucking kidding me????",

    "review": "  Force Awakens is kind of movie which makes you miss James Cameron. The visionary director who actually understands the need and desire of the audience. Force Awaken even lacks the philosophy offered by original movie. It's a product which is made with only one intention, 'Feed the hungry fans and cash the cow'.Starting with the story, it was like watching A New Hope's mesh up with Jurassic World. All elements of the Original movie were present. The Trio of young characters, the good turned bad antagonist and his relationship with the protagonist. Even the death star and some old stars were there. There absolutely is no real goal in the movie. We movie from securing the map to preparing the Jedi to destroying the death star. And story itself has holes big enough to swallow a galaxy which is far far away. It seems that in last 30 years only earth have progressed in technology and biological domain, the galaxy which was so advance 40 years ago, now seems be living the same. Like the original series, antagonists are not killed and neither the family of protagonist is revealed. I wonder if they have any idea about DNA and biology. Also it's not clear that how come antagonist know a lot of technology. From a 30 years old spaceship to a newly built death star. She knows the right circuits to pull out. Characters seemed to be very distant throughout the movie. There absolutely was no chemistry between Han Solo and Princess/General Lea. Who unexpectedly is never mentioned to be from Jedi family. Although after recent success of female protagonist oriented film series, they did pass the torch to a girl.Moving to visual effects and cinematography, perhaps the focus really was to add unnecessary and blunt action sequence. Much like prequels directed by George Lucas, colors were blurred and not so bright. There was no need to watch the movie in Imax or 3d, the worst a director can do to a 3d movie. J J Abrams really lacked a vision here. It is just like watching a 2d film.Acting is okie, Although I did not understand some of the wits. Daisy Ridley is great in her role. She wore the role over and is the best thing in movie crossover. Harrison Ford is good and easy in his role. Carrie Fisher is alright. She did not have much to do that explains more than enough make up even at crucial times. John Boyega and Oscar Isaac played split up of Han Solo's character with not much required jokes.One goes with high expectation but returns very disappointed.",

    "review": "  Horrible character development, completely implausible situations and a glaring lack of chemistry define this PC reboot of the original Star Wars. We have the Stormtrooper who inexplicably develops a conscience, but no explanation as to why we have Stormtroopers sans Empire. One of our heroes, Poe, is...wait, who is he? We're supposed to care about him...why? And, of course, we have our main hero, a girl who's a junk dealer/ scavenger. At the drop of a hat, she becomes an ace pilot, master mechanic and Bruce Lee Jedi all rolled into one. Then we have our villain, who delivers all the menace and malevolence of Leave it to Beaver's Eddie Haskell while wearing a mask for no reason. Throw in a giant Area 51 alien to replace the Emperor, the First Order to replace the Empire and the Resistance to replace the Rebellion and it's time to search for Luke Skywalker. You see, Luke ran away to hide after one of his Jedi pupils turned out to be a bad boy. In the end, we can only hope that our new hero, Rey, will inform Luke that all this Jedi training is unnecessary in the first place- after all, she had only to pick up a light saber in order to make Darth Maul look like Pee Wee Herman. In the end, this film's only redeeming quality is the opportunity to see Han Solo and Chewbacca on the big screen for the first time in over thirty years, and even this left something to be desired.",

In fact, everything that seemed most interesting was only described in passing like anything that apparently happened since Return of the Jedi and this movie. All that said, upon 2nd viewing I was trying to look past the recycled plot and sit back and try to enjoy it for what it was. The characters/acting and dialog were all solid which was refreshing considering the disaster of episodes 1-3 in this department. The special effects were spot on as you would expect. I am hopeful this is just a little reboot to kick things off and we really get into some seriously interesting plot devices moving forward. If that happens then this film is perfectly acceptable.

    "review": "  What a complete and utter waste of time and money, and a total erasure of the excitement I had to revisit and enjoy even part of the magic from my childhood experience.Garbage story. Bad character development. A couple of absolutely horrible casting choices and stilted performances. Loaded with clich�s. Entirely derivative from A New Hope - except without any of the charm, mystery, and intrigue. I'm not going to waste time talking about droids with hidden information, hiding under Falcon floor plates, or Death Star channel runs and destruction. It's all far too apparent when you see the film.Want to care about the characters and their stories? Impossible. Even the ones you used to are less than shadows of what they were. Sorry, Harrison, I love you. But aside from a couple of cool moments, Han Solo - one of the most beloved characters of all time - was just completely BLAH. It's an unforgivable insult that this is the drivel that was given to you.Finn. Rey. Poe. Phasma. Ren. Why care about any of them? They are all ridiculously underdeveloped and utterly uninteresting. They are either too perfect (Rey), too pathetic (Finn), disappear and reappear inexplicably and in the most superficial way (Poe), or just not fleshed out whatsoever (Phasma, who really looked cool and could have been built up to something really bad ass - a new Boba Fett. But she was rendered completely insignificant and glossed-over).Kylo Ren. This is our new villain? Seriously? Could he have been any less interesting or weak? He turned out to be nothing more than a tempestuous, troubled teenager. There was no compelling setup or background for his battle with dark and light. He even beared no resemblance to his parents, Han and Leia. And if you want to build any interest over a character with a hidden face and intimidating appearance, you do not unmask him in the first film, let alone have it be that kind of anti-climactic reveal.General Hux. The worst casting of the entire film. The worst acting. And the Nazi reference was just gag-inducing.The movie was ridden with non-sensical stuff. Star Wars used to make sense. There was a sensible lore. Force users needed intense training, or they stood zero chance. How about some scavenger - unrealised force powers or not - able to fly a totally unknown ship with such efficacy and impossible skill? She resisted powerful force mind probes. She could out force-grab a light saber. Rey was all but victorious over a trained and 'powerful' Sith apprentice? Flinn - a SPACE JANITOR and rookie Storm Trooper - virtually holds his own against this trained Sith with a Jedi weapon he's never used before? Seriously?And the incongruencies abound. Ren can deflect point blank blaster shots behind his back, but can't detect and defend himself from a distant shot from a wookie who screams and reveals his position? We're supposed to be impressed or scared of this guy? He displays awesome initial powers, but ends up almost totally inept, and little more than a tantrum-throwing teenager?Han solo, one of the baddest and coolest good characters gets murdered over a touchy-feeling family moment and thrown into an abyss? What a fitting end. (rollseyes)There are so many negative things to say about this movie. And the only positives are a few moments of wonderful cinematography and VFX. Even the score was sub-par, which is a shocker from the greatest of all time. Almost everything about TFA was abysmal. Some of the tone was there. But this was light years from the Star Wars we knew and loved thirty-plus years ago.No wonder. No mystery. No lore. No build up. NO SIGNIFICANT, BELIEVABLE OR INTERESTING DRAMA. A complete failure to set up the most basic emotive themes like the first movies explored so successfully.By the time I was halfway through the movie, I was repeatedly throwing my hands in the air. This is a horrid re-entry for a franchise that was supposed to be resurrected and freed from the incapable clutches of a next-to-incompetent George Lucas.Well, we found out there are more incapable movie makers and IP owners. 4 billion dollars bought what we knew and loved, and the most bland product was funneled through the bowels of idiocy and incompetence. Yet it appears they are going to end up recouping it all and actually profiting. Such is the current state of modern cinema.Shameful.30 years we waited for this. I had so much hope this would be good with no Lucas. It would have been so hard for it to fall further from my expectations. I am absolutely gob smacked it's being received so well.Has the bar been set this low?",

And the good side still fight with junks? Didn't even have any bombs on their plane machines to destroy the weapon... All thanks to Han Solo self carries bombs!4. And what with this so easy stuff?

    "review": "  Great reboot of the original episode 4. Appearances from the first film made the best parts of this one. Daisy Ridley was outstanding and very easy on the eyes. Hopefully there is more depth to Finn and not entirely sure where Captain Phasma fit in. Seemed like a dead end character. I think they blew it casting Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. He made me think the 70s version could have cast John Travolta as Darth Vader. Vinnie Barbarino, I am your father.",

    "review": "  The Force Awakens does not disappoint and perhaps surpasses 4 of its predecessor movies as the number 3 or higher best Star Wars movie out there. Kylo Ren instead of trying to make him better than Darth Vader makes him ask that question for you. A character that will grow and have vulnerability and something more to his resisting of the light than we may be led to believe. You buy the instant friendship of Finn and Poe and love it with a \"we're going to do this\" Rey is a great hero who you instantly love, the world setting with her is done very well. She's strong willed, yet fragile in her own way and scared with abandonment issues. BB-8 is everything you hoped he'd be. Phasma is just like Boba Fett. Does nothing, but I think we'll see more of her in the next one. The humor is very Star Wars and laugh out loud. The nastalgia gets a little pandering. The chess table was a bit too much. Maybe bring in more new ships. Not the old x-wing and millenium falcon. The familiarity insures us that though changing hands, will still be Star Wars, repeating events and themes intentionally (like SPOILER death of a mentor in the first movie, not a jedi you will be until you confront your father) like a song or poem repeats rhythm and chorus. John Williams has not lost his touch (Rey's theme is great). We've had a Nazi theme with the empire and well-executed, we got something new and yet familiar with the Nazi speech never seen but perfectly in line with Lucas. Some good mysteries left unknown.Highly recommend. A great addition to the Star Wars universe. Most the rotten ratings are just a backlash to its popularity. I don't like it because it's popular type stuff or they don't understand the cyclical nature of Star Wars.",

    "review": "  I was very skeptical from the new Star Wars, with that said, hear my rant on what I think of the new movie....Star Wars: Force Awakens was a movie that if you were skeptical, a movie that if you don't like Sci-fi, a movie that simply looked mediocre to you, well, your wrong and you should see it. It was the magic that the first trilogy captured audiences around the globe. Maybe more so this time. There were so many moments that mesmerized me begging me for more. This is the Star Wars movie we have been waiting for. I as a huge skeptic who waited this long to see it, am excited to see the next one in the series. Rey is now my favorite character in all of the Star Wars universe. Fin pulls a strong second. The development on these characters are so well written that the only disappointment I walked away with was the movie ending. I want more, nay I Demand more! Pony up the cash to go see this movie, do not let it slip by. It will be the best movie you see in the theaters for years to come.",

Complete with the heroine being just like her dad Luke living in the desert wanting nothing to do with the force. The Republic planets get destroyed again. Of course someone dies off the platform of the ship after their family member kills them. They have a new robot that has all the important info. Also they shoot to kill the death star again and the falcon js the ship of use. They have the scene of going into the weird creature bar all over again. Lots of cameos from the old crew still acting the same like hans solo owing ppl money. Action-packed, good acting, some humor, nice effects, but nothing new. The only surprise was that a girl was the heroine and that a storm trooper turned good. Yawn they played it too safe to the original franchise. I sincerely hope they up their game for the next one.",

It is packed with great action, it has an wonderful cast (Daisy Ridley and Oscar Isaac being the stand-outs), and is very high in entertainment value. With the story, half of the film is basically A New Hope, understandably so to make the series feel like Star Wars again, but I felt that this was a bit distracting, despite the film doing a great job balancing old Star Wars with a new fresh blood. There were also things that happened in the film were pretty convenient, the under-use of certain characters, and questionable decisions made in the script. Otherwise, The Force Awakens successfully reclaims the former glory of the Star Wars saga. The force is still strong with the franchise.",

The Force Awakens had a very interesting plot that kept me on the edge of my seat. Harrison Ford did a great job returning as Han Solo. Also I thought having Daniel Craig as a Stormtrooper in the movie was pretty cool. Kylo Ren will make a good villain in the future movies, and Rey will make a fantastic Jedi. I really liked Finn and his decision to do what is right. Abrams did a nice job in his character development and I hope there is more to come on the story of Rey. The First Order will be a good successor to the Empire. The battles in the movie were exciting and looked amazing in 3D. The acting overall was pretty decent. The Force Awakens was without a doubt in my mind one of the better movies of 2015, and definitely deserves future sequels that hopefully build on its strong foundation.",

One thing that I really liked about it was that they brought back the original actors from the first trilogy. Right when they announced that there would be a seventh one, I instantly feared that they would get some random, awful actors to play Luke, Han, Leia, etc... BUT....they didn't do that, and they brought back Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and the rest of the crew. Another thing I liked about the movie was the acting jobs of the main actors and actresses. I thought they did a phenomenal job and definitely surpassed my expectations. The last thing I really liked about it was that it did have some similarities to the original movie. I actually don't think it was that similar to the first one but the ways that it was more similar made it continue the story well and gave it a little bit of the original trilogy feel. Overall, great movie, would definitely watch again, solid 8.5/10.",

Who will carry the movie after the death of Hans Solo? Has Luke been training Jedi in his hideout? Is SL Snoke really Darth Plagus?The saddest part of the movie was the plot. Couldn't they think of something besides the good guys saving the rebellion at the last minute by blowing up a planet/solar system killing machine?Speaking of which, didn't any science advisor point out that when you start draining a sun in a solar system you immediately allow all the planets to fly out of their orbits killing the populations within hours if not minutes?These defects turn this sci-fi fantasy into a sci-fi farce.",

I hoped I'd love it so much I'd want to buy a poster that I could look at and remember how much I enjoyed it. But I've hoped to love a lot of movies and it doesn't always happen. I loved The Force Awakens.It respected what came before and used plots and ideas as backbone and inspiration, but it didn't rely on them. The Force Awakens calls back to the past, but doesn't copy it. It's funnier than the Star Wars movies of the past (and they could be quite funny). The filmmakers know that humor is what saves you from tripping over your own seriousness. And things do get serious, as a Star Wars movie should.But what really struck me about The Force Awakens was the pacing. Many action/adventure movies tumble through their own plots, never stopping long enough to let either action or emotion land - the movie's already on to the next scene. The Force Awakens never does this. Important conversations and contests of wills get the number of minutes they deserve. Moments land, and the whole audience is completely caught in the moment. It was all exactly what I was hoping for.",

    "review": "  Just saw the movie last night for the first time. I opted for the 3D version, and took the family. First, the good. Visuals and quality of the scenes was excellent, and Disney (and Abrams) experience at making films and worlds that are easy on the eye was apparent. Abrams also did a nice job with lighting and angles on most of the shots which accentuated the characters and definition of each scene. The 3D was mostly spectacular, with not too much and not too little, but just the right amount of depth (with a few in your face \"coolness\" moments) to make the extra $ worth it. Resolution and clarity was excellent, although with all 3D movies due to the technology, brightness of the scenes continues to suffer somewhat.However, beyond the big budget quality of the film, there was not much more to like. The story line was dull, there was little suspense, portions of the acting seemed amateurish (Fin in particular), and I felt like I was watching a copy of the original movies. There were at least 3 moments in the film where I was visibly shaking my head back and forth and rolling my eyes over the predictable and downright plagiarist nature of the film (I won't spoil it).If you are expecting a seat of your pants, action thriller with new creative elements, and storylines that make you care about the characters, this movie is not for you. If you want to be mildly entertained for a few hrs by good 3D and pretty scenes, you won't be disappointed.",

    "review": "  While the mass hysteria, expectations born 40 years ago and uber-hype surrounding Episode 7 may brainwash the millions of lemmings out there (and I realize I now risk incurring their wrath), the Force does not awaken, but rather slumbers through what is essentially a bloated remake of the beloved 1977 classic. A very good film for the new Star Wars generation without question, but for us old-school aficionados to which the original trilogy is cinematic scripture, it fails to deliver any lasting emotion, excitement or resonance. Another resistance, another Empire (now called The First Order), another Cantina, even a planet revamped and masquerading as a pseudo Death Star??? Seriously!?!?! I'm not being overly critical, really I'm not. I'm just being true to Lucas' original vision and trilogy and I know there must be other intelligent, genuine cinephiles out there in their 40s who agree with me and know exactly what I'm talking about. Make no mistake, this is not a terrible film. It's passable in every regard. But for those of us who remember the magic and majesty of the original trilogy, it's like having a sip of Coke from an open can that's been sitting on a counter for a month and has long lost its fizzle and taste.",

It is more than a tribute or ode to ?A New Hope? as it is about repeating the same elements. That?s too bad. I was afraid of this considering what Abrams also did with the ?Star Trek? series in which the latest installment is now under the helm of a new director.This is probably the best move for Disney though, in order to protect its $4 billion investment. No doubt it will satisfy fans of the series. But those looking for something fresh and new may have to look elsewhere.",

    "review": "  So here it is after all the build-up and hype. The Force Awakens has been more anticipated than the second coming....Would it be as rubbish as The Phantom Menace? Could it possibly match The Empire Strikes Back? You'll note my personal biases there. My answers in the simplest forms would be \"No\" and \"No\". I don't want to be the one who breaks the unwritten code and gives away elements of the plot for those yet to see the movie but The Force Awakens is a grand Space Opera type movie, spanning numerous worlds on a breathtaking scale. It does deliver in terms of scope, grandeur and styling, fitting neatly into the Star Wars universe as it is established and adding significantly to it. Indeed I was torn by the revelry in the nods to \"A New Hope\"-\"Return of the Jedi\" in terms of recurring tech, ships and characters and an excitement to see how J.J. Abrams would carry the franchise forwards. As with his revisionist of Star Trek, Abrams has done a superb job and clearly loves the subject. The care, craft and dedication to the established vision of George Lucas is clear. I loved the fact that the effects seemed gritty and real, wiping away some of my own disappointment at the plasticky CGI that plagued \"The Phantom Menace\"-\"Attack of the Clones\". Everything looked convincing and solid. Abrams has avoiding the jokey and childish aspects of parts I-III which drew so much criticism, instead he's given us proper characters with real personality and convincing relationships. However, for me, the plot of \"The Force Awakens\" did bear far too many similarities to \"A New Hope\". There are just too many parallels. There's a similar role for a cute droid, a masked baddie with a family connection to major characters, a bar sequence featuring a band and various outlandish alien creatures and a pivotal raid on a super weapon by a squadron of X-Wing fighters. The list goes on. I was also a little unconvinced by the performances of two of the returning actors from the older movies. I think it is fair to say that this is not one of Harrison Ford's best performances. Maybe the pain from his broken ankle was distracting him but he just didn't seem able to recapture the spirit of Han Solo. I missed the twinkle he used to have in his eye and the genuine camaraderie he portrayed with Chewie was missing. However, the biggest problem for me was with Carrie Fisher. She delivers her lines as though she's just been dragged out of a local bar after partaking in a drinking game. She's lost all the regal air of Princess Leia and has none of the gravitas a rebel general would need. She really didn't work for me. A shame as she's such a great character and has been so good in the past. The new characters are well portrayed and I'm really looking forward to seeing how both Daisy Ridley and John Boyega develop as the next movies come along. Indeed, the film ends on a perfect, though completely guessable, cliff-hanger with which to lead into the next film in the saga. Shortcomings aside, this film comes as a huge relief to those of us who queued around the block in 1977 in order to see the first Star Wars movie. I am genuinely looking forward to seeing where the adventure leads us over the coming year and it is great to have such a well loved, admired and cherished franchise back on winning form.",

    "review": "  The bottom line for why this movie worked is because it did exactly what it needed to do; Reestablish Star Wars as it was before Lucas' prequels.Yeah, some of the people who are hating on this movie have valid points, but they forget the fact that we just got a movie far better than Episode I-III and maybe even better than Return of the Jedi. Most people who are giving this move a '0-4' unrealistically bought into the hype as if it was some portal into the future as what this movie has to be. It sets an expectation that not even The Empire Strikes Back could achieve.Sorry, I just had to get that out of the way.Anyway, I'm just going to get the flaws out of the way first, because they're not the point of this review. First off, yes, this film can feel a bit too familiar at several points. A lot of the basic plot, characters, and scenes are strait ripped out of (mostly) A New Hope. The little 'wink wink' and nods to the originals were really the ones that took me at out at some moments, but fortunately, there are few of them, and they are over within seconds. These problems do get a pass for me, because they're more so homages rather than reminders. Second, the Starkiller Base was the line for me. Not only is it absurdly impractical, but it really is just another Death Star. I do appreciate when the film recognizes this, but it was still just a bit too much for my liking.And that's it. Everything else was, well, pretty much perfect.Not only is the start of the film ingenious, but so is (mostly) the rest of the movie. From the opening scene we are given everything we need to know, and how to feel throughout it. Our main characters aren't only incredibly handled, but also human, which is something we haven't seen in Star Wars for a really long time. Something that has to be understood is that these characters are the main focus of this plot, unlike in A New Hope where everything revolved around a planet-destroying ball. Something that can't be unnoticed is the new roles, not only are Rey, Finn, Po and Kylo Ren great characters, but evenly comparable to icons such as Luke, Han, Leia, and Darth Vader. The new roles didn't only have great actors behind them, but actors that wanted to be there, putting in all that they had. When I see an actor like Harrison Ford after thirty years, I didn't see Harrison Ford on screen, I saw Han Solo. The same goes for the other returning cast, with I'll be it, limited screen time. It is also intriguing how fast it is, this is the fastest moving Star Wars since Episode 5, for nearly all scenes have no time for relaxing, which is actually a good thing here. Other misc. things include how technically impressive it is, the music old and new, and how well it sets up this new trilogy. Anything that I didn't mention I probably loved anyway.Overall, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is exactly what this franchise needs. Yes it is mostly Disney playing it safe with a retro style, but if it went too different, then you have a mistake made by the prequels. This film feels like the Star Wars we've known to love, and I can't wait to see where it takes us.",

Han Solo's death was predicted but I still felt some sort of astonishment when he had a fateful encounter with Kylo Ren. BB-8 was actually very different then R2D2 in many ways. Finn had a great backstory and had character and heart. along with comedy; which I respect in any kind of movie. C3PO didn't change a bit, (which I particularly like), and Rey didn't feel like a star wars kind of character but it was interesting to see her become pretty tough even with her backstory.

Nevertheless, when you sit in the cinema watching the X-Wing fighters roar across the ocean, silhouetted by the sun in a futuristic Ride of the Valkyries, you cannot help but be awestruck as the familiar score begins and you are once again turned into a child by the magic of the Star Wars universe.",

    "review": "  Its watchable but not as good as a Lucas film. The good bits: as a little walk down memory lane reminiscing of the old magic, the old crew (specifically Harrison Ford), Daisy Ridley, a lot of action. Daisy Ridley does one of the best jobs I've ever seen of portraying a powerful yet still feminine and human female role model.The bad bits: there's no heart or magic to this film (as there was in every Lucas film). Its just a rehash of old stuff with little character development or pause for atmosphere (something Lucas was great at). He made you feel. Feel part of the story. This is just a series of excitements occurring one after another. If Solo and Chewbacca were not in it, this would be nothing more than a so-so TV B-movie. Maybe this is what American teenagers want to pay to see. If thats the case, they're in for an exciting future because there's a promise of endless of these without Harrison Ford in them. A notable point of failure in the nostalgia - the Millennium Falcon, even having sat in a scrap yard and left rotting for decages, in this film worked better than it ever had.",

    "review": "  Overall the movie was a joy to watch! The acting, practical effects, special effects, and sound were phenomenal. I saw the movie twice, and the IMAX experience was out of this world. IMAX 3D is definitely the best way to go watch it. My only gripe is that I wish a few parts of the storyline were just a tad bit more unique. At times it felt like some of the homages to the original trilogy were excessive and not enough was done to expand the Star Wars universe. You'll understand what I mean after you watch the film. I hope Disney takes more risks in the next two trilogy films. I am fully confident that they are capable of making rockstar films that feel like Star Wars but are also completely unique to the series. Most importantly though, Star Wars is back and for at least the next 5 years to come!",

    "review": "  After seeing it twice, I don't like it.First, the movie is a medley of sorts of the original trilogy (particularly ep. IV), only the plot is way more confusing. I keep reading additional content (like that Aftermath) and I still can't fully grasp what's the situation of the galaxy. It's a mess, and this should have been explained in the movie (having to dig information elsewhere is frustrating). Also, a new Death Star? Really?Second, the pacing is weird. The first half of the movie is somewhat stronger than the second. The ending feels like it doesn't fit and it doesn't feel much like Star Wars.Third, the villains are weak. You can't stop comparing Gen. \"Mux\" with Tarkin, \"KillO'Ben\" with Vader, and \"Supreme Leader Snarf\" with Palpatine - and they all fail to deliver (and it's not the actor's fault...). That Kylo Ren is the stupidest character since Jar Jar Binks. Nothing he says makes sense. \"I'll finish what you started...\" What did Vader start to begin with? Palpatine founded the Empire, Palpatine started hunting down the jedi, Palpatine started every war in both the classical and prequel trilogies... so what the heck is this kid talking about? Finally, having a loving father and mother, being son of two of the greatest heroes of the galaxy wasn't enough... Having the strongest force user as uncle and master is not enough... Somehow he bounded to Supreme Leader Snarf will and - then they repeat the plot again? At least we had 3 movies to try to understand Anakin's fall. By the way, nobody told this stupid kid that the grandfather he worships so much came back to the light before he died? Oh, but that's not enough. The stupid kid had to lose the lightsaber fight so we could grasp how dumb and weak he is. Kylo Ren is like \"Cartman with Authoritah fell to the dark side\" - but dumber.Forth, why wasn't the big imperial ships protecting the big bad base as well? Why that stupid name, \"First Order\"? Why captain Phasma lowered the shield (the price for such treason should be surely death or worse... oh, forget it). Why make lots of puppets and then make Maz Kanata CGI? The movie kept reminding me it was just a movie!Also, that dialogue between Han and Leia. So much of it was unnecessary... Which brings me to what I hated the most about the movie, and the main reason I'm giving it such a low score: it erases anything good and fulfilling we had at the end of Return of the Jedi. Every single one of the original heroes failed miserably in every aspects of their lives. Where is the reward for being good, just and do heroic deeds?So... Han failed as a husband, as a father, as a member of the resistance and overall as a man (a bitter one it seems)... same goes for Leia (oh, she is a general of a sidekick cell that's supported by the republic... great). Luke is the worse of them all: failed as a jedi master, failed as a protector of the galaxy, as uncle, as friend, as brother, as the owner of R2D2... the plot seemed to be around finding Luke, but the movie ends and he's done nothing and you get to wonder: why? Why do they need him? What do they need him for? The resistance certainly can handle any new Death Star that appears, and it seems the plumber trooper and junkyard girl can surely handle the stupid angry kid. All that, and R2D2 being in a coma because he's sad sounds so absurd... Didn't the little droid survived the killing of younglings by Anakin Skywalker? Didn't he watch the purge of the jedi and the founding of the Empire?Well, I guess that's it. I had to watch it 2 times to be sure I didn't like it, but the more I think about it, the worse it gets. I was going to keep it to myself, but after seeing how angry \"the real fans\" are getting at anyone that disagree with them, I felt I had to come and share with you, that also didn't like the movie, that you are not alone. I can only hope the next one will end up being so good it's going to redeem this one.",

The new line-up of characters are not so spectacular at all, nor convincing. Also, the script isn't ambitious enough, but that's understandable for such a great leap for Disney in reviving the franchise- play it safe. While Rey is indeed an interesting yet repetitive addition, as well as BB-8 is. Flinn fails to capture the real drama of being a rogue stormtrooper.Poe was one of the most promising, an his acting and character is good, but heavily under used. As far as the Dark side is concerned, Kylo Ren and the Knights of Ren, for me, where really a highlight.A new Death Star... Almost lost me there, even more when the attack plan was the same cliche like in the previous ones. Overall, I guess the nostalgia and the experience of seeing it in IMAX guarantees you a memorable trip into a Galaxy far far away...",

No earth shaking visual new technologies were to be found. But it did feel like watching a continuation of the old Star Wars flicks, which I am sure was its intended purpose. There were some exciting scenes to be sure, but not of the caliber I was expecting, based on the rave reviews this movie has garnered. It was enjoyable to watch, I will admit. But I think it is being a tad bit overrated by the critics. It is a good movie; but not a great movie. \"May the Force be with you!\"",

I have always supported the choice of JJ Abrams as director of the film as it has great films in the curriculum as \"Super 8\" and yet reborn another franchise also science fiction and also very famous \"Star Trek,\" and not regretted it because it He held the desire of every fan of the saga, which is to make a new story with great new characters, adding relevance to the familiar characters from previous films and introduce new worlds and knowledge about the universe. In terms of performances this definitely is the best film in the franchise, Harrison Ford returns as \"Han Solo\" and not only back to make the character we know as also adds more layers to it, Oscar Isaac as \"Poe Dameron\" is excellent and could appear a little more than he is, John Boyega like \"Finn\" is amazing it has a lot of energy to the role you see he is really happy to be in the movie, and Adam Driver as \"Kylo-Ren\" managed to create a new villain very different than \"Darth Vader\" as he has much more emotional conflicts and does not come as a total master of the force since it shows that it is still inexperienced. More most certainly surprise is Daisy Ridley as \"Rey\", she is the star of the film, her performance is quiet but very talented, I've really fallen in love with her and I'm coming to see anything she is now. Technically then I already think unnecessary talk, after all who is going to see \"Star Wars\" already know what to expect from this question that is a visual spectacle, and again yes it is, especially for this film using more practical effects and scenarios real than the last film made by giving more reality to the film and leaving the CGI much smoother and cleaner time to be used, and already on the 3D that was the best 3D EXPERIENCE I have ever had at the movies, no kidding . Of course, John Williams as always hands us another fantastic, engaging and relevant soundtrack in time to thrill even in the most exciting scenes. Look I can even be a little too excited, but the impression I got those two times I went to the cinema to see \"Star Wars: Episode VII\" is that this is possibly the best movie of all franchise next to \"The Empire Strikes Back, \"and honestly I know there are many good films in 2015, more for me not to hear a more rewarding film than that this year, so for me\" The Force Awakens \"is the best 2015 movie no doubt.",

    "review": "  This movie is not a remake or rehash of ANH any more than Ep 1 was, and it is MUCH less similar to ANH than Ep 6 was. It has more differences than similarities to ANH and takes the familiar elements that it does use and turns them inside out and backwards, resulting in a deeper, better film. Rey is no Mary Sue. Luke was knocked out by sand people but that's his only failure in ANH. Rey fared worse; she is paralyzed by Kylo Ren, rendered unconscious and captured. She accidentally causes the deaths of 8 characters, causes Han to lose his giant freighter ship, and is unable to prevent one friend from dying and another from going into a coma. If you go on a space adventure, you definitely do NOT want Rey watching your back! Also, you have to wonder how the haters can simultaneously believe Rey is a Mary Sue and that TFA is a remake of ANH, unless Luke was a Mary Sue! Regarding that final fight, complainers overlook that Kylo was twice injured before he started fighting Rey. First by Chewbacca. The movie took great pains to show how powerful Chewie's crossbow is. Recall when Han asked if he could use it? He blew a stormtrooper sky high then said, \"I like this thing.\" That was to let you know later, when Kylo is struck by a bolt from the same weapon, of just how powerful a shot Kylo took. He was bleeding all over the ground before they started their duel. And he took another hit from Finn before Rey took over. The haters ignore this. Rey's victory was not as impressive as Luke knocking out a stormtrooper, donning his uniform, shooting up a bunch of guards, rescuing Leia, and going from farm boy to the Rebellion's best pilot in 2 hours, destroying the death star - without his targeting computer! but using \"The Force\" after a total of 5 minutes' of training from Obi Wan. And how about Rey's partially successful attempt to resist Kylo's mind probe? Ridiculous? \"Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.\" Who said that? Darth Vader of Leia in ANH -- Leia, a Skywalker with no force training! Vader could not pull the location of the Rebel base out of her, even though he was the baddest sith going.Besides, this movie drops so many hints of Rey's prior training it could not be more obvious. This will be made express in Episode 8, but this movie intentionally planted the seed for that. The haters are just very slow on the uptake. When you consider that groups of men are actually boycotting TFA because a woman is the protagonist, you understand where at least some of this is coming from. \"How dare a woman pick up the light saber and defeat the bad guy after her male comrade is defeated!\" Welcome to the 19th Century! I didn't think that's what \"A long long time ago\" meant LOL! Fact is, this movie is an improbable gift! 25 years ago, if anyone had told me one of the very best Star Wars films, in which Han Solo would figure prominently, would be released in 2015, I would have suggested they lay off the sauce. For me, One element that makes this film work so well is the instinctive empathy and compassion of Rey, it permeates everything she does even while she is at the same time as hard as nails, and the moral determination of Finn. Finn for all his bumbling machismo, is someone you admire for his unerring and moral compass. Even Solo, wizened by years, is driven to his own best moment by compassion. And it is all delivered in the context of a thrill ride of an action movie that never stops. There's nothing message-like about it. It is baked into the characters and drama. They all embody the light side by their actions more than Obi Wan ever did by talking about it. Even though in trying to measure objectively I place this behind The Empire Strikes Back, I have actually enjoyed it personally more than any other Star Wars film - maybe because its very existence seems so improbable, maybe because it is heartening in late middle age to see Han Solo roughing up aliens and pirates in his mid-70s, maybe because Daisy Ridley is just such an excellent actress, or maybe because I know this is just the start and that there are at least 5 more films to come. It is like the Star Wars universe was dead and gone and has now been brought gloriously back to life. I've seen The Force Awakens twice. The first time in 2D. Second time in 3D. My recommendation. See it in 3D! There was one moment when the tip of a star destroyer hovering in space seemed to be about to bump my nose! Han Solo and Rey dominate this movie. Together they are the engine that makes it go. They hold it on their shoulders. Finn and Poe are great, but in this installment, they took a bit of a back seat. Harrison Ford kicks azz and Daisy Ridley is amazing, versatile, sympathetic. She tears at your heart. Whoever cast her deserves a bonus, and Daisy deserves to be a major star. Most importantly the characters interplay excellently. Rey's major moment brought tears to my eyes literally. The audience cheered. It was just magnificent.",

I've read most of the books that follow Ep.6. .I had heard that Disney did not want George Lucas involved (somewhat understandable after Ep.1), but they have obviously decided that they also could care less about long-time Star Wars fans & the existing Star Wars storyline. The one thing that Lucas did right is that he insured that the books, TV series, etc. were all consistent re: the long-term storyline.

    "review": "  I have seen all Star Wars movies and unfortunately including this one.When J.J Abrams did a reboot of Star Trek, I was pleasantly surprised even as I was dismayed that Star Trek was turned into something it was not--a low brow action flick. But I also enjoyed the sequel--Star Trek: Into Darkness--with some reservation.Back to Star Wars: I did not like this movie and I did not understand what it's intent was. The story telling was poor, the acting was poor, the animation was poor , the use of 3D was poor and it did not have the largess of a typical Star Wars movie. It lacked polish through and through and it turned the force into a side joke. It might be fair to say that it destroyed Star Wars for any loyal fan. I am not sure of the impact it will have for younger viewers who have never seen Star Wars before this one.My expectations might have been too high, but the only person who has done Star Wars right so far has been George Lucas.I can suspect that the challenge of rebooting a franchise can be a daunting task. I am sure that the was work was hard and it is easy to be a critic, but this was a poorly done movie.",

    "review": "  It is simply a marvel to witness the over hyping of a Hollywood blockbuster. The Force Awakens is a pretty good movie but Academy Award good as its critics rating would suggest? Not according to this discerning eye. Some basic observations.*Spoilers ahead*The positives: - Top notch CGI and engaging action sequences, as expected of Star Wars films.- Solid casting and strong performances by Daisy Ridley as well as Harrison Ford. It would not be a stretch to say that Rey effectively carried the film until Solo showed up. BB-8 was also pretty amusing for a non-human role. - The adequate use of humor without it becoming distracting or overbearing. Star Wars isn't a comedy so the sprinkling of humor was just the right amount.- No Jar Jar Binks like character. Let's face it, this alone was worth 1 star due to the pain that amphibian inflicted on the audience in the prequels. The negatives: - Far too many plot holes and fallacies. Why is the Resistance called such and why is it a separate entity from the Republic? If the Republic gained the upper hand after the battle of Endor, why would it feel the need to create a proxy militia to fight the Imperial remnants? Geo-politically it makes absolutely no sense. Also, why is the is the Republic only a handful of planets? Next, how was Finn able to reverse his life long brainwashing due to one single event that he was certainly to have been trained to endure? Most psychologists would be baffled by that I imagine. - Irritating and unconvincing villain. Kylo Ren was far too emotionally unstable and teenage like. That is hardly menacing by any stretch of the imagination. - While the casting for the main characters were mostly on point, there were simply too many minor characters. Phasma was basically a non-factor for the entire film despite the heavy marketing. And who was that storm trooper that called Finn a traitor before fighting him with the electro-baton thingy. It would have been nice to dive a little deeper into Finn's past as a First Order trainee and the relationships he built which may have served to explain why he abandoned it so readily. Missed opportunity. As a whole The Force Awakens works as a film and was entertaining. It certainly had its sentimental moments such as the Solo and Kylo scene but once you get over the nostalgia, the inherent flaws makes it rather difficult to rate this as anything but a 70% effort.",

    "review": "  The ideas in this screenplay must have come from a fear of failure rather than an opportunity to create a new fresh path that would add to the Star Wars franchise. They take the \"Luke I am your Father\" idea from \"Empire\" and transfer it to Harrison Ford this time. Then they take the Death Star idea and from the original Star Wars and just give it the ability to kill multiple planets at the same time. And the protagonists are not real. The Daisy Ridley character is an expert at everything! In the original Star Wars we hear that Luke is an excellent pilot but he must spend time training with Obi Wan to gain skills with the light sabre -- then when he fights its believable! Not Rey -- she's an expert pilot, mechanic, and an instantaneous expert at with the light sabre with no training at all -- she defeats the main antagonist who has ostensibly spent his life training with the light sabre for the dark side. When we go into a film like this we know of course it's not real -- and so its the job of the writers to draw us in by making the characters feel real human which means they all have certain strengths and weaknesses -- They really need to let George write theses stories as he's a very creative writer -- this is his baby and he knows where it needs to go.",

    "review": "  This review is rated SPOILERIFIC by Fly Casual Podcast. Virgin eyes and ears have been warned.The Force Awakens is here! FINALLY! After a year and a half of all the news, rumors and outright wackiness (at least from the crew at Fly Casual Podcast), we have our first taste of the new age of Star Wars. JJ Abrams and Disney deliver on the most anticipated movie of the year in a BIG way. As I write, The Force Awakens has been crowned king of the domestic box office $770 Million in gross receipts and has broken a myriad of records. Worldwide, the film is currently at $1.5 Billion with the movie opening in China today. The movie is at 93% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. What's not to like about this movie?There are a million different angles you can take on this, so instead of me trying to rationalize each and show how smart I think I am for having such a broad view, I am just going to give you my background with Star Wars to set the stage for this review so you get the sense of where I am coming from. I am a forty-something who has seen all of the films in the theater, albeit A New Hope was at the 1979 re-release. I grew up in the 80's with my Kenner Star Wars toys and have been there since the beginning. I avidly partook in what was called the Star Wars Expanded Universe (EU) which is all the books, games, and extra-movie material that came out almost from day one. I am what you would call an uber-fan of Star Wars. Not only is The Empire Strikes Back my favorite of the movies, I think it is one of the greatest films of all time. I love John Williams's scores for the films. I love Ben Burt's sound production. When people think of how a laser bolt sounds, they are actually hearing Ben Burt hitting a ground wire on a telephone pole with a wrench and the resulting vibrations. I am deeply entrenched in this stuff to the point that I co-host a Star Wars podcast with other Uber nerds and debate this stuff. I appreciate George Lucas's vision, but I am not an apologist. The man has flaws and they were on full display in the prequels. But don't get me wrong; I don't hate the prequels. Like most people leading up to this movie I had fun debating what we would see with the Disney/JJ Abrams incarnation. Listeners of Fly Casual over the last year and a half know how deeply we delved into these discussions. It's been lots and lots of fun. BUT, would the movie live up to the hype?As regular listeners of the show know, I was \"not available\" on December 17 when the rest of the Fly Casual crew went to see the movie and recorded Episode 70 live immediately after the movie. Following is my addendum to that episode.I have now seen the movie 4 times. Believe it or not, I saw it 3 times in the first 24 hours! I didn't realize this until a friend pointed it out. The first was by myself the evening of the 17th. I couldn't see it with the guys, but made it happen later at the 11:15 showing at our local theater. This was by far, my least favorite of the four times due in part to my criticisms of the film, a bladder FULL of Diet Coke, and over 3 hours of run time when you include trailers! My second viewing was the next day with my business partner. We skipped out and saw the film at the same theater at the 11 AM showing. My criticisms remained, but my \"under-control-bladder\" situation helped immensely with increased enjoyment levels. Later the same evening, my kids begged me to take them, so what's a dad to do? I felt pretty much the same at this viewing that I did at the viewing earlier in the day, but we were in a different theater that had the volumes MUCH higher and at a far more enjoyable level for me.My final viewing was in IMAX 3D. Now, our local \"IMAX\" theaters aren't true 70mm, but I am not a fan of 3D to begin with and this viewing did little to change that. I am not sure that seeing the film in 70mm would have helped, BUT the sound was even better with the demonstrably superior sound system in the theater.So let's just get this out there now. I am not \"gaga\" over the film as most people are and the way that most of my cohorts on Fly Casual are. I don't dislike the film. It was good! It has some very strong points. But the movie is not the home run I had hoped for leading up to its release. So let's get into the nitty gritty.The GoodGoing into the film, EVERYONE was buzzing about the \"practical effects\" that JJ Abrams planned to employ in the film. For the most part, he did not disappoint. Many felt like one of the things that made the original trilogy great was Lucas's limitations with special effects that forced him to rely on landscapes and well-conceived camera angles to deliver his film. When the effects-heavy prequels rolled around, Lucas seemingly forgot what made the originals great and embraced what many feel were lifeless performances by his actors due to lack of directing and nothing but green-screen sets to play off while delivering their performances. Abrams seems to have found the right balance of special effects and live sets. The film certainly felt more grounded, even if some of the sets and landscapes were too reminiscent of past films. If it looks like Tatooine and sounds like Tatooine and smells like Tatooine then why are we on Jakku???? In my opinion, Daisy Ridley stole the show. The character Rey was the right amount of everything: vulnerable, strong, gorgeous, expressive, funny, and \"Roberta Badass.\" Some are actually criticizing the character as being a \"Mary Sue,\" but I am all about it. She is definitely the new Luke in the series and I am excited about having an intriguing female character like this being the new lead in Star Wars.Lupita Nyong'o's character, Maz Kanata, almost, stole the show from Rey... almost. By far she had my favorite line in the movie, \"Where's my boyfriend? I love that Wookie.\" The character is a Yoda analogue; a character that has been around for a millennia and has seen it all. With lines like, \"I have lived long enough to see the same eyes in different people. I see your eyes. I know your eyes\" one would think that in order to portray such a deep character you would need a wizened sage of an actor. Well look no further than barely-30-something Nyong'o. Her performance was brilliant. Han Solo is one of those iconic characters you don't want to screw up. Everyone is thankful for Harrison Ford and his $23 million return to the role. Han and Chewie are definitely a highlight of the film. There were a few times that Ford showed his age (running away from rathtars) and one time that Abrams skated dangerously close to the absurd (no-look shooting). But he represented the old guard well going toe to toe with Ridley and Boyega. He brilliantly portrayed a still brash and reckless Han Solo who IS 30 years older AND wiser. He will be missed from the franchise. I don't want to say that John Boyega's character Finn was the \"surprise\" hit of the film, but it felt that way to me. By all accounts leading up to the film, he was a talented actor and was expected to be the next Luke Skywalker in the series. I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was because going in, our only real exposure to him was one or two lines in the trailers and a lot of desert sweating. A LOT of sweating. To my delight, I loved Finn's character, who, by the way, is closer to a Han Solo than a Luke Skywalker. Finn is a loner who wants to run away as far as he can from the First Order. He does this to the point that he is lying to EVERYONE around him about his true intentions. If not for his affinity for Rey, he would have been long gone, much like Han's affinity for Leia in the original trilogy and desire to have nothing to do with the Rebellion. He was certainly a heavy part of the comic relief. I am interested to see where this character goes. I think I know where just about everyone else is going. Finn is up in the air.Adam Driver's character Kylo Ren has received mixed reviews from the people with whom I have spoken. Most critics are saying that he is not \"evil\" enough to be the new trilogy's villain. He is whiny and out of control. To me, these are the things I LOVE about him. Here is a darkside Force user who is being tempted by the LIGHT! He is a Skywalker! I am actually glad that we have a villain that isn't a scarred-beyond-recognition-amputee! I want to know more about him. Why did he betray Luke and the Jedi? What happened during the rebellion? Why is he so obsessed with Vader? How does Snoke play into his betrayal. I also thought that despite having to set up this character very fast to get to the payoff of the Solo death scene, both he and Ford played it as well as it could be played. From the tear shedding by Ren that had us believing for a moment that he was going to go with his father to the final touch of Solo's hand on Ren's face. Kudos on the performance. I am a fan. The BadAnyone who knows me understands that Luke was my hero growing up. The day I heard we were getting Ep VII and that the original cast was back I started conjuring images in my mind of Luke's return to the silver screen and the badassery that must ensue. Fast forward to December 18. Saying I was a little disappointed would be an understatement. I get it. The movie turned into the quest for Luke. Rumors early on were suggesting a very limited role for Mark Hamill in the film. I was somewhat prepared, but I really didn't think we wouldn't even be getting a single line from Luke. Listeners of Fly Casual know about what we call the \"Fan Boy Wet Dream.\" In said \"dream\" scenario our hope was more along the lines of Luke being found and participating in the final battle sequences. Instead we get a robed figure turning around and pulling down his hood. Que music. I am taking this as well as I can and hoping for previously mentioned badassery to commence in VIII AND IX. Don't let me down Rian!John Williams is THE MAN! He has written every major movie score throughout my youth, formative years, and adulthood. The man is a genius with scores like Star Wars, ET, Indiana Jones, Jaws, Harry Potter, and a million others. The man is also 83 years old. The score for this film felt like an 83 year old man wrote it. What I mean is that it is not very memorable, with the exception of classic trilogy themes, I really don't remember the soundtrack at all. Even though Attack of the Clones is my least favorite of the films, I still remember the Anakin/Padme love theme which was brilliant. The best I can say about the new score is that I remember hearing the Rey theme and remember liking it, but please don't ask me to hum it. This is more than a little disappointing. Part of the problem is that the sound track in general is mixed poorly in my opinion (see The Ugly below). It feels like JJ called up Williams, and in his head was like, \"What?! Another one?\" They paid him a bajillion dollars and he futzed his way through it. I will be frankly surprised if he returns for VIII at 85 years old. I think they should have thought more long term, ripped off the Band-Aid, and made the change now.I remember our very first cast of Fly Casual in the summer of 2014 and talking about Disney choosing JJ Abrams to direct. We saw JJ's involvement as a double edged sword. We all knew what he could do with \"look and feel\" through \"Super 8\" and the Star Trek reboots. But one of our earliest criticisms of him was that he tended to sacrifice story and originality for said \"look and feel.\" The more the rumors and images poured in over the next year and a half. The more concerned we became. Unfortunately he did not prove us wrong. In many many ways, this film is almost a complete replica of A New Hope complete with desert dwellers, a young idealistic kid, a sage old man, a rogue, droid carrying secret data, a masked villain, and on and on and on. After seeing The Force Awakens, I am happy that JJ was involved, but I am somewhat relieved he won't be back for snow planets, metal walking tanks, and a city in the clouds called \"Jackee\" in Ep VIII. Can anyone explain who or what is the Republic? I thought there should be more exposition there. Now I do realize that the \"Empire\" was pretty vague at the time of A New Hope, but I think that was out of necessity at that time. I think they could have been clearer about the status of Coruscant and the New Republic. Captain Phasma: wait, what? Rathtars: Unnecessary. Didn't feel like Star Wars.The UglyAlluded to above, my biggest complaint with this film, by FAR, is the sound track. By \"soundtrack,\" I don't mean the just the music. The music was only the tip of the ice berg. I mean the sound effects, the music, and the mix. Why they felt like they had to completely recreate the sound of laser bolts is beyond my comprehension. When they purchased Lucasfilm, they inherited Ben Burt's sound library complete with the most recognizable laser sound effects in existence. When someone describes a laser blast, I would argue that most people hear Ben Burt's version. Suddenly laser rifles sound like crappy 1970's sci-fi. I was stunned. Even light sabers were changed. HOW ON EARTH DO YOU SCREW UP LIGHT SABERS?! I'll even give them a pass on Kylo Ren's lightsaber since it is \"unique.\" But Skywalker's light saber sounded more like a jet engine! Part of the reason none of the music was memorable to me is that I couldn't hear it most of the time. Foreign Correspondent Steve Potter in the UK shares many of my criticisms of the film. He has told me that he has purchased the musical score and after listening to it, isolated from the film, he actually likes it. If that is the case, if there really is good music to present, why the hell is it tucked so deep into the sound track? After my first viewing of the film, I was downright mad. Now part of that was because of previously said full bladder. But even after my second and third viewing, that criticism remained. I will admit that at my 4th viewing at the IMAX Theater, I was able to hear many of the classic and familiar sounds I missed in previous viewings, BUT I still had to concentrate to hear them. I felt like the soundtrack was REALLY rushed on this film... almost to the point that the film was unrecognizable and unenjoyable to me. Call me an uber-nerd if you want and you're probably right that most people don't care or recognize this as a problem, but I do. With JJ Abrams reputation for look and feel, this was an unexpected misstep in my opinion. As previously discussed, JJ's \"return to the well\" of A New Hope was a noticeable problem. The icing on the cake is Deathstar 3, aka Starkiller Base. This was an absolute eye roller to me. There HAD to be another way to bring the film to a climatic end. That was just damn poor writing, Mr. Kasdan. When the Resistance was in the war room and Poe pulled up the side-by-side of the Deathstar and Starkiler base, I thought I was going to lose it. JJ is getting a LOT of flack right now from Lucas and other critics for making a \"nostalgia film.\" Had there not been a Deathstar 3, I would stand in defense of him. He honestly deserves all the criticism he gets for that one. This is a total lack of creativity in my opinion.My final criticism of the film will only be relatable to fans of the EU. Many of us waited eagerly to see if beloved EU characters Jacen & Jaina (Han and Leia's twin children) would make their big screen debut in The Force Awakens in the form of Kylo Ren and Rey. We knew there was at best a 50/50 chance these characters would transition over to the New Canon (or Disney's newly established Star Wars timeline which renders most of the prior EU irrelevant). But not only did they tell us that Jacen and Jaina will not exist, but they also flipped us the bird when they revealed Kylo Ren's birth name to be \"Ben\" Solo. You see, in the old EU, Luke's son's name was Ben. I know some in my circle of friends are patiently waiting and hoping for revelations/explanations or even other EU characters to end up in the movies. In my mind this is a clear sign that the EU will have no place in the new movies, and frankly, this disappoints me. I will still enjoy the films. I enjoyed this film. But it would have been nice to feel like the filmmakers threw the uber-fans a bone. The LowdownStar Wars films evolve over time with me. Right now, I can't give this film more than 3 out of 5 stars. Good movie. I really enjoyed it. My kids enjoyed it. The film will become part of my collection. But it just doesn't have the classic feel with me yet. I am not certain about the staying power. I will say that I am glad that there is mystery returning to the saga. With the prequels, you always knew where they were headed. That is an inherent problem with prequels. With these new sequels, anything is possible again and THAT is exciting!My Star Wars order of favorite movies:1. The Empire Strikes Back2. A New Hope3. Return of the Jedi4. The Force Awakens5. Revenge of the Sith6. The Phantom Menace7. Attack of the Clones",

Abrams does a fine job in the continuation of Geo Lucas' visionary cosmic fable. Political correctness has visited that galaxy far, far away as now our heroine is Rey (Daisy Ridley) a space scavenger just getting by in the dusty outer planets and her hero of color Finn (John Boyega) who has deserted the First Order after a moment of conscience where he could not act as a deadly Storm Trooper and execute the innocent. You see, it's the 27th century or such and we have evolved! That aside, both do fine jobs and there are tongue in cheek moments with the wink, wink, nod, nod cuteness that really works as it's sprinkled in dashs. Stealing the show is BB-8, the new droid that is a whirling sphere with a frisbee hat that swirls, rotates, slides, glides and does all manner of mystical adherence to its first master, resistance pilot played by Oscar Isaac, who is a superb actor and feels a bit out of his sartorial element here. Nevertheless, the pursuit of truth, justice and the galactic way must continue. Darth Vader is the grandfather of the newest cosmic sadist with a saber, now played by Adam Driver as Kylo Rey and boy is he pissed. You see the force is with him, sort of. He just can't seem to wrap his light saber completely around being the lost, forgotten progeny of Hans Solo and Princess Leia. No matter, the cosmic sword play, planetary explosions and just damn fine CGI is terrific. The film is worthy of seeing in IMAX 3D and visually it does not disappoint. Minimal CGI as best as could be hoped appears and of course there are the signature Lucas space odd balls, galactic miscreants and shape shifting wierdos that you would expect. Max Von Sydow plays the long gone Alec Guiness and Carrie Fisher reprises and now General Leia sadly resigned to the impossibility of knotted hair and a meteoric turn in a bikini. The Wookie Chewbacca grunts in his dog suit to great effect. All in all a great ride, but in the grand scheme of worthy best picture 2015 offers, this film should not be nominated nor awarded. Far, far more worthy are Brooklyn, Sicario, Room, Spotlight, The Big Short and The Revenant. Most curious of all is how that centuries from now, in those galaxies far, far away, is it that the young heroine Rey has traversed the galaxy yet has a strong English accent as strong as if she'd just had afternoon tea with Her Majestiy. Go figure...but do go enjoy...",

Once the trailers started coming out for The Force Awakens, I started to feel a bit better about it. Then I finally saw the movie, and boy did I LOVE IT! Abrams did an amazing job at capturing what was so good about the original trilogy while combining it with other amazing new elements. The characters, both old and new, are fantastic and funny in this and the Star Wars style action will turn you back into that giddy kid you were when you when you first saw the originals. Sure the story is pretty similar to Episode IV's, but it still has enough new stuff to make it stand on its own. A Fantastic return to the galaxy far, far away. Sorry I once doubted you.

    "review": "  The Force is strong in this movie. With a star making performance from Daisy Ridley, some other strong performances from John Boyega, Harrison Ford, and Adam Driver, the FA is a tour-d-force when it comes to even movies. The plot is a bit like A New Hope, but there are enough differences to the story, Harrison Ford shines as Han Solo, when he cracks that crocked smile with his silver hair. You are thrown into a time warp that doesn't feel dated at all. The other great editions (but the people who are not in it long enough) are Snoke, Maz, captain Phasma and Poe. Hopefully, the next few installments will fix this. The action scenes are great, (especially the big light fight saber fight at the end), so this movie has a lot of good going for it. The real strength of the movie is the two main young leads. John Voyega, and the luminous new comer Daisy Ridley, who runs through every scene in the movie like Donald Trump would burn a lie detector test up. She steals every scene with a wonderful mix of strength, vulnerability, and innocence. Her performance is worthy of an Oscar nod. Princess Leia shows up later in the movie, and it is good to see Carrie again, strong, intelligent and feisty as ever! The best moments involve Rey sliding down on her sled in the Jakku sun, Fin and Poe with their awesome bromance, Solo when he tries to talk to someone not to go to the dark side and Snoke telling Ren that he wants him to finish a task to see if he he ready to make the next move. The pacing is really good, and the movie has JJ Abraham's trademarks like the lens flair, the fast moving edits and the dark colors mixed with bring lines. They are used to great effect in this movie and JJ knows the force every inside and out. He knows what fans want and he delivers in spades.",

This spectacular film restores the franchise to what the Original Trilogy had established nearly 40 years ago. The plot that The Force Awakens hearkens back to that of A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back, revealing surprising new twists and turns, but JJ Abrams pulls it off by effectively using familiar themes that tie this new trilogy and the original trilogy together. But this repetition of material is made possible with the outstanding cast. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher jump into their roles with ease and it is a real treat to catch up with these beloved characters as the film progresses. Of course, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac help to rejuvenate the franchise and are welcome additions to the Star Wars universe. As always, John Williams creates a phenomenal soundtrack composed of familiar melodies and new scores. The Force Awakens is a welcome sequel to the Star Wars franchise and I cannot wait to see what the next film has to offer.",

But it's not a standalone movie. and.. it was not supposed to be a Disney production.. (thank you Lucas.. hope you enjoy your millions). It's supposed to be a Star Wars sequel!After watching it opening night.. it was simply another disaster in a long line of disasters perpetrated by mega corporations on people's fond memories of films past. At least Jurassic World tried some to preserve the continuity of the original trilogy. Barring a few goofy missteps with raptors fighting alongside humans, it was a fairly entertaining remake. I had no hard feelings... but Star Wars is special.. It's our childhood. This movie made me appreciate the prequels! Have no desire to watch what happens next.. How can anyone want to see more? What's the \"Empire Strikes Back\" to this? The inept first order who only possessed one weapon requiring hours of charging and ignored buying some extra fleets of tie-fighters for good measure if they were swarmed? A goofy post-pubescent villain who evoked laughter rather than instill fear when he removed his mask. I was reminded of the time Dark Helmet in Space Balls removed his.. at least that movie was funny!How was the \"force\" the underdogs in this plot? Why go through the entire movie trying to find a lost Luke? Is he unreachable via the force? More importantly what's his role? We already have our Mary Sue to the rescue. She could very well have conjured a petronus charm and waved off all evil from the galaxy. I understand the need to provide a strong role model for 10 year old girls; movie seems to be targeted at the Frozen audience in that way..but seriously, even 10 year old girls know better and will hate this movie! Viewers are being misled. I am highly skeptical of the unusually large number of positive reviewers showered at this movie so close to release. It just rubs the cynical in me the wrong way. No way so many people liked it..anyone I run across who's watched it has mixed feelings or disliked it totally. But I guess studios have to create the hype for box-office ratings.I think this movie was riding on the success of the earlier movies. A true measure of success for this movie will be the second one.. which will have to stand on the shoulders of this disaster. Let's see how that goes. Will buy used dvd's for the next two to see what happens.. no way am I going to throw good money at this corporatized ideological nonsense. Maybe they hand it over to Michael Bay.. at least the action scenes would have some life.. cuz the rest of it is just one big black hole.",

    "review": "  Having grown up under the loving embrace of a huge Star Wars fan, this movie far surpassed my pessimistic expectations. While it certainly wasn't without flaws, it used those flaws to its advantage and filled viewers with nostalgia and good feelings.Marketing wise, I feel like work could have been done. Some scenes that I believe would have made for incredible trailer fodder were glazed over completely. However, it wasn't as if the film needed a ton of hype to begin with. You could have just put a blank screen with \"Star Wars\" and a release date written in comic sans and people would still be writing blog essays on their theories on what possibilities such a deep trailer could possess. Good use of that wondersome man, Harrison Ford.Music was flawless, right on point with incredible timing and rhythm. It held quite a bit of the appeal of the original films' soundtracks, and each track suited it's scene. The only improvement I can see is not to change anything there, but to add something that I felt was neglected. You remember Vader's awesome theme that played every time his intimidating form stepped onto the screen? Yeah... this film's main villain lacks such an iconic measure. Maybe next time guys?Visuals were very impressive. 3D however did not enhance the experience whatsoever. But I have a disdain for 3D anyway. CGI was mostly convincing, and I did not see any clipping or blurring issues that would make it less realistic. PRACTICAL EFFECTS, I was so pleased with the costumes, puppets, and animatronics. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.Characterization and writing was pretty spot on. Though some characters were obviously weaker than others (one of the main characters needs work) it is obvious that care was taken to the source material as well as the fact we get a bajillion sequels for characters to grow and develop. This kept the pacing under control, and the story flowed pretty nicely as well. Very satisfied.Highest Pros- Ship battles, camera work, strong but realistic female charactersLowest Cons- Villain actor choices all across the board. I'm not intimidated by anyone on the enemy side thus-far. The characters themselves have shock and power, but the actors chosen may be lacking. Sequels will tell us if its totally so.",

    "review": "  STAR WARS EPISODIO VII \"EL DESPERTAR DE LOS NOST�LGICOS\"Ya tuve la oportunidad de apreciar tres veces el nuevo filme de J. J. Abrams. La primera vez, siendo tajante, no me gust�. La segunda, me termin� conquistando (posiblemente gracias a la experiencia inmersiva de la tecnolog�a IMAX). Y la tercera ya fue para establecer mis conclusiones entre el lado oscuro del \"no me gusta para nada\" y el luminoso de \"soy muy friki, me gusta todo de Star Wars\". El filme cumpli� claramente su objetivo: entretiene. No obstante, parece que la industria a cargo de esta nueva franquicia ten�a un objetivo mucho m�s grande, el cual fue \"entretener a los fans de la trilog�a original que llevaban un mal sabor de boca por las precuelas\". Y as� fue. Disney hizo una dedicatoria muy expl�cita a todos estos fans, entre los que se encontraban cr�ticos, quienes finalmente terminaron alabando el filme. Pero �es realmente el m�rito merecido? Pues no. The Avengers, otra pel�cula de la misma productora que ten�a m�s o menos la misma misi�n con los fans (con la peque�a diferencia que no cargaba una generaci�n resentida), logr� igual su objetivo similar. Y entonces �cu�l es la raz�n para que dos pel�culas, que quedan relegadas en la categor�a blockbuster, tengan una aprobaci�n abismal de la cr�tica? Bueno, sin fundamento para mi propia cr�tica existe la teor�a de que Disney paga a los cr�ticos cuando lanza algo potencialmente peligroso a las butacas de cine. Pero aun as�, lo m�s probable es que todo est� relacionado a encontrar al ni�o interior de las personas. Y es as� como naci� la nueva estrategia de marketing cinematogr�fico denominado \"nostalgia\", responsable de las infinitas secuelas, reboots y dem�s productos en las que Hollywood ha ca�do porque lo peor que puede pasarles es perder dinero, dejando fuera de lugar el amor al arte.Y \"El Despertar de la Fuerza\" es un producto de ese tipo. De forma insistente, �se merece el m�rito de ser considerada una excelente pel�cula? No, porque en realidad no lo es. Es un m�rito conseguido mediante la subjetividad, aunque cabe la pena destacar que la pel�cula tampoco es mala. Por eso, se hab�a afirmado al comienzo que cumple su objetivo, y s� entretiene, lo cual es un punto a favor. Pero no trasciende. Ni los propios personajes de Rey o Finn van a trascender. Son disfrutables para la pel�cula, claro, pero no lo ser�n para la cultura pop porque son estereotipos de humor y drama yankees. Un argumento para afirmar esto es el decepcionante guion de Lawrence Kasdan, a quien se le ten�a fe, y por ende las l�neas que se le da a Finn. Aunque la culpa en s� es del director, porque donde manda capit�n no manda marinero. Abrams desde que fue elegido por Lucasfilm como capit�n del barco de esta bomba de tiempo no ha hecho otra cosa que confesar su miedo por defraudar a los miles de fans (divididos en los bandos \"h�psters de la nostalgia\" y \"s�, apoyo las precuelas, crec� con ellas, y no son malas\"). Pero el Maestro Yoda ya lo dijo: el miedo lleva al lado oscuro. Y ese miedo fue responsable de la pobreza argumental de esta quinta entrega. Muchos afirman que no existen tantas similitudes entre este filme y \"A New Hope\", pero curiosamente son los mismos que deprecian las precuelas, los \"objetivos fans de la saga\". Sin embargo, �s� existen y son demasiadas! De hecho, cualquier persona en un nivel de fanatismo cero se dar�a cuenta que pr�cticamente todo el arco argumental de \"El Despertar de la Fuerza\" es un calco de la primera pel�cula lanzada en 1977. Esta carencia de innovaci�n ha funcionado porque es fruto del marketing de la nostalgia. Supuestamente, el filme tambi�n incluye lo que las precuelas carec�an: humor y desarrollo de personajes. De lo segundo no se puede discutir, pues realmente se not� el esfuerzo a toda costa de traer personajes sometidos a toda clase de pruebas de fe muy obvias. Pero el humor... Es importante considerar una cosa como humor y otra cosa como chistes flojos y sin sentido. Por ejemplo, Finn le dice a Rey \"�Quieres volver a Jakku? �Tienes un novio guapo ah�?\". Esa sola l�nea puede disputarle el lugar a Jar Jar Binks. La pregunta es �realmente eso es lo que quer�an los fans? �Esa clase de chistes? �Realmente son fans de la trilog�a original y la conocen tan bien como ostentan decirlo? El director de \"El Imperio contraataca\", Irvin Kershner, debiera estar revolc�ndose en su tumba. Personalmente, muchos de esos pasajes a lo largo de la pel�cula me dieron verg�enza ajena. Incluso as� se afirma que el personaje de Finn tendr� potencial. Finalizando, el filme cumple, aunque se siente por dem�s e innecesario. Los personajes son agradables. Tuvieron que crearse nuevos villanos para el nuevo argumento de esta pel�cula, los cuales denotan que est�n fuera de lugar para la antigua saga de seis episodios, donde quien majeaba los hilos era Palpatine. Por otro lado, el filme crea muchas dudas o da por explicado varios acontecimientos, lo cual se siente como arma de doble filo. Se insiste: el filme prometi� lo que iba a ser, y lo logr� con creces. Ha satisfecho a una horda de fans sedientos de la sangre de Jar Jar, sin destacar en innovaci�n o pruebas de trama... temas que George Lucas s� explor� en las tan odiadas precuelas.",

It follows the old story enough to keep as many of the old fans happy while still adding new characters for the next generation of Star Wars family.",

    "review": "  Big fan of the first three, and it was good to find this one was done in the old school style with the necessary updates. Also, keeping over the top CGI and the cast of the Muppet Show out of the movie was a big plus. Kylo Ren is a weak villain however, and lost any intimidation power when he removed his mask. Two armatures that never heard of the \"Force\" took you down? Vader would never take crap from some metrosexual General, like Ren does. The battle scenes are fantastic and leave you wanting more. The new band of heroes introduced, seemed to gel together nicely, although Poe & Fin's \"buddy\" dialog seems a bit forced. Even with it's flaws, and rewarmed plot, it's still a great film, worthy of the franchise.",

Although it reminds a bit too much of episodes IV and V and its pace is a bit too fast, this movie succeeds in entertaining the audience with some solid acting and decent - though not always convincing - plot. The proof of its success is that it makes you want more. Still I wished a bit more time spent with the main characters to learn about them. A special mention for Daisy Ridley who was fresh and excellent.",

    "review": "  ***Spoilers***Just as the first seven words in the film says \"This will begin to make things right\" The Force Awakens does just that. It completely wrights the capsized ship of Star Wars the prequels gave us.Some complaints that the plots of the movie follow the original trilogy are understandable, but this didn't bother me personally. Some complained that Ray learned aspects of the force to quickly as it took Luke a long time to learn. This also didn't bother me as well because Luke had no knowledge of the Force or Jedi where Ray knew the legend of Luke and she probably heard the fantastical things he could do. So once she accepted that she had this power she started trying it out, I mean would you? One of the biggest complaint was that she was able to fight toe to toe with Kylo with no training to the point of even beating him in the end. That as well didn't bother me because of the aforementioned knowledge of Force she had, also the fact that at best Luke only had 3 weeks of formal training between Yoda and Ben and he fought Vader and eventually beat him and Vader wasn't even injured like Kylo was. So training isn't as important as trusting in the force and letting it guide you.My only issue was nitpicky and it's that JJ doesn't have any sense of spacial distances, as you cannot stand on a planet and watch other planets blow up in your own solar system much less planets in a completely other solar system. Just like in star trek where they stood on that moon that wasn't orbiting Vulcan but yet they where able to watch Vulcan be sucked into a black hole. As well as the fact that Star Killer base makes itself useless by draining it's own sun. This would also kill everyone one that planet if you removed it's sun. I know this is not Star Trek and science isn't one of the major things you look for but you still need to keep some things grounded in realty to keep the suspension of disbelief.This film is a must see for Star Wars fans or even new people who haven't seen Star Wars before.",

    "review": "  I?m NOT a ?Star Wars? fan. Never have been, fortunately. But always loved watching action/science fiction movies. When I checked the internet, everywhere I saw that this movie had broken all Box Office records. Then I thought maybe, just maybe, this movie would be special . But it?s not, sadly.I found a lot of negatives than positives. Let me talk about the good part first. The special effects/graphics are amazing! And by ?special effects?, I also mean the beautiful landscapes on different planets, the action, the spaceships and the droids. (I loved BB8 in the movie). And now the negatives. The two things that I disliked the MOST are the story and the acting (by most of the actors).It?s difficult t prove my point without giving spoilers, but it is true that a LOT of the plot elements/ incidents are very similar/same to what has happened in the previous six movies. I was sincerely hoping that Lucas would take the story in brand new direction. But how wrong I was. Almost everything seemed like a repetition of what occurred in the earlier movies. I thought Lucas was very creative. But for some reasons, he decided not go for something original; he just presented the very same concept, that had worked many years back, again. Now about the acting. The veterans have done a great job. Ford (as Han Solo) was remarkable and Fisher (as Leia) was also nice but her role was quite less. Most of the newer/ younger cast were disappointing. John Boyega (as Finn) was irritating. Adam Driver (as Kylo Ren) failed to live up to his role. Ren is actually a very evil character but Driver just didn?t do much justice to the role. Daisy Ridley (as Rey) was very good but sadly her character itself was not sketched properly. What I mean is, Rey is actually a scavenger, surviving by herself on a hostile junkyard of a planet. Now such a person should be very tough and emotionless but she seemed to get emotionally attached to a lot of people. She seemed like a teenage fangirl when she says ?THE Han Solo!!?!!? and ?Luke Skywalker!!??!!!?. Overall, the film has failed to meet my expectations. I was expecting a lot from this film, in all the departments. The story was again a rehash of the previous movies. Most of the newcomer actors were not fit to play the roles they were assigned. After seeing this movie, it?s pretty easy to guess what?s going to happen in the sequel. I was never a ?Star Wars? fan and this movie has failed to change that.",

    "review": "  The first sequel in the new Star Wars sequel trilogy has been hyped up all year. Its been used to basically advertise everything, from trucks, to batteries, to oranges, etc. The movie was directed by J.J Abrams, though he was only brought in to direct The Force Awakens and not the other two in the sequel trilogy. The story, setting, and characters feel rehashed to a really big extent, It has good characters for the most part,and It feels like its rushed.  To begin with it has a really unoriginal plot. It basically mirrors A New Hope and the ending of The Empire Strikes Back. Most of its characters feels like rehashes like Rey being a copy and paste of Luke Skywalker. The settings feel exactly the same but with different names. Jakku is basically Tatoonie, its houses look the same, and the desert looks the same, just with a bunch of destroyed Rebel and Empire vehicles everywhere. The First Order's Starkiller Base is literally just a giant Death Star with a different name. It feels lazy altogether and could of used more creativity.  The Characters in the movie are hit or miss. Rey is too boring and dry. Kylo Ren is a Darth Vader fanatic who is childish, impatient and whiny. He throws a big temper tantrum when something doesn't go his way, which makes me hate him as a villain. Which is a good job to me.The character Finn in the movie was actually pretty good as he brought a new point of view as a defecting First Order storm trooper. A over hyped character named Captain Phasma appears for like 3 scenes and barely does anything, a total disappointment . Some of the actors from the original Star Wars trilogy comes back and they put on a pretty good performance. Most of the acting isn't bad but the acting that is, is down right terrible. Finally, the film feels rushed and made to only sell because of name not story. It seems extremely stale in the beginning and becomes exciting towards the end with tons of action. If they took more time it would go beyond of being a sub par movie. I would recommend seeing it, its a good OK movie for today's standards but nothing special. The original trilogy was special because it was made to be something different and was different from its time. The Force Awakens feels like it was trying to be too much like the original trilogy, but failed because of it.",

Nothing interesting. Super Mary Sue with no sex appeal and awkward acting from Daisy Ridley. Finn is worse than Jar Jar at mocking people of African descent. Clear bias from Rotten Tomatoes. Pitiful, Pathetic, Unprofessional, Racist, Unrealistic even for Science Fiction, and an absolute disgrace for the original series as well as the prequels. J.J. Abrams and Michael Arndt should have nothing to do with Star Wars ever again. The only good parts were those with Harrison Ford, the only bad parts were those without Harrison Ford. That is the only positive thing I could say. Dearth Star 3.0, absolute not necessary and ruined this movie most of all. Po did a War of the Worlds and Jurassic Park 3 in surviving when it wasn't necessary for him to remain in the film. Either keep the ace pilot in the film as a companion of Finn's or just kill him off. Michael Bay would even do a better job and that is the statement I wish to conclude with. Absolute disgrace. Critics of the movie are disgusting. The fans who like this movie are disgusting. Anyone who spoke positively about this movie needs their head examined and perhaps even medicated to stop seeing reality through rose colored lenses, especially at what happened to Finn being such a wuss, a coward, instant PTSD, instant recovery from PTSD, and just too much teeth from Daisey Ridley. I felt like I was looking at a Xenomorph from Aliens the entire time I saw her. DISGUSTING!",

They could have easily paid homage and lose their own creative vision through the process, but their passion bleeds purpose, and the reverence to older characters, while bittersweet, ties into the script quite naturally.The screenplay executes onscreen like a well-oiled machine, with every bit as conflict-ridden as a hero's journey should be. I loved the character arcs introduced. Finn as the ex-stormtrooper in search of an identity presents interesting opportunities, especially in later sequels. Rey commands the screen and flips Episode IV on its back as the heroine and not the damsel-in-distress. Kylo, as the new villain, conveys a welcome vulnerability in the early stages of the new trilogy. Although the film may harken back to A New Hope with its trope, I personally did not mind as long as the conflict remains fresh and characters develop consistently, as the film has shown.Overall, I was proud of the product that the producers and filmmakers agreed upon. It's a business saga for the universe, but the creative force remains strong.",

    "review": "  This movie, on a personal view, was extremely disappointing. First off, the Star Wars series is legendary. Everyone knows Star Wars by name. Growing up watching the series in chronological order makes one feel emotionally attached to the plot, the persona and the characters. Watching this film felt like watching a rushed and half-hearted prequel to the epic series. The movie did not hit the spot for those who feel sentimental towards this film. Many will disagree however the movie was a waste of time and it did not feel like it flowed from the series. The newer episodes (The phantom Menace to Revenge of the Sith) connected extremely well to the original series. However The Force Awakens does not connect from Return of The Jedi. Some questions that were left in my mind after the film was- How did Kylo Ren (which sounds like a pretty poor name for a sith) acquire his training and powers after evil was destroyed in the galaxy? How did Rey just know how to use the force and a lightsaber within a short space of time while every other Jedi in history has to undergo years of training to learn the skills she demonstrated? What was the point of replacing one of the most loved characters, R2 D2 with a completely new character, BB8 when everyone see's R2, they automatically think Star Wars? Why were Leia and Han so separate from each other? Yes, their son had turned evil but is that a true reason to break this much loved couple apart? And isn't the Star Wars series about the Skywalker family? Why is the new Jedi a scavenger that just happened to meet Han Solo? Overall the movie was a massive let down to one of the most epic stories in history and I have no intention in going to see episodes VII and IX. JJ Abrams should not have written the story and has taken George Lucas' movie and destroyed the plot completely.",

While it is good to applaud those who take risks and make bold choices, sometimes it's not making the bold choice that matters, it's making the right choice. The much-maligned prequels were chock full of bold choices, stuffed to the gills with them. Bold, and universally awful. The original films functioned by being the monomyth. They weren't even inventive (beyond their setting and certain technical aspects). They were just a regurgitation of a story that has existed from before the time of Gilgamesh. But it's a story so central to what it means to be human, that its regurgitation is-- in itself-- a form of magic. It is the story that is ever-new. That Abrams hewed close to that eternal tale, and in doing so seemingly \"copied\" A New Hope isn't a fault, its a necessary part of the machine. The changes he made WERE bold, if subtly so. So see this movie, if you haven't already. It's fan service in that it is exactly the movie we needed it to be.",

    "review": "  Semi spoiler review. Read at your own risk if you have not seen the movie and want to find out for yourself. Being an avid Star Wars fan I would have to say this movie was not anywhere up to par of where it should have been. Don't get me wrong it was a good movie but it could have been 100x better. The story is completely broken. Yes I know when star wars came out back in 1977 it was to also broken but at the same time George had the scripts made out to give the foundation for episodes 4, 5, and 6. I really commend Disney for bringing back Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and others that were part of the original saga but they screwed this up big time. I mean come on to me this looked like they took episodes 4 and 6 combined them together and added small pieces of the ending from episode 3 and called it a new movie. Come on if I wanted to see those movies again I would have just put them in my DVD player. The ending of episode 6 eliminates the Sith and the Imperial forces and in 7 all of a sudden you have a new Sith Lord with an apprentice. Where is the story at of where the Sith survived the destruction of the Death Star how they came to be. Then lets take the Death Star blow it up in size by 1000x (using a planet this time) and call it something completely different when in all actuality its still yet another Death Star. This is not original at all George Lucas did this twice. Terrible idea Disney. Then lets blow it up in almost the exact same way that it was blown up in Episode 6. While they are working on blowing it up lets take the way that episode 3 ends with Darth Vader getting his limbs chopped off left for dead and do almost the exact same thing to Kylo Ren except this time all we are going to do is put some cuts and slices on him from a lightsaber. Come on I have seen this already. Yes I know George Lucas was just a consultant on this movie but why have him as a consultant if every single idea that he gives you shoot down.I know I am probably being overly critical about this movie but I wanted to see something new something exciting and for me this movie did not do it all. Some of the graphics in my opinion were not George Lucas quality graphics. The lightsabers looked fake. To many edges and looked more like fire then a semi solide beam of light. And there are many more in the graphics that could have been much better.For this movie out of 5 stars I give a 2.5 and the only reason it gets this is because it did have some good action scenes. Even though the lightssabers looked fake to me the lightsaber battles were good. There was some suspense in the middle of the movie when the rebellion comes to help but after that the movie just falls off into the same old thing as before.I hope that when and if they release Episode 8 they do a much better job at telling the story and filling in the gaps that should have been put into this movie and make it 100x better in all aspects. The story, graphics, and even the battles.I wanted to see the Force Awakens not see hey heres the force it never left at all.",

    "review": "  Luego de ver esta pelicula y comparando notas con otras criticas presento mi veredicto de Star Wars....tomen en cuenta que soy un Fan de star wars que vio primero la original trilogia y luego las prequelas....a pesar que tengo mis reservas con las prequelas estas a�adieron mucho al universo de Star Wars pero fallaron en los dialogos, actuacion, ritmo de la pelicula que se vuelve muy aburrida y el ya famos abuso de CGI....pero almenos la historia era fresca con nuevas ideas y personajes.Ahora el Episodio 7:El Plot: nada mas que una reciclada del episodio 4 con unos aspectos del episodio 5....un gran copy paste que no tiene merito donde se nos presenta lo mismo solo que mas grande 3/10la cinematografia y efectos especiales: lo mejor de la pelicula que recupera el feeling de la original trilogia a excepsion de 2 personajes que bn pudieron ser hechos con efectos practicos en lugar de recurrir al CGI 10/10Musica: el episodio con la musica menos memorable de todas 0 intension de hacer algo en ese departamento a pesar de la importancia que la musica adecuada tne en esta franquisia 2/10Actuacion: de alta calidad toda un gran obra de actuacion desde BB8 a los personajes CGI. 9/10Ritmo de la pelicula: perfecto en este departamento nunco un momento de aburrimiento con dialogo o escenas fuera de lugar de relleno accion comedia seriedad todo en su moment adecuado 10/10Personajes principales solo los nuevos y leve mension de los viejos:Kylo Ren: una gran descepsion de ver a este personaje no ser nada mas que un Emo adolecente berrinchudo....que no pudo ganar un duelo con una chica (Rey) que en su vida habia tomado un sable en su mano y apenas pudo con Finn un limpiador de ba�os que fue facil mente derrotado cada ves que se enfrento a cualquiera...como podemos tomar encerio a este nuevo villano?Rey: una Marie Sue...valla si es un estandarte de propaganda feminista pobres jedi y sith que estudian por decadas la fuerza cuando esta chica sacada del desierto puede manejar la fuerza en todos sus aspectos y derrotar a un discipulo de Luke y aprendis de sith en su primera batalla con sables lacer....encerio no se necesita ningun entrenamiento en la fuerza para ser el maximo ser del universo como pintan a esta chica que todo lo sabe todo lo hace todo perfecta conoce mejor la nave de Han solo de 70 anios en segundos la maneja y repara mejor que el...maneja el sable mejor que jedi, es una piloto perfecta etc etc lo que hicieron con Anakin ni�o en el episodio ! no es nada con este personaje mas alla de lo exagerado....un verdadero insulto a Star Wars y los fans.Finn: en el fondo lo que el personaje propone es muy interezante \"como un Storm Trooper mira el mundo\" que es lo que lo motiva a desertar? bno nadfa importa cuando su personaje se la pasa corriendo toda la pelicula sabiendo la situacion por la que pasan los storm troopers no tiene problema en dispararles en cualquier momento a pesar de pintarse como alguien muy moral...pero se le pone como el comico casi un JAR JAR.Poe Dameron: todo un gran piloto...pero nada mas se puede decir de el pues el personaje no es explorado solo se sabe que tne una mision y luego de un accidente no se le ve mas abandona su mision y reaparece magicamente luego de la nada en el mometo ideal asi por asi...un desperdicio de personaje.Maz: otro push Feminista al crear un reciclaje de la idea de yoda ahora una hembra anaranjade de 1000 anios muy sabia que sabe guiar a Rey en la fuerza....que puedo decir lame.General Hux: el unico mal actor y mal cast de la pelicula demaciado joven para ser el maximo lider militar a cargo de este remanente del imperio que se la pasa peliando con Kylo como ni�os de 10 a�os para tratar de alagar a la maestra (Snoke)Snoke: nada se puede decir de el...no se le vio mucho en la pelicula y mantiene intriga es un bn personaje en apariencia por el momentoPhasma: definitivamente que el personaje que mas se elvo en los trailers solo para derumbarce de lo mas asquerozo en la pelicula que descepsion de personaje otro gran desperdicio.La primera Orden: nada en absoluto se revela de esta faccion mas que parecen imitar o considerarce erederos del Imperio....pero no se explora para nada quienes son y como demonios tubieron acceso a mas technologia y recursos que el propio impero...siendo solo un remanente.La Nueva Republica: nuevamente nada se explora de que fue de esta organizacion sabemos que los rebeldes ganan y rehacen la Republica y nada mas se menciona de ellos mas que ayudan a la resistencia a luchar contra la primera orden.Resistencia: a diferencia de las prequelas y de Star wars donde hay verdadeRA guerra de las Galaxias y la original trilogia donde podemos ver una enorme organizacion de los Rebeldes....la resistencia nos deja con un sabor de boca como si son unos 100, 150 individuos haciendo una pequenia resistencia mas que una verdadera amenaza u oposicion a la primera orden.El destructor de Estrellas: otro reciclaje mas de la estrella de la muerte solo que mas grande y mas ridicula sin ninguna base o credibilidad o practicidad...la peor idea jamas consebida y la 3era ves que lo intentan esto se vuelve viejo rapido...se le ve destruyendo un planeta no sabemos bn que planeta era mas que era de la republica...pero como no se invirtio en crear algun tipo de historia sobre ese planeta o la republica los que vemos la destruccion nos pela pues no sabemos nada de ellos. nunca se invirtio en ellos. destruyeron un planeta X okEl original elenco: todos en punto todos regresaron a su papel de una manera mas que satisfactoria...pero en gran oposicion al espiritu de Star Wars.Luke: desaparece nada mas y no se le ve casi para nada....esta va en contra del espiritu del personaje que nunca hubiera abandonado la causa de la manera que lo hizoLeia: otro push Feminista la generala de la resistencia cuando talves deberia de haver pasado a ser canciller de la nueva republica o aprender la fuerza se le mira poco.Han: toma el lugar de obi one al ser la figura paterna que es sacrificada al hombre de mascar obscura para motivar a los heroes...pero al final su muerta pasa practicamente inadvertida y tne un final pesimo para un tan gran personaje que va a tener 2 peliculas de origenes pero ahora que tanto las queremos ver sabiendo su pesimo final?En resumen esta pelicual en accion y visuales y elenco es toda una obra maestra pero en los detalles como la historia que es loq al final queremos ver es la peor de ttodas las peliculas y cada uno de los personajes o es desperdiciado o no explorado, parece que esta pelicula se fue por el lado opuesto de el Episodio 1 que trato de explicar mucho e introducir mucho esta por miedo no explica nada ni introduce nada....en resumen le doy a Star Wars Episodio 7 por los visuales y el feeling pero pierde 4 por todos los agujeros y falta de plot y simplemente ser huevona en el aspecto creativo....veredicto 2/10!!!!",

And for people who claim \"rehash\" or \"not original\", I can see why one would say it; but it's just not correct--new characters, bad and good. Plus, the since-the-beginning-of-time plot: GOOD VS. EVIL. DARK VS. LIGHT. Force Awakens rekindles that flame and even adds fuel to it!",

    "review": "  Too predictable - even when Han was about to get it, you knew what was going to happen. Great special effects, but the story line was weak, character development outside of Finn was pretty much zero (where did Kylo Ren come from and why did he turn to the dark side anyhow?). I was most shocked at how bad Carrie Fisher looked and sounded. She reminded me more of a VERY aged Captain Katherine Janeway with her smokers voice and shriveled face. As for Luke - I wonder how much he got paid for his part",

    "review": "  A New Hope Awakens when the Force Returns after the Jedi Strike Back(or how to compress 3 movies into one)(spoiler alert)The movie beings with (Darth Vader/Kylo Ren) killing a Rebel/Village Leader in cold blood and then capturing the Rebel (Princess Leah/Poe) to try and get a secret. (Darth Vader/ Kylo Ren) then tortures (Princess Leah/Poe). Luckily, (Princess Leah/Poe) hid the secret in a droid which escapes into the desert and is discovered by Luke/Rey, a \"nobody\" unknowingly strong in the force, who grew up in poverty without his/her parents, and rescues the Droid from being turned into spare parts by Jawa/scavengers. The Storm Troopers murder a group of (Jawa+Luke's uncle+aunt /villagers), and (The Empire/First Order) tracks down R2-D2/BB-8 on this desert planet. Then Luke/Rey, with the help of a reformed (smuggler Han/stormtrooper Finn) escape in a (\"piece of junk\"/\"garbage\") known as The Millennium Falcon. Famous actor, (Alec Guiness/Harrison Ford) plays an older father figure, wise in the ways of the world, who has guilt because his pupil/son killed his fellow Jedi and became the scary bad guy in the black mask, (Darth Vader/Kylo Ren). However, (Darth Vader/Kylo Ren) is just the pawn of the wrinkled (Emperor Palpatine/Supreme Leader Snoke), who appears in a hologram, and when (Darth Vader/Kylo Ren) battles Luke/Rey, he tries to convince Luke/Rey to join him and become his apprentice. (Obi-Wan/Han Solo) also confronts (Darth Vader/Kylo Ren) one on one, and Luke/Rey is too far away to help and screams,\" Nooo!\" when (Darth Vader/Kylo Ren) use a light saber to kill a defenseless (Obi-Wan/Han Solo).There are atmospheric touches such as Cantina/Castle full of various drunk and degenerate Aliens, or a short, wise elderly green/yellow alien who senses that The Force is strong in Luke/Rey. (The Empire/The First Order) has an ultimate weapon than can destroy an entire planet/system, run by authoritarian military commander, (Grand Moff Tarkin/General Hux), yet his weapon has an Achilles heel, a single vulnerability that can be destroyed by small one manned space fighters. Luckily, this vulnerability is such an open secret that even The First Order's sanitation department is aware of how to exploit it.It's up to Han Solo to go down to the (Forest Moon of Endor/surface of the weapon planet) to set off explosives and disable the shield. This way, the Rebels/Resistance, hiding out in a forest base, will mount an assault, and seconds before the ultimate weapon unleashes its death ray, will blow up the ultimate weapon by taking advantage of this vulnerability.In this way, over the course of one, instead of three, movies, Rey instead of Luke, will suddenly, instead slowly, learn the ways of the Jedi and, after no apparent reason, instead of arduous training, will go from having zero control of the Force to gaining skills such as learning to mind control (Jabba the Hutt's translator/a storm trooper), pulling a light saber out of the snow, and finally mastering enough Jedi powers to defeat Darth Vader/Kylo Ren in a light saber duel. In a similar way, The Rebellion, which by the end of \"Return of the Jedi\" has a fleet of large ships when it defeats The Empire, becomes the Army of the Republic. Yet, somehow, during the thirty years that the Republic rules the Galaxy, the love child of Lord Voldemort and Gollum has recruited a new generation of storm troopers while the Army of the Republic has lost its armada and has disintegrated into a \"Resistance\" of a few dozen X wing fighters (likely because Congress used Sequestration to cut the Republics' military budget).",

While some things are similar, it has much that is also unique. History repeats itself. WWI was fought with bigger battleships than WWI. Same here. My only complaint is that it doesn't contain any bad acting. Everyone does a good job and many give excellent performances. This is out of character for a SW movie! Rey - after a third viewing where I can watch the performances better - does a superb and job with complex emotions. Kylo Ren is perfect and Finn and Poe are very good. Go see it at least 3 times.",

    "review": "  Completely Awakening your faith in one of the most popular and influential franchises in film history, the latest Star Wars offers a reverential, entertaining, and seamless bridge to the classic trilogy while building a storyline with an entertaining and exciting Force that's nearly as strong as its forebear. Remember the fever-pitch fan intensity accompanying the release of The Phantom Menace over 15 years ago, the white hot fervor that kind of smoldered once audiences saw how bad a film it actually was? Well, it looks like we were all building ourselves up for the wrong film. Star Wars: The Force Awakens course corrects the series, offering none of the candy-colored video game-aping empty calories heaped on filmgoers in the prequel trilogy. What proves most amazing about this improbable reboot is that director J.J. Abrams, a man who's already demonstrated a genius knack for re-invigorating an iconic sci-fi series (2009's Star Trek), nails a tone and channels a through-line that Star Wars creator George Lucas himself could not in the prequels. While that mostly soulless threesome feels unrelated to the original and much superior triumvirate, The Force Awakens feels like the next authentic step for this storied universe and these iconic characters. Make no mistake about it, however, as Episode VII doesn't focus on these returning heroes. Rather, the story smartly turns the spotlight on some new Star Warriors, with Han Solo and Company offering perfectly nuanced support.In this PG-13-rated continuation of the saga created by George Lucas and set thirty years after Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, balance returns to the Force as the First Order, emerging from the ashes of the Empire, clashes with the Resistance, which includes scrappy newcomers as well as heroes from the former Rebel Alliance. Oh, the script sports a few interesting points that could lead to qualms for some. First off, the story purposely follows the original film's plotpoints to a T (SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD: a droid holding a secret plays an imperative role, a lightsaber gets handed down to a potential future Jedi, the First Order boasts a planet-destroying moon-sized weapon that must be decimated), but this makes it that much easier to fall into the overall framework. Secondly, connectivity plays a huge role (MORE SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD: some new and old characters are related, characters happen upon each other rather conveniently to forward the narrative, a classic character makes a sacrifice to help in the development of a newbie and inspire a revenge plotline for future films), but these films have always held true to the simplicities of the classic myth structure wherein these tropes play a key role. Beyond these arguable gripes, everything - from returning screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan's excellently structured script to the perfectly chosen cast and their well-played performances to original composer John Williams' powerful score to the brilliant use of practical as opposed to digital effects as much as possible - makes for an emotional nostalgia sequel that sets your heart racing with empathy, action, and anticipation.Bottom line: Force Majeure",

    "review": "  It's a mind blowing new Star Wars movie, excellent in many ways, although it has very serious flaws. For example what is with girl's ability to learn The Force so fast within the period of one battle whereas Luke learned to use The Force through the whole trilogy when he at last could confront Darth Vader. And what about this weak villain.. The weakest of them all in Star Wars franchise. Still a beautiful continuation.",

    "review": "  Story: D+Light Side Casting: B+Dark Side Casting: DVisuals: ASound Effects: AMusic/Score: CTHERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEWI read the gushing reviews, I heard from friends how amazeballs this movie was, and I went in with hope, hope that this would not fall prey to the failures of the prequels. This movie was better than the prequels, but there are still significant failings (although there is good here too)VISUALSVisually this movie is stunning, similar to JJ Abrams work in the Star Trek reboots. However, image isn't everything unfortunately, and the visuals can't make up for other failings (specifically storyline related)MUSIC/SCOREWhen I hear certain songs from the original, they conjure up images of specific characters, locations or entire scenes. There was a magic to the music of the originals and there is not one song that stuck with me from this film that will bring me back to it when I hear it.LIGHT SIDE CASTINGI felt that both Finn, Rey and BB8 were fantastic additions to the series and show promise. Poe fell a bit flat for me as did the CGI lady in the poor man's Cantina scene with the big glasses.DARK SIDE CASTINGMan, where do I begin? Kylo Ren, initially, is pretty cool, when he keeps his mask on. When he stops Poe's blaster bolt in midair AND holds it there, pretty damned impressive (even Darth could only swat away a bolt, never saw him stop one).But it's when the mask comes off that the character just loses all appeal. His visage doesn't inspire terror, fear or respect. He struts around like a temper-tantrum throwing man-child.Likewise, the General for the New Order was horribly cast as well, failing to inspire any confidence in his abilities to lead this galaxy-dominating armada. He, too, comes across as a temper-tantrum throwing man-child who is constantly tossing snarky remarks at Kylo Ren.Further destroying some of the immersion is that Kylo Ren looks nothing like Han and Leia's son, not one ounce.COMEDYThe comedy in this film, for me, was fantastic. A lot of hilarious moments that elicited outright laughter from the audience. JJ Abrams did this with the Star Trek reboots as well and succeeded I feel.STORYLINE AND PAYING HOMAGE TO THE ORIGINALSWhere this film really falters is that it tries too hard to pay homage to the originals. It pays so much homage, that it outright copies them, to the detriment of this film.The problem is that Abrams went too far in paying homage, which prevents this film from having it's own stand-out moments, its own ability to shine on its own merits.There is yet another super weapon, conveniently with a glaring weakness to exploit, this time it's just all bigger (the super weapon AND the weakness). And while the super weapon draining a sun to power itself was cool to see, the battle to stop it was a huge let-down. Sure, you get X-Wings and Tie Fighters, but that's it. Where are the massive capital ships, frigates and fleets to slug it out? We get none of that and this battle fails to pack any punch.Another major issue is the development of the two primary characters, Finn and Rey. Finn is just thrust upon us with little introduction, little reason to care about him or to even understand his decision to flee the New Order. We discover he was assigned to sanitation duty, yet we also see him participating in a ground assault and later he is able to outgun experienced tie fighter pilots in a ship he's unfamiliar with, doing a task (gunner) that one can only assume he is equally unfamiliar with. Later he almost holds his own in a lightsaber duel with an experienced Sith.Rey is too good. She's an orphaned scavenger who can fix things, fly things, shoot guns with perfect accuracy, duel with lightsabers and develops her force powers in about one minutes time and is then able to challenge a trained and experienced Sith in combat. Remember all the training that Luke had and he still struggled? Yeah, well we don't really get that here.Some would argue \"oh, she's just a natural!\" but I say poppycock! She's a natural at fixing things, shooting blasters, flying, lightsabers and the force? C'mon son!BB8 is a welcome addition to the franchise and has his own comedic moments and is certainly no Jar Jar.Han's death was painfully obvious and quite clich� in how it went down. Leia struggles to stand out like she did in the originals, Carry Fisher has been away from acting for too long methinks.Overall this film was a giant disappointment for me. Although there is some hope, perhaps a New Hope, on the horizon. With the director behind Looper at the helm of the next film, perhaps there is something that can be salvaged. I definitely feel that the new light side cast can help this trilogy shine, hopefully the dark side cast doesn't drag it down too much.",

    "review": "  I think JJ Abrams has managed to perform the same trick with The Force Awakens that he did very successfully with his Star Trek reboots. What I mean is this is nothing new on the others in the franchise but he hasn't meddled too much with the bits that we like. It has the look and certainly the feel of Episode 4 and there are so many nods to this throughout that fans will recognise. Like Episode 4 it has a bar scene (with a band), a Jedi mind trick, a droid central to the mission, a massacre that changes everything and parental issues. There's more that I cannot recall right now but this is no bad thing.A couple of questions did spring to mind, firstly, who has the contract for building Death Stars in the Star Wars universe? Whoever does must surely be considered the wealthiest and most powerful entity out there. I also have a question about the design of space stations in the Sci-Fi universe and why do they insist on building razor thin walkways with no rails and a perilous drop either side? Isn't there such a thing as the Intergalactic Department for Health and Safety? If so then they need to stop sipping on Pan Galactic Gargleblasters at lunchtime and up their game. The flow of the film is very slick with excellent action sequences (esp. in IMAX) and it doesn't feel like a two hour plus film. Performances are good with perhaps Daisy Ridley (Rey) being the standout as it was difficult not to warm to her. Kylo Ren was also a decent baddie and what The Force Awakens does is introduce new characters, reintroduce old ones and setup things for the next one so hopefully (as with Star Trek) the best is yet to come.",

Long time fans will love the nostalgia and new fans will appreciate the two young leads, especially Rey, who is one of the best characters to come around in the Star Wars universe in decades. The story may seem familiar, but J.J. Abrams still brings his own style, mixing CGI with practical effects which makes the film have a down to earth feel. The action is intense and the classic characters all have their moment. Harrison Ford is the anchor and he guides the new characters as the torch is passed to a new generation of heroes. It was 2 hours of fun and entertainment and that is what Star Wars is all about.Grade: A-",

Abrams and new franchise owner Disney decided to introduce a bevy of young characters, along with some old fan favorites, over a plot that is -- for all intents and purposes -- the same as George Lucas' original film. Star Wars has always been mythic storytelling, and even the prequels featured elements mirroring the original films. But this entire approach struck me as lazy and trying to play it over-safe. To make matters worse, Abrams kind of already did this with his rebooted take on 'Star Trek' -- I expected more of him, frankly. To the filmmakers' credit however, the new cast shows a lot of promise; under the guidance of a director less willing to hang themselves up on nostalgia and take some chances, this could bode well for further installments of the new trilogy.",

The characters are bland and have basically no depth. Mind you, I've watched this movie twice, and i found it even more enraging the second time through.",

    "review": "  Really unimpressed with this film. It just is a recycled version of the first star wars film released in 1977. But much worse than that film. The characters are wooden. I did not buy the relationship between rey and finn nor the rey's ability to channel the force so immediately. Or the relationship between Han solo and Leia. Why not take more risk and make an interesting sequel to the other films? There is no way a film like this can lose money and yet they went the safe way.",

It's charming,visually stunning, packed with action and lovable characters. It's a new breath of life into the franchise whil still respecting it's prequels. Like many others, I was also very pleased by the strong performances by the entiere cast. I left the theathers wanting more without having thefeeling I didn't get to see much. It completely succeeded both in terms ofa part of a trilogy and as a movie on it's own. Definitely a must-see!",

    "review": "  I went to see Star Wars The Force Awakens around 2 weeks ago and as a big Star Wars fan I really enjoyed it. I was worried before going into the cinema thinking this might be like the prequels (even though the prequels were ok in my opinion). I liked the new characters, I liked the return of the old characters. I thought the chemistry was better and the dialogue was better than the prequel characters. It had funny banter, there was more emotion. A lot of the negative comments are all the same, \"It's too much like A New Hope\". A lot of the negative comments about the prequels were \"It has too much CGI, no emotion, no action, no characters you get attached to, awkward dialogue etc etc and then when this film comes out which has none of that, people still complain. You just can't please some people no matter what you do like.Another thing people criticise is \"How come Rey knows nothing about the force but can use a lightsaber all of a sudden?, it's stupid\" Well if you watch A New Hope, Luke Skywalker has never flown a starship or x-wing before and here he is blowing up the death star and flying in space, here he is shooting at Stormtroopers even though he has never been in armed combat before. People seem to forget that.",

Also character reveals likes all three of the originals. The darkness of Empire Strikes Back, it's all rolled into this one installment.The acting is solid and more grounded with John Boyega, Daisey Ridley, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver and Domnhall Gleeson all give believable and highly enjoyable performances.Like I said I wasn't wowed by this film, I enjoyed and I liked it, and is perhaps the most enjoyable to date, but it didn't give me the wow factor that Man of Steel and Captain America Winter Soldier did, but then again that's just me.Overall a triumphant return to the benchmark space opera and franchise.

    "review": "  For me this movie was incredibly painful. There were constant flaws within the character's stories and within the overall plot itself. Everything felt forced and rushed along as JJ Abrams tired his best to smash in all the Easter eggs he could that would give old timers a sense of nostalgia and make them forget what a bad movie they're watching.My problem with (inappropriate) humor:  Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed humor in the previous films of Star Wars but this movie felt like a Marvel superhero film, with humor added in all the wrong situations. Star Wars films (the good movies) have a history of having darker tones until, despite all odds, the heroes barely manage to escape, where Marvel movies have gotten a reputation for lighthearted, funny movies without any real danger posing significant threat. Jokes are inserted at inappropriate times, ruining the gravity of grave situations for the heroes in The Force Awakens. The biggest example of this is when star-pilot Poe Dameron is captured and when face-to-face with the newly introduced Kylo Ren blabs out \"So who talks first?\" and other light hearted dialogue to get some cheap laughs out of the audience. Yes some people laughed, but at what cost to the mood? This ruins a potential scene for Kylo Ren to establish himself as fearsome and creates a scene for the audience to begin to associate danger with laughter, similar to Jar Jar Binks goofing around in the middle of a fire fight. My problem with the plot:Next we move on to the problem of the plot.... In that it is the same plot we have seen TWICE already. The resistance (the rebels) must defeat the First Order (empire) by blowing up the \"weapon\" (death star) by attacking an exposed portion with solo pilot aircraft which will lead to a system wide explosion rendering the battle station completely destroyed. Is this ringing any bells?My problem with \"the weapon\":The weapon is powered by SunnyD and the power of the sun. Despite the problems posed by bringing an entire sun into a planet and still having frozen snow on the surface, let alone any living thing not instantly being incinerated, it still takes the perfect amount of time for the rebels to win despite there being a perfect demonstration by blowing up the new republic government (a story I am left very curious about but I guess we'll never hear about it since they just get blown up). And what happens when the planet runs out of suns to use as fuel? Are there giant engines that will move it to the next sun, and can the First Order control the rotation of the planet or does gravity go all crazy when positioned to attack a new target. It must have some kind of rotation considering it is portrayed as being in orbit around some kind of sun. My problem with the character Finn: His entire role seems very forced for me. His affection for Rey is nearly immediate and he seems to be the only Stormtrooper that can aim in the entire franchise of Star Wars. He shows his prowess with a blaster during the raid of the new JJ Abrams' version of the Cantina. Killing soldiers left and right with his blaster, despite working sanitation and not firing his weapon once during his \"first mission.\" His prowess with the lightsaber is thrown on the audience as well, defeating the Stormtrooper in close quarters combat and holding his own against the trained Kylo Ren. He is even able to use the TIE fighter's and Millennium Falcon's weapon systems with expertise, shooting down trained First Order pilots in while in both ships. My problem with the character Rey: Throughout the first portion of the movie we see her as alone, waiting for someone to come back to her, presumably her family, and only coming into contact with some other scavengers only to have a negative interaction with them. Despite this reclusive lifestyle she is able to understand what BB-8 is telling her, understand Chewbacca's language (Shriiwook), and seem to understand how the machinery in multiple ships work. My biggest problem with this character is possibly her actions. She was able to fly the Millennium Falcon flawlessly after around 15 seconds of trial and error, weaving through star destroyer wreckage and outmaneuvering the First Order's trained pilots. Also she seems to know the ship better than Han Solo himself as shown when she fixes the hyperdrive, while being portrayed as never having been in the Millennium Falcon before. Another thing, she is able to out-duel and use the force much better than the actually trained Kylo Ren. Even with training being so emphasized in the previous 6 movies she is able to defeat the feared Kylo Ren despite not even believing in the force until halfway through the movie.My problem with the character Kylo Ren: Being portrayed as the new Vader we see immediately that he is nowhere near as fearsome when instead of killing the messenger of a bad report he vents his anger out onto a control panel like a child throwing a tantrum. He finally loses all fearsome characteristics once he takes off his mask, showing that he is only a man, and a scared one at that, that bring back memories of pre-Vader Anakin Skywalker who whines his way through movies. The new Sith is shown as powerful with the force, stopping a laser blast and paralyzing two rebel fighters. But then when it is time to get information from Rey by using the force, which apparently can be used as some form of telepathy now, he is denied entry by Rey who is using the force for THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE! This does not show the power of Rey but merely the lack of power of Ren. Also when Kylo Ren kills his father, Han Solo, he leaves no room for redemption in his future. During the scene of Han's death the theme seems to fall upon Kylo Ren wanting redemption and to join the light side of the force, but after killing possibly the most loved character in the Star Wars universe he will find no love from the fans and if he is still alive by the end of the trilogy Disney will have needed to pull off a miracle if the fans are to accept Han's death going unavenged. My problem with the character Captain Phasma: Much like the rest of the First Order, Captain Phasma is initially portrayed as a character who will give the heroes a great deal of trouble. Eventually, during the short amount of screen time she got, she comes out looking like a wuss. She captured too easily and just agrees to the demands of the 4 rebels despite being on a base full of her loyal troops. Amazingly she agrees to turn off the most crucial aspect of the battle station's defenses. Without Captain Phasma, the rebels would have never succeeded. Her giving in so easily is surprising because she should know the risk that goes with her actions, she should have been a good soldier and made Solo, Rey, Chewy, and Finn kill her before she enables the rebels to destroy \"the weapon\" and possibly all of the First Order. My problem with Han Solo's death: I did not have a problem in the death of the character but rather in how it was handled. Han Solo is arguably the most loved character in the franchise and should be given a proper send off if he is to be killed off. I never got that from this movie. Han's death seems to be brushed aside for the sake of focusing more on Finn and Rey's story. There is never really screen time dedicated to dwell on the loss of everyone's favorite scoundrel. A quick look between Rey and Leia is all we get. One would think that there would be some ceremony for a hero of the rebellion but that just would not fit into the new jovial Star Wars. At least Qui-Gon got a funeral and he was only in one movie of the franchise but a fan-favorite completing his fourth movie barely gets 30 seconds of characters mourning for him. I was conflicted on what emotions JJ Abrams wanted me to feel exiting the movie. Of course I was still sad at the loss of Han and with no real closure or time to mourn him I stayed sad for the rest of the movie, meanwhile the tone shifted to one of hopefulness as Rey finds Luke (much easier than the movie made it seem it would be) and starts her training. Hopefulness and sadness are emotions that do not easily mix, though one could make the argument that I could feel sad for Han's death and hopeful that Rey will beat the Sith but she already did that. And since the rebels seem to have already beat the First Order I am left not knowing what to be hopeful for and feeling sad at the same time.My problem with the \"epic duel\": When it comes time to see the final duel at the end of the movie we have a matchup between the evil Kylo Ren against the two heroes, Rey and Finn. Kylo Ren is clearly hurt from a blaster as he took a blast from Chewbacca's crossbow but he demonstrates the ability to endure the pain and function regularly as he beats his wound repeatedly. What is expected is a complete massacre of a deserted soldier and a scavenger but what the audience gets is the opposite. Of course the good guys must win eventually but they do not need to win in the first movie of the newest trilogy. In both previous trilogies, successful or not, we see our hero attempt to face off against the villain and lose. This happened in the cases of Qui-Gon against Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace, Anakin and Obi-Wan against Count Dooku in Attack of the Clones, Yoda against Darth Sidious in Revenge of the Sith, and finally Luke Skywalker against Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back. These losses happened for a reason, to show that the hero is not yet ready to defeat the evil that opposes him/her. It gives added fear toward the main villain and shows how powerful he is. The idea of a Jedi training to gain skill has been stressed so much in the previous 6 movies the thought of even a novice Jedi defeating a Sith Lord would be absurd. But in Star Wars 7 we do not only see a scavenger beat a Sith, but we also see an ex-Stormtrooper hold his own against the \"fury\" of Kylo Ren. Having the new Darth Vader figure be beaten by a scavenger who has never wielded a lightsaber, never had any combat training against trained soldiers, and did not even believe in the force until halfway into the movie extremely belittles his ability to bring any concern to the audience over the danger of their hero. During the next movies we will possibly see Rey or another main character face off against Kylo Ren again. Now at the end of the movie we see Ren go to complete his training (I have no idea why he was in charge if his training was incomplete) but we also see Rey find Luke and begin her training. By Star Wars 8 both will have improved but one would think Rey would have improved exponentially due to her absolute lack of training during her entire life. We will have a face-off in later in the series that we have already seen, with no added tension because we there will not be much doubt about our hero due to Kylo Ren already being brutally defeated in Star Wars 7. Why are there still rebels?  It has been 20 years since the destruction of the empire and a new republic has been created. Usually when a rebel force overthrows a government they become the governing body and cease to be rebels, creating a capital and government to rule in. One would think that after the rebels create a new government that they would at least move their base to the planet where their new government is. So why do the rebels still exist in this movie? Also, why does this new republic allow the creation of a new death star? They must have clearly understood what was going on because it is hard to build or modify an entire planet without the ruling government finding out. And still nothing happens. No one remembered a few decades ago when an entire planet was destroyed and clearly no precautions have been enacted to stop this type of attack from happening again. But hey, everyone seems to love the lack of originality. At the end I was left searching for anything to like about this movie (I really wanted to like it), anything that would give me a decent overall feeling about the film, like the fight between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan with Dual of the Fates ringing in the background. But even the film score left me wanting something much better. Unless someone can convince me there is something to like about the movie besides less than 3 minutes of cool X-wing vs TIE-fighter action and a few Easter eggs, this movie will take its place as the 7th best in the franchise in my mind.",

And when compared to some bad movies out there, this isn't necessarily a bad movie, overall it is very well done, the sound is great, the visuals, the effects, even the acting is good.However, when taken in the context of Star Wars, this just does not feel like a star wars movie, the pace is completely wrong, the characters are flat and basically rehashes of previous characters from the saga. There is just no sense of accomplishment anywhere, it is as if the plot just moves along, there is no sense of struggle for the heroes, everything just conveniently happens. I went in with fairly low expectations, so in some ways I was pleasantly surprised, but I left disappointed overall. It is better than the prequels, but not by much. This movie really is just Ep IV, V, and VI rolled into one, with a female Luke Skywalker.",

Rey: She's a junk scavenger played by Daisy Ridley Han Solo: Yeah, that guy. He's played by Harrison Ford.Plot Summary A BB-8 droid has become the target of the First Order (new name for the Empire). Why? Because it has the location of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. After a short fight, the droid lands under the care of Rey, who teams up with Finn in order to make sense of the map in the BB-8. But to get off the planet, they have to get a ship - and they just happen to land the Millennium Falcon - Han Solo's ship. Soon after, Han gets the ship back and agrees to help out. Problem is that Han and Leia's son is on the First Order's side - and he will do anything to get the map.SCORING Main Characters Han's just like I remember him in all the other Star Wars films he's in (which is good). But what's really surprising is how well Rey and Finn fit into the mix. They've got some chemistry and an appealing back story. SCORE: 9 Supporting Cast The rest of the cast is good, lead by the main bad guy, Kylo Ren. And it's good to see Leia again - even without the iconic hair do. SCORE: 8 Plot This film is over two hours long, but I had no trouble sitting through it. It's great that they can bring in new characters yet make use of the old ones.  The only problem I had with the story is that I felt parts of it were just a rehash of Episode IV. But that's a minor complaint. SCORE: 8 Originality This film does the look and feel of a Star Wars film, but they do a few new things with the characters - namely Finn and BB-8. SCORE: 8 Violence Factor Lots of stuff gets blown up - and this time the wreckage just doesn't vanish into space. And there are shots of damage a laser blaster can do when it hits a person. And the stormtroopers can actually hit their intended targets. And someone gets killed when someone else thrusts a lightsaber through the chest. This is far more realistic than any of the other Star Wars films. SCORE: 8 Other Moral Issues This film is about trying to figure out what the best course of action is to save the day from an evil empire. But I wonder how did the First Order got so powerful in the first place? SCORE: 7 Final Score (out of 60): 48 % Score: 80% The force is strong with this film.",

Sure it may be a near carbon copy of the original 1977 film (soft reboot is the term I keep hearing), while being a bit rushed or convenient at times, but my brain didn't care. My brain just said \"Nostalgia! Exciting things flying around on screen! Smile dammit!\" And I subsequently smiled and had a great deal of fun. It was the movie it needed to be. Nothing more. Nothing less. And that is extremely satisfying :)",

I does start different but there are some many scenes that are the same that I almost felt like I could say the lines before the actors. It's not a bad movie but it doesn't deserve the 93% rating that Rotten Tomatoes gave it. If this is your first ever view of Star Wars I know you loved it. This story line was just flat, but the acting was OK.",

    "review": "  Star Wars is back, and in my opinion is better than ever. Sure, I am super nostalgic about the original trilogy, but the original trilogy never had the caliber of actors and professionals working in it. The new cast elevates, in my opinion, this movie above the others. Rey, Finn, Poe and Kylo Ren are each interesting and well though out characters. In particular, for me Kylo Ren steals the show. Adam Driver gives us one of the most in depth and appealing villains in a long time...or is he a villain? All I know is that Vader is no longer the standard of a good Star Wars villain. The movie is always fun, and for the two and a half hours it plays, is a constant thrill ride. Time will indeed fly by. One of the best movies of the year without a doubt. Enjoyable every time you watch it!",

    "review": "  Despite it has the similar plot as An New Hope, the Force Awakens brilliantly brings the magic of A Galaxy Far, Far Away with the same glance as the Original Trilogy. J. J. Abrams mastered the directing as Irvin Kershner did during the making of Empire Strikes Back, all new actors are great in their roles: Boyega is both charismatic and funny as Finn, Ridley's Rey is lovely, Isaac in Poe Dameron's boots is as cool as Wedge Antilles (not ironic) and despite Revan's influence of Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, Adam is great as a fallen Jedi Knights. All the original cast is excellent, especially Harrison Ford reprising his role of Han Solo. The effects are visually marvellous as well as glorious. Step back to practical effects in an era of computer-made films was a good idea. With one word: Epic. What else to say?",

I see it almost as a blend of a stand alone and prequel. It is a movie in itself but has set up a way for the world to go off in many different directs that I'm excited to explore. I am amazed that people are so upset by the unoriginality of the movie. For one, the original borrows so much from the epic tradition and adventure movies/novels of the past that it's hard to see the battle between good and evil as anything else. And episodes 5 and 6 are basically the same as episode 4 rehashed and expanded. I don't mean this as a criticism. It's an exciting series of movies and this continues in that fashion. I think, if the next two movies are well done and do explore the characters and how they deal with challenges then we will have another set of excellent movies. I loved the characters or Rey and Finn (and Po if he were in it more). I cried when Han died. I look forward to more Luke and Leia and I wasn't bored once.

SPOILER ALERT from here forward:There's the usual alien bar scene, the outpost of scavengers, the my family member is evil seduced by the dark side but I think I can change him, the evil dude in the odd mask (who this time turns out to wear it because he wants to), the really big weapon that has awesome destructive force but can be destroyed by a small force yadda yadda. The line from Battlestar Galactica comes to mind, all this has happened before and will happen again (we can only hope not). And of course the reunion of all the old stars felt almost forced. I thin they almost needed to put a name tag on Princess Lea so we could recognize her, not to mention Luke's cameo. We saw it in IMAX 3D and I was also underwhelmed by that. The 3D did not seem to have the same \"depth\" to it, or the same depth of field. And you had to keep your head rotated at exactly the right angle or it was out of focus. All in all I would say wait for it to hit the small screen and you won't be disappointed (quite so much). I give it three and a half ... yawns :)",

Much more than the previous installments, Episodes 1, 2, and 3. There are huge glaring flaws to this movie that really hurt it's potential to be more enjoyable. Biggest being the huge lack of chemistry among the cast. I found myself wishing that both Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher were not in this film. They looked and felt absolutely uncomfortable whenever they had scenes together. While I found Rey to be a very likable character, someone I am truly interested in seeing where she goes in the future. I hope that future does not include the character of Finn. Boyega is another actor that didn't seem to have chemistry with the other actors, and that is not mentioning that this character was very poorly written. He was this movie's Jar Jar Binks, though not quiet as annoying, but getting there. Another peeve, too many references, hints and copying of Episode 4, there were moments when this felt as if it were a remake rather than continuation. We need more original ideas writers. As for Kylo Ren, the temper tantrums left me perplexed, really didn't add anything to the story, seemed like something that should have hit the cutting room floor in my opinion. My favorite things taken from this more were Rey (Daisy Ridley), BB8 ( had most of the successful humorous parts ), and the ending of the movie. Loved the ending, and left me very curious to see where the Skywalkers go in the next movie.",

    "review": "  Star Wars: The franchise rebooted is a very safe by the numbers movie that did not excite me at all and this is a movie which I had low expectations for to begin with. Now, I might get some flack for this but let me explain why.Minor SpoilersBasically, the movie is a new hope re-packaged. Nothing has changed in the galaxy, except the Empire is has become vestigial and the old cast of the original trilogy ended up being a bunch screw ups that managed to get everything back to the same condition as a new hope. It's like watching the new spiderman reboot. Guys, I really don't need to watch uncle Ben die for the second time. The acting: The original cast.It was okay, it was nice to see Harrison play Han again. He even manages to put a performance that is slightly better than his performance as Indy Jones. Though, as character arc, having old Han Solo in the same spot as New Hope Han is quite disheartening. Carrie Fisher Leia is also a tragic figure, she is relegated to the role of Mon Mothma as Ms. Exposition mixed in with disheartened mom who for having the rank of general does very little commanding, that shit is taken by Admiral Ackbar.Mark Hamill Luke is barely in the movie as sequel bait. The only ones that didn't show their age was C3PO and Chewbacca. R2-D2 had one tiny part to play as he was shown up by the volleyball robot.The villains:New Darth Vader/Kylo Ren: Is a laughable villain, they managed to resurrected all the cringe worthy moments of Anakin Skywalker, with an actor that cannot play a torn soul and whose actions are so inept that new emperor should have killed him.New Emperor/Supreme Leader: Again a mere shadow of the menace that was Emperor Palpatine. Also poor Andy Serkis will be cursed to play CGI motion capture model for the rest of his career. He also just there as sequel bait.Quota Stormtrooper/Phasma: Why did they feel the need to waste Brianne of Tarth on this. She is NPC with like two lines and no reason to be there plot wise. She isn't even like a super Stormtrooper. WTF. Even gets captured.New Tarkin/Hux: Surprisingly manages to halfway steal the show, though his whole purpose was to be a Hitler knockoff. Just missing the mustache.The heroes:Reverse Darth Vader/Finn: Is not too bad, though I wish the story was a little more developed. Would have been nice to see him in the Stormtrooper role for a little longer and fuller arc to heroNew Luke/Rey: Again not too bad, thankfully sparing me\" I'm female hero so that means I'm a mega bitch\" to very minor levels which is actually is joke in the movie. Kind of wooden and also lacking development.New Han sorta/Po: Is missing from about half of the movie and is relegated to hand wave plot motion device that is actually quite sad.Minor charactersNew Yoda/Maz: A full-fledged alien Ms. Exposition who sole purpose is to push New Luke to Old Luke.The effects: Were good, if the camera work didn't excite. Thankfully, someone told JJ to knock it off with the lens flairs. The soundtrack: Classic John Williams, though there wasn't any Imperial March or Duel of Fates to speak of, it's kind of sad really.Finally, I'm pretty sure this movie is going to get high marks from everybody else cuz politics and money yo but my from my humble opinion Hollywood managed to make another cash grab by resurrecting storyline Frankenstein's monster style yet again. Not that the movie is prequel bad, just nothing new to see and no new story to tell.",

He has a crazy Red Arm, anyway! So cool! Maybe he found a new, identical, C3PO droid leg. But wait a minute. We have to do that a lot in this movie. We have to make up our own plot explanations 20 or 30 times. OH, yeah.. that *could* have happened, whatever. A jawa trader just gave up a droid that's worth a fortune, sure, but he probably didn't know it was worth anything either. The bad guy took his mask off because some stupid smuggler pissed him off, sure. Princess Leia hugs Rey as if she's her long-lost daughter even though they've exchanged six words with each other. Poe and Fin are super duper best buddies even though right before they escaped, Poe pointed out that this guy is just a stormtrooper who wants to desert. But whatever, best friends now. We have to do that a lot, and it is annoying. Do all of the reviewers work for Disney? How does this have 8.5/10 rating?.There are two movies here. There's a really intriguing story about a girl who finds out that she has a deep, mysterious history that she never knew about, and rebel friends with a plan to bring freedom to a universe ruled by power and greed. And then there's a Hollywooded-out story where a bunch of characters that were almost really cool got left flat and the plot elements had to be resolved when the bad guy loses his super powers, the good guys suddenly gain unexplained super powers, and where the bad guy's base is really poorly defended and his minions easily beaten.I didn't hate it. Seriously. But it's hard not to hate the viral marketing (What's with those \"No Spoilers!\" memes ?? What is there to spoil? Are you afraid I'm going to tell my friends about the obvious plot holes?) This movie was sort of a cash grab. If it didn't have \"Star Wars\" all over it, it would be just another crappy Hollywood movie.The Plot Had Obvious ProblemsThe plot elements resolved themselves far too easily, and a lot of what happened did not make sense in the context of the Star Wars universe. One character's powers are \"awakened\" in the space of about twenty minutes - suddenly more powerful than other Jedi that have trained for years. The bad guy suddenly loses his powers for no reason. A janitor gives someone who is basically a kung-fu master a run for his money. The giant, quadzillion space-dollar space station has an obvious weakness and terrible network security, since its defenses can be deactivated by a random squad commander at a random, unguarded computer terminal. Wtf?There are dozens of moments that just don't make sense, which would have been *so easy* to just change slightly so the plot is a bit more intriguing. It all makes me think that the movie was named this just so they had a magical explanation for all of the ridiculously good luck that the heroes have.The Dialogue Fell Short -The lines seemed like they had been oversimplified to just a series of one-liners, which in most cases would make sense with just a bit more dialogue. The science and realism that could've easily been there, wasn't - it became clear that the writers don't respect the audience when they say \"*the* sun\" rather than \"a star,\" or \"this system's sun,\" or really, anything other than what they actually said, which sounded completely stupid. Another phrase I take issue with is \"thermal oscillator.\" Semantically, that makes no sense. It would have been just as easy to say \"thermal modulator.\" But, they didn't. And that upsets me.The plot is a bunch of recycled, generic Star Wars elements, yes. But, that said, it's hard to say what I would've been satisfied with. There is a lot that they could have messed up with this movie, or the next one.#1 Problem with the movie - The really cool, really intriguing bad guy takes off his mask. He apparently had gone through great pains to hide his face, and make the audience think he was awesome. In the first half of the movie, he's this awesome, violent masked character with a cool voice. In the second half of the movie, he's an insecure child whose force powers shut off by themselves for no reason. Ooh, I'm so scared.The point is, this movie could have been *so cool.* I think they should have gone with the plot that it's obvious they were trying to have. But somewhere along the lines, Hollywood happened to this movie and they decided to please the crowd by throwing all three of the previous episodes in a blender, and removing any really distinguishing plot elements from this film. Whatever. It was fun to watch, but nothing happened, and the real hero of the movie is a nameless X-ray pilot. On the surface, it looks really good, but I think that if you scratch the glass, this is a really generic Hollywood story with a bunch of Star Wars stickers on it.",

    "review": "  Jar Jar Abrhams has finally proved what the hardcore Star Wars fans thought wasn't possible. He made a movie so bad it makes Episode 1 look good. The movie is essentially a reboot of Episode 4. From a bigger deathstar (which the movie points our for you incase you weren't sure) to the death of a mentor which causes the main character to cry despite having met him only a few scenes earlier. This movie was bogus. Incase that isn't enough we even get a whinney tantrum throwing sith to enjoy. The humor was so randomly thrown in the movie that I wasn;t sure if I'm supposed to laugh or just stare awkwardly at the screen. They tried to make the Empire funny which made the movie even worse since the empire is supposed to be forboading and dangerous while the Rebellion tends to lean to more humanly charecteristics. As for the Rebellion they added it to this movie, but its called the \"Resistance\". They even have a bunker ust like in Episode 4 even though they won 30 years earlier. Theres not explenation as to why the Resistance isn't the Republic or as to why the Republic isn't helping the Resistance or why theres even a Resistance anyways. As for the \"New Order\" there isn't much explenation as to why it's around or why the REpublic lets it do it's thing and build massive planet sized Death Stars. I could go on and on, but if you're a hardcore fan and haven't seen this movie yet..don't waste 10 bucks on a ticket. Instead sit at home and watch A New Hope. Its the same thing anyways.",

    "review": "  The new Star Wars (The Force Awakens) people over reacted with it saying how great it was but although the actors were amazing the plot wasn't. Even the directer from the first 3 movies even said he would have done it different. In the first book is shows you tat when Luke Skywalker found out he had the force he had to learn how to use a life saver, and the mind control like thing. Now I don't know if you noticed but the new character Rey as soon as she found out she had the force she completely knew how to use everything, from the mind control, to how to use a lifesaver.",

    "review": "  The film was more about visuals and has some really dumb moments through out and J.J. Abrams penchant to make fan fiction films. The problem for me was that Rey character at times was poorly written. inconstant, and annoying character I have seen. She speaks lines I would expect a ten year old sidekick to say in awe or some star wars fan would spew in fan fiction . Yes my eyes were rolling like they were watching the Phantom Menace when Rey was suddenly starts piloting the Millennium Falcon (plot hole) at the beginning and then Han Solo's later entrance in another ship that finds them (plot hole). I can see why Rian Johnson is taking over the franchise for Episode 8. I hope Riany fixes the characters and this franchise that has been repeatably trashed by Lucas.",

    "review": "  Ok, let's get this out of the way first: The new Star Wars movie does live up to the original trilogy. Besides that though, it also modernizes the franchise, while also being a hoot of an adventure movie for both newcomers and longtime fans. While the inclusion of familiar faces is sure to invigorate the audience, the best moments come from the new characters. Finn, Rey and Kylo Ren are all well-cast and instantly likable, and hopefully their back stories will be even more fleshed out in the sequels. Also, The Force Awakens is carried by a really tight script, and just like this year's Mad Max: Fury Road, it's jam-packed with action but still tells a story efficiently. Some emotional moments are a bit glossed over, and some story elements seem a bit too similar to the original Star Wars, but it's free of the annoying and childish tone that doomed the Star Wars prequels. Finally, Star Wars fans can sleep tight: Their signature series is back and with a brighter future than ever.",

I really don't like how it took Luke Skywalker three movies (including training by Yoda) before he could use/handle the force and defeat Darth Vader, but it takes this girl 14 seconds (with no training) to figure out and master all the nuances of the force and defeat the dark side/Kylo Ren. She went from scavenger/nobody to the ultimate jedi warrior in 14 seconds with no training. Just ridiculous and stupid. She is not believable as a hero/jedi saving the galaxy and Kylo Ren is not believable as the bad guy (new Darth Vader) - he's a wuss. I'm surprised they did not have him break down and cry and surrender to the girl. Terrible job as a villain. I won't bother going to see any more Star Wars movies now that Disney is doing them.",

    "review": "  Episode 7 hat gute Effekte, gute Schauspieler, netten Humor, gutes Sezenenbild und ein paar coole Ideen. Das will ich nicht bestreiten. Aber leider fehlt dem Film in den Grundlagen des Filmemachens die Professionali�t. Das Drehbuch ist �u�erst schwach geraten, obwohl gute Vors�tze vorhanden sind. Das f�ngt bei der Grundlage an, dass im Grunde Episode 4 im gr��eren Ma�stab mit ein bisschen Episode 3 fast identisch wiedergegeben wird, nur eben weniger dramatisch und spannend. Dem Zuschauer wird die Vorgeschichte der Personen und darin ihre Bewegr�nde in eins�tzigen Unterhaltungen entgegengeworfen, so das keine Zeit bleibt, sich emotional in die Protagonisten und Antagonisten einzuf�hlen. Selbst der Hintergrund der beiden Hauptfiguren wird mit zwei S�tzen abgehandelt. Was Solo, Leia und Luke in der Zwischenzeit getrieben haben, wird mit gef�hlten 3 Silben behandelt und in h�lzerne Gespr�che gepresst. Es wird nicht einmal versucht sie realistisch wirken zu lassen. Man h�tte dem Film eine halbe Stunde mehr geben m�ssen, die mit guten Dialogen und Spannungsaufbau verbringen m�ssen, dann h�tte etwas daraus werden k�nnen. Aber dann h�tten sich da draussen wieder ein paar Jugendliche beschwert, weil es 10 Minuten lang zu keiner Explosion gekommen ist. Keylo Rens Absichten, warum er auf der dunklen Seite wandelt, werden nicht einmal genannt. Seine Herkunft wird ebenso mager erz�hlt und als er sp�ter sein Gesicht unter der Maske zeigt, fingen viele im Kinosaal unwillk�rlich an zu lachen. Die Enth�llung wirkt fast schon peinlich. Von der feinf�hligen Entwicklung eines Anakin zum Darth Vader, trotz der damaligen Sch�chen in der Umsetzung, ist hier nicht das geringste zu sp�ren. Und doch versucht man hier den emotionalen Inhalt von Episode 3 mit einzuarbeiten. Wer einen zweiten Darth Vader erwartet, kann lange warten. Man sieht hier eben auch deutlich die Handschrift von J.J. Abrams, der manchmal dazu neigt, das Drehbuch, was Dramatik und Substanz betrifft, nicht richtig auszureizen. Nat�rlich lag auf ihm ein unglaublicher Druck und Filmemachen ist nun ach nicht einfach. Aber das Interesse an ausgefeilten, emotionalen Drehb�chern ist in den letzten Jahren stark gesunken. Wer vertr�gt heute schon noch emotionale, nachdenklich machende Kost, wenn man auch schnelllebige, hirnausschalt-Kost haben kann. Doch so bleibt nichts, als ein schnell vergangenes Actionkino, das trotz dramatischem Inhalt, wie eine Runde \"Avengers\" vorbei geht und kein bisschen ber�hrt. George Lucas hat da ein besseres H�ndchen gehabt. Die Magier seiner Filme, (auch wenn sie nicht perfekt waren und es ein paar Ausrutscher gab), dieser Kampf zwischen dunkler und heller Macht, war bei ihm viel sp�rbarer. Episode 7 hat Witz und ein paar gute Actionszenen. Aber ihm fehlt die Substanz um in Erinnerung zu bleiben und bemerkenswert zu sein.",

The lack of lens flares....the characters...no midichlorian bullshit...all good. Though plot elements from the original trilogy are obviously used (Evil giant planet destroying death ball, old man death, opening on a desert planet) and we get more than enough nods to the original trilogy, it is done in a way all Star Wars fans would want and love. Fresh new batch of likable and interesting characters are introduced such as the stubborn, brave, tomboyish Rey, the badass pilot Poe, and the dude who is way in over his head, Finn. And we are also given the original characters we know and love. Han and Chewie are back and haven't changed a bit and Leia is back and her actress thankfully lost all that excess fat. Phew! Though I'm wondering if they put on too much make-up cuz she could barely make facial expressions. Kylo Ren is the antagonist we've been waiting for. Fans of the infamous Jacen Solo from the expanded universe will be pleased to know Kylo Ren's real name is Ben Solo. Many say Kylo Ren is an annoying whiny douchebag...well he kinda is, but isn't it better to have a bad guy like that. Rather than get a cliche pretty boy, we get a dopey, big eared, long faced, non-scary looking bad guy who actually looks scarier and more dangerous and even sounds better with the mask ON. This makes his obsession with Vader make more sense, as he wants to be as strong and dangerous as his late grandfather and thus has the Vader-ish mask. So this whiny wannabe is actually a great antagonist. As for the dark-colored female stormtropper...she didn't really do much so I'm hoping for more of her in the next film. Cuz she BORED me. Other issues include the galactic conflict? Instead of the First Order being the bad guys and the good guys being called the resistance...shouldnt the Resistance be the remains of the old empire trying to take over? And shouldn't Leia be leading the Republic's army to stop them from recreating the Empire? As for the map to Luke Skywalker....why is there a map? Who made it? Why did R2 have 90% of it? Who figured out the 10%? Leia was looking for him so was the map some kind of process of elimination thing? Calculated deduction? As a whole this movie is GREAT! Emotion! Action! Characters! Music! EVERYTHING! It makes you want MORE!One last question....WTF is Kylo Ren's uniform made of?! It looks like a plain cloak! And we was taken all those lightsaber blows like it was nothing. I'm assuming he has a layer of Mandalorian steel or something cuz...wow...that would hurt A LOT. Force Awakens gets a 5/5...barely.",

Abrams has really gone whole hog to please us ageing fans of the old films, and the plot was sometimes a bit too much like that of A New Hope.Still, it was fun, and that's all that matters. I'm guessing it's going to take a while for the fans to sort through all the layers of allusions back to the old series, but the story also lays the ground for a continuation that just might work. Not a masterpiece, but a satisfying continuation of the whole Star wars mythology.",

    "review": "  El episodio n�mero VII de la saga de \"Star Wars\", el universo creado por George Lucas e inspirado en los seriales de ciencia ficci�n de los a�os 40 y 50, est� en buenas manos con los estudios Disney. El director J.J. Abrams, creador de la serie \"Lost\" y responsable de la resurrecci�n de la franquicia de \"Star Trek\", logra hacernos olvidar de las desastrosas precuelas dirigidas por Lucas a comienzos de la d�cada del 2000 y vuelve a darle a \"Star Wars\" la energ�a, el sentido del asombro, la emoci�n y la diversi�n de la saga original. La estructura del gui�n escrito por Abrams y Lawrence Kasdan (antiguo colaborador de Lucas) copia pr�cticamente la estructura base de la pel�cula original de 1977, pero la adorna con muchos elementos nuevos y sorpresas que no se ve�an venir. Han-Solo, la Princesa Leia, C-3PO, R2D2, Chewbacca e inclusive Luke Skywalker vuelven en esta entrega que se desarrolla 30 a�os despu�s de los sucesos ocurridos en \"The Return Of The Jedi\", pero ahora est�n acompa�ados de nuevos y grandiosos personajes: un carism�tico robot llamado BB8, un stormtroopper renegado llamado Finn (un s�lido John Boyega de \"Attack The Block\"), una misteriosa chica solitaria llamada Rey (una tambi�n s�lida Daisy Ridley), un valiente y bondadoso piloto llamdo Poe (Oscar Isaac de \"Inside Llewin Davis\") y unos odiosos y misteriosos villanos llamados Kylo Ren (un potente Adam Driver) y el L�der Supremo Snoke (un malvado e imponente Andy Serkis). Estos nuevos personajes llegaron para quedarse y si los siguientes episodios de \"Star Wars\" planeados por Disney son as� de buenos, me tendr�n comprando las boletas por anticipado.",

It dosent follow the expanded universe and it makes no sense with everything. from the old republic to the legacy era, what was supposed to happen was that the Yuuzhan Vong aliens from Yuuzhan'tar planet in another galaxy was supposed to come to the galaxy and invade!! They attemped to terraform corascant and them later on they got fended off by the Galactic Republic, They later invade a second time which caused another civil war and total there i think were about 4 yuuzhan vong wars. It just dosent follow the expanded universe because all disney cares about is ruining star wars and making it for little kids. I was looking foward too seeing the movie until I heard disney will try to remove the old and beast expanded universe.",

He basically takes old materials and slaps a fresh coat of paint on it. Watch the original. Adam Driver is laughably miscast as a millennial spoiled brat with mommy and daddy issues. And, the original cast members have nothing to do other than phone it in. There is NO reason to see this again from FX. He repurposed everything, including the Deathstar which is just supersized from the old one. Skip it. Go see Guardians of the Galaxy.",

    "review": "  I am not a Star Wars fan. Or at least I wasn't until this past weekend when I watched Stars Wars: The Force Awakens�and fell in deep cosmic like. As a fan of romantic comedies and Oprah recommended films that tug at heart strings and make you cry, this most recent story, directed by J.J. Abrams,�has won me over and I now anticipate the next installment.�Yes, it was that good.This film is what Star Wars enthusiasts and super fans would call, \"strong with the force.\"� Why? Well, because as a novice to the franchise, I was never lost in a web of characters or plot subjects that needed over explaining in gap filling montages or flashbacks that would go over my head if I was not a previous viewer. Though a flashback did occur, it was executed in such a fashion that I didn't need my all knowing Star Wars encyclopedia of a brother to explain. Plus the cinematography is beautiful, wide shots are amazing, close-ups are meaningful, and the subtle pauses gives you time to take in the scenery that lingers on the perimeters of your mind as you continue to enjoy in awe and wonder.For all of my fashion and beauty gurus, Princess Leia, who is now General Leia, has a new twist on her cinnamon bun up-do, and to satisfy my yearning for romantic connections, Han Solo is still in love with the princess who inspired a thousand up-dos.� General Leia still looks at Han with a, \"come hither gaze,\" and all I wantedthem to do was to run off into the galaxy together and spoon in a space pod far far away, but alas the galaxy must be saved, and the Princess, I mean General Leia must send her love off into battle and save their son from the dark side. I have revealed too much.The blockbuster is filmed with themes of bravery, betrayal, internal conflict and self realization.� Without giving too much away to those still waiting to go see the movie, a number of key characters have similar internal struggles: questioning where they belong, wondering if they are on the right path, many are being haunted by their pasts, and what is most interesting is that they are challenging galactic norms and departing from what is expected.� Star Wars: The Force Awakens,�is well written so that you don't have to be a sci-fi junkie to enjoy the drama, comedy, romance, tech and effects of the film. It satisfies the theatrical palette. It did not disappoint.Should you go see the movie? Yes, you should.",

    "review": "  The first hour of the film was interesting as it introduced us to the new generation of characters. Towards the end of this first hour though it becomes apparent that these aren't actually new characters at all, they are just the same characters from A New Hope, re-cycled with new actors & actresses and given new names. Once this becomes apparent, it is obvious that we are not watching a new film at all, but instead just a re-make of A New Hope. Therefore, the rest of the film is just spent watching happen, what you already know will happen.Yes of course it's got more bells and whistles, and the CGI means they can do fancier things, but we are just watching the exact same film. Those of us who were around to watch the original will not find anything new here to excite us, and new fans to the series will think it's a great film which inexplicably has some OAP's in.I don't really see any point in watching this film if you have already seen the original. And if you haven't seen the original, then watch that instead, it's better, funnier and doesn't have a Pound Shop Darth Vader for a villain.Having said all that of course it's still better than the prequels, so whilst Star Wars is in slightly better hands than it was when Lucas had it, if Disney are only going to re-cycle the same plot, almost scene for scene, then I won't get my hopes up too much for Episodes 8 & 9.",

It borrows certain elements from the original trilogy, which they carry out smoothly enough, but some might still have a problem with it.

The effects are by far the best in the whole saga, which is to be excpected. The mixture between practical effects and CGI is great and help the film a lot. J.J.

I you were hoping for a reboot similar to what Abrams did with Star Trek you will be disappointed. This is more like the comfort of a familiar old blanket on a cold night. The new characters do not have much depth yet but you must remember that with the original characters there has been almost 40 years of backstory development in the various books. My biggest complaint that in an effort to create a strong female character they may have gone too far...Rey is Wesley Crusher the only person in the entire movie that is capable of anything. Need a starship fixed call Rey, Need a super Pilot call Rey, need a Jedi master in light sabres...Rey. I understand natural talent can overcome experience but if the first time she picks up a light saber in the woods she can be a Sith Apprentice with not much effort then it removes all suspense as the villian is so weak that what happens when she gets training. There is a nice three short story book that gives some background on the characters and Finn was a super skilled stormtrooper with a conscious unfortunately in the movie he is more of a bungling comic relief side kick. Again I realize that this is so Rey can be the ONLY hero in the story. I hope the second movie deviates from Empire strikes back and we do not get Luke as Yoda, some major battle with the First Order winning and one of our sidekicks put into stasis, suspense reveal of Rey's parents) The movie has introduced some good new characters it just needs to use them to tell a better story going forward. They need to make the villains more menacing Capt. Plasma was a disappointment and Kylo seemed more like a teen angst character from a Twilight movie than the successor to Darth Vader.",
