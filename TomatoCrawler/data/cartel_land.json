    "review": "  This is an eye opening documentary which follows groups of vigilante's who are so fed up with Mexican drug cartels they have decided to do something about it. The problem is that the lines are blurred as to who the criminals are and on what side they are on. Watching this film you cant hep but think Mexico is Damed. There seems to be no order and the country is entirely corrupt. If i was a Mexican it would totally depress me. There are some very gruesome scenes of what happened to some of the Cartel members and their victims and it's not for the faint hearted but don't let that put you off what is a fascinating look into another world.",

    "review": "  Two men stood against on the different side of the border for the same cause.I was not sure what to expect from this film. By seeing its poster, my mind was very clear that it definitely some serious subject. I'm kind of a person who's not okay with the lions killing a zebra on the animal planet, so I was worried about the clips they might show would be too violence. You know, in the movies everything's fake, and this isn't a movie, but a documentary. That's why I simply disliked 'The Act of Killing'.The opening scene was something like 'Breaking Bad', so I thought it might told from the bad guy's perspective about how their network and business would work. But everything drastically changed after the 5-10 minutes of the film. It's where the original story commence.The two main characters were introduced who are fighting for a same cause, but separated by the international line. Across the border, under the different society and government, how these two sacrifice their lives in battle against the dangerous networks that threatens the peace is the story.In a small town on the southern border of the US, a small paramilitary team headed by Tim has taken such a measure to prevent the all kinds of trafficking. In the same line, Dr. Mireles from the Michoacan, Mexico, goes a bit bigger and stronger by forming a force with the volunteered people with arms to fight for the same mission.The film had many the phases, not like the chapters or the episodes, but like a split in the narration to cover the other side of the story. The stories of two men and their undertaking was the prime focus. That's what I thought, you know I felt it was a modern day 'The Magnificent Seven', but in the larger scale of everything. Only until a twist that surprised me, because I was not thought a tale would turn like this.\"I believe what I'm doing is good.And I believe what I'm standing up against is evil.\"So what's the twist? I tell you, you know, one man was doing his task all by himself with the help of a few other buddies. On the other side, the man's contribution becomes the nation and international news and publicity. In such circumstance, a fame can turn the destiny of a man on whatever side. It's not like why he did what he had done, but a default human nature.I thought 'Heli' was a fictional work. After seeing this documentary I'm not sure how to judge any country by what they depict in their films. Every nation has its flaws, but I wondered why Mexican government was so blind over drug trafficking as shown in this film, if the information was correct. The absence of the federal law enforcement agencies on those disputed places is really a humiliation for the government after this film officially entered the Oscars race.I don't think taking action again them won't collapse the nation or the economy. And again, I'm not the right person here to analyse and predict the nation's fate. I've never been to Mexico and I know little about Mexico, but all this only because of the curious to know the truth, that's all. When it comes to the filmmaking, I don't know how it was made.Documentaries usually follows with the series of interviews and the recorded clips, in this it was a live shot like any entertainment film. Maybe I must look for director's Q&A for the answers. But something was sure, that production happened at the right place at the right time.This a very good documentary film, very gripping and interesting storyline with the characters. I don't watch documentaries on the regular basis and to be honest, I saw it for the Oscars nod, to know what its special. I don't think it is going to win, certainly I can't either rule out the chances as it made this far. Anything might happen, so wait and see.It had a few dull moments, lot like a pause in the narration or took a wrong diversion after the first half. But during the conclusion, brought back to the track and clarified many doubts, yet leave a few unanswered. Not for the sake of the Academy Awards nominee, you can give it a try if you feel you're interested to know why the people are taking arms in their hands to fight the evil force that corrupting our society.8/10",

It also talks a lot about the Mexico vigilantes and how they try to clean their towns. At the same time showing how the Autodefense (Mexican vigilantes) sometimes abuse this power. In all this film mostly shows how little power the Mexican Government has against the cartels and how that lack of control is causing problem for us hear in America.

While the coverage of the strife that happens in Michaoacan is insightful, the opposite is true for the coverage of the self armed, racist border patrol. It knocks you over the head, trying to juxtapose the stories of self determination in two communities that struggle against drug cartel violence.

Las entrevistas que logr� son supremas pero no tuvo idea de como utilizarlas, l�stima. Triste ver como este fen�meno del paramilitarimo y/o autodefensas est� presente en todo el continente. Triste ver como la gente se pierde en la locura colectiva de la violencia, las armas, el poder, el dinero, las drogas. Triste ver como ese c�ncer avanza por todo M�xico y como acaba con su pueblo. Triste ver la cabalgante corrupci�n de los gobiernos. Pero lo m�s triste de todo es saber que en mi pa�s debemos estar mucho, pero mucho peor respecto a esto, que es mucho, mucho, pero mucho decir.",

    "review": "  I thought it was an amazing story but could have been told much better. Firstly I don't think the group on the American side were that interesting or analogous to the group on the Mexican side. The Mexican side were basically an effective operation to fight criminality both in the cartels and the government. The American guys seemed like a bunch of lost souls. I wasn't even quite sure what they thought they were achieving but all it seemed to be was capturing some dumb kids. So the story on the mexican side was much more fascinating but it was told in a quite a muddled way. For example the split in Autodefensas (which was a key point) seemed confusing, Basically it was a filmmaker so familiar with his subject matter than he often lingers on irrelevant details while failing to explain major points. The story of Autodefensas was amazing and can be summed up by \"Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.\"",

On one side, you see the rapid rise and downfall of Dr. Jose Mireles, who founds the Autodefensas, a citizen uprising that opposes the all-powerful drug cartels and corrupt police forces in the Mexican state of Michocan. On the US side, you follow the a paramilitary group called the 'Arizona Border Recon' that patrols the Altar Valley of Arizona, also called, \"Cocaine Alley\".

Being incorporated legally does not equate to humanity in any sense - people, society, environment, sustainability of life. So... rather than billions on a fence, patrol, etc. why not put that money into drug treatment, enforcement in the US - or maybe just legalize everything and produce drugs for druggies for export. We already export products and ideas that are devastating and as long as money is made, taxes paid, then ...",

    "review": "  Up close and personal from all sides, Cartel Land paints an unvarnished bleak picture of just how badly corrupted all levels in Mexico are and the withering daily violence visited on rural villages as well as towns and cities. This documentary cannot have a happy ending, and it does not, as narco wars continue in much of Mexico. The true hero is a medical surgeon, Dr. Manual Miriles who suspends his medical work to devote his efforts to form a self defense group to fight the drug cartels, house by house if necessary. That Mexican police are corrupt is very clear, not so clear is how much corruption exists in Mexico's military. On camera gun battles are shown and the bravery of the camera crew is scary to watch but the results are gripping. Also well documented is the feckless of the federal government of the United States and its look the other way for the most part attitude. The film is presented mostly from the Mexican side, but also focuses on the Arizona Border Recon, a group of armed volunteers who scout the border for smugglers of both people and drugs. The film will leave you wanting to know more and the end coda is a sad one indeed for what happens to those who really care, yet get screwed by the Mexican federal government. Mexican President Nieto comes off looking like a narcisstic jackass.",

    "review": "  Deep in the desert, where no legitimate government rules, a terrorist organization operates freely. Established governments fear them. They're well-financed, violent and ruthless. They control large swaths of land, including some cities and towns, causing local residents to live in fear. The members of this organization think nothing of murdering their enemies or killing just to make a point. They murder men, women and children, and even celebrate those deaths. They often decapitate their victims and sometimes use the internet to publicize videos and photos of their brutality. They even evoke the name of their god to justify their actions.I'm not talking about the Middle East or ISIS. I'm talking about Mexican drug cartels.The documentary \"Cartel Land\" (R, 1:38) shows everything I just described and more, but focuses mainly on vigilante groups who fight the cartels - on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border. The film's title refers to areas of Mexico - and areas of the United States as well. U.S. Marine veteran Tim \"Nailer\" Foley leads a small paramilitary group called Arizona Border Recon whose volunteer members carry semi-automatic rifles and patrol Arizona's Altar Valley (\"Cocaine Alley\") for any sign of drug traffickers operating on the U.S. side of the border. Meanwhile, Jose Mireles leads the Autodefensas, whose members carry similar weapons in their quest to root out members of the ruthless drug cartel which operates in the area around the western Mexican state of Michoac�n. Both of these vigilante groups operate outside of their government's good graces but both governments refrain from direct action against the groups, even seeming to work with them on some level. The film alternates between following both groups as they struggle to turn back the advancing tide of cartels operating in their areas and also deal with manpower and leadership issues and with the friction between them and their respective governments. The story of these two vigilante groups is bookended by scenes shot during methamphetamine production by cartel affiliates at a remote outdoor location in Mexico. With their faces covered, this small group of men goes about their business unfettered and they even talk to the camera. At one point, their leader admits that what they're doing is wrong, but doesn't seem to care. He says that they'll continue cooking meth \"as long as God allows it\". Similarly, the leaders of both Arizona Border Recon and the Autodefensas justify their actions, even as some of their methods resemble those of the cartels. \"Cartel Land\" does things that I've never seen before in any documentary and does others better than I've ever seen them done. I've rarely praised either of these in other documentaries, but the cinematography and the score are both magnificent. Even more impressive than how it was shot is where it was shot. Besides gaining practically unprecedented access to that secret meth lab, director Matthew Heineman embeds with these vigilante groups, following them on their missions and getting up close and personal with some of the action in some obviously dangerous situations. (The film won the directing and cinematography awards in its category at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival.) The editing is also extremely impressive. The film contains more surprising reveals and vital story developments than in many traditional movie thrillers. Besides Heineman's obvious talents (and guts), it probably didn't hurt that one of the doc's executive producers is Kathryn Bigelow, Oscar-winning director of \"The Hurt Locker\" and \"Zero Dark Thirty\". Bigelow and Heineman's film is quite simply one of the best documentaries I have ever seen and only the second one that I have ever given this grade: \"A\".",

Previous documentaries that I've watched have revealed government officials and police partner with cartels. Cartels end up with everyone in their pocket - on their payroll and the Drug Machine just keeps on rolling. You realize that the poverty in Mexico has really forced most citizens hands into producing Meth and other substances. Putting yourself in their shoes - it's a hard to say that you would different given the options they have.",
