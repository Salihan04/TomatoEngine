    "review": "  Julianne Moore is pretty dang good as a fifty-year-old linguistics professor who learns that she has Early-Onset Alzheimer's. Moore's eyes are simultaneously blank and frightened, and her naturally strained smile really works for this tension-filled character. The narrative is rather choppy, but there are some truly great moments: the five-minute-long close-up of Alice ever-so-slightly struggling to complete the doctor's memory quiz, the scene of Alice panicking because she can't find the bathroom and ultimately wetting herself, the harrowing and suspenseful sequence of Alice trying to end her suffering by following the directions she recorded for herself when she was still lucid. All the supporting characters are somewhat superfluous, save for youngest daughter Lydia, played to varying degrees of competency by Kristen Stewart. Her rocker hair is a cool style choice, but KStew can't stop playing with it, and the beachy waves don't work at all for the Chekov play. She tsks before most of her lines, indicating a lack of breath support, which is even more noticeable when she's trying to deliver classical theatre monologues. She shrugs and shakes her head and shivers like a Chihuahua. She only transcends her crutches when she delivers Harper's monologue from \"Angels in America\" in the last scene, and even that's not a great barometer of her acting skill because while she's very good at playing Lydia's objective of connecting with her mother, I doubt that her unfaltering gaze and rapid pace would actually work for the role within the role.",

    "review": "  Driven solely by the character of Alice, there is nothing really remarkable about this film aside from the performance of Julianne Moore. There is a very impressive script written here, aside from a few questionable moments, but the plain camerawork and \"television\" feel the film has throughout, makes it a weird viewing experience to those were hoping for this story to be told in a \"Hollywood\" way. Does that hurt the film's story? No, but may make your mind meander throughout it's 102-minute running time. It's themes really does make you feel for these characters' emotions, and you will probably have a few tears trickling down your face, but what bothered me were the off-putting technical aspects. Overall, it is a very powerful and moving character study that is extremely well-acted and well-written. Those are two of the necessities in a great film, so I will give it a lot of credit for that, but there are a few undeniable set-backs, including an extremely abrupt ending. In the end, not having read the novel that this film is based upon, \"Still Alice\" is a moving picture that I highly recommend.",

    "review": "  \"Still Alice\" is one of those quiet dramas that is eye opening and heartbreaking at the same time. Julianne Moore stars as Alice, a brilliant college professor who is diagnosed with Early-Onset Alzheimer's. From there it's the about the impact of the disease not only on her, but her family. Moore is fantastic and will no doubt get a bunch of award nominations, and could easily win. Alec Baldwin plays her husband, and this is probably his best film performance in a long time. He isn't your typical husband in one of these movies. It's a very real and honest portrayal of a man who is losing his wife and doesn't know what to do. Even Kristen Stewart is good as Alice's daughter. I don't think she does that lip biting thing very much. Good movie with a great performance. But, it can be uncomfortable to watch, especially if you have a loved one battling alzheimer's.",

    "review": "  A beautiful film that deals with a difficult subject and one that terrifies me as I get older. My own mother exhibits signs of the disease and her mother became afflicted in her final years. The acting was superb, and justified the Oscar for Julianne Moore for me. Kristen Stewart demonstrated once again what a fine young actress she is, in spite of her bad reputation because of the Twilight franchise. One scene that really brought home for me what beginning to lose one's memory must feel like. Alice is out for a run through the streets of New York, in the vicinity of Columbia, where she taught Linguistics for many years. She suddenly stops running and the camera pans around her, showing the confusion on her face while the background remains out of focus for what seems an eternity. The image finally resolves on the facade of the building in front of her and one realizes she is on the campus of Columbia. A powerful image that struck home with me. This one had me on the emotional edge for it's entirety. The only thing to keep it from perfection, for me, was Alec Baldwin's portrayal as Alice's husband. I would have liked to have seen a more sympathetic character (or maybe a more sympathetic actor) in the role. But otherwise a pitch perfect portrayal of a woman who winds up losing herself to this horrible disease.",

    "review": "  Still Alice is a very simple movie on the surface, but once you watch it you get something so much more, boosted by the performance of a lifetime from Julianne Moore. It takes a deep look at the tragedy and horrors of Alzheimer's disease, and how it effects Alice and the people closest to her. The film shows us themes such as cherishing life and the memories of the people and things we love. I am still completely in awe of Moore's epic performance, truly becoming following each stage of Alzheimer's with perfection. I have had family members who have suffered from this tragic disease, and all I can say to Moore is bravo and that her Academy Award was well deserved. She gave every ounce of her soul and mind into this role. Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart also give noteworthy performances, each giving real and emotional performances that helped feel for them and our protagonist. Everyone will have a different reaction to this film, wanting a happy ending with everything handed to them easily, but Still Alice isn't a simple movie and it shows the reality of life and commend them for it. Thanks to a great script and perfect performances, especially from the flawless Julianne Moore, this film soars.",

    "review": "  On a trip to California to see her actress daughter Lydia(Kristen Strewart) and to speak at a conference, Alice Howland(Julianne Moore), a university professor in linguistics, trips over a line or two in her speech. Concerned that this could be a symptom of something more serious, she sees a medical doctor who after running a wide variety of tests, diagnoses her with early onset Alzheimer's disease. To make matters worse, the disease is genetic, putting her three children at risk of developing it.While \"Still Alice\" may not exactly excel in showing Alice's deterioration from her point of view, that's really not the point of this otherwise fine movie. What the movie is much more interested in a keenly perceptive way is the dynamics of the Howland family that is so overachieving that one of the daughters cannot just give birth, she has to have twins. Okay, okay, I know it does not work that way but it could look like that to an outside observer but not to Lydia who is comfortable with opting out of the race. However, for her mother, who remarks at one point that she would have preferred cancer, that is not an option, having overcome so much already in her life. Frightened by what she witnesses at a nursing home, not the state of the patients but the lack of visitors, she Rube Goldbergs her own euthanasia. In the meantime, Alice takes the opportunity to reconnect with Lydia who she had otherwise been at odds with before it is too late.",

    "review": "  UNFORGETTABLE - My Review of STILL ALICE (4 Stars)Tremendously moving, heart wrenching and credible, STILL ALICE puts you right into the head of a relatively young person struggling with early onset Alzheimer's disease. Julianne Moore, in a role certain to garner her first Academy Award, gives the performance of her career as Alice, a sharp linguistics professor who slowly but surely sees everything she has known and cherished dissolve away. Writer-Directors Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer (QUINCEANERA) have adapted Lisa Genova's novel, and despite its flaws, give us a bracingly methodical experience. With few signposts to indicate the passage of time, the audience rides along with Alice as memories and tasks grow blurrier. Cinematographer Denis Lenoir keeps things tight and uses shallow focus to create an unsettling glimpse into Alice's fading mind. Beginning with an almost imperceptible moment of forgetfulness, the story moves along its inevitable trajectory with a quiet sense of foreboding. Some have criticized the Lifetime treatment at play here, but I found it understated and lovely. The score by Ilan Eshkeri could have been more dynamic and edgy, yet it settles instead for the tinkly, overt themes of your standard disease-of-the-week film. It's a minor quibble in a film that brought me to tears, the sobbing, uncontrollable ones often reserved for personal family losses. Because Alice is such a strong, intelligent woman, her decline feels that much more tragic. Her family, particularly strong work from Kristen Stewart as her challenging daughter and Alec Baldwin as a husband who tamps down his own feelings for far too long, may feel sketched in, but that's the point. This film is entirely from Alice's point of view. We have to consistently catch our bearings from scene to scene, much like our protagonist. The repetition of her exercise routines, her recordings, and her doctor visits act as markers for us, slowly chipping away at her (and our) sense of security.An early scene, in which Alice discloses her disease to her husband, is that Oscar clip moment one would expect. Moore infuses it with unexpected rage, and it's some of the best work she has ever done. Strangely enough, she bests that in a latter scene in which she has to give a speech. Standing in front of a group of people, highlighting her prepared words with a yellow marker as she goes, so as not to skip any lines, Moore is matter-of-fact and stunning as she talks about the hell she's living. She fills the moment with surprising joy, utter simplicity, and throws down a Master Class in film acting, the likes of which I have not seen before. Speeches like this do not usually have such a profound effect on me. I typically respond to real exchanges between two people, but this memorable moment cuts so deep, gets to the strange dichotomy of being able to find joy and despair in the same breath, that the aforementioned bawling commenced from the top of the scene and carried into the next few. As Alice's world gets stripped away bit by awful bit, her essence becomes more and more pure, and it affects everyone around her. Stewart does some of her best work in these late scenes, proving that despite the TWILIGHT saga's numbing boredom, she has considerable depth of feeling. The final scene in particular absolutely wrecked me. Stewart's commitment to the moment and Moore's utter transformation will stick with me for a long time. Sure it's a film that will be remembered for Moore's acting rather than as a masterful cinematic experience, but sometimes a beautifully realized window into someone's soul is enough.",

    "review": "  Showcasing a heartbreaking brave performance by Julianne Moore, Still Alice presents a truthful and heartfelt account of harrowing disease. There have been decent dramas about Alzheimer's before, most notably The Notebook and Away from Her. What this latest such film offers, however, is a deeply personal trip down a disheartening rabbit hole that somehow never feels tragic. Still Alice feels so deeply personal because Julianne Moore imbues our heroine with such character that youre drawn into the drama from the outset. The audience becomes ridiculously sympathetic because they seemingly know Alice like an old friend, which is a credit to the actress for informing her life with such detail and verve. And then, filmgoers go on this perilous journey with her.In this PG-13-rated drama based on the novel by Lisa Genova, a linguistics professor (Moore) and her family (Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth) find their bonds tested when she gets diagnosed with Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. Screenwriters-directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland do an excellent and economical job at condensing a 350 page book without losing resonance or relegating supporting players to stock characters. Indeed, despite being a performance piece for Moore, Baldwin, Stewart, and Bosworth likewise shine as some not-always-likeable family members. Still, make no mistake about it, this is a certain actresss show. Its seems improbable that Moore never won an Oscar before this film. Despite a career bursting at the seams with memorable roles (The Big Lebowski, Magnolia, Hannibal, Children of Men, A Single Man, The Kids Are All Right) and past Oscar nominations (Boogie Nights, The End of the Affair, Far From Heaven, The Hours), she had never taken home this prizebefore Still Alice. Not only did she win Best Actress, but she totally deserves it for this vital inspirational role. Bottom line: Courageous Beauty",

    "review": "  A hard-hitting and underplayed portrait of what Alzheimer's can do to the best of us, Still Alice depressed the hell out of me and that's okay. What makes this even more tragic is the fact that our protagonist (Julianne Moore) is exceedingly brilliant and watching her slow drift into cognitive oblivion despite her best efforts and clever mental tricks was a bit hard to take. Moore commits to the point it puts Eddie Redmayne to shame and it's quite fascinating how in each scene (and I mean EVERY scene) we see some new hint of mental decline and the person who we are familiar with begins to fade. The film itself is tastefully shot and the soundtrack will often give clues as to the state of her mind, especially when she is about to suffer an attack. The supporting performances are beyond excellent with Alec Baldwin as the silently suffering husband and Kristen Stewart (yes, HER) as the closest of the children to the mother and understanding her feelings. I'm still going to go on record and say that Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl) and Reese Witherspoon (Wild) had Julianne Moore dead to rights as far as a leading performance is concerned, but that should not hinder your appreciation of what she does here. And let's be honest - Moore is a veteran, no bullshit actress who consistently brings her abilities to the screen in everything she appears in - whether it be critically acclaimed character studies or hack popcorn action movies. So recognition is deserved in one way or another. Approach this film with respect and fair warning of its heavy subject matter.",

An interesting concept, and one that I think has been useful in opening the public's eyes as to the disease itself. It feels as though the presence of Alzheimer's disease has gradually been increasing in recent years, whilst never truly being considered a threatening illness, but rather just the case of memory loss. This is is simply not true, and it is important that it is viewed as a serious illness and efforts put into both assisting those with the disease, and most importantly working on remedies for the future.'Still Alice' does a great job of depicting Alice's struggles and how her life is quickly altered. Scenes are undoubtedly powerful and emotional, with Julianne Moore portraying the lead character quite brilliantly.

Still Alice does a wonderful job of not only empathizing with its entire cast, but embracing all of those emotions in order to help define what exactly being alive even means. I wish the rest of the cast as as good as Moore, then you could have had a really perfect movie. I commend Still Alice on not falling into manipulative and flat 'terminal illness movie' waters. I don't know that I'd recommend this movie to just anybody, but certainly a stand out from this year.",

The movie could have been 15-20 minutes longer, then it would have had the chance to explain some things that you might not understand if you see the movie without having read the book. Julianne Moore was absolutely remarkable in the very emotional scenes. But I just keep questioning the rest of the cast. Even though I already knew which actors were to play who when I read the book I still feel that Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart weren't quite right for this movie. Julianne Moore is the only one who really shined, the rest just somehow blended in. There were some scenes that were in the beginning of the movie but should have been in the end and there were some scenes that weren't even in the movie but needed to be there for you to fully comprehend it and for the movie to be even more emotional and gripping than it already was. Other than that it was a good drama about memory. This is a movie about a painful disease. It's about losing your memory and your ability to be yourself. It's also about your family and how it affects them to see someone they love turn into someone they can't recognise anymore. All in all this is a story about love and that love conquers all, that we should love each other in sickness and in health. To be there for each other when life is at its hardest, is what's most important.",

Moore and Alec Baldwin turn in solid performances, and the first third of the movie is replete with \"real\" -seeming experiences. But of course, as Moore begins to fall apart, the script enters \"movie of the week\" territory. There may not be much that you can do with a character that can no longer express herself. Kristen Stewart, the youngest adult child, tries hard to be authentic with her mom but it's tough. She's the only one keeping the movie alive by the end. Soon, the sad string music is everywhere and your heart can't help but be tugged. I have nothing left to say.",

    "review": "  A hard-to-chew medical drama, Still Alice is a demanding, but completely rewarding movie which terrifies with its slow, but irreversible depiction of a brilliant woman and falling into the void. Slow, quiet and painfully expressive, this drama is never to melodramatic or over-the-top. It is a realistic story that is capsulated within a family which has to observe how the woman they know is slowly consumed by a devastating decease. The inevitability of what is going to happen would make you feel unease throughout all the 109 minutes. You would be staring at Julianne Moore's character and you would quietly suffer with her. Speaking of Julianne Moore we should say that she is the main reason for Still Alice to be such an engrossing drama. Her Oscar-winning performance is a portrait of a woman who has to come to terms with her fate, but who also fights for every single moment of being herself. Filled with extremely powerful moments, Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland's movie has scene in which you would feel uneasy and unpleasant, simply because you would be discovering together with Alice the darkness awaiting her.Even though the story development is clich�d and predictable, this movie is a must see gem that would remain stuck in your mind long after the final credits due to its honesty and leading performance.",

In fact the whole movie is beautiful, moving and thought provoking without ever becoming sensationalist or maudlin. he subject matter, though at times difficult to watch, is handled with great care and sensitivity. The viewer is taken on a journey with Alice and her family as they recognise something isn't quite right, deal with the news of the diagnosis, cope and at times fail to cope with the progress of the disease. There is a real dignity to Alice and she is shown as both strong and determined but gradually, as the disease takes hold, she becomes more vulnerable and her family have to take on her day to day care. The beauty of this movie is that all along, we never lose sight of who Alice is or was. The film is factual, moving and sincere. The script and dialogue are completely believable and natural and every member of the cast, especially Julianne Moore and Alec Baldwin give there all to create a really memorable movie.",

    "review": "  Dr. Alice Howland (Julianne Moore) has it all. She's a highly respected linguistics professor, a loving wife and mother, and is at the point in her life where youthful vulnerability has vanished - she's worked hard, and now, at fifty, is able to live happily as success prospers with certitude. But everything she's come to understand about herself comes crashing down as her usual intellect begins to betray her. She gives a lecture and blanks out on a word that would normally come out of her mouth like a long-kept secret. She goes for a jog on campus and gets lost. She forgets how to make her familial favorite bread pudding recipe for Christmas dinner.  Immensely worried about her current mental state, she goes to a neurologist, her mounting forgetfulness too pressing too ignore - to her horror, she is diagnosed with Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease, genetically inherited and spreading fast. The premise of \"Still Alice\" is predictable, going through the usual \"disease film\" motions as its protagonist is diagnosed, tries to function with the disease impairing her every move, and, eventually, finally abandons dignity and succumbs to the effects of the illness. Not much is left for a plot twist, but a film like \"Still Alice\" doesn't have to be tricky to be effective - success has to do with the actors and filmmakers involved, and the people behind and in front of the camera do more than just make another \"disease of the week\" movie. They create a moving one, studying the ripples an earth-shattering disability can have on a person, their family, and their livelihood. To see Alice go from the smartest person in the room to the most handicapped is crushing, and the film doesn't attempt to romanticize the reality of the situation.  Glatzer and Westermoreland aren't necessarily trying to depress us, to give a voice to the many victims of Alzheimer's; their unfiltered goal is to piece together a convincing slice-of-life drama, a slice-of-life drama that just so happens to be relentlessly tragic. The brutal truths that emanate off of \"Still Alice\" are refreshing - in an era where most films of the same nature attempt to go the Oscar bait route instead of a different, poignantly inhibited one, it's inspiring for such a movie to turn no tricks, to unspool agonizingly without the usually expected emotional breakdowns that screech for award attention.  Perhaps \"Still Alice\" seems so effective because of Moore's performance: providing for a characterization that may as well be her all-time greatest, she is positively magnetic, breaking our hearts just as easily as she galvanizes a jaw drop. The unraveling of Alice burrows under our skin like a parasite, affecting us at times we least expect to be overwhelmed. Consider the scene where Alice and her husband (Alec Baldwin) prepare to go jogging and she quickly goes off to the bathroom before they embark. A task normally simple to the woman suddenly becomes an obstacle course as she can't remember where the bathroom is, soon forgetting where she is altogether. Beforehand, Alice's many plights made her seem like a functioning victim, her deterioration slow and only subtly crippling. But as it heads sharply downward and denial can hardly be an excuse, we are forced to confront our own feelings as Alice finds herself stunned at how much she's changed in the course of a few months. Moore is phenomenal, capturing her character's degradation with an instinctiveness frightening in its believability. The supporting performances are, of course, eclipsed, but Stewart (as the outsider daughter who confronts the situation with surprising emotional maturity) and Baldwin (as the husband who never abandons his once admirable wife as she becomes harder and harder to care for) are just as empathetic as Moore, perhaps even more so as they have more in common with the viewer, sitting back and helplessly watching in horror as the woman they adore evaporates before their very eyes. As a film, \"Still Alice\" is unremarkable only because it moves along with too much inevitability to really feel alive - but Moore and the players that surround her are excellent, and the writing and direction is stunningly honest. It's a sobering tale of illness hard to write off. It's too close to the heart.",

Watching a brilliant (and I mean textbook writing brilliant) woman by the name of Alice (Julianne Moore) slowly lose herself, her knowledge, memories, and even begin to lose the capability of socializing with her daughter was both incredibly difficult, as well as heartbreaking. Julianne Moore gives a top of the charts performance along with Kristen Stewart excelling also. The only problems I had with this film were some slight awkwardness in scene shifting along with being underwhelmed by the films ending. I'm sure if I delved into more, I would find additional meaning behind that final scene, however see the title and credits begin was the last thing I expected after that last moment. That isn't always a bad thing though. I might just have to see this one again but as for now, I did find some powerful message of awareness in here and this is a great dramatic, family, eye-opening movie.",

My own mother exhibits signs of the disease and her mother became afflicted in her final years. The acting was superb, and justified the Oscar for Julianne Moore for me. Kristen Stewart demonstrated once again what a fine young actress she is, in spite of her bad reputation because of the Twilight franchise. One scene that really brought home for me what beginning to lose one's memory must feel like. Alice is out for a run through the streets of New York, in the vicinity of Columbia, where she taught Linguistics for many years. She suddenly stops running and the camera pans around her, showing the confusion on her face while the background remains out of focus for what seems an eternity. The image finally resolves on the facade of the building in front of her and one realizes she is on the campus of Columbia. A powerful image that struck home with me. This one had me on the emotional edge for it's entirety. The only thing to keep it from perfection, for me, was Alec Baldwin's portrayal as Alice's husband. I would have liked to have seen a more sympathetic character (or maybe a more sympathetic actor) in the role. But otherwise a pitch perfect portrayal of a woman who winds up losing herself to this horrible disease.",

Every symptom, the deterioration of one's memories, all done to perfection. The film's depiction of the disease is incredibly realistic. Moore's performance never plays up the symptoms or takes them to the extreme.This is Moore's film, but she's not the only one who shines here. Alec Baldwin is very good as her husband. He gets a few tender and heartbreaking moments and plays them perfectly. The other big standout is... Kristen Stewart. Stewart plays one of Moore's daughters (Baldwin and Moore have three kids in this film) and honestly gets a very interesting role. Since Stewart's playing a struggling actress, it's interesting to see one person whose entire job is memorizing something interact with someone who is incapable of forming memories.Overall, this is a very solid drama. Moore deserves every accolade she got for this film, but Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart also deserve a little love for this. If you know anyone who's had Alzheimer's, this is a pretty good film to check out.",

    "review": "  While the tragedy of Alzheimer's is indisputable in all circumstances and at all ages, Still Alice is an intensely moving story about fifty-year old Columbia professor of cognitive psychology Alice Howland (Julianne Moore) whose fastidiously constructed communication driven life abruptly submerges into murky confusion. Accentuating the supreme loss of those with the crippling disease, Richard Glazter and Wash Westmoreland's adaptation of Lisa Genova's novel is a passion project that transfixes viewers with compassion and realism. As the woman who learns to master the art of losing - her memory and herself - Moore's performance is stunning. A contained Alec Baldwin portrays her devastated and ill-prepared husband, whilst Kristen Stewart is surprisingly good as the couple's youngest unwavering daughter. The Verdict: Thought provoking, resonant and poignant. Published : Canberra Weekly MagazineDate of Publication : 12/02/2015",

Unless you have a family member who is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, you know the disease intellectually, but not emotionally. This film explores the emotional in ways you probably never thought of. It separates what's important to your life from the trivial.

    "review": "  HeartbreakingStill Alice is an aching portrayal of how a lifetime disease completely destroys the life of a person and tests the people around. Alice (Julianne Moore) is highly successful linguistic professor who is intelligent and loving. She has recently turned 50 and is married to John (Alec Baldwin) and has three children. When Alice is diagnosed with early onset of Alzheimer's which is rare at her age, the family is left devastated. Moreover the form of the disease is rare and also genetically inheritable. Alzheimer's disease slowly degrades the functionalities of victim's brain, if you don't know. At start, Alice can't remember a difficult word during one of her linguistics lecture but towards the end she cant even remember who she is or her family. Still Alice captures this transformation subtly and its an emotional experience. Whatever happens Alice remains as strong as possible and faces the problems with support of her family. Definitely the biggest credit goes to Julianne Moore, whose performance was pivotal in connecting with Alice. She very well deserved her first Oscar. The scene where Alice gives a speech to other Alzheimer's patients was touching and motivating. Also Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart were notably good as ever supportive husband of Alice and her youngest child Lydia. Alice and Lydia have a kind of special bond and the film exploits it very nicely. The soundtrack was gentle and soulfully good plus the cinematography was beautiful. But I felt the story missed many opportunities to strike the chords harder and was predictable many times. Would have been better I feel if more screen time was provided to rest of the family (esp. the children). Anyways, Still Alice stays strongly focused on Alice and boosted by a memorable performance by Julianne Moore it becomes am immersing experience. Its sad, heartbreaking and human. If you don't have much idea about Alzheimer's disease I suggest you must not miss this one!RATING: [3.5/5]",

Col. in the Army Corps. I watched my mother watch her mother slowly decay. Julianne Moore is able to give a face and the raw emotions to sufferers of this horrible disease.

    "review": "  Still Alice is typical of most devastating illness dramas. Emotional scenes of human suffering and struggle and finally a form of acceptance as friends and family come to terms with their grief. Or guilt. Or pain. But in the hands of Julianne Moore - one of the most talented actresses working in film - Still Alice seems less predictable and dower. She finds the humanity in her character and takes us through the plot with minimal trauma to the audience. We feel her strength and determination throughout the film as we arrive at its inevitable conclusion. I'm not always a fan of adversity dramas especially when they involve human suffering to this degree. But Moore and her supporting cast including a capable Alex Baldwin and a surprising Kristen Stewart make this an exploration worthwhile. The real reason to go is to see Moore. On the cusp of winning her long overdue Oscar this Sunday, she has had one of the finest careers in the business. Starting out in thankless supporting roles in genre films like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Tales of the Darkside, and The Fugitive, she hit her stride with the Robert Altman's sprawling Short Cuts in which she has a lengthy monologue with Matthew Modine. She is naked from the waist down the entire time - a bold move that marked her as a fearless actress. She continued to work with directors of Altman's caliber garnering Oscar nods from Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights, Neil Jordan's The End of the Affair, and Stephen Daldry's The Hours. Her work with Todd Haynes includes the indie cult classic Safe and 2002's Far From Heaven - her fourth nomination. She also balanced her star image with Spielberg's The Lost World, the Hugh Grant comedy Nine Months and the Coen's The Big Lebowski. Her other significant work includes taking over the role of Clarice Starling in the sequel Hannibal, PTA's Magnolia, Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men, Lisa Cholodenko's Best Picture nominee The Kids Are All Right, and the HBO film Game Change in which she portrayed Sarah Palin. Few actresses possess such a resume, and Still Alice is a fine cherry on a very rich sundae.",

If her turns in \"Boogie Nights\", \"Short Cuts\", \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\", even 2013's remake of \"Carrie\" didn't prove to be for the win, \"Still Alice\" is every indication that she's long overdue for an Oscar. Not only does Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland's meditation on a woman's journey into Alzheimer's prove to be sweet, even humorous, but it's also devastatingly real. The cast helps tremendously in that category, particularly Alec Baldwin and a surprising Kristen Stewart. But the movie belongs to Moore through and through in a performance that simmers with subtlety and nuance. We care about Alice, and Moore was the perfect choice for the role.

    "review": "  Watching Julianne Moore as Alice Howland in Still Alice is akin to watching Michael Jordan lead his Bulls in the NBA finals. Her performance as a woman slowly losing all she holds dear to early-onset Alzheimer's is nothing short of virtuoso. If you have feelings, this film is sure to evoke them. Alec Baldwin as her equally driven husband and Kristen Stewart as her actress daughter can only watch helplessly, but supportively as Alice, the woman her husband calls the \"smartest person I've ever known\" increasingly struggles to function in a world that becomes more foreign to her as time passes. As I watched I was reminded of the 1993 film My Life with Michael Keaton and Nicole Kidman. While that was a fine film with excellent performances, what separates the two movies is Still Alice never goes for cheap emotion. It's stark. It's raw. Alice forgets words. She gets lost going a run she takes everyday, she can't find the bathroom in her own house. The reality of Alzheimer's is harrowing and if you've known someone with it, this film will ring true. Folks this is worth seeing for Moore alone, and if you have doubts about what living with the most dreaded disease of our lifetime is like, you won't after seeing Still Alice. Heartbreaking. Sincere, Eye-opening.",

    "review": "  Julianne Moore is pretty dang good as a fifty-year-old linguistics professor who learns that she has Early-Onset Alzheimer's. Moore's eyes are simultaneously blank and frightened, and her naturally strained smile really works for this tension-filled character. The narrative is rather choppy, but there are some truly great moments: the five-minute-long close-up of Alice ever-so-slightly struggling to complete the doctor's memory quiz, the scene of Alice panicking because she can't find the bathroom and ultimately wetting herself, the harrowing and suspenseful sequence of Alice trying to end her suffering by following the directions she recorded for herself when she was still lucid. All the supporting characters are somewhat superfluous, save for youngest daughter Lydia, played to varying degrees of competency by Kristen Stewart. Her rocker hair is a cool style choice, but KStew can't stop playing with it, and the beachy waves don't work at all for the Chekov play. She tsks before most of her lines, indicating a lack of breath support, which is even more noticeable when she's trying to deliver classical theatre monologues. She shrugs and shakes her head and shivers like a Chihuahua. She only transcends her crutches when she delivers Harper's monologue from \"Angels in America\" in the last scene, and even that's not a great barometer of her acting skill because while she's very good at playing Lydia's objective of connecting with her mother, I doubt that her unfaltering gaze and rapid pace would actually work for the role within the role.",

    "review": "  I have carried on a debate with people for some time about getting older, and whether in your old age you would rather lose your body or lose your mind? I have seen first-hand both sides. My Grammy, who lived into her late 90s, lost her body. Her eyesight failed with cataracts and she had poor results from surgery late in life. She had pain in her legs but refused pain killers because they made her \"fuzzy\". In the end she was in constant pain. My other Grandmother, kept her body for the most part, but suffered from dementia. In the end she did not know her family nor where she was. She remained independent until the last moment possible, but had assisted living when she wandered the streets aimlessly from her condo. The movie Still Alice explores the whole issue from the latter perspective, and does so very poignantly. In it, we have a Best Actress Oscar Winner Julianne Moore, with a good supporting cast of Alec Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, and the almost unrecognizable Kate Bosworth (so skinny!!). Moore plays a much awarded linguistics professor from Columbia University and just turned 50 yo! I note fifty with an exclamation mark since this is not that far away for yours truly! Anyway, she notices herself stumbling on words and forgetting the odd thing or appointment. She gets lost running one day on campus. She eventually sees her doctor, and a Neurologist who suspects early Alzheimer's disease. The diagnosis is confirmed with MRI evidence and noted as rare \"familial Alzheimer's\" which is genetic, and passed from one generation to the next. If you have the gene, then you are 100% to get the disease. We see this disease from early stages right along to its rapid progression as this woman struggles. There are many quality scenes here, but this hits home and is thought-provoking on a couple levels for me. First there is a personal level, where one wonders in middle age whether this would strike me down. Where in essence we are, and consist of, little more than our experiences and our memories. And what would we be if that was slowly and steadily taken away from us? But there is the parental aspect of this too, where you could have a sibling or a parent be diagnosed. The movie is very early Alzheimer's but it is more a elderly disease. But how cruel is it, to have your mind and memories taken from you?In the debate I have with myself, I would rather lose my body. I would like to keep my mind. My reasoning is that I remain sharp and I am still \"there\". I could suffer the pain of a crippled body on my own and deal with it. This is preferable in my mind than losing one's mind and memories. I think that those around you suffer more, as you are blissfully unaware and somewhere else. Like Ally in The Notebook and countless other examples, I don't want to put my loved ones through this. This movie explores painfully and sadly what can happen and what a devastating disease this can be. It is thought provoking, and it has stayed with me. I have to admit that I really am not much of a Julianne Moore fan, and I did see her outside the theatre at TIFF where this was playing (in fact I walked right by her going to see another nominated film Two Days One Night with Marion Cotillard). But this was a very good performance. If movies are about bringing forward issues and casting new light on them, then this issue helps in the fight against Alzheimer's. In the movie, Moore's character says that she would rather have gotten cancer. Incredibly but truthfully, the reasoning is because cancer sufferers are thought of as victims and there are rallys and runs and things that people do. For Alzheimer's people around you just look at you and wonder what's happened to you, and it's not as galvanizing a cause. Perhaps it should be.",

In real life Alzheimer's is at first about the experience of the person with the disorder. But Alzheimer's becomes about the rest of the family because we can't know how the person experiences their world. For example, I want to see the issue with finding the bathroom from her perspective but I also want to see it from the perspective of a family trying to decide what to do about bathroom issues. It's an incredibly hard transition for the spouse and kids as they incrementally take on responsibility for bathing/changing/feeding/watching a person. Yes, the movie is about Alice but it's also about who Alice becomes which is a person cared for by strangers. If you've been with Alzheimer's patients when they're hospitalized, you know the intense fear and disorientation when they constantly forget where they are, why they're there, why something hurts, and who are these people taking care of me. You also know that over time, as a caregiver, you become a different person as you collapse and stand, collapse and stand under the weight of this terrible plight. Having created characters with texture and depth, the film makers didn't let that play out to the extent that this would have been a brilliant movie. Final gripe, I can't watch Kristen Stewart twitch through another role replacing emotion with movement.",

If you know anyone with Alzheimer's this movie will be really hard for you to watch. Thinking back to vague memories of my grandfather not recognizing me, calling me other cousins, yelling and swearing in fits of confusion was triggered watching this and I broke down. Julianne Moore of course plays this role to perfection. I will say I expected the ending to go a different way (you will understand when you watch it) and i kind of wish it did only because I don't think anyone should have to live with this after they literally loose their memory completely. People can judge and say suicide is a coward's way out, well this isn't living, and you should be able to have the choice to die with dignity. It's not about how long you live, It's the quality of life you can have while on this planet. I don't think I could watch this movie again, it's too sad, but I do think everyone should watch it once to fully understand and see the devastating effects Alzheimer's has on everyone.",

It is all about the emotions of Alice and her family, it focuses on telling that we should how focus on how that person was and maintain those memories. All that a person leaves behind is memories of who he/she was.You sometimes feel like the movie was going a tad too fast, and it does but I guess it had to,to cover a long span of time.Julianne Moore really good,she makes you really feel her struggle which is heartbreaking. There are many scenes in the movie which make you really cry and choke on your own saliva.You feel sad for all the people with Alzheimers and their family.How a person starts forgetting people they have been close to all their life, forget their childrens name is scary.",

Julianne Moore at her best; one of the most honest performance that I've seen this year. And Kristen Stewart is on the right path, I'm glad that she is moving her career away from Hollywood blockbusters (at least for a while) and taking these kind of supporting roles with a lot of layers. \"Still Alice\" is one of those movies that go so deep into the audience that you will remain seated during all the end credits just listening to the music and digesting the movie.",

Moore's performance and the script's precision are frighteningly authentic in feel and, in many ways, the movie is scarier than most Horror films for its ability to really put into question the essence of man in the face of mental degradation. But it's also hopeful in the way the spirit remains and the love of others never leaves, even in life's most challenging circumstances. In that way, it's one of the most rewarding movies available to watch. On either side of the coin, it's a must-see and one of the finest films of 2014.",

    "review": "  Showcasing a heartbreaking brave performance by Julianne Moore, Still Alice presents a truthful and heartfelt account of harrowing disease. There have been decent dramas about Alzheimer's before, most notably The Notebook and Away from Her. What this latest such film offers, however, is a deeply personal trip down a disheartening rabbit hole that somehow never feels tragic. Still Alice feels so deeply personal because Julianne Moore imbues our heroine with such character that youre drawn into the drama from the outset. The audience becomes ridiculously sympathetic because they seemingly know Alice like an old friend, which is a credit to the actress for informing her life with such detail and verve. And then, filmgoers go on this perilous journey with her.In this PG-13-rated drama based on the novel by Lisa Genova, a linguistics professor (Moore) and her family (Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth) find their bonds tested when she gets diagnosed with Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. Screenwriters-directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland do an excellent and economical job at condensing a 350 page book without losing resonance or relegating supporting players to stock characters. Indeed, despite being a performance piece for Moore, Baldwin, Stewart, and Bosworth likewise shine as some not-always-likeable family members. Still, make no mistake about it, this is a certain actresss show. Its seems improbable that Moore never won an Oscar before this film. Despite a career bursting at the seams with memorable roles (The Big Lebowski, Magnolia, Hannibal, Children of Men, A Single Man, The Kids Are All Right) and past Oscar nominations (Boogie Nights, The End of the Affair, Far From Heaven, The Hours), she had never taken home this prizebefore Still Alice. Not only did she win Best Actress, but she totally deserves it for this vital inspirational role. Bottom line: Courageous Beauty",

    "review": "  There are so many illnesses and diseases that exist in the world today that just don?t have a cure, no matter how many fundraisers we donate to or telethons we listen to, there never seems to be any change in the world or in the diseases and illnesses that they are working towards find a cure for. For me I've only ever known one person who had Alzheimer's they were very late in their age and always said they had had a good life. When she passed though everyone?s response was ?she?s better off? personally I always had a problem with that sentiment. It?s not like Hallmark make cards saying such things, so why would people believe that ?they?re better off? can be consoling in any possible way. I guess we as individuals deal with such things in our own unique way and this film will definitely have you thinking about yourself and your own little quirks and what ifs by the time credits run.Alice is sitting at a table celebrating her 50th birthday with her three children and husband, Alice is a linguistics lecturer at the local university, she keeps not only her mind fit by solving problems and playing word games but also her body by jogging about the campus on a regular basis. One day during a presentation Alice forgets a word, she thinks nothing of it until later when she is out jogging and gets lost about the campus unable to find her way back home. Alice goes to see her GP who refers her to a neurologist where she is told she has Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease. Alice of course can?t believe the news but goes about telling her husband and children of her illness, she must also tell her family that the disease is actually hereditary and passed down through the mother so the kids must be checked as well. Two of the children take the test the third child refuses. As the film progresses the harshness and reality of what a day to day struggle living with the disease becomes very heartbreaking. Alice sets up some questions on her phone whilst still able to comprehend her surroundings; she makes a video directing her to take some drastic action when the day comes that she can no longer answer any of the questions?The one thing that really works for this film is its simplicity in the way the story of Alice is told, everyone involved has done a wonderful job bringing the hardships and heartache that Alzheimer?s brings forth. Julianne Moore (Seventh Son, Children of Men) is amazing as Alice Howland, I don?t think anyone out there could have done any better, and finally the lady got the award she should have been awarded a very long time ago delivered to her due to the outstanding character she created and her amazing skills as a talented actor. Starring alongside her is Alec Baldwin (30 Rock, Rock of Ages) as her husband John Howland, Kate Bosworth (Superman Returns, Before I Wake) as Alice?s eldest daughter Anna Howland-Jones, Hunter Parrish (Weeds, 17 Again) as Alice?s middle child Tom Howland, and most surprising in her role Kristen Stewart (Twilight Saga, Jumper) as the black sheep of the family Lydia Howland, she did shock me a little especially as she has never been a personal favourite of mine, she stepped up to the mark quite well in her role. Directed by both Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland (The Fluffer, The Last of Robin Hood) both guys working together have made something that could have been extremely difficult to pull off yet they have made it seem much easier in their final delivery.I did find it very slow in places which in turn made the film feel quite long but worse than that it took away a lot of the emotion I was supposed to be feeling as well. Don?t misunderstand me here; the film is a tear jerker especially for those of us that replace the actors with ourselves and our own life situations. The first time I watched this film there was one scene early on that had me blubbering like a baby, just at the helplessness poor Alice was going through, I inturn put myself in her place which made it far worse.Still Alice is a film that deserves more recognition than it has received so far, it is a film that will tear down your walls and make you fear not only your own life but that of all your nearest and dearest as well. Not a family friendly film as the young ones will get very easily bored I feel and tear your attention away",

    "review": "  'Still Alice' bravely battles Alzheimer'sThis film's heartfelt and frightening look at the early onset of Alzheimer's leaves viewers to ponder and question their own mortality. It offers the unpleasant and unfair ending to a brilliant life, the result of a ruthless disease that attacks, degrades and then destroys one's mind over time. The movie feels like a punch to the stomach for audiences, as it calculates the disease's heaviest toll; the loss of one's ability to reflect back on their most precious moments accumulated over a lifetime. It focuses on one family's response to Alzheimer's, underscoring the need for acceptance and understanding of this terrible life sentence. The movie saddens and shocks in a world where one's Bucket List of all the must-do sights, sounds and tastes to remember before death, are replaced by the disoriented, forgotten and mistaken lists of an Alzheimer's sufferer. Academy Award winner Julianne Moore is phenomenal as Dr. Alice Howland, a married mother of three, who is diagnosed at the age of 50 with Alzheimer's. Ironically, Howland is a renowned linguistics professor at Columbia University and understands, better than most, the difficult and unpleasant journey ahead for her and the Howland family. Moore's chilling transformation in physical demeanor and mental acuity, as her condition worsens, leaves the audience in the uncomfortable position of bystander--wanting to help, but unable to do so. Whether it's answering the simple questions Howland has placed in her phone or seeing a family member go unrecognized, viewers can't help but feel unnerved and disheartened seeing Moore's sad story unfold before their eyes. Based upon first-time author Dr. Lisa Genova's 2007 best-selling novel by the same name, \"Still Alice\" superbly illustrates the struggles and coping mechanisms used by Moore as she attempts to slow down the disease. The film, though, doesn't go nearly far enough in describing the vastly different relationships Howland develops with her children. As a result, the supporting cast equates to average overall, leaving the Oscar-winning Moore to cope and carry the film herself, alone-just as Alice must do.This story is Moore's to live and tell, in the moment. Her courageous fight reminds us to cherish our memories and live today. We are a society of etched memories stored on Go-Pro videos and selfie-sticks for reflection later. But what if there were no later, only a now? It's that question which \"Still Alice\" answers unabashedly, triumphantly raising awareness to Alzheimer's and its frightening aftermath following diagnosis.Grade: B",

    "review": "  Alice (Julianne Moore) is a 50-year-old linguistics professor at Columbia University. She's happily married to a medical researcher (Alec Baldwin) and has three grown kids. When she starts forgetting words and gets lost during a jog, she's afraid she has a brain tumor so makes an appointment to see a neurologist. Turns out she actually has early-onset Alzheimer's.Anyone familiar with Alzheimer's disease knows where this movie is headed. The only surprise is the speed at which the disease progresses. While Alice struggles with losing her memory, her family also tries to cope. Her initially-supportive husband throws himself into his work. The two older children (one played by a very prissy-looking Kate Bosworth) are basically throw-away roles with little substance. The younger daughter, a struggling LA actress (Kristen Stewart), is the only one with much of a part.Perhaps you'll think I'm a terrible person for admitting this, but I didn't find Alice to be a very sympathetic character. I didn't exactly dislike her, but she has a whiny, privileged, Pinkberry-with-blueberries-and-coconut way about her that I didn't find particularly relatable. In fact, the only one I liked in the whole movie was the neurologist.I think the fact that pre-Alzheimer's Alice was supposedly brilliant is meant to make what happens to her all the more horrifying, but if the writers had bothered to develop her character enough for the audience to be able empathize with her, it would have been far more effective than the forced irony of creating a linguistics professor who loses the ability to communicate.  Even so, this movie could have been much better. The attempts to clue the audience in to the fact that Alice is suffering a bout of confusion through special \"dementia music\" and visual effects are annoying and unnecessary. When Alice gets lost jogging, the camera switches to her perspective - blurred images of people and buildings - which I assumed meant she was having vision issues - a stroke perhaps. Apparently, the director didn't have enough faith in Moore's acting or the audience's intelligence to think we could understand the scene without a metaphorical visual cue. One of the movie's key sequences seems unrealistic. Despite having almost no short-term-memory, Alice is able to focus intently on the same task for an extended period of time, unable to remember the details needed in order to complete it, but somehow still focused enough to repeatedly try to overcome her inability to remember. I know it's just a movie, but this makes no sense. Though Moore gives a fine Oscar-winning performance, \"Still Alice\" is not very good overall. It's the sort of movie that leaves you with plenty of time to think about your own stuff because what's happening on the screen doesn't require all that much concentration to watch. So while Alice is busy looking for her missing cell phone, I'm remembering how just that morning I forgot to pour the water from the coffee pot into the coffee maker and that maybe this is how it all begins.Because the real hook to a movie about early-onset Alzheimer's is the terrifying idea that any of us can get it - people as young as thirty have been diagnosed - and there is no cure. That fact alone is enough to give people pause; watching Alice's descent from brilliant to babbling doesn't really add that much. A friend who saw this movie before I did advised that I skip it but couldn't articulate why for fear of giving something away. I'll give it a shot: it contains a single good performance trapped in a mediocre movie. Unless you're a big Julianne Moore fan you should probably take a pass.",

Nevertheless, it hides no pain about dealing with Alzheimer's disease, one of the most devastating and tragic diseases known to man. What makes it a must-see tho is Julianne Moore's heart-wrenching performance - probably the best in her career. Her performance has as twice as much impact as any performance I have seen in a long time. We instantly care for her, feel with her, go through hell with her - we're with her, every step of the way. And what an emotional journey this is. Julianne Moore gives this movie an extra layer of gravity, depth and emotion, something I always value in movies. Her Oscar is so well deserved...honestly. Next to Julianne Moore, Still Alice has another little surprise... Kirsten Stewart's gentle performance as Alice's daughter who - in the end - understands her mother the most.As the movie progressed it became more and more engrossing even if it didn't reach its full potential on a hard to talk about topic. Still Alice is undoubtedly a tough movie and I suggest you prepare yourself mentally. It contains life-affirming moments but its perspective is what makes it unique. And that ending... it broke me, in a way.",

One scene sticks out in my mind: this woman did it all, 3 children, a top academic in her field and she was scrubbing a pot with no gloves on, somehow this annoyed me and seemed unbelievable. Why do women have to do everything?I found the editing to be a bit too jumpy and some of the relationships and interactions seemed too cliche. I found it hard to believe someone would choose to go ahead and have children knowing they would eventually die from early alzheimers, maybe I missed the timing on this: JA eldest daughter who became pregnant with twins. I was disappointed that her family was so detached and her hubby abandoned her in the end. The scene where he discusses moving to Minneapolis is very sad- she basically tells him he doesn't want to watch what is happening to her and spend time with her, she had asked him to do this before she starts to lose more of her brain function and he always uses work as an excuse. Not long after that we see that she has deteriorated further and we wonder if his cruelty to her and his inability to fully be there for her hastened the decline. In the end when the final stages of the disease are only beginning, we see that her youngest daughter(KS), who has been less successful and who is an actress, not an academic, compulsively worried about intelligence and success, is the one who has the strength to be there for her mother and to help her through this. I think it's wonderful someone wrote about this and made a film about it. I can't imagine how horrible this is for everyone involved. I also found it very interesting in the diagnosis phase. I had been asked similar questions by a neurologist recently who I saw for vertigo. I couldn't remember the things she wanted me to remember and I couldn't do anything backwards, lol. I'm sure I don't have early alzheimer's thank god. I do wonder if I should do a petscan though since my mri was normal too. I wanted to know more about Alice, who she was before this disease hit her. I wanted to know more about the diagnosis. I felt like it was all crammed into too short a space. She and her family put so much importance on intelligence and articulation and then her hubby abandoned her, very sad. This is a depressing film to say the least.",

After watching a thoroughly engrossing portrayal of a women with an above average IQ descending into the abyss of Alzheimer's, I was disappointed, but not surprised, that it didn't really show the End Phase of the condition. There were times that Julianne Moore seemed to be channeling her role in Game Change where she portrayed Sarah Palin during the 2008 Presidential Campaign. I just hope I have someone like the character's daughter, the one she thought was making bad life choices, step up to the plate if need be. I would recommend at least renting it.",

    "review": "  What must it be like to realize that you no longer connect to the world around you; that one's footing is untethered? That everything is unknowable, but yet has a tinge of familiarity. The present is a labyrinth of disassociation; we are floating in an ether where we futilely shadow box to gain mastery of the seemingly simple task of being oneself. STILL ALICE attempts very straightforwardly to depict the mesmerizingly desolate story of Dr. Alice Howland - a renowned Professor of Linguistics at Columbia University - whose field of study deals with words and communication - and the ironic turn her life takes, as she realizes that she is slowly losing the ability to access the power of language and memory - the underpinnings of books, years of study and exploration are now desperately failing her. Alice at the age of 50 has been diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer's disease. A beautiful performance by Julianne Moore as Alice - a woman, heroic in her efforts to create strategies to navigate the abyss. Alice is a warrior in a fight she knows is un-winnable; filaments of who she was, and who she is slowly becoming to her family and professional colleagues, exist at the core of this daunting drama. What makes this film so personally harrowing is the fact that we all can empathize with the possibility of being in a similar situation sometime in the future and even in the present. Those moments when a name slips away from our tongue and gets knotted up in our brain refusing to reveal itself; when we blindly stare at the computer and wonder what is this blank slate we are so intently gazing at; or finding oneself in the middle of a street momentarily wondering how we got there and in which direction should we transverse.Alice never becomes an \"empty vessel.\" There are remnants of what is \"still Alice.\" Expressions of a parent's love, compassion, as well as past familial conflicts are never entirely erased; glimpses of the poetry of longing and physical touch come to light to surprise those who thought Alice had all but disappeared into the void. A searing honesty that refuses to cover up the truth of her situation prevents this movie from being insipidly maudlin, and reinforces the admiration we feel for this courageous woman who is valiantly fighting to preserve her mind from oblivion.",

Nothing is really wrong here, it's just everything it didn't do great was just ok. Now, the main reason you watch this movie is for Julianne Moore. She is what the movie worth watching in the first place. Without her, the film would probably be maybe a 5 or 6/10. She became the character. I didn't see Julianne Moore. I saw a poor, tortured woman suffering from Alzheimer's. She definitely deserved her Oscar for Actress in a Leading Role. The one other thing I liked was her husband. He wasn't an asshole. Normally you would expect a significant other to bail on the main character once they find out they're dying or sick, which is unrealistic and a stupid way to cause drama. Here he stays, which is really nice. It made me truly believe he cared about this woman no matter what. That about does it for things that were worth mentioning. Everything thing else is rather unexceptional. Kristen Stewart wasn't bad, but she certainly wasn't good either. That phrase is probably the best way to describe the rest of the things in the film. Wasn't bad, but perhaps not good. Anyway, I still like the film and would recommend it, mainly for Julianne Moore.",

Initallyone can deal with it but in short the realities of this unrelenting situation becomesoverwhelming and devastating. Simply, there is no where to hide. Same with Alzheimers.This film was marvelously edited into a tight 100 minute movie. The story line unfoldedearly in this film and the progression of the disease and its impact moved along fast. Asa result, the viewer felt a lot of tension in the scenes where Moore \"Dr. Alice Howland\" isby herself, and one only expects the worst. A variety of variables prevented \"really badthings\" from happening but you sensed it was just a matter of time. No doubt, this filmends before her mind/memory is completely gone, but you could sense the future.This was not a comfortable movie to watch but it is important to watch. I'm sure the boxoffice dollars were unremarkable. I credit the movie editor/director for keeping the storyfocused on the decline without deflecting to many side stories. Personally, I don't believeI have been exposed to this dreaded illness (friends/family) but I bet it is closer than Iknow.I can fully understand why Moore won the Oscar for Best actress, it was quite a remarkablerole.Lastly, and going back to the beginning, I suspect most folks going to the movie knewwhat it was going to be about. I went on a yucky, cold winters day and yes would havepreferred a warm or fun movie. Sort of reminded me of going to a viewing/funeral. Notsomething you get excited to do, but you know it is important to do. When you leave, youfeel and know you did the right thing.Again, I don't have 1st hand experience with this dreaded disease. However, I feel betterand have my eyes open because no doubt it will come into my life in some form. I amvery happy \"Still Alice\" was made and that I saw it.",

So often, we get caught up in materialism and striving. We forget that life is short and the wake we leave behind and around us grows secondary to identity and achievement. I found myself absorbed in to Alice's shrinking world and grew fond of her youngest daughter, the bravest of her 3 children. Also appreciate that the family struggles with her illness did not take center stage. It allows the viewer to fall more in to Alice's experience rather than family drama unfolding around her. Highly recommend this film if for Moore's bravo Best Actress performance!",

It's a perfectly crafted film, and brings an awareness to this awful disease that needed to be there. With cinematography by Denis Lenoir, there are scenes that make you feel as though you're struggling with her--the blurring, foggy mind, the frustrations of forgetting.

Alec Baldwin is her husband, who is confounded by the disease and deals with it by working more. Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth, and Hunter Parrish are her children, who have their own varied responses. Written and directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, it plays like a better-acted version of a disease-of-the-week Lifetime movie. Moore's mental descent is glumly predictable. The final sequence where Stewart recites to Moore a passage from the play \"Angels in America\" and interprets it's meaning, suggesting that love conquers illness, is shamefully patronizing.

    "review": "  A hard-hitting and underplayed portrait of what Alzheimer's can do to the best of us, Still Alice depressed the hell out of me and that's okay. What makes this even more tragic is the fact that our protagonist (Julianne Moore) is exceedingly brilliant and watching her slow drift into cognitive oblivion despite her best efforts and clever mental tricks was a bit hard to take. Moore commits to the point it puts Eddie Redmayne to shame and it's quite fascinating how in each scene (and I mean EVERY scene) we see some new hint of mental decline and the person who we are familiar with begins to fade. The film itself is tastefully shot and the soundtrack will often give clues as to the state of her mind, especially when she is about to suffer an attack. The supporting performances are beyond excellent with Alec Baldwin as the silently suffering husband and Kristen Stewart (yes, HER) as the closest of the children to the mother and understanding her feelings. I'm still going to go on record and say that Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl) and Reese Witherspoon (Wild) had Julianne Moore dead to rights as far as a leading performance is concerned, but that should not hinder your appreciation of what she does here. And let's be honest - Moore is a veteran, no bullshit actress who consistently brings her abilities to the screen in everything she appears in - whether it be critically acclaimed character studies or hack popcorn action movies. So recognition is deserved in one way or another. Approach this film with respect and fair warning of its heavy subject matter.",

The power of the story lies in the very rare occurrence of early onset Alzheimers disease. The dramatic impact is contained principally in 2 or 3 intense scenes. The audience is left to extrapolate the disease to the more typical, later in life, onset of the disease. The progression of the disease is depicted well.The rest of the cast does not have much to do. They are all competent and believable.It was an interesting trip to the flics.",

Moore has played 2014's Best Actress and she definitely deserved that Oscar. One cast member that was really looked over was Alec Baldwin. I thought that he was great in the film and not many people are giving him his credits due. Still, the picture focused on Moore, and she ran away with the focus of attention. Kristen Stewart, who many people including me hate for Twilight, was surprisingly okay in this, as people may have thought that she would ruin it. Overall: Still Alice may not be an Oscar nominated picture, but it is certainly enjoyable thanks to the amazing performance by Julianne Moore. Perfect Time Killer if you are in need for one.Rating: 87% and A-",

    "review": "  The deterioration of both our memory and our entire entity are subjects that fascinates me.From the moment we are born, we begin to form connections and construct our personality; at a very minimal level, of course, but this portion of our life is utterly vital to our eventual being. As we grow older, we begin to learn to talk, walk and do other common practices that we take for granted as we age. As is made note of by the protagonist within Still Alice, from our earliest days, we are processing information at an exponential rate, absorbing the visual and verbal contexts and features of our environments to improve our knowledge of the world. It's incredible that children can form such a strong personality at so young an age; even if they have barely been alive a year, but they can still (physically) enunciate their emotions and thoughts. Perhaps they can get up on their own two feet and walk across a room. It's amazing.I watch the members of my family and examine their behavior. My sister is 9 years of age, an amateur gymnast, quite possibly an intelligent individual, full of life and vitality and absolutely in love with One Direction and Taylor Swift. Her personality is still being crafted day by day, and she is yet to find her special something; the thing that a kid or a teenager finds that becomes their unique attribute. Mine is a love of film and scoring. All the same, she is young and with the world ahead of her, much like my brother and I. I am the eldest; the one who dares to go out into the world first. To make the intrepid charge into adulthood before either of my siblings. It scares me as I don't have another family member of comparable age who has already ventured out into the dark and mysterious world. I'll be the first of my parent's offspring. That makes me nervous.My siblings and I are all building our memories, and have just initiated the construction of our individual spirit. I build memories every day; whether it be the first kiss I experienced (an absolutely disgusting display of inadequacy in the area), the first film I remember seeing at the theatre, the first time I had a sibling born and was no longer the only child, or the first time I endured death within my immediate family. I remember the day my grandfather passed away vividly. It was a school day, and I'd had a poor time. I had felt alone even though my friends were around me. I was struggling in maths, as I always did. I wasn't able to concentrate. I hated myself, and I hated everyone around me; I despise days where I can't hold my attention. I was frustrated with the world. But then I came home, and my father informed me that my grandfather had died, and it put into perspective how naive and slight my problems were. That whilst I was complaining about not being able to figure out an algebra technique, one of the people instrumental in shaping me into the person I am today slipped from this planet of ours. All these memories form me into the human being that types here today, and they form the initial establishment for my thoughts on the world around me.Much as Boyhood reflected on the wonder of discovery and building memories, Still Alice provides an analysis, albeit less refined, on the condition of demise. Our protagonist, the titular Alice, is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease at the age of fifty. She is a respected linguistics lecturer at Columbia University, and possesses a healthy marriage and three children who have turned out rather favorably. As we meet this woman, she is a beaming example of intelligence and energy. She possesses a smile that lights up a room once she steps in it. But she forgets a word or two here and there, and begins to lose her way whilst she goes on runs. The initial displays of deterioration are obvious and slightly forced, but they lead way to moments of emotional resonance. Alice's plight is one that we understand, and her denial, guilt and frightened states ground her in a reality that is as tragic as it is painful to watch.There are moments of dramatic tension which are unnecessary and lead credence to the idea of \"Hollywood-ising\" something. A potential suicide thread is completely without substance and eventually results in a rare moment of comedic relief for the audience, the direction of the culmination of this concept proving ill-handled. That said, there are moments where Still Alice shines. But more importantly, it absolutely rivets. I was not only astonished by the acting prowess on offer, but also scared by the intensity and verisimilitude of the performances. Lead actress Julianne Moore won the award of Best Actress at the Academy Awards recently, and whilst she should not have bested Rosamund Pike in the category (Gone Girl deserved at least one award!), she most certainly deserves the commendation she has received. Her restrained authenticity and range maintains an audience's attention, even in the most baffling, boorish or excessive of moments. It is her who grounds the film and allows it to mesmerize.The movement from a jubilant woman to a human of disabled status proves highly effective in provoking the kind of emotions the film targets. It may shove its manipulative hands down your throat, but that's not to discount the impact of those same prodding hands. It's heartbreaking to witness the decline of such an intellectually advanced woman; it's harrowing to know that even the brightest and most intelligible of our society can be brought to their knees by the very object of their competence and dexterity. The mind is home to our most astounding thoughts and concepts, but it, like all other features of the body, is a muscle that is capable of corruption. The disease that Alice is diagnosed with reminds us of the frailty of mankind, and it made me scared for my future. To lose what makes me me? To forget the names of my hypothetical children or my hypothetical wife? To lose the ability to verbally communicate my thoughts and opinions on various subjects? What can be more frightening than slipping into an abyss which contains only you; where you can not be the person you once were? How can anyone live this way?Still Alice doesn't necessarily answer that question. Its ending hints towards the eventual resolution that Alice would face if the film were to continue on past its ending point, but it never shows it. This is the most alarming of all questions asked throughout; where would she end up in the end of it all? Still Alice makes it clear that there is only ever one outcome in relation to her disease, and that is death. The worst thing is that it's more than just a shot to the heart, a knife across the throat or a sudden heart attack. It's prolonged and slow. Every child's worst nightmare is that of dying in a painful way. We're all frightened by the idea that we could be tortured to death, or shot in the head. That we could be hit by a car. That the plane we're travelling in could fall out of the sky. But none of those seem even marginally comparable to the physiological suffering caused by slowly being internalized. Still Alice tackles this melancholic topic with a heavy heart and affects one for doing so.I could discuss at length the value of the cinematography in such a pivotal context, but all I'll say is that it is astounding. I'd like to end this review by stating that I don't know when I'm to die. I don't when I'm to take my final breath. My future belongs in the hands of the universe, and whether I shall die with a family surrounding me or in a lonesome street all alone, I shan't know until it is all imminent. And when the time comes, I'll want but one thing; the ability to be able to look back and appreciate. To embrace my failures and my successes throughout my brief stint on this planet. To acknowledge all those who have paved my way. I'll think about my parents; my brother and sister; my first girlfriend and all those subsequent; my pets; my Year 9 religion teacher who taught me to be myself; my friends; my family. I'll want to remember the first time I watched How To Train Your Dragon and cried at its beauty. I'll want to remember the first time I witnessed Jack grow up in The Tree of Life. I'll want to remember the first wails of agony and aggression within James Horner's score to Avatar. I'll want to remember the first banal screams of life that my theoretical son or daughter delivers. I'll want to remember all the small things that made life worth living; the rain pelting my roof whilst I type at my computer, intent on writing the greatest review of my life; playing in my sandpit as a child; imagining building rockets, creatures and cities as I explore my backyard; running around with my dog Stella (yes, she was named after Interstellar); hugging my mother and father after a long day of school; savoring the sweet taste of banana cake whilst watching a television show. But most of all, I want to remember my grandfather. I want to remember his joyful face. I want to remember his ironic nature. His bawdy jokes. I want to remember the smile that covered his face whenever my family would come and visit him and my grandmother. I want to remember. Still Alice reminded me of the importance of memories. Even in its most frustrating moments, this is beautiful film.",

If your idea of entertainment is watching a brilliant, vibrant Professor of Linguistics deteriorate into someone who can hardly formulate a one-word sentence, then by all means go see it. ****SPOILER ALERT****And of course she has the rare Familial version of Alzheimer's Disease, so she's passed the gene on to one of her daughters (which means her daughter is 100% going to contract the disease).

Boy was I happy that I did, I saw probably one of the strongest performances by a woman in film. There were times during the movie where I felt sympathy for the character because by her portrayal of the character I could tell Alice was just not herself. There were times the film might have been a little slow for me, but that was expected, so it did not take me out of the movie. It was a tale of a woman who was changing by a terrible disease that does affect many today. It was sad, emotional, and quite inspiring. The run time of the movie could have been longer, but it did not affect my overall thought of the film itself. I would recommend this film in general, but you can choose to watch it on the big screen or not. It is not the greatest movie theater experience one could have, unless you do like the theater for whatever reason.4.4 / 5 Stars",

    "review": "  Not a bad movie, but it left little impression on me. The strongest part of this movie is its acting - Julianne Moore indeed gives a touching, sincere and powerfully emotional performance as the ailing linguistics professor, Alice.To be honest I found the film rather too predictable to be genuinely enjoyable. While I appreciated learning about Alzheimer's and felt it was a good depiction of a woman's slow descent into sickness, I didn't feel enough of a dramatic pull in the storytelling to keep me fully interested and engaged. I saw almost everything coming miles before it happened. And not only that, but there aren't that many interesting things happening in the movie in the first place. Alice loses her position at the university. Alice gives a talk at an Alzheimer's foundation. Alice tries to commit suicide but is predictably stopped by her daughter coming home.I don't know. Maybe I've just seen way too many movies for my own good, but I found Still Alice a tad on the boring side. Don't get me wrong - it's a touching and poignant movie about a very important disease that more people should be aware of, and it is not without its own form of subtlety and sophistication, but I didn't find it as engaging and provocative as I had hoped it would be.Still, not at all a bad movie, one that comes with my recommendation. I think Alzheimer's should receive far more attention, so kudos to the filmmakers for addressing this unpopular disease.",

    "review": "  \"Still Alice\" is the sort of film one feels almost obliged to like. It features an acting Tour De Force by it's star Julianne Moore, it deals with the tragic effects of Alzheimer's Disease on the individual and their family, and it is based on a best selling book. The screenplay is solid and the supporting actors are all faultless. So why did I find it so very unremarkable and so predictable and why did I leave the cinema so unmoved? Much has to do with the subject itself; so much has been written and spoken about this awful disease that one hopes that a movie like this will provide a fresh insight into its ravages but it basically tells you everything you already know. Plus so many movies nowadays are aimed squarely at the heartstrings that the audience sometimes becomes 'all cried out' from seeing so much abject misery and tragedy on the screen. If only someone, somewhere would write a genuinely good comedy but, alas, it seems that is a lost art!",

It's due to the amazing performance of Julianne Moore that elevates the overall film's quality. Julianne Moore proves here that she's one of the best actresses of her generation. However, I have my objections on Kristen Stewart's acting which I find totally mediocre, I suspect it's a matter of big studio decisions and management.",

    "review": "  Okay, let me just say, Julianne Moore's performance is brilliant in the film; she captures the fear, sadness, helplessness and perseverance of an Alzheimer's patient with tact. Other than Moore's acting, 'Still Alice' felt quite bland and underwhelming to me. It failed to give us more insight into the lead protagonist, and gave us almost no insight into the lives and minds of her loved ones. When someone is afflicted by Alzheimer's, it's his/her loved ones who suffer more. I mean, the person exists, but all the memories connecting him/her to others ultimately vanishes, and that is torturous to the people around. The film is too linear and paper-thin; the theme had so much potential, but it's completely squandered. All of the characters just merely exist that you almost feel nothing for any of the characters. Other than Alice's speech in the second half ,there wasn't a single moment or aspect which made me connect to the characters.With much more needed depth, the movie could have been as terrifying as the disease itself, and may have given us some idea as to how people cope with it. Now, it's just one of those disease-movies which will be easily forgotten (except of course, for the fact that Moore finally won her Oscar for this).",

    "review": "  I imagine it must be very hard to make a movie about Alzheimer's. It seems to always have such a straightforward trajectory, with small memory slips, then a doctor's appointment/diagnosis, then a gradual declining until the person basically doesn't know who their loved ones are anymore. There's only so many places you can go with a movie about someone with Alzheimer's. In addition, it's hard to prevent a movie like that from becoming overwhelmingly depressing. It's just such an inherently sad thing to happen to someone.Still Alice does get a little sentimental in parts. I wasn't super fond of the first act or so of the movie, just because it went exactly like I thought it would, and all those early signs of Alzheimer's seemed a little overwrought and obvious, although, again, that's something that comes with the territory, not necessarily a mistake the filmmakers made. But everything proceeded in a standard direction. Also, there's a scene where Alice gives a speech, to lots of applause from people. I complained a lot about this when it came to The Theory of Everything, but I eventually realized why it was so much more effective (I teared up) in this movie. First of all, it didn't come at the end as a dumb way of showing the audience how brave and wonderful she is, or something (like Stephen Hawking). And second, it was acknowledged that ultimately, it was one of the few happy moments in a long road ahead, that Alice wouldn't even remember the speech after some time. The speech wasn't reductive. It was a genuine triumph for the character, especially with her neurologist there (a character I, strangely, really liked).The film overcomes most of the sentimentality thanks to the supporting cast and a general light touch in some scenes. There's some humor that goes a long way to preventing the mood from turning oppressive, although I would've liked even a little more humor, without seeming too artificial.The parts I really enjoyed of Still Alice, though, were the things that set it apart from other standard Alzheimer's narratives. I found it extremely interesting that Alice would use her linguistics skills to devise ingenious ways to remember things, and that's what made it all the more heartbreaking when she failed. Another dimension I really liked was the revelation that Alice passed the disease on to her kids (at least Anna). I would've actually liked if the movie did more to delve into Alice's guilt about that, because that was an interesting facet I haven't seen in movies like this before.Maybe one of the best parts of the movie was the character of Lydia, who was played surprisingly excellently by Kristen Stewart. The thing I liked about Lydia was that she was super unsentimental, still getting angry at her mom for being condescending about her dreams and reading her private diary, but also had a ton of love for her mom, and a lot of hidden heartbreak. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Lydia apologizes to her mom for getting angry earlier and asks her what it's like, having Alzheimer's. It's refreshing to hear Lydia genuinely curious and not annoying or sad about it - she never breaks down and cries or anything throughout the movie. But that scene does a great job of exemplifying the duality I mentioned; though she doesn't get melodramatic about it, you can see her struggle not to freak out as Alice explains her memory loss in-depth.Then there's the ending. I wasn't expecting that to be the last scene at all, so when it flashed to the title card afterwards, it seemed abrupt to me. But I do kind of like that it ended there. I like that it didn't end with Alice dying (whether from the disease or from suicide), or with her finally forgetting who Lydia was, or something. I like that the movie gave us a large, comprehensive snapshot of Alice's struggles with Alzheimer's, but I'm also glad it didn't try to cover so much ground that it took us to the end of her journey. If Julianne Moore wins the Oscar tomorrow, I'll be pleased.",

    "review": "  On a trip to California to see her actress daughter Lydia(Kristen Strewart) and to speak at a conference, Alice Howland(Julianne Moore), a university professor in linguistics, trips over a line or two in her speech. Concerned that this could be a symptom of something more serious, she sees a medical doctor who after running a wide variety of tests, diagnoses her with early onset Alzheimer's disease. To make matters worse, the disease is genetic, putting her three children at risk of developing it.While \"Still Alice\" may not exactly excel in showing Alice's deterioration from her point of view, that's really not the point of this otherwise fine movie. What the movie is much more interested in a keenly perceptive way is the dynamics of the Howland family that is so overachieving that one of the daughters cannot just give birth, she has to have twins. Okay, okay, I know it does not work that way but it could look like that to an outside observer but not to Lydia who is comfortable with opting out of the race. However, for her mother, who remarks at one point that she would have preferred cancer, that is not an option, having overcome so much already in her life. Frightened by what she witnesses at a nursing home, not the state of the patients but the lack of visitors, she Rube Goldbergs her own euthanasia. In the meantime, Alice takes the opportunity to reconnect with Lydia who she had otherwise been at odds with before it is too late.",

    "review": "  Still Alice is a story of a linguistics professor named Alice, played by Julianne Moore, who finds out she has a form of Alzheimer's disease. The movie shows how it takes a toll on her and her family. It is heartbreaking to see how it affects Alice because she values her intellect. Her family must find ways to connect and help her. Julianne Moore does a fantastic job showing how the disease impacts someone over time. Kristen Stewart plays one of her daughter's and the movie does a good job showing their relationship. I thought the ending finished abruptly and the look of the movie was just okay. But that could be because of the source material. I give it a 4/5.",

    "review": "  I give the *Moores performance* 4.5-5 stars. The movie barely a around 3. Good 'enough' but THE movie is *Moore! lol. Without it, its kinda barely good enough to be on cable (but it's def. not bad...just okay). 'Clearly' the directors knew what they were doing (putting ALL the emphasis on Moore to make sure she slam dunked her way w/ the Oscar and most likely Bafta)! Thank god almost every scene has Moore in it who is riveting and 100% believable. Because of her talent the movie flew by and filled in whatever textbook, made for TV movie blanks we wouldve had otherwise. For me, the worst performance (almost cringe worthy) was Baldwin (wooden, monotone, disconnected and irritating). Just a 1/2 as*ed acting job like he didn't wanna be there :#. As most have been saying its all about Moore and Stewart (who is more than fine). Not great but good enough and 100x better than Baldwin lol. Again, def. recommend 100% only for the (finally!!) first time Oscar winner Moore!",

    "review": "  Get ready for a gut punch. This is about a highly intelligent linguistics professor (Julianne Moore), who notices that she cannot grasp the perfect word during a couple of conversations/presentations. She goes in for a diagnosis, only to be given the tragic news: it's early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Talk about putting your problems in perspective. This is a movie where you slowly watch an incredibly clever woman's brain slowly deteriorate, and it is heavy and affecting. Personally, this had an additional layer in that I know that there is a history of this disease in my family, and boy, did it hit home for me. This movie is anchored by a positively brilliant performance from Julianne Moore. She has always been a great actress, usually appearing in supporting character roles, but here, she is given a wide range of emotions to hit, as she makes her way from high functioning to barely the same person. She is front and center gives a raw performance, and I don't think there is a surer lock at this year's Oscars, she is going to win. Speaking as someone who has memory problems, this is scary, and you are constantly worried for the next time she is going to have a \"moment\". You cringe for this woman, and it is heartbreaking at practically every turn. At its core, this is ultimately a disease movie, which is to be expected if you read the plot summary. I uttered \"UGH\" at least a dozen times, as there are many instances where there is a lapse of her fragile brain breaking. But like most disease movies, I have no inherent desire to ever rewatch this again, as it is not a good time, much like that cancer movie that gets released every two years. It's hard to watch a movie that's setting you up to feel so depressed, and while it is all very well done, you kind of know what you're getting yourself in for, and in many different ways, I view this as this year's Rabbit Hole. This is all about a woman trying to keep it together while ultimately resigning over to becoming an empty vessel, and if you can handle that, by all means, give this a watch for a tear-jerking performance by Moore",

Now, Kristen Stewart finally won me over for the first time as an actress. 100% turnaround from her Twilight days.

    "review": "  Every once in awhile I find myself watching a movie and thinking \"I knew it wasn't going to be an easy one to watch, but what am I? Masochistic?\" Such was the case with this well made and effective drama. It's not actually as much of a downer as one might expect, as the characters, including Alice, punch back at the hopeless diagnosis with a combination of life review, reflections imbued with gratification for a good life well lived, and spiritual/poetic inspiration. Julianne Moore's performance is flawless, even if I doubt most people would react to such a diagnosis with such a pragmatic nor in such a non- hysterical manner. However, the character she plays, a brilliant linguistics expert with a Ph D would seem more likely to take just such an approach. I might add that Alec Baldwin, who plays her husband, delivered an understated performance and was quite good as was Kristen Stewart, who set aside her usual tics and vaguely pissed off acting indulgences to play a convincing daughter at odds with her mother's expectations of pursuing a \"normal\" and responsible career. This is the best I've ever seen her in any movie in fact. Alice and her family are clearly at least upper middle class, which does not make the movie any less effective. However, the kind of material and familial support depicted is of course not always the case, in which such a shocking and grave diagnosis must be even harder to cope with. See this movie; it will win a deserved Oscar for Julianne Moore, but be prepared for a dark drama if you do so.",

There is a very impressive script written here, aside from a few questionable moments, but the plain camerawork and \"television\" feel the film has throughout, makes it a weird viewing experience to those were hoping for this story to be told in a \"Hollywood\" way. Does that hurt the film's story? No, but may make your mind meander throughout it's 102-minute running time. It's themes really does make you feel for these characters' emotions, and you will probably have a few tears trickling down your face, but what bothered me were the off-putting technical aspects. Overall, it is a very powerful and moving character study that is extremely well-acted and well-written. Those are two of the necessities in a great film, so I will give it a lot of credit for that, but there are a few undeniable set-backs, including an extremely abrupt ending. In the end, not having read the novel that this film is based upon, \"Still Alice\" is a moving picture that I highly recommend.",

Probably most effective is Moore's ability to portray Alice's slow but inevitable regression of verbal language (more noteworthy given that Alice is a linguistics professor), as well as Alice's increased utilization of technology in an attempt hang on to what she's bound to lose . The supporting cast unsurprisingly take a huge back seat to let Moore shine, and the gentle approach in the direction throughout avoids any trappings of excessive melodrama (into which such a film could have easily fallen)",

The director uses editing and the camera to perfectly pace the film with occasional prolonged fuzziness to tie the viewer's observation of what is happening to Alice in tandem with the progression of the disease. It doesn't fall into a couple of very easily possible Hollywood traps during the film and, thus, stands out. It ends perfectly and respectful of the movie's theme. Why overrated films like \"American Sniper\" and \"The Imitation Game\" are nominated for Best Picture and \"Still Alice\" is not, in spite of the 10-film limit not being reached, is beyond me.

She learns from her neurologist that the condition is hereditary and explains the uncommon occurrence of it for someone in her 50's. Alice even learns that she may have passed the gene on to her children unknowingly. The film deals with Alice's physical and mental breakdown from a distinguished linguistics professor at Columbia University to a shadow of her former self. Obviously, her condition deteriorates throughout the movie and affects everyone around her, including her husband (Alec Baldwin) and her kids. She starts forgetting simple things and arrives at a point where she can't even coherently speak. It is a very tragic film and not for the faint of heart. I felt that Moore did a remarkable job in the role and captures all of the aspects of Alice's personality amazingly. I believe her time has come, and if my sources are correct (which I have no reason to think they aren't), she will take home the Best Actress Oscar next Sunday. Kristen Stewart (Twilight) even does serviceable acting in the role of her daughter, however, Moore steals the show. Moore has waited a long time to be recognized to this extent by the Academy, but I feel this is her year and I see no reason to think she can possibly lose this race. Her role as Alice may well be remembered as the finest role she has ever played. This movie is excellent, and Moore steals the show ----------------------------------------------------------- B+",

This film also show the progression of familiar Alzheimers which progresses faster due to inherited genes. This is a must see film.",

There was no need to overact in this movie to grab your heart. The reality of the facts and debilitating stages of this disease on Alice and her family are frightening and sometimes hard to watch played out in this film. Well deserved Oscar nomination for Moore. For those who have been personally touched by this disease in some way may find it difficult to watch as I did at times but I highly recommend seeing it.",

    "review": "  Still Julianne: The Great Actress Gives What May Be Her Best Performance YetYoung Critic1/29/2015Julianne Moore is one of the greatest at her craft. Her memorable performances in The Hours, Boogie Nights, and The Kids Are Alright, have found her a spot among the greats. Despite that, she's been denied an Academy Award. But with her latest turn in Still Alice it must be undeniable now: she's reached legend status. Still Alice is the harrowing story of a 50-year-old woman who is diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimer's: Alice Howland (Julianne Moore). Alice teaches linguistics at Columbia University, she is happily married with fellow medical teacher John Howland (Alec Baldwin) and has two daughters and one son. The oldest of her daughters, Anna (Kate Bosworth) is also married and is planning to have a child, Alice's son Tom (Hunter Parrish) is trying to settle down with a girl, and Alice's youngest, Lydia (Kristen Stewart), is looking to be an actress in Los Angeles. The film perfectly transitions the lovable Alice into her absent state. The experience is tough for the audience, and thus gives us the smallest of tastes into the tough lives that Alzheimer's victims and their families suffer. While all the praise has been going to Moore, both Baldwin and Stewart cope well with their roles. The reason that they may have been overshadowed is that the film is primarily focused on Alice alone, so the roles of John and Lydia are diminished. Nevertheless I was glad that Baldwin finally stepped out of his Woody Allen comfort zone, and Kristen Stewart left her Twilight days behind, which was the big surprise of the film. Previously it seemed as if she was an incapable actress with what we saw in Twilight, but in Still Alice she's given us all hope that she could make it as a serious actress. But of course we must talk about Moore. What I noticed was most admirable, was that most of her scenes were all one shot. I was especially marked with the scene in which she first goes to see her neurologist. The whole scene is a close-up on Moore and her mastery of her character was clearly defined there and then. Her simple stares and innocent repetition of sentences are heart breaking. However, the film doesn't want you to specifically feel pity for Alice, it wants you to experience her dismay in a realistic and objective emotional way. Driven by Moore's warm performance, the film is an example of how no matter how perfect and safe we may be in this world, we must cherish every moment as if it were our last. A-",

    "review": "  + \"Still Alice\" is a very difficult film to watch not because of the subject matter but because Julianne Moore inhabits the persona of Alice so you feel, and see, everything that is happening, and what will happen, to this woman.Alice Howland is a very successful linguistic professor at Columbia University in New York who has written books on language and traveled the world teaching it. She and her equally successful husband, John (Alec Baldwin) live in a brownstone in which they have raised their three children, now on their own paths, and have a summer home on the shore. In everyway she is successful as a professional, a mother and a wife.Very early in the film Alice, at the age of fifty, is diagnosed with early on set Alzheimer's which it turns out is genetic and there is a 50 percent chance of their children contacting it and, after testing, one of the children tests positive. The screenwriters/directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland dismiss this angle in the movie instead concentrating on Alice and Moore comes through with a devastating performance. By the end of the film you will know what it means to have Alzheimer's, what and how it takes everything from you. Wordlessly, with a look, the changes in her face, the awareness of what she will lose before she loses it, is upsetting because we know what she had and she no longer does.The film rightfully concentrates on Moore but the screenwriters don't help her in not filling out the roles of her husband and children. We know her husband loves her because he tells her but Baldwin is a good enough actor to show us with little touches here and there. Her children, played by Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth and Hunter Parrish, are normal, well adjusted children which at times can drive a parent crazy and there is one scene where Moore uses that old line, \"....I can because I am your mother,\" that has the audience laughing. The conflict between a mother and daughter is briefly touched on just as the sibling rivalry between sisters is but neither are fleshed out.The film is not all sadness and tears, with little bits of humor here and there, but we share the few triumphs Alice has along the way just as in two scenes we are afraid to breathe.For those who haven't dealt with Alzheimer's in their family this is a learning experience of what has happened with 45 million people in the world going through this debilitating disease and what their loved ones have to deal with.Julianne Moore has deservedly earned 4 Oscar nominations along the way and with her 5th in \"Still Alice\" she is deserving of getting that statue that has eluded her.",

    "review": "  Qu� define a una persona? Si olvidamos lo que hemos hecho, lo que hemos aprendido, si ya no podemos reconocer a nuestros amigos y familiares? Acaso podremos seguir siendo la misma persona? Son las preguntas que plantea este drama donde Julianne Moore, ya ganadora de un Globo de Oro (al momento de hacer este review) por su personaje en esta cinta donde luego de ser una exitosa y respetada doctora en ling��stica y adem�s profesora universitaria que tambi�n da conferencias alrededor del mundo enfrenta la tr�gica realidad de ser prescrita con una rara forma de Alzheimer que se desarrolla a una edad m�s temprana de lo usual y adem�s con altas posibilidades de heredarlo a sus hijos y ellos a su vez a cualquier hijo que pretendan tener. Un filme basado en la exitosa novela del mismo t�tulo, en donde Lisa Genova, la autora, particip� del guion para el filme. Julianne Moore presenta a esta mujer emprendedora, ambiciosa, independiente y que justo cuando ya pr�cticamente sus hijos ya son adultos, dos ya con carreras terminadas, y donde su futuro no podr�a verse m�s prometedor, es cuando empieza a notar peque�os detalles aqu� y all�, donde el temor de aceptar la realidad, se transmuta en genuino p�nico de comentarlo con su esposo e hijos y lo que implicar� en el futuro. Una historia donde sin temor muestra todos los �ngulos de la dram�tica situaci�n que est� pasando esta familia y donde el cuidar del personaje de Julianne Moore se vuelve cada vez m�s dif�cil. Una enfermedad que pone a prueba todo el amor, sacrificio, paciencia y respeto que se tienen entre s�. Sin demandarse mucho de s� mismo, Alec Baldwin cumple aceptablemente bien su personaje, y ciertamente los productores y/o el director fueron temerarios al castear juntas a las actrices, Kristen Stewart (Twilight film series) y Kate Bosworth (Superman Returns) donde ambas dejaron muchas dudas de su capacidad histri�nica pero debo admitir que en este filme, ambas cumplen con efectividad sus personajes sin ninguna queja de mi parte.",

The finely judged script is lean enough so that scenes are never dragged out and the audience does not feel manipulated. Instead, it feels genuine and the emotions are well earned. And then there is Julianne Moore, who is effortlessly sublime and her performance is so well observed that her transformation as her character's early on-set Alzheimer's disease took over her mind will make you weep and your heart melts. She leads an exceptional cast who acts their collective socks off in nuanced and subtle manners, in particular Kristen Stewart who, in my opinion, was robbed of a nomination in the supporting actress category in the upcoming Oscars.",

Alec Baldwin is always great and this is no exception (Fun Fact: If and when Moore wins Best Actress at the Oscars, this will be the 2nd year in a row that the winner played the wife of Alec Baldwin with Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine last year). Speaking of Oscars, I support her wins this award season since a lot of the underdog performances I loved got no love this year so out of the nominees, Moore deserves this. I hate Kristen Stewart with a dying passion but she was tolerable in this. Though some of her acting choices were reminiscent to some of her other crappy performances, others were actually nice mostly with Moore. Kate Bosworth and Hunter Parish were also good as Moore's kids. The screenplay is great and the score is nice. Many have talked about how this movie really feels like a Lifetime TV movie which I can see where they are coming from but Moore's performance makes this worth seeing in the theaters.

    "review": "  Alzheimer's is a terrible illness that affects millions of people. There is no treatment that can ease the pain and suffering from Alzheimer's from dementia, disorientation and language problems. Several movies have touch this subject, from On Golden Pond, The Notebook, Iris, Rise the Planet of The Apes.In the film Still Alice directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland tales the story of Alice Howland (Julianne Moore) a successful Columbia University linguistic professor diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. She have a very supported family, from her husband John Howland (Alec Baldwin) and their daughters Lydia (Kristen Stewart) and Anna (Kate Bosworth). Is important to mention that her family have typical conflicts like any other family from Anna trying to conceive a baby to Lydia pursuing her career in acting in California. Alice keeps the early diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease secret from her family thinking that she can handle the situation. Until John and her decide on a family reunion to break the silence. Anna couldn't handle the news, but Lydia does, because her free spirit nature. For Alice Alzheimer's disease is coming to fast to ruin her success and also her normal and happy life. Her life deteriorate day by day, from loosing the ability to figure out locations, remember events and appointments to finally inability to teach in college.

There Alice reinforce relationships with John, but sometimes John is to busy to be with Alice. On the other hand Lydia develop new kind of ties with her mother because the book Angels in America. One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the use of the butterfly as a element of rebirth and also how Angels in America play another significant role in the story. How the celestial concepts and renaissance connects with Alice character and her unfortunate situation and how she it what it is no mater how lost she is because of the Alzheimer's disease.Julianne Moore perform a Oscar worthy role, perhaps one of her best.",

    "review": "  Featuring a leading performance from Julianne Moore said to be her all time best, Still Alice sounded like the film that would finally net her an overdue Academy Award.Still Alice is a thoroughly simple film. It doesn't have much narrative or too many characters and it moves at a slow pace which may irritate some viewers, but it is the greatest depiction of Alzherimer's disease I have seen in any film. This is because the story rests solely on two narrative elements: the concept of Alzheimer's disease and what it is to experience it. It doesn't progress in terms of story development all that much, but the way that it slowly intensifies more and more in its focus on the subject matter is very effective.Still Alice is essentially all about a woman named Alice with Alzheimer's disease and little more, for better and for worse. For most of the film, it is for the better because the simplicity in the film is one of its most beautiful elements. Focusing solely on its subject matter and main character while implementing in other characters as light subplots, Still Alice establishes their relationships with the main character as a way of establishing the damaging effect that it has with the other people in her life, such as her husband and her daughters. It touches upon the universe beyond Alice Howland, but the focus remains on her and takes a clever look into the way that she changes over the course of her mentality being damaged by it all. The emotional strength of the film is great because of the subtextual family elements as well as the elements regarding Alzheimer's disease which means that it goes beyond just the nature of its surface value subject matter. The script in Still Alice does a good job delving into the complicated themes of its subject matter and explaining its concepts to viewers in language which understands the complex nature of mental health but remains simple enough so that viewers are able to understand it. In keeping up with the complicated nature of Alzheimer's disease, the style of Still Alice moves along at a gentle pace but consistently cuts from one point in the titular character's life to the next though different points in time. The fragmented narrative gives viewers a sense of insight into what it is to experience Alzheimer's disease and it is consistent in doing so. Instead of coming of as choppy, the gentle directorial work of Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland manages to ensure that the script is given the treatment that it deserves while the genuine feel of the film is appropriately atmopsheric, as well as being filmed nicely in a way which captures the claustrophobic mood of the main character.But there is nothing more key to the success of Still Alice than the leading performance from Julianne Moore.Julianne Moore is the entire reason that Still Alice is tied together as everything in the film rests squarely on her shoulders. With a career of four Academy Award nominations under her belt, she goes for a fifth in Still Alice which should hopefully be the one she wins for. While Julianne Moore is known for many complex characters she has played in a series of films, Still Alice is a simple film which requires her to play simply an everywoman. She plays Alice Howland as a strong and confident woman who really has her life shattered by the presence of Alzheimer's disease as she slowly attempts to deal with it in more hardcore situations. While Julianne Moore never lets go of her spirit and her likability, she gradually loses touch with her grip on memory more and more in a brilliantly realistic portrayal of the deterioration that is a painful reality that comes with Alzheimer's disease. Julianne Moore captures the suffering of the character Alice Howland flawlessy and develops incredibly well over the course of the story, and it is one of her finest performances ever simply because she strips away eerything that would make Alice Howland a character and emphasizes the saddening nature of her damaged humanity more than anything else. Julianne Moore has many scenes in the film where the camera focuses solely on her for an extensive amount of time without editing which shows her delivering many lines like monologues without her ever having a problem getting the character dead on in terms of physical instability and emotional trauma. She is surely the frontrunner for the Academy Award for Best Actress which is really long overdue as it is recognition she has deserved for a long time.Kristen Stewart also delivers a memorable effort. In one of her greatest post-Twilight performances, Kristen Stewart tackles the role of Lydia Howland really well. Going up against Julianne Moore, Kristen Stewart shares a powerful chemistry with Julianne Moore which brings a stronger sense of sympathy to the film as it touches upon the concept of a mother-daughter relationship in times of tragedy. For the Golden Raspberry Award winning actress from Twilight to face the challenge of standing up to five-time Academy Award nominee Julianne Moore only to succeed so incredibly is beautiful, and so Kristen Stewart's performance in Still Alice gives her more credibility than ever before.Alec Baldwin also makes a nice supporting effort, bringing a genuine sense of support to the suffering of Alice Howland which makes the film seem nicer by putting him in a restrained role where he faces the responsibility of caring for Julianna Moore's character. He shares a gentle chemistry with her. Alec Baldwin approaches the material in Still Alice in a very simple mannerSo while it remains a very simple film, Still Alice puts all the weights of its success on the shoulders of Julianne Moore who carries the film all the way with a beautiful and heartbreaking performance.",

    "review": "  If you want to see a truly poignant and cinematically innovative film about a woman succumbing to early-onset Alzheimer's Disease, allow me to suggest the marvelous 2006 debut feature by Canadian actress-turned director Sarah Polley (only 27 when the film was released!), \"Away from Her.\" Shot and acted with poise and restraint, starring the great Julie Christie (\"Darling\") and equally fine - but largely unknown outside of his native Canada - Gordon Pinsent (\"The Shipping News\"), that movie touchingly evoked the joy and pain of life and death. Based on a novella by Alice Munro, it was a perfectly crafted work of art.\"Still Alice\" also has a literary source - the novel by Lisa Genova - and shares its main subject with that earlier film. It tells a similarly moving story. Unfortunately, its directors lack much of the grace and subtlety of Polley, and though Julianne Moore (\"The Kids Are All Right\") tries her (mostly) best in the lead role of Alice, she cannot make up for the rather ordinary and plodding way the script takes us through her journey. I usually admire Moore - she's one of the best actresses of her generation - but here she is unable to transcend the pedestrian soap-opera structure. So far, she seems to be favored in predictions for this year's Best Actress Oscar, but for me it is not a performance on the same level as that of the other nominees. She's good, but not that good.Moore plays a noted Columbia professor of linguistics who turns 50 as the film begins, then soon discovers that her recent wave of disorienting experiences is due to an inherited genetic defect that will quickly lead her inexorably into dementia. Before long, the sharp-as-a-tack woman we meet at the start has turned into someone who cannot find the bathroom in her own house. It's a tragic situation, made all the more so by the loss her family feels. Her husband, played by a distracted Alec Baldwin (\"30 Rock\"), is supportive but distant, unable to process the premature loss of his best friend; her youngest daughter, played by the ever-talentless Kristen Stewart (\"Twilight\"), struggles with the many unresolved issues we all have with our parents. There are other children, but they are not developed enough in the screenplay to have much effect on the story.It's sad. A lot of people cry. Alice speaks less and less. The camera isolates her with shallower and shallower depth of field. Surely we can do better than this shallow movie about such a devastating condition. And indeed we can: watch \"Away from Her.\"",

    "review": "  Alzheimer's...not exactly Saturday night movie fare but I went...somewhat begrudgingly..to see this film. You see, I, like many people, have seen Alzheimer's first hand. It's not pretty. It can be funny at times, but not pretty. But this story approaches this a little differently. The info: \"Alice Howland, happily married with three grown children, is a renowned linguistics professor who starts to forget words. When she receives a diagnosis of Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease, Alice and her family find their bonds thoroughly tested. Her struggle to stay connected to who she once was is frightening, heartbreaking, and inspiring.\"And really this struggle to remain who she is/was, was interesting. It was heartfelt and definitely frightening, but I think it's worth a watch...especially to see Julianne Moore's best performance, maybe ever. She deserved an Oscar nomination for her portrayal. I'd say wait for this to come to streaming but definitely put it on your list to watch.",

    "review": "  Still Alice has nothing to offer, though strives for passion and emotion, but only offers a scratch on the surface helping to shed no tears, but what lifts this film to attention is the nothing less than fascinating performance of Moore, who comes out triumphant in a portrayal that has me speechless and at a loss of words.Only this film comes with the sweet surprise of Kristen Stewart, who baffled with an excellent performance to match the presence of Moore, but also her portrayal of Lydia was the only aspect of the story to trigger my curiosity.Summing up: Amazing performances, less than mediocre storytelling.",

    "review": "  It's long been said that Julianne Moore is long overdue for an Oscar. She's been previously nominated for Boogie Nights, The End of The Affair, Far From Heaven and The Hours, but she should have been nominated for Safe, Short Cuts, Magnolia, Children of Men, Savage Grace, A Single Man and The Kids Are All Right. Moore is an actress of uncanny talent and grace.That doesn't mean her performance in Still Alice is just overdue half-baked goods. As a Columbia linguistics professor exhibiting signs of early-onset Alzheimer's, Moore delivers a performance rich in detail, acting at its finest, alert to every nuance and feeling and ringing with truth.Moore's Alice Howland is an expert in her chosen field. She lives the life of a wife to John (Alec Baldwin), a biologist and mother to their three children, played by Kate Bosworth, Hunter Parrish and a wonderfully touching and vibrant Kristen Stewart. The family reacts in various ways to Alice's worsening condition, with the rebellious daughter---an aspiring actress who disdains her family, becoming her only willing caretaker. Even when Still Alice sometimes delves into cheap sentiment, Moore and Stewart are funny and superb.The film, like the book from neuroscientist Lisa Genova that inspired it, isn't exactly about the other people. It's all Alice. Through her mind and heart we see the world. The effect is earth-shattering, but not hopeless. Moore reveals a woman who doesn't yet know what will come with the dying of the life in her eyes. She can intuit from her children's reactions that they might inherit the illness, from her husband's decision to take up another job in another state and from her own decision to record a message to her deteriorating self in order to trick her later self into suicide.The film wisely refuses to hold Alice up as a specimen. We feel right along with Alice, something that must also be credited to the two men behind the camera. That would be directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland (Quinceanera), who both wrote and directed Still Alice as Glatzer coped with the debilitating effects of ALS, a disease that ravages the body as mercilessly as Alzheimer's ravages the mind. Glatzer and Westmoreland, who married in 2013, make Still Alice deeply felt and personal. We feel the stakes they have in this story. Still Alice, bolstered by the brilliant artistry of Moore's performance, is an emotionally charged powerhouse of a film. It will take a piece of you.",

    "review": "  \"Movies are mechanisms of empathy,\" Roger Ebert didn't quite say.But this reviewer prefers the misquoted diction (provided by Anderson Cowan of The Film Vault.)When one asks, \"Why watch Still Alice when it's only going to depress me?\"There's only one legitimate response.\"It's a mechanism of empathy, dawg.\"Channeling an experiential river flow, the narrative spins the neurological waterwheel.Did I want to watch Still Al? No.Am I a smarter/better person following the experience? Absolutely.The purely objective form of personal growth? The viewer's exponentially more fluent in the Alzheimer's realm of modern medicine.The subjective forms? For one: The priceless merit of seeing a well-crafted, timely motion picture.Two: If your torso's peppered with shurikens, I'd hope it wouldn't come as a complete surprise.Likewise, if my demise arrives on a tidal wave of death stars, what's to stop me from running around in a circle and screaming obscenities until the official end?Maximizing (rather than minimizing) the agony of my unexpected affliction.Catch my drift, proverbial reader?Still Alice is profoundly sad, but not 'depressing.''Depressing' connotes a residual effect; a lasting (potentially irrevocable) alteration of your emotional state.I discourage this aversion toward cinematic tragedy. My top three films of all time (Platoon, Raging Bull and Schindler's List) belong in the downer category.Tragedy often spotlights hidden profundities.Still Alice is a heartwarming narrative obscured by the haze of Early Onset Alzheimer's, a rare form of the disease. Symptoms typically begin showing in the early fifties.At that precise moment, the viewer meets Alice and her family.It's tough, folks.No sugarcoating it.Expect to weep. More than once.On a high note, it's well shot, directed and edited. The writing's crisp; the drama's chilly and real.Lead by an outstanding performance from one of the best actresses ever, Julianne Moore, the entire cast is fantastic.Alec Baldwin's excellence in a major supporting role comes as no surprise.What (perhaps) defies expectation is an equally terrific piece of acting from Kristen Stewart.This reviewer hopped aboard Kristen's locomotive after Snow White and The Huntsman. That gal's gotten a bum rap, despite some serious acting chops.Anyhow. For an educational and moving experience, check out Still Alice.It's a top quality flick, featuring adept performances from a tight (but stellar) cast.Should one find oneself sobbing mid-theater, cursing a favorite film reviewer's name, try to remind oneself:\"It's a mechanism of empathy, dawg.\"Feel that cognitive waterwheel aturnin'.",

Julianne Moore is excellent as Alice as she slowly succumbs to the steady progress of her condition which wipes out her personality. Alec Baldwin is understated as her husband and, surprisingly, Kristen Stewart (Twilight) is excellent as Alice's daughter who connects with her mother more than anyone else in the family. This is the first movie (according to the director) which looks at Alzheimer's through the eyes of the person experiencing it. It's a must see that is confronting in its understated handling of a very difficult subject.",

Because and despite the fact that I hadn't seen 'Still Alice' yet, I thought this was a little presumptuous. But now that I have...inevitability or not, all I can say is she better win.

    "review": "  This is seemingly the story of a woman diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease, but around the midway-point of the film, this all becomes a lachrymose mess and it becomes increasingly clear that the real narrative of \"Still Alice\" is that of an actress who keeps a movie afloat for an hour and forty-five minutes. Julianne Moore is that actress, and she joins a class of performers (Jeff Bridges in \"Crazy Heart,\" Meryl Streep in \"Julie and Julia,\" etc.) who have turned borderline-bad-movies into something actually fairly watchable. That, I'm afraid, is the best that can be said of the film, which is numbing in its sentimentality and only really watchable for the acting; there are also good supporting turns from Alec Baldwin and, yes, even Kristen Stewart, who has some surprisingly nice moments. But the movie belongs to Moore, who is endlessly-engaging in her portrayal of a happy, brilliant woman who begins to lose that which is most precious to her. Her earnestness and fearfulness are enough to keep one engaged and, on several occasions, even tear up. There are moments of real elevation in \"Still Alice,\" but they all belong to her.",

    "review": "  Still Alice is a drama film based on the novel of the same name by neuroscientist Lisa Genova. The film stars Julianne Moore as Dr. Alice Howland, who learns that she has Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50. Alice struggles to manage the time she has with her memory intact before she forgets everyone she cares about. Still Alice also stars Alec Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth, and Hunter Parish.This is another movie that didn't catch my eye until recently, getting word about Moore's performance in the film shortly before she was nominated for an Academy Award. Being one of the two movies with the Best Lead Actress nomination I haven't seen (the other one being Two Days, One Night with Marion Cotillard), I decided to see the movie to figure out if Moore's performance was truly as praiseworthy as most people say it is. As I expected, Julianne Moore was nothing short of amazing.There's no denying that the best thing about the movie by far is Julianne Moore's performance. Given how character driven the story is, the entire movie is dependent on Julianne's performance-and she is phenomenal. Her character's mental degeneration as she forgets more and more is virtually seamless. Before I saw this film, the best female performance of this 2014 in my opinion was Rosamund Pike in Gone Girl; I now say that Moore will most likely win the Oscar instead. My judgment with this boils down to two reasons, one being the fact that Moore had a much bigger role in terms of plot, and the other reason being that I find portrayals of people with any sort of disability to be exceptionally impressive when done well (like Eddie Redmayne's performance in The Theory of Everything). I wasn't sure whether to put this as a positive or a negative, due to circumstances, but the supporting characters failed to catch up to Moore's performance, making the film feel lop-sided in that aspect. This is in no way a criticism of any of the supporting actors, but the movie is Alice's show, and it is very clear that any distracting performances wouldn't be of best interest. There is even an otherwise regular scene of dialogue, which is entirely a close up of Alice with the other character off-screen, and it doesn't seem weird due to her prominent presence. This situation reminded me of Ben Affleck's performance in Gone Girl. Affleck's performance may have not been as big of a presence (figuratively speaking) as Pike's performance, but I believe this worked to the movie's favor.Interesting enough, this is the first movie featuring Kristen Stewart, who plays Alice's daughter who is a stage actor, I've seen in years. Because of this, I wasn't really exposed to movies like Twilight or Snow White and the Huntsman, in which many have criticized her acting ability. I wouldn't consider her performance terrible (except her in-movie theater performance), but I wish her performance were a little better. Again, this might just be the fact that most of her scenes are one-on-one conversations with the best performer in the movie. Other than that, I liked being able to stare at Stewart for a lot of the movie. Another thing I had trouble with was the ending. I feel like they either should have ended the movie before they did or added 10-15 more minutes.After seeing this movie, I'm confident that Moore is the frontrunner for Best Lead Actress. I also realized how some of my comments about the movie could also be applied to Gone Girl, although I personally enjoyed the latter more overall. If for nothing else, check this movie out for Moore's Oscar-worthy performance.7.5/10",

This film is just above average, since everything were just half-done - half-done drama, half-done feel-good story, half-done character development, half-done style, half-done message, etc. The acting, except for Julianne Moore and Alec Baldwin, was terrible - Kate Bosworth looked annoying while Kristen \"Stoneface\" Steward still exhibited her infamous stone-face throughout the film. As a character-driven film, this is also another half-done aspect, since Baldwin did excel in his role as a matter-of-fact husband who loves his wife just barely more than his career as scientist, and Julianne Moore, well, she was just as excellent (yes, excellent!) in this film as in other films. The problem with Julianne Moore is that the ... half-done script really did not help her, some parts she appeared to be a woman of strong will, in other parts her behaviour resembled the behaviour of a loving wife and caring mother, yet those parts were not connected smoothly enough to bring out a complete picture of a woman falling into the abyss of forgetfulness. Julianne Moore has proven time and time again that she is an excellent actress of utmost mental sensitivity and emotional vulnerability. These strengths are both showed in this film, but to see Moore at her best of emotional vulnerability - \"Magnolia\" is a much better choice, whereas \"Boogie Nights\" is the best example of her mental sensitivity. That said, she may still get an Oscar for this role, but that would be an undeserved Oscar for a well-deserved career.",

    "review": "  A raw portrait of a family divided by bad circumstance, Still Alice explore the life of Alice, an intelligent and successful professor who develops a rare form of early Alzheimer's. The tumultuous journey of deterioration is brutal, with fantastic performances from all around. Julianne Moore is obviously the stand out, but I feel some of the others also match her. View the mighty return of Kate Bosworth, Kristen Stewart under-used, and Alec Baldwin as one of the film's highlights. Though it doesn't give a lot of resolution, the movie is heart breaking but never manipulative, which is refreshing.",

    "review": "  Julianne Moore is the center of STILL ALICE and it is her lack of all artifice that makes STILL ALICE quite powerful. The film is directly about alzheimers but ultimately about the loss of self that disease hurdles upon its victims. It's a terrifying film that induces tears because it is so matter of fact and not shy about those facts. If Moore is wonderful, Kristen Stewart is quite a revelation. She brings a depth and truth to her role as Moore's daughter which the other actors simply cannot deliver. And hence the problem with STILL ALICE. For all it's remarkable directness, STILL ALICE cannot resist a cliche and those cliches undermine far too much of the excellent work.",

    "review": "  Not my slice of pie. I'll probably be in the minority of not liking this film, but it just didn't work for me. Alice Howland (Julianne Moore), is a renowned linguistics professor who teaches at Columbia. She is happily married to her successful husband John (Alec Baldwin), and has three grown kids: her daughter Anna (Kate Bosworth) who's trying to have kids, her son Tom (Hunter Parrish) who is going through med school, and then her more rebellious daughter Lydia (Kristen Stewart) who is in LA being an actor. One day Alice starts forgetting words and goes to see a doctor about her sudden memory lapse. She soon finds out that she has Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease. The rest of the movie follows her through the months of her slowly unraveling and what it does to her. Overall, thats about it. The movie gets the premise through to you in the first 15 minutes and from there it's an hour and a half of watching someone basically slowly lose all functionality. I just never felt connected to any of the characters expect strangely enough Stewart's character Lydia who seems to the most real out of everyone. John seems like an asshole who trys, but seems to always be going somewhere, or thinking of himself. Tom is a nobody. And then Anna comes off as a straight bitch at times. Moore does a good job playing Alice and is the clear favorite for Best Actress this year in the Academy Awards...but I am puzzled why. At times it seems like she's over acting and it clearly makes this film look just like Oscar Bait. Overall, I didn't enjoy this. It's a sad story and it really sucks to have Alzheimer's Disease and I can only pray I never have to experience it with my own family, or myself, but I just didn't like this one. It's a film I will watch once and never again. If you're super super interested then give it a look while it's in limited release. It not...you're really not missing much in my opinion!",

    "review": "  Definitely a film where the actors carry the story. Julianne Moore certainly deserves her award nominations, and surprisingly even Kirsten Stewart is quite good in this. The story, for those who are unaware, is about Moore's Alice dealing with early onset Alzheimer's, and her coping with the condition. However, that is literally all there is to the story, and as a result other aspects of the film which are brought up are underdeveloped. Moore's and to a lesser extent Stewart's, characters are the only ones with some depth to them. A plot point about her variant being genetic is only briefly touched on, with her pregnant-with-twins oldest daughter (Kate Bosworth) testing positive for the markers but then no further discussion of it occurs. Moore reads a speech she wrote to Stewart, who comments it's too scientific which results in an argument, but then the speech given doesn't match the earlier one, so I'm not sure if Moore re-wrote it or if Stewart helped. Certainly worth seeing for the performances, and it brought back some memories of relatives of mine who had the disease, but don't be surprised if it leaves you wishing there was slightly more to the story.",

Moore gives a heartbreaking performance as a middle-aged woman with Alzheimer's. It is so sad to just see her character, who is a smart, college professor, lose her memory to the point where she can't even spell \"water\". The movie itself is non-eventful as there really isn't any conflict besides Alice's disease. Kristen Stewart has some god scenes with Moore as her daughter, but there isn't enough of those scenes, because the two were great together. Julianne Moore has always done great work, but this performance might be the one that finally gets her the recognition she deserves.Grade: A-",

Julianne Moore is phenomenal and this may be her best performance to date with emotional subtlety and a tear-enducing speech about what it is to lose your identity and her hopes for a cure. The brutal irony of a linguistics professor losing the ability to communicate is ripe with tragedy and watching her character's brain slowly degenerate isn't easy. Another stand-out is a surprisingly great turn from Kristen Stewart, whose strained relationship with her mother is resolved when she steps up to the plate to look after her. The film has a truly suspenseful moment that I won't spoil but my mouth was hanging open and I almost couldn't watch. The writing is strong, with small details of her coping mechanisms shining through such as a daily quiz and in her aforementioned speech; highlighting each line so she doesn't repeat herself are wonderful additions to the realistic nature of the film. Julianne Moore did an amazing job and I applaud the blunt approach the filmmakers took to an increasingly terrifying disease that I found highly relatable.",

Alice begins to forget small things -- like the words to an important speech and where she is in her neighborhood -- which prompts her to see a neurologist. The film then follows Alice as she struggles to hold on to what has defined her for most of her adult life: her family and her job. Julianne Moore's gripping, honest, and devastating portrayal of Alice's decline defines the film. Her subtle yet powerful depiction of Alice captures the anguish and confusion of losing control over your actions and thoughts and, eventually, losing your identity.",

    "review": "  \"Still Alice\" is one of those films that was significant before ever being released to theaters. This depiction of early onset Alzheimer's disease is truthful, heartbreaking, and something that we should all see. Many films have tackled the physical destruction caused by cancer and AIDS, but this film offers an unadulterated look at Alzheimer's degenerative destruction of the mind. \"Still Alice\" explores the emotional suffering of a college linguistics professor as she quickly loses her words, memory, and ability to function; moreover, it shows the devastating consequences on her family as her mind disappears. This film is particularly difficult because it centers around a loving marriage and a tight-knit family. It shatters our image of \"happily ever after\" in lieu of reality. The success of the film hinges completely on Julianne Moore, and her performance is inspired. After four previous Oscar nominations, this has to be Moore's year to take home Best Actress. The contrast between subtle and dynamic emotional reactions paints the picture of a woman whose soul is at war with her mind. There is a unique emotional topography as her emotions magnify as she comes to terms with the disease and then slowly diminish as the disease takes over her mind. Her emotional collapse is physically reflected by her facial expressions as they transform from being full of life to blank. Of course, the rest of the cast supports the emotionally-charged story. Alec Baldwin shakes off his typical goofball persona to portray the frustrations of losing your wife emotionally while remaining the loyal caregiver. While some people might question the inclusion of Kristen Stewart into this cast, she isn't bad. Her character lacks emotion but Moore's performance is so stunning that you won't even remember that Kristen Stewart was in it. You need to emotionally prepare yourself for this film. There is not a silver lining and the reality of this disease is tough to swallow. But \"Still Alice\" drives home an important message about life: rather than valuing money or success, value your memories. Alzheimer's victims spend each day treasuring each memory, knowing that it could be the last time that they ever get to remember it.",

    "review": "  Undoubtedly, one of the greatest actresses of the last twenty years is the multi-faceted Julianne Moore. And Moore is coming back for more, with the role that might finally land her a Best Actress Academy Award. In \"Still Alice\", Moore stars as Dr. Alice Howland, a successful college professor who is unexpectedly diagnosed with an early onset case of Alzheimer's Disease. Alice is supported by her loving husband John, and her three adult children. Directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westomoreland orchestrate a slow moving film in \"Still Alice\", that might not be for the impatient viewer. But they do a solid, but not spectacular job, in depicting Alice's progressively downward spiral due to her Alzheimers. But the role of Alice needed a home run performance to authentically demonstrate the personal and health effects of Alzheimers; and Moore did even more what was asked her to do in her role as Alice. I would be shocked if she does not win a Best Actress Oscar. \"Still Alice\" still had some other good acting performances; including Alec Baldwin playing Alice's sympathetic husband John. And we also get some pretty decent work from Kristen Stewart playing Alice's youngest daughter Lydia; glad her twilight days are over. Yes, \"Still Alice\" does require for you to be suited up with a handkerchief upon watching, but it will still be worth your time. And, did I say Moore? **** Good",

Sure, it's captivating enough to watch as this horrible disease slowly eats away at the mind of an extremely intelligent woman and witness how her family copes with it, but at a certain point the film stops giving us new insights and just kind of flounders toward an ending that wants to be more poignant than it actually earns.Moore definitely earns the Oscar talk but I was also really impressed by Alex Baldwin's work as her husband.

Still Alice tracks her life as a well known and hyper intelligent Columbia professor and mother in a well to do family who gets a devastating diagnoses of early onset alzheimers desease, and her battle to maintain her hard fought cognitive function and relevance despite the eventual complications that ensue. A film full of moments, seeing her deliver a speech at a meeting for people with Alzheimers to help provide compassion, as well as her visiting a care facility were particularly impactful and just watching the decline from the top of the film to the bottom is just heart wrenching, especially with an event close to the end of the film.

The subject is handled with sensitivity (rather than sensationalism) and humanity (rather than overt sentimentality), and the writing and direction are spare, unfussy, and effective. It's undeniably a difficult task to watch the progression of the disease as it overtakes the main character, but I think you owe it to its victims to portray it as realistically and matter-of-factly as possible, a goal which the film definitely achieves. Moore is simply terrific as the lead; she handles the difficult material with grace and resolve, yet doesn't underplay the vulnerable aspects inherent to the character's situation. She's supported by a pair of fine turns from Alec Baldwin (as low-key and sympathetic as he's been in quite some time) and Kristen Stewart; Stewart is the shocker of the film, for not only does she convey actual, believable, relatable human emotion, but she feels effortlessly engaged and invested in the material. The movie does not attempt to sugar coat anything, and as a result it might be a difficult film for some to watch (though it's by no means a grim or punishing slog), but in the final analysis, STILL ALICE is, ultimately, enormously affecting.",

    "review": "  Forgetting something has to be the most annoying and stressful thing that a person could have, but losing your memory by a disease and becoming coming pretty much brain dead is even worse and this movie plays it out very well, because the movie feels real and not fake like other movies that try to do that.The story is about a Linguistics professor in a loving marriage with three grown children starts to forget certain words. After meeting with a doctor, she receives a devastating diagnosis, one that will test the bonds between her family.I always love it when a movie that I never know existed could make me glad I saw it and happy that it exists. I'm always looking forward to the big blockbusters that everybody's talking about and wouldn't shut up about. I always look past those kind of movies that are actually pretty than the entertaining blockbuster's and like always I feel like moron for skipping them. Still Alice has to be the most extraordinary film that I watched this year, in a way that the movie could had scenes where it would have dragged out or slowed down extremely, but that all was over shadowed by the amazing performance from a Oscar worthy Julianne Moore and the fantastic writing.Julianne Moore takes this role has a mother who slowly losing her memory by Alzheimer's disease, and Moore knocked it out of the park as she makes a beautifully crafted performance that just boosted up her career as a actress.The cast members like Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin and Kate Bosworth all did fantastic performance as well. Overall the performance were good in the film.The writing was just spot on great and realistic as well, the directing was good and the film almost had me in tears at parts. My only problems with the movie has to be the other character's, and I'm not talking about Moore's character I'm actually talking about the background character's that for some reason always get in the way of the story and don't really do anything. The movie to me isn't like the best movie of the year or of all time, the movie falls into the great, not into the brilliant.Overall \"Still Alice\" has fantastic acting from Moore and from the other cast, great directing and writing. If you every got a chance to see it I say go ahead.",

Instead of being \"I have this disease but I'm still here\" type of inspirational story, it's a lot more realistic. Yes, the inspirational moments are still there, but it also shows the sadder, bleaker moments. It was more realistic. Which is partially thanks to Julianne Moore. She went for it. This is one of my favorite performances from her since The Kids Are Alright. She's brilliant. You see her condition debilitate while at the same time still seeing the person underneath realize she's debilitating and trying to control it. Also, the focus on the family is interesting as well, with Alec Baldwin playing her husband and Kate Bosworth, Hunter Parrish, and Kristen Stewart playing her kids. They were all very good, with particular focus shown on trying to balance their own lives with now taking care of Alice's. Overall, this is a heartbreaking drama that will probably go into my \"really liked it, but don't know if I want to watch it again\" list. But, it is worth that first watch.",

    "review": "  \"So live in the moment I tell myself, it really is all I can do, live in the moment.\"Still Alice is a film that touches delicate subject matters, which sometimes don't make for a compelling watch. It's hard to sit down and watch someone suffering from Alzheimer's Disease and witness their slow deterioration as they gradually lose their mind. Somehow, Julianne Moore gives such a powerful performance that makes this delicate theme worth your while. She carries this film, and elevates it from your standard mental illness movie. Julianne Moore is on the top of her game and following her strong performance in Maps to the Stars, she delivers an authentic portrayal of a woman trying to come to grips with her terrible diagnosis. The film intelligently centers on her in a very authentic way instead of focusing on the rest of her family, like so many films tend to do when the character has hit rock bottom with their mental disease. As the title suggests, the focus is on Alice and her character is fully developed even when she is at her lowest. As an audience we sometimes tend to look away or find ways to ignore people with mental illness, and many films do so by focusing on the reaction of the rest of the family or on the loved ones as if the main character has lost his or her personality. But we are reminded in this film that Alice is still Alice, and Julianne Moore makes sure we come to grips with this. Julianne Moore will probably be nominated for her lead performance here and it wouldn't surprise me if she wins her first Oscar after her fifth nomination. She is long overdue.It's no surprise that this film was delivered in such an authentic way when you take into consideration that the co-director, Richard Glatzer, suffers from ASL and can't speak himself. If a film wants to deliver a powerful and empathetic film about mental illness, then there is no better way to do so than having someone who is experiencing this first hand. Glatzer, who has co-directed his previous films with Wash Westmoreland, reunites with him once again co-writing the adapted screenplay from Lisa Genova's novel. I know the issue has been explored many times before and one could assume it enters familiar territory, but Moore's portrayal of the character makes this film stand out from others. For people who have gone through similar issues with a family member or close friend, Still Alice hits home, but it does so in a compassionate way. It reminds us how fragile our minds and life can be. Having Moore play a highly intelligent linguistic professor makes this all the more shocking as we see how she struggles with the disease. The most emotional moment of the film comes when Moore's character is giving a touching speech about how she is dealing with the disease. It was a powerful moment in the movie and Moore deserves all the recognition she's been getting for her performance. Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart both give strong supporting performances as well. The entire film rings true in its exploration of mental illness, and the performances never go over the top. Everything about this film rings true despite the delicate themes that are touched. The subject matter might not be appealing for most audiences and they may find the film tedious, but for me it hits home and I found it to be a compelling drama.",

    "review": "  UNFORGETTABLE - My Review of STILL ALICE (4 Stars)Tremendously moving, heart wrenching and credible, STILL ALICE puts you right into the head of a relatively young person struggling with early onset Alzheimer's disease. Julianne Moore, in a role certain to garner her first Academy Award, gives the performance of her career as Alice, a sharp linguistics professor who slowly but surely sees everything she has known and cherished dissolve away. Writer-Directors Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer (QUINCEANERA) have adapted Lisa Genova's novel, and despite its flaws, give us a bracingly methodical experience. With few signposts to indicate the passage of time, the audience rides along with Alice as memories and tasks grow blurrier. Cinematographer Denis Lenoir keeps things tight and uses shallow focus to create an unsettling glimpse into Alice's fading mind. Beginning with an almost imperceptible moment of forgetfulness, the story moves along its inevitable trajectory with a quiet sense of foreboding. Some have criticized the Lifetime treatment at play here, but I found it understated and lovely. The score by Ilan Eshkeri could have been more dynamic and edgy, yet it settles instead for the tinkly, overt themes of your standard disease-of-the-week film. It's a minor quibble in a film that brought me to tears, the sobbing, uncontrollable ones often reserved for personal family losses. Because Alice is such a strong, intelligent woman, her decline feels that much more tragic. Her family, particularly strong work from Kristen Stewart as her challenging daughter and Alec Baldwin as a husband who tamps down his own feelings for far too long, may feel sketched in, but that's the point. This film is entirely from Alice's point of view. We have to consistently catch our bearings from scene to scene, much like our protagonist. The repetition of her exercise routines, her recordings, and her doctor visits act as markers for us, slowly chipping away at her (and our) sense of security.An early scene, in which Alice discloses her disease to her husband, is that Oscar clip moment one would expect. Moore infuses it with unexpected rage, and it's some of the best work she has ever done. Strangely enough, she bests that in a latter scene in which she has to give a speech. Standing in front of a group of people, highlighting her prepared words with a yellow marker as she goes, so as not to skip any lines, Moore is matter-of-fact and stunning as she talks about the hell she's living. She fills the moment with surprising joy, utter simplicity, and throws down a Master Class in film acting, the likes of which I have not seen before. Speeches like this do not usually have such a profound effect on me. I typically respond to real exchanges between two people, but this memorable moment cuts so deep, gets to the strange dichotomy of being able to find joy and despair in the same breath, that the aforementioned bawling commenced from the top of the scene and carried into the next few. As Alice's world gets stripped away bit by awful bit, her essence becomes more and more pure, and it affects everyone around her. Stewart does some of her best work in these late scenes, proving that despite the TWILIGHT saga's numbing boredom, she has considerable depth of feeling. The final scene in particular absolutely wrecked me. Stewart's commitment to the moment and Moore's utter transformation will stick with me for a long time. Sure it's a film that will be remembered for Moore's acting rather than as a masterful cinematic experience, but sometimes a beautifully realized window into someone's soul is enough.",

Julianne Moore stars as Alice, a brilliant college professor who is diagnosed with Early-Onset Alzheimer's. From there it's the about the impact of the disease not only on her, but her family. Moore is fantastic and will no doubt get a bunch of award nominations, and could easily win. Alec Baldwin plays her husband, and this is probably his best film performance in a long time. He isn't your typical husband in one of these movies. It's a very real and honest portrayal of a man who is losing his wife and doesn't know what to do. Even Kristen Stewart is good as Alice's daughter. I don't think she does that lip biting thing very much. Good movie with a great performance. But, it can be uncomfortable to watch, especially if you have a loved one battling alzheimer's.",

    "review": "  There are moments of Still Alice that are entrancing and demonstrate the cinema in its purest of forms. Unfortunately they are not consistent enough to elevate the film above it's original material. The subject material is one that I believer would make for a great read, but doesn't make for a particularly interesting film. Julianne Moore is great, of course, but despite the seriousness of the material, the film never really becomes anything.",

What I like most about this film is that it reminds us that Alice, our mother, our father - whoever is suffering from Alzheimer's is always still there. Somewhere. On the heartbreak meter this film is a 10 plus. But don't let that keep you from seeing it. It's ultimately hopeful, too, and a testament to the power of kindness and compassion. Will write a longer review later, but as film is opening in LA and NYC on Dec. 5 to qualify for awards, I encourage everyone to go see it.",

    "review": "  Is there truly a race for best actress this year? I'd say it's a race for runner up after witnessing Julianne Moore effortlessly grab it and I'm sure no other performance this year will make her let go. In the unique 'Still Alice' Moore is remarkably committed to inhabiting the devastating beginnings of early onset alzheimer's. This wonder-of-an-actress left me smiling, crying and shocked, all in perfect measure and strokes. Her supporting cast aid her very well too, particularly with a good performance from Baldwin and and eye-opening and impressive performance from Stewart, a performance I wish had more screen time. The original screenplay is a refreshingly different one from Genova, a brilliant screenplay that never exploits the disease to get every last tear out of you, but is never aesthetic to the point of ineffectiveness. What we're left with is a superbly paced and structured film that feels like a case-study, one that doesn't follow the whole of Alice's disease but takes the hardest part of the disease, the beginning of it, and follows that in the most detailed manner. By the end of the film we know the end of Alice is inevitable, but because we have followed the beginning of the disease we also care that much more, which is why the film ends in the slightly abrupt manner that it does. The direction from Glatzer and Westmoreland is spectacularly subtle, emotional and ultimately progressive, and is certainly of tremendous merit. Still Alice as a whole is so packed with emotion, subtlety and remarkable performances that I left it feeling endlessly affected and cared so much more for all the Alices and Alices' families affected by the disease in the world. What an achievement!",

It is perhaps the most upsetting movie i've seen, as for me it's a stark reminder of how brutal and unforgiving Alzheimer's Disease truly is. A disease that has affected my family.Watching her hopeless battle with Alzheimer's was incredibly difficult. Made even more so with the fantastic performance by Julianne Moore.Still Alice is truly a unique movie as it shines a light on those suffering with Alzheimer's Disease. Understated and raw in the best possible way it reflects the brutal and heartbreaking nature of the disease.Our faces may in time fade, but we will never forget. She is Still Alice.",

Moore is always excellent, but in the character of Alice she instills a fierce and passionate spirit, a quiet ownership and a willful rejection of her situation that's powerful to watch; this role could very well win her an Oscar, and deservedly so.",

It's very straight forward, but because of the lead performance, pretty moving (and possibly devastating). This is an opportunity for Julianne Moore to break your heart, and she does. She gives an amazing performance and may win the Oscar she so richly deserves if enough people see this. Currently on my card I think it's a battle between Moore's heart breaking and Rosamund Pike's throat cutting for the top prize.",
