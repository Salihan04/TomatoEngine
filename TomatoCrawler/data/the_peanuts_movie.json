    "review": "  The legendary Charles Schulz comicstrip gets a modern day movie adaptation care of 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios, with two members of his family behind the story, yet despite that last bit of info, I was still worried. You'd be forgiven for being worried too in this day and age. I cringed at the thought of this movie in all honesty, it terrified me, growing up with Snoopy and co, how could the modern day Hollywood monster do this epic creation justice? Thoughts of newly created PC characters crowbarred in, lots of hip hop music, dreadful big name voice work with pointless cameos, oh my God! you could just see it coming. Luckily none of that actually did happen (amazingly...accept for the music), so lets be happy.As for the plot, well its a simple little thing really, in true Schulz form. Good old Charlie Brown is kinda eeking his way through life, trying his best and not really getting very far, as we all know and love. In the meantime good old Snoopy is up to his good old tricks whilst having his dreamy daydreams about flying against the dastardly Red Baron in his trusty doghouse/bi-plane. All of a sudden (not really) a new girl moves into the sleepy neighbourhood, a little red headed girl, to whom Charlie Brown instantly falls for. What follows are Charlie Brown's attempts at getting the little red headed girls attention in any way he can...without making a fool of himself. As I'm sure you're all aware, this doesn't really go well for old Charlie but nevertheless, he keeps at it and eventually comes out on top (spoiler alert...Charlie Brown comes out on top...duh!).Now the main highlight for this movie is obviously the visuals. When the film was announced I was pretty sure this would look terrible, it would lose all of the charm from Schulz's comicstrip, OK...I was wrong, but come on, how many thought the same thing huh. As it turns out the original Schulz designs are perfectly adapted and complimented by the use of CGI, yes everything is CGI, but its tastefully done and recreates the original material amazingly well. In all honesty it doesn't actually look like CGI for the most part, if you ask me, it looks more like a glossy [i]South park[/i] episode to me with that flat 2D appearance. This is one reason why it works so well, the visuals combine both the 3D and 2D element, giving the best of both worlds, making it feel fresher, different and all the time keeping the classic Schulz style (kinda like the later [i]Street Fighter II[/i] games ya know).Seriously though, when I say they have kept the Schulz style in one piece, that's exactly what I mean, I don't just mean they skimmed the surface. Remember how the classic Charlie Brown gang used to dance in school? all those quirky and unusual little jigs? well they are perfectly recreated here. All those classic facial expressions from Brown and co, their funny little hairstyles, Pigpen's clouds of dirt, the characters stances, the way they move, Snoopy's little happy dances, the little dotted line trail Woodstock leaves behind when he flies around, adult characters represented by a trombone etc...its all here. What's more, they even manage to include some oldschool black and white animation harking back to the old days, not sure if it was actually old footage or not, don't think so, but all the same it was a sweet little touch.The one thing that did disappoint me was the music included (same old I'm afraid). Now admittedly the film wasn't filled with horrendous modern trashy music, thankfully they kept the more chirpy to humdrum tunes and sounds from the original material. But alas they just couldn't help themselves, and to that degree we do unfortunately get some sequences accompanied by some atrocious modern claptrap that completely pulls you out of the moment, it ruins the atmosphere. Seeing Snoopy and co getting up to their cutesy hijinks whilst some RnB/hip hop (whatever) music plays, is tantamount to heresy! I hated every second of it. Then of course they have to continue the trend over the end credits, sheesh!Another tiny issue I had, that did actually become a larger issue, was Snoopy's plot line. Snoopy spends much of his time in dream sequences fighting against the Red Baron atop of his doghouse. Now while this was very cool, very well done and was perfectly recreated along with everything else, there was a little too much of it. The whole idea was sweet at first but became a bit mundane quickly. Yes we know Snoopy hates the Red Baron, yes we know he will rescue his female counterpart and we know the Red Baron will get away to fight another day. But did we really need this to take up virtually the entire movie? I really wanted to see Snoopy interact with the others a bit more in all honesty, its not a massive huge flaw or anything, but it stands out enough to be fair. The rest of the gang are given reasonable amounts of screen time but again some could of done with a bit more (and less of Snoopy flying around), background characters like Pigpen, Schroeder and Franklin I always found more interesting. To be honest, I was never much of a Charlie Brown/Snoopy fan growing up, I knew of them, saw the odd special on TV (was never overly enthralled by them) and had the odd cuddly toy of Snoopy. I don't really know much about the Peanuts lore and don't pretend to, but despite that I can't deny this was a great old fashioned heart-warmer updated with some lovely CGI work. Whether everyone would enjoy this I don't know, kids will I'm sure but they probably won't be up on the whole franchise backstory side of things. Older folk...sure, or at least oldschool fans will, not sure about non-fans though, it might seem a bit too babyish to them. Overall its a very simplistic and basic premise which has been executed wonderfully, everything looks spot on from the locations to the characters attire, they all sound just right and the use of archive sound footage from Bill Melendez (Snoopy) was an awesome touch. This is a completely, near perfect, faithful adaptation of a much loved classic.",

    "review": "  Steve Martino revisits the characters of Charles M. Schulz in The Peanuts Movie.Running with a very very very friendly tone and a brief 85 minute run-time, the plot comes complete with many nostalgia moments and a delightful story. With that said, even with a shorter run-time than a lot of other films, this one still seems a bit stretched. The second story-line involving Snoopy feels as if it exists to extend the film out.The CG animation doesn't trump the old fashioned sketches; however, there is more than enough throwbacks and character movements to make this a successful picture visually.Backed with a classic soundtrack and much approved voice work, this film also delivers in the sound department.The Peanuts Movie excels on many levels and is easily a recommendable easy going animation.",

    "review": "  Tastefully done with care and ease, \"The Pleanuts Movie\" brings back the classic characters in all of the ways you hoped they would. The central story is that there is a new girl at school that Charlie Brown is gushing over and does not have the guts to speak to her. Side plots include a 3D look into what snoopy has been fighting all these years and Charlie Brown trying to win a talent show to impress this new mystery girl. I loved every aspect on how they mixed the old school two dimensional style animation with the new school 3D. It was done carefully and the callbacks to the original specials were done perfectly. Although it does rely on some of the source material to drive the story, I was able to look past that and see that they were just trying to pay homage. \"The Peanuts Movie\" will put a smile on your face no matter when you watch it. It is the children's feel-good film of the year. Is it one of the best animated films I've seen in a long time? Of course not! It is an extremely fun family film with great laughs, a heartwarming story for kids, and great messages throughout. This film may borrow a lot of elements from the past, but it is still great. This film was a pleasure to watch!",

    "review": "  Twentieth Century Fox Animation that brought us Ice Age and a short featuring Scrat in space as the opening act reintroduces the Peanuts gang in 3D. Throughout the years of Peanuts specials the cast has regularly been replaced to keep the voices sounding young. The music at the school dance and the fact that Charlie Brown takes a bin of recycling out to the curb at his house are some of the few modern touches that I noticed. The characters don't suddenly use cell phones. Snoopy writes his own hero story fighting the Red Baron of WWI. From his doghouse fighter-plane he must save the poodle Fifi (Kristin Chenoweth is the one celebrity attached to this project). Charlie Brown gets all flustered over his new crush, the Little Red-Haired Girl. This movie is like Linus' comfy blanket. Pretty much every part of the story and the relationships between the characters have been done before. There is nothing new except the 3D animation. The point is that there are still universal themes that modern kids can identify with in Charles M. Schulz's creation. Parents and grandparents get a throwback experience. From what I observed Thanksgiving week at the multiplex, kids were laughing and into it too.",

    "review": "  No, The Peanuts Movie doesn't reinvent the wheel. It doesn't add anything to The Peanuts that we haven't seen before. Rather, it is a celebration of what we love so much about these stories: the unforgettable characters, the story situations which have become a staple of The Peanuts, the excellent humor, and the innocent joyfulness. The Peanuts Movie captures this, and therefore is an amazing celebration of what made Charles Schulz's work so amazing. It's an example of simplicity being a good thing, and the sweet, innocent nature of it makes it maybe not the best movie of the year, but certainly one of the most delightful ones of the year. If you even mildly enjoy The Peanuts, this is a movie you're going to want to see.",

    "review": "  Bringing a beloved franchise out of near complete dormancy, The Peanuts Movie has the right amount of charm and humor for children, their parents, and yes, even their grandparents. (Charlie Brown is HOW old?!) This latest take on the comic strip turned cartoon utilizes a brisk pace and a 3-D animation style that cleverly appears to be a hybrid between hand drawn animation and modern digital trickery. It's not, but the presentation almost fooled me. The plot doesn't take us in any new directions, but it doesn't need to. The movie packs in as many references to the Peanuts franchise as it can, sending Charlie Brown on a mad quest to impress a certain redhead, and showcasing that Snoopy and Woodstock still win at life. The older films exuded a somewhat morose and somber feel that centered on lonely children and their experiences with failure. The Peanuts Movie largely ditches that for a more cheerful experience that succeeds in actually allowing that blockhead Charlie Brown to grow as a character and have an arc. I personally despised the placement of modern music in a Peanuts movie, and a lot of the slapstick humor could have been left on the cutting room floor. But whatever. It's a well-crafted children's movie that will probably best serve as a rental or a purchase for long-time fans of these near timeless characters.",

    "review": "  Brilliantly re-introducing the legendary Peanuts gallery to a whole new generation of Lucies and Linuses, this touching colorful Movie smartly doesn't throw out the Brown with the bath water. Instead of going cynical and cutting edge, the latest adventures of Charlie and Snoopy perfectly nail the heart and humor of Charles Schultz, connecting with nostalgia as if it were the football that our pint-size hero finally gets to kick. Indeed, The Peanuts Movie ends up to be the furthest thing from a \"dark and stormy night.\" In this G-rated animated family flick, Snoopy embarks upon his greatest mission as he takes to the skies to pursue their arch-nemesis, while his best pal Charlie Brown begins his own epic quest back home. In an era when potty humor, fully automatic zingers, and overly syrupy messages get fired at the audience from characters moving faster than Ricochet Rabbit on a cocaine binge, it says a lot that this flick plays out nice and easily as opposed to fast and furiously. This is not to say that it's slow-just that it's not overactive and frenetic like the Ice Age series that ironically comes courtesy of the same inspired minds and animation house. Seriously, if select children want that badly for racecar-in-the-red bedlam, they need Ritalin-not Scrat, the Flying Prehistoric Squirrel. Certainly, Peanuts doesn't lack ambition, it simply fixes up - rather than outright fixes - what isn't broke. With eye-popping computer animation, the movie brings in all of the telltale Schultz hallmarks that made the comic strips and holiday specials (A Charlie Brown Christmas and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown) so enjoyable and indelible. Some slight modern touches (Meghan Trainor sings \"Better When I'm Dancin\") don't do much for the story but they don't exactly detract either. Bottom line: New Kids on the Blockhead",

It's the same characters, jokes, lines, and gags that you come to know as a Peanuts fan. They don't update the formula or modernize it at all for the new crowd of kids coming in to see it. It's the same Peanuts, except for a few modern songs which you can't really prevent. The story doesn't stick to the beginning, middle, end structure as the strips and specials never did. It's Charlie Brown, just seeing him live out his daily life trying to please the little red-haired girl. You'll like this one.",

I'm sure they worked hard to get them like that. I didn't like the animation. It looked like they stopped working on it too soon.

All your favorite characters are here and the story is the same good old Charlie Brown story just on a larger scale. Charlie Brown (Noah Schnapp) has to muster up enough courage to talk to the little red haired girl (Francesca Capaldi). I'm glad that the movie didn't just go the same way that other big budget children movies have gone. With the exception of a few things I still believed I was watching the Peanuts and not some big scheme to make money. But I guess those things have to be addressed.There is even a reference to late Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz and his nickname Sparky. Schulz's sons produced this movie and they did a remarkably faithful job of reviving his father's creation; they kept new, unwelcome ideas from infringing on the Peanuts legacy.Overall, I can honestly say that I'm proud that Blue Sky Studios did the source material justice. If you're a fan of Peanuts, then take it from me right now: go see this movie! It's a big ol' ball of nostalgia for any fan, it's a good film for kids and adults alike, and when it's over, I can guarantee you'll leave the theater with a big smile. Now if you'll excuse me, I feel the sudden urge to save up for a keyboard; I wanna learn how to play \"Linus and Lucy\"!",

    "review": "  The Peanuts were a big part of my childhood and I got pumped when I heard they were finally making another theatrical release. But at the same time, I was nervous because they were making it computer generated with Blue Sky getting involved with it. I've never really cared for any of their movies, not even the first Ice Age movie. Their stories aren't very interesting, their humor isn't all that funny, they feel so forgettable, and they never left an impact on me. Though they've always had really beautiful animation. When I finally saw it, my fears were never realized. The Peanuts Movie is one of the best animated films I've seen all year. I'm so glad to see a film that actually stays true to its source material. The story acts like a classic Peanuts special, the script is written like one, its tone makes it feel like one, even the animation feels like your traditional Peanuts special. I didn't think that a computer generated Peanuts movie would work. We were all used to it being completely hand-drawn, which gives it that charm and simplicity that we enjoy. But the style of the CGI actually made it seem like it was hand-drawn and gave us that charm we love to see from Peanuts. Not only that, I think it adds even more depth to the world of the Peanuts and made them feel more real. The characters that we all adore still have their personalities. Charlie Brown is still the lovable loser, Snoopy is still the loyal beagle, Lucy is still the crabby and bossy girl, Linus is still the smart and helpful friend who carries his blanket, Sally is still the cute and naive younger sister, they all have the relatable personalities that we all know and love. All the actors nailed the voice work, especially since it's all child actors. They were all the perfect voice for each character. I also love that the film offers a lot of valuable lessons for children. They show this at the end where, without giving too much away, the Little Red-Haired Girl tells Charlie Brown about all the admirable things he's done. That ending...is just perfect! So sweet, so meaningful, and kind of emotional. I had a huge smile on my face during that scene. It was a perfect way to end the movie. A lot of people have complained that they didn't try anything new with this film. They say they paid too much homage to the original source material, copying a lot phrases they said in the specials. In a way, I kind of agree. There were some parts that felt a little forced. I also thought that there were too many scenes with Snoopy and the Red Baron. Though they were fun to watch, it didn't feel like they had any significant point in the story. But when saying that the film doesn't do anything new, it doesn't need to. We see the movie mainly to see the characters that we all love. The Peanuts were part of a lot of people's childhoods and there's a lot of nostalgia in this film. For that, we should be grateful that they stayed true to the source material. So in the end, I really love this movie. It is by far and away my favorite Blue Sky film and is one of my favorite movies of the year, not just in animation. It unlocked the childhood in me and it has become a worthy addition to the Peanuts canon.",

    "review": "  Jan. 2,2016- I've never read the Peanuts comic strips by Schulz, but without any prior knowledge it was easy to understand the nostalgic effect it was going for simply with the help of great character design and animation. The film succeeds very well at capturing the minimalistic nature of comic strips and manages to maximize the emotional effect coming out of the characters. Story-wise the main plot is very straightforward and easy to understand- Charlie a genuinely nice guy wants to get closer with the little red haired girl but *snap* things never go his way. The beauty of the story however lies in the side plot of Snoopy whose story not only provides the necessary action in the film but at the same time relates very well with the main storyline. I have major respect for Blue Sky studios in taking such a risk with the design elements and the animation when movies such as The Good Dinosaur are bringing almost photo realistic images on screen. It goes to prove that story will always be king even at the cost of some good looking imagery.",

    "review": "  I should confess that the new Peanuts movie has been my first real exposure to the Peanuts comics and franchise as a whole. Peanuts has never truly taken off here in the UK - not for lack of quality - but mainly because Peanuts has and always will be a reflection of Middle-America suburbia. It is a celebration of simpler times; not through the eyes of the current generation, but rather for the older generation looking back at their own childhood.Now yes, of course, this feeling of childhood nostalgia is not exclusive to the middle-class American culture but a universal feeling that has only grown in popularity and become ever more profitable. Yet The Peanuts Movie doesn't culturally translate fully from American to Britain. There were many set pieces that wouldn't really connect to a British audience in the same way, such as the talent show, show and tell or the general imagery of the American suburbs. Despite this, the character of Charlie Brown is very relatable, undergoing feelings of inadequacy and lack of identity that always remains with each new generation.Based off the comic by Schulz, Peanuts centres around the childhood of Charlie Brown, his dog Snoopy and his friends as they get into adventures around their neighbourhood and school. In this movie, Charlie Brown has grown affections for the new red haired girl that has just moved in and believes that he needs to reinvent himself as a winner in order to get her attention. Rather than having one story to follow, the movie has broken itself down into a few miniature stories.At one point it's the book report that's going to save the day, at another time it's the talent show or the dance, all held together by a string of a plot. It's also worth noting Snoopy's sub-plot of his imaginary piloting adventures to save his imaginary girlfriend which the movie casually drifts into at random intervals. The plot is fundamentally non-existent, with all the characters being defined by one strong characteristic. Snoopy's imaginary adventures, conversely, have no bearing on the movie.However, everything I should hate about this movie, I actually kind of love. Peanuts promotes a simpler time so it stands to reason that it follows a simple story, and what might seem small and insignificant can be huge and life-changing to a child. While every character has one defining feature, they have a lot of fun playing to those characteristics, and no single character feels over-used or unwanted; Snoopy's airplane adventure makes for some of the most charming moments in the whole movie.The animation is beautiful, the voice acting is perfect and the humour is hilarious. Plus it doesn't try to update them to modern expectations; no computers, tablets and they play outside. It's never mentioned what decade the film takes place in but you could tell it wasn't this one.All the regular Peanuts characters feel both fake and real, they play to their defining feature unbelievably so; one child is really into music so he constantly talks about Beethoven and always plays the piano, one child is always dirty, another is nerdy and shy. Yet they all feel fleshed out, they have their own dreams, hobbies, mannerisms, quirks and loyalties. After the 65 years that Peanuts has been around, the characters have aged, certainly, but in the process they've become timeless.The only real criticism to make is that while Charlie Brown has to ask himself what makes him special, there's nothing to say what makes the red haired girl so special that Charlie has to chase after her. If they took a moment to give her some personality it would be justified, but she's only really there to move the plot along.It feels so strange that in a movie dedicated to saying how important it is to have a good personality, they don't give the main love interest (well crush interest anyway) any personality at all.The Peanuts Movie isn't going to change anyone's life - I doubt a child would watch it and have it stick with them for long - but it is a very enjoyable experience. The charm and creativity put into this movie alone is worth going to see it. It's a simple movie, but it's refreshingly simple.",

There were so many dumb things that the few cute ones just didn't make up for it. I'm a lifelong \"Peanuts\" fan, and I walked out. I mean I get that they'll throw Patty and Marcie into the same school (even though they went to a different one), but to put Linus and Sally into the same class was just lazy. Top it off with the lackluster comedy that's been recycled for 50 years without a break and it was just a yawnfest. Yeah, this is a show for kids. I get that. But there have been many offering throughout movie history that were kids offerings that were simply amazing for adults as well. (Toy Story I-III anyone?)

    "review": "  In a year full of reboots of childhood classics, this is one of the most faithful. It updates the Peanuts in all the right ways, while remaining true to their essential spirit. It doesn't Smurf them by sending them to New York or having them reach out of the TV into our world or any other way this film could have gone horribly wrong, it is just 90 minutes of old school Peanuts shenanigans. Not a whole lot really happens, it's really just sort of a slice-of-life story. Charlie Brown questions life and tries to get the attention of the new girl, and that's pretty much it. It's simple, but it's nice, and it's incredibly likable. It's got a solid message too, and the ending is genuinely heartwarming. Charlie Brown notes how life constantly craps on him, but he keeps trying. That's been a message The Peanuts have always had, but it's really relished here in all the best ways. It's cute and it's funny. It's faster paced than The Peanuts have been in the past, but I'm actually okay with this, it leads to a lot of really funny moments. It stays nostalgic in all the right ways, while speeding up its pace for today's audience without losing the essence of what made Peanuts great in the first place.The films only flaw is also something I liked about it, and that's that not much really happens. I feel like 30 minutes has always been the appropriate length for Peanuts, at 90 minutes it feels a bit too long. If they had done this style rebooted as a TV series, I think it could have worked better. As a movie, it feels a bit off. It's still hard for me to criticize it too much there, because really for what it is I don't think I'd change a thing. It's not like it's the greatest film of the year or anything, but it's exactly what a Peanuts movie should be, for better or for worse.",

    "review": "  'The Peanuts Movie' (or 'Snoopy and Charlie Brown: The Peanuts Movie', as it's billed in some places) seems long overdue, seeing as Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts comic strip has been around since 1950. Since he passed away in 2000, Schulz's children have done well continuing on his legacy, as this film honours him and Peanuts well - the animation is quaint at times, but detailed and colourful when needed.The whole Peanuts gang is here - the klutz Charlie Brown (Schnapp), the nagging Lucy (Miller), Charlie's best friend Linus (Garfin), the odd-pair Patty & Marcie, Charlie's sister Sally, the followed-by-a-cloud-of-dust Pig-Pen and, of course, Snoopy the beagle and Woodstock the bird. The film's set in winter, so there's plenty of snow and ice skating, and plenty of opportunities for Charlie Brown to embarrass himself. Plot = new girl moves in across the road, Charlie Brown spends the entire movie trying to impress/talk to her!This director has form, with 'Horton Hears a Who!' and does well to keep things happening, especially when Snoopy's daydreaming and dogfighting in the European WWI skies against the Red Baron! The other adult reference kids won't get is Charlie Brown reading Leo Tolstoy's 'War and Peace' - a 1,200+ page book for his book report - and asking for \"Leo's Toy Store\" at the library! I didn't like the weird sounds they used in place of adults/teachers, but otherwise it's well made.",

I'd say it's an overall success as its animation is very well done in its the technical aspects and what not, but also tells an easy to understand story for kids and it's rather enjoyable for everyone. It's pretty loyal to it's original source and it has plenty of good messages. Finally, Snoopy may be one of the most charismatic fictional dogs of all times, if not the most.",

    "review": "  'The Peanuts Movie' is a children's Animated Comedy following Charlie Brown and Snoopy as they each go on their own little adventure, one to defeat the evil 'Red Baron' and the other to try and win over the love of his life. Firstly, i really really enjoyed this movie, this was such a pleasant surprise to watch and i had a smile on my face pretty much the whole way through. This was definitely one of the biggest surprises of the year for me, i expected this to be a very childish film that would only appeal to young kids and try to draw in those who grew up with these characters. I really thought i was just going to have to try to survive through it and then be done with it, but i don't believe how much fun i had watching this movie. It was immensely funny, had great emotion, great characters and chemistry, a great score/soundtrack, and an interesting yet repetitive plot that kept me intrigued. My past experiences with 'Peanuts' is limited to knowing basically who Charlie Brown and Snoopy are, and you can definitely still enjoy this even if you don't have an attachment to the property. One of the biggest things that makes animated movies successful is including elements that an older audience can really enjoy, as 'Pixar' have done so well. And when an animated film doesn't do that it really isn't enjoyable to anyone over like 10, it doesn't mean the film is a failure but it should aim to attract an audience outside of the little kids who are going to see it regardless of what its about. This film accomplished that really well, it was a very charming film with plenty of laughs and many positive and uplifting moments that i couldn't help but to smile at. The animation style combined with many unpredictably funny moments made for a very good time watching this movie. I thought they balanced the use of comedy with the more plot driven, emotional moments very well, and a lot of that was due to Snoopy. Snoopy is such a loveable cute character and whenever he was onscreen playing around, they happened to be some of my favourite moments of the film. The plot of the film was simple and a little predictable in that you knew how it was going to end, but there were a few surprises here and there that i liked and kept me interested. It did get a little repetitive by the last 20 minutes, but being aimed at kids, you can't knock them down that much for a simple and repetitive plot. Somehow i don't think an 'Interstellar' style of plot in a Peanuts movie would go very well. The other thing i really thought was a huge positive for the film was the great score by Christophe Beck. Beck, is in no way a household name when it comes to memorable scores but hearing work like this makes me want to hear more of what he can do. The score was very uplifting and kept a very positive and adventurous tone the whole way through. In the end, peanuts was an enjoyable movie filled with emotion, funny moments, great characters and a fun time for people of all ages. It had a very positive and light-hearted tone that made this a very fun film and one of the strongest animated films of the year. - 7.8",

Hearing about this movie , many hearts filled with hope and joy so as to see their lovely characters to come on screen.Hope of Charlie Brown , Snoopy , Lucy and aall to come with their sweet and salty aura to the screen. But the movie could not hold up to the expectation as the strip which was noiseless , sound less , devoid of any vice to the characters , let our imagination draw a eternal sketch of their power to mesmerize , but the feature film that brought voices to these characters , neither could help up to our imagination nor did it justify the characters essence. Also , the story line could not focus on a bigger goal and was just floundered over small incidents directly picked from the strip.So a piece of advice would be to rather read the comic strip than go for this movie.",

    "review": "  The legendary Charles Schulz comicstrip gets a modern day movie adaptation care of 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios, with two members of his family behind the story, yet despite that last bit of info, I was still worried. You'd be forgiven for being worried too in this day and age. I cringed at the thought of this movie in all honesty, it terrified me, growing up with Snoopy and co, how could the modern day Hollywood monster do this epic creation justice? Thoughts of newly created PC characters crowbarred in, lots of hip hop music, dreadful big name voice work with pointless cameos, oh my God! you could just see it coming. Luckily none of that actually did happen (amazingly...accept for the music), so lets be happy.As for the plot, well its a simple little thing really, in true Schulz form. Good old Charlie Brown is kinda eeking his way through life, trying his best and not really getting very far, as we all know and love. In the meantime good old Snoopy is up to his good old tricks whilst having his dreamy daydreams about flying against the dastardly Red Baron in his trusty doghouse/bi-plane. All of a sudden (not really) a new girl moves into the sleepy neighbourhood, a little red headed girl, to whom Charlie Brown instantly falls for. What follows are Charlie Brown's attempts at getting the little red headed girls attention in any way he can...without making a fool of himself. As I'm sure you're all aware, this doesn't really go well for old Charlie but nevertheless, he keeps at it and eventually comes out on top (spoiler alert...Charlie Brown comes out on top...duh!).Now the main highlight for this movie is obviously the visuals. When the film was announced I was pretty sure this would look terrible, it would lose all of the charm from Schulz's comicstrip, OK...I was wrong, but come on, how many thought the same thing huh. As it turns out the original Schulz designs are perfectly adapted and complimented by the use of CGI, yes everything is CGI, but its tastefully done and recreates the original material amazingly well. In all honesty it doesn't actually look like CGI for the most part, if you ask me, it looks more like a glossy [i]South park[/i] episode to me with that flat 2D appearance. This is one reason why it works so well, the visuals combine both the 3D and 2D element, giving the best of both worlds, making it feel fresher, different and all the time keeping the classic Schulz style (kinda like the later [i]Street Fighter II[/i] games ya know).Seriously though, when I say they have kept the Schulz style in one piece, that's exactly what I mean, I don't just mean they skimmed the surface. Remember how the classic Charlie Brown gang used to dance in school? all those quirky and unusual little jigs? well they are perfectly recreated here. All those classic facial expressions from Brown and co, their funny little hairstyles, Pigpen's clouds of dirt, the characters stances, the way they move, Snoopy's little happy dances, the little dotted line trail Woodstock leaves behind when he flies around, adult characters represented by a trombone etc...its all here. What's more, they even manage to include some oldschool black and white animation harking back to the old days, not sure if it was actually old footage or not, don't think so, but all the same it was a sweet little touch.The one thing that did disappoint me was the music included (same old I'm afraid). Now admittedly the film wasn't filled with horrendous modern trashy music, thankfully they kept the more chirpy to humdrum tunes and sounds from the original material. But alas they just couldn't help themselves, and to that degree we do unfortunately get some sequences accompanied by some atrocious modern claptrap that completely pulls you out of the moment, it ruins the atmosphere. Seeing Snoopy and co getting up to their cutesy hijinks whilst some RnB/hip hop (whatever) music plays, is tantamount to heresy! I hated every second of it. Then of course they have to continue the trend over the end credits, sheesh!Another tiny issue I had, that did actually become a larger issue, was Snoopy's plot line. Snoopy spends much of his time in dream sequences fighting against the Red Baron atop of his doghouse. Now while this was very cool, very well done and was perfectly recreated along with everything else, there was a little too much of it. The whole idea was sweet at first but became a bit mundane quickly. Yes we know Snoopy hates the Red Baron, yes we know he will rescue his female counterpart and we know the Red Baron will get away to fight another day. But did we really need this to take up virtually the entire movie? I really wanted to see Snoopy interact with the others a bit more in all honesty, its not a massive huge flaw or anything, but it stands out enough to be fair. The rest of the gang are given reasonable amounts of screen time but again some could of done with a bit more (and less of Snoopy flying around), background characters like Pigpen, Schroeder and Franklin I always found more interesting. To be honest, I was never much of a Charlie Brown/Snoopy fan growing up, I knew of them, saw the odd special on TV (was never overly enthralled by them) and had the odd cuddly toy of Snoopy. I don't really know much about the Peanuts lore and don't pretend to, but despite that I can't deny this was a great old fashioned heart-warmer updated with some lovely CGI work. Whether everyone would enjoy this I don't know, kids will I'm sure but they probably won't be up on the whole franchise backstory side of things. Older folk...sure, or at least oldschool fans will, not sure about non-fans though, it might seem a bit too babyish to them. Overall its a very simplistic and basic premise which has been executed wonderfully, everything looks spot on from the locations to the characters attire, they all sound just right and the use of archive sound footage from Bill Melendez (Snoopy) was an awesome touch. This is a completely, near perfect, faithful adaptation of a much loved classic.",

    "review": "  The Peanuts Movie is the 5th feature length animated version of the Charles M. Schulz's comic strip Peanuts but this time using 3D computer animation technology. This time around this tells the story of Charlie Brown and his infatuation with a new pupil at his school, a mysterious red headed girl.It's been 35 years since the last Charlie Brown movie (Snoopy Come Home, 1972) and 50 years since A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) and I only had a vague recollection of seeing the Peanuts movies, mostly either at Christmas or during the early mornings of school holidays but the image of Snoopy laying asleep on top of his kennel was always a prominent and memorable one. As I sat watching this film, I was asking myself, \"Who exactly is this film aimed at?\" The animation is flawless and the story is very nice and sweet, however wasn't anything to keep adults entertained and the angst ridden exploits of Charlie Brown probably went over the heads of youngsters who probably weren't aware of most of the reference. And speaking of Charlie Brown, I don't remember him being so damn depressing, with every pit fall I wanted to give him a good slap and for a film that was only 90 minutes long, there were a lot of slaps to be dealt out. It's obvious that a lot of care and attention went into making the movie and it's a love letter to it's creator unfortunately not enough attention went into the script.",

His eyes are little lifeless charcoal dots! The droll, slow-paced, melancholiac, low-fi look of the TV specials is part of the charm that is the Peanuts comic. When it gets an update courtesy of CGI and a 3D-look, it just seems weird. However, Snoopy does make a nice transition over to CGI. His fantasy sequences where he is a WWI ace come to vivid life especially. Overall, the story is the usual thing: Charlie is a underachiever, is smitten with the little red-haired girl, tries to impress her, fails and tries again and again and again. Nothing fancy but the story and the characters are punctuated with modern updates that don't mesh with the Peanuts comic that I grew up with. But the movie did get me to feel for Charlie and root for him and ultimately succeed.",

Hollywood did this one right: they kept the message clean and pure, just as Charles Schultz would have liked it. I suspect parents who grew up with the Peanuts will enjoy this more than their kids. This is a classic, simple love story and underdog tale. While it doesn't really offer anything new or fresh, it feels like a nostalgic visit with an old friend and plays like a \"Best of Peanuts\" film.Uplifting Theme:� You're as young as your imagination will allow you to be.� Be kind to others. We are all fighting our own battles.� Never give up.Things I liked:� Meagan Trainer's cute song Better When I'm Dancin' is adorable and catchy. You'll leave the theater dancing.� Snoopy's timeline is adorable.� Cute Charlie Brown balloons at the school assembly. I'll bet you can buy them on Amazon soon.� When I was in high school, I played the little red-haired girl. Nope, no lines. I just sat there on the stage while Charlie Brown did all the work. I pretended to pick my nose and eat my boogers ...and stole the scene. Ha ha� Linus plays Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata , which my mother used to play on the piano while I was growing up.� Fans of Minions will get a kick out of the overly dramatic Snoopy and the sounds he makes.� Keep watching during the closing credits.Things I didn't like:� It's so true to its source material that it feels unimaginative. We've seen it before.� Paying extra for 3D is not necessary.� Some children who are used to sophisticated animation nowadays may think the simple animation design of the peanuts is too...simple.� It's weird that so many of the Peanuts characters are balding as young children, right?� There aren't very many really funny lines.Funny lines: � \"Is there an emoji for good grief?\" - Charlie Brown� \"Can a brother and sister get a divorce?\" - Sally (Charlie Brown's sister). She kind of reminds me of Lisa from the The Simpsons Movie .Tips for Parents:� The language gets as bad as \"Rats!\" and \"Good Grief!\" How refreshing. It's sweet and innocent.�",

The animation and pacing is ok, but don't expect humor or story elements to keep you entertained as an adult. This movie really is mean't mostly for kids. It's definitely more a kids' movie than a family movie. It's well done-don't get me wrong. And in many ways aspects of the animation surpassed my expectations. The problem is that I felt it was a little simplified for Peanuts. Yeah Peanuts is simple and kid friendly, but like most good cartoons there's a bit more depth to it. Hollywood has had a bit of a record for make child characters more obnoxious, insecure, and spastic than they need to be. Some of it is probably based on truth, but I feel it was mean't to keep little kids' attention. When I read Peanuts as a kid and teen, I never quite imagined the kids as being so spastic, but more slow and deliberate in their manner, usually more calm. I guess you got to fit the day and age you live in. The best parts were, and IMO always will be, Snoopy. Beautifully animated, simple but ok story, voice acting was ok but the scripted mannerisms were a bit much, and snoopy's adventures tying in with the story was actually quite funny.",

Many of Mr. Schultz's early comic panels are referenced in this film, which brought back a flood of memories from my early childhood. This is a terrific film that I was skeptical about after seeing the trailer, but turned out to be a winning script with fabulous animation.",

    "review": "  The Peanuts Movie est le meilleur hommage qu'on ait pu faire � l'oeuvre de Charles Schulz. Le film de Steve Martino est simple, franchement adorable et surtout extr�mement dr�le. Visant un public familial, le film ne quitte jamais l'esprit du strip et ne tente pas de moderniser son humour avec des r�f�rences � la pop-culture qui auraient �t� malvenues et qui vampirisent parfois les films d'animation. Visuellement splendide, il tient tout de m�me � raconter une longue histoire et � ne pas tomber dans la suite de sketches (m�me si le premier quart d'heure peut y faire penser). Le casting vocal est remarquable. Un peu plus d'ambition n'aurait pas fait t�che, mais en l'�tat, cette adaptation est parfaitement acceptable.",

    "review": "  There is a whole generation of children out there right now who have been raised on Superhero or comic book movies. When I was child the trend was there unfortunately the results were often mixed for every Blade there was The Phantom, for every Batman there was The Shadow. Good films mixed with Turkeys. Then the comic boom happened at the end of the 20th Century in the year 2000 X-Men paved the way and today we get around up to three or four superhero movies in one year guaranteed depending on how many studios are putting their films out.You may ask what the point of stating the obvious is, well my point is that before the boom there was a generation of children born in the late 70s, the 1980s and possibly the early 1990s, who were raised on quality cartoons. One such cartoon was Charlie Brown based on The Peanuts comic strip.So over 30 years later Charlie Brown and the peanuts gang are given their just rewards with quite frankly what is a masterpiece of nostalgia and one of the best animated films if not best films of the year.The gang is all back and most if not all get their due, remember Lucy giving psychiatric advice, well it's here charlie brown attempting to kick an American Football only for Lucy to pull it away that's here to, Linus and his blanky. It's all here and it's joy to behold. There is very little action in this movie out with Snoopy's fantasy scenes and even they are genuinely entertaining.Unfortunately today's children may end up being bored by this film due to the lack of things going boom, but those children who are more inclined will have fun. In the end a film which will appeal to both adults and children if they let it.",

    "review": "  The Peanuts Movie certainly does feel the loss of C. Shulz behind this re-vamped 3D version of the classic cartoon series. And that is perfectly fine. What his son does do is provide a sincere and likeable homage to his father's brilliance, while moving us forward in to (what one can hope) is a new era of his legacy. I should be clear, Shulz is a personal hero of mine. If I could choose to travel back to sit down with anyone for an afternoon coffee, it would be him. He was ahead of his time, and his personal story, which was written all over the Peanuts characters, is heartbreakingly honest and real. He understood depression, he understood anxiety, and he understood inadequacy, all struggles that have grown ten fold in recent years. For anyone who read up on the ambitions of his son in tackling this tailor made for a modern audience version, you will know the amount of time and effort he gave to keeping his father's legacy alive in the final product. This means we feel his loss, for certain, but also means we can celebrate the memory. And that, at least for me, is something of a gift. The first minutes of the film is a breathless nod to this legacy that moves us briskly through a number of classic references to running gags, moments and trademarks. It culminates in a scene from the previews in which the entire gang is standing by a fence and Chuck declares that his luck has finally changed. It is at this precise moment that the entire fence falls down and we are invited on that all too familiar journey where Charlie Brown, inadequacies and all, must come to term with his own feelings of failure. This opening sequence is intended to remind us that even if Charle's strand of hair is jumping out at us iin full (and kind of oddly creepy) 3D mode, we should feel right at home with the gang we remember. The actual story of the Peanuts movie is admittedly could have shed a few minutes of screen time, and (without giving away the plot) wraps up a bit too neatly (a product of the length). But this is recognizably minor and subjective, as there is a ton to enjoy along the way. There are clever references to the Christmas specials and the story essentially infuses two complementary lines that includes the flying ace as a symbol of the love story that pushes forward between Charlie Brown and the Red Haired Girl (who is ever so cleverly utilized to mirror Charle's own personal journey). The whole thing is delivered as a nicely wrapped present, but there is definitely something worthwhile that sits underneath the wrapping. What made Shulz specials (and regular series) so compelling and intriguing was that underneath a nice story about a Christmas tree told by two dimensional characters was something darkly honest and human. There is a moment where Charlie Brown is sitting in the principle's office, and the kid next to him asks why he is there, to which he responds, \"Why am I here? I have a serious case of inadequacy.\" There is an equally revealing moment (one deftly handled by the Shulz script) at the 5 cent psychiatrist stand where we are invited in to the depths of Charle's despair. This despair is symbolized by the scene (again, in the preview) where Charlie Brown is standing at the door of the Red Haired Girl's home, unable to bring himself to ring the door bell. In the final sequence of the film we find ourselves back at this door, only this time Charle's is trying to apply the learnings of introspection and emotional healing that he has aquired along the way. I couldn't help but smile in this moment, partly because I see some of myself in that moment, but mostly because there was a kid directly behind me who leaned forward intently and shouted \"you can do it Charlie Brown. Push that button\". To me that was a testimony that Shulz son had successfully bridged the gap between the nostalgic two dimensional memories and the 3D modernized recreation. I hope there is more to come, but if not this film is a nice stand alone gift to fans of the old series and young ones who never had the opportunity to grow up with the series and characters. And for this I say to Shulz, thank you.",

Pero el aspecto m�s importante que debo resaltar sobre esta pel�cula es que ense�a que los valores van por encima de cualquier cualidad que alguien pueda tener. Al final la moraleja de la historia es que cada d�a deber�amos tratar de ser m�s como Charlie Brown. Un ni�o humilde, honesto y valiente :)",

    "review": "  Who doesn't know Snoopy? He is probably one of the most popular cartoon canines around along with Scooby Doo, Pluto & Courage the cowardly. The daily newspaper comic strip of Charlie Brown and friends (AKA The Peanuts) has been around for decades. Created by Charles M. Shulz in the 1950s about a bald headed kid doing his best to get by in life like any other average Joe, seemed to stick with its audience. Schulz passed away in 2000, far too long to see his largely popular foundation to get a big screen treatment. Honestly, I figured it would be a quick cash-in on a nostalgic property, kind of like The Smurfs, the Scooby Doo films, the terrible Marmaduke or more recently, Goosebumps (which was kinda fun actually). I was also afraid they were going to sneak in some innuendos and maybe some childish toilet humor, much in the same sense. I feared the worst for this movie, and I grew up reading the strips & watching the TV specials. The whole idea of taking something from the past is to either bring it to current time or at the very minimum reintroduce it to a new generation as it was when it was originally made from its inception. Schulz did have the classic animated specials for the holidays and even a short-lived TV show, but having it brought to the big screen never felt like it was ever a part of his intentions. Perhaps it never was, but it's safe to say this will not make him roll in his grave. This movie has a charm and feel to it, that very few \"kids\" movies do nowadays. If you are familiar with Charles M. Shulz's work, you will instantly know that this movie was created with pure passion, and was held close to the heart during the whole process. The art direction feels just like the old style hand drawn strips, not like a cheap 3D imitation like other companies do. They invested time and effort into capturing the soul of the characters.Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely! This movie may not be a huge success, but it's coming from a source that really hasn't been hurting, or lacking success. Taking a look at the credits, it is clear as to why this film is as good as it is. First, Steve Martino, the same director of Dr. Seuss' adaptation Horton Hears a Who! (2008), directs it. Secondly, the descendants of the creator himself, Bryan and Craig Schulz were the writers. From that alone there seems to be a decent amount of people who care about this project. The plot is the classic story for new generations that are not familiar with The Peanuts crew. The story follows Charlie Brown (voiced by Noah Schnapp) and his friends who discover a little red-haired girl has moved into their neighborhood & has joined their class. Charlie immediately develops a crush on her, but is frustrated that his long-running streak of bad luck will prevent him from ever getting noticed. Lucy (voiced by Hadley Belle Miller) advises Charlie to try being more confident. Hence Charlie Brown decides to embark upon a series of new activities in hope of finding one that will get the Little Red-Haired Girl to notice him. In a side story, his dog Snoopy (voiced by Bill Melendez), upon discovering a typewriter in a dumpster, decides to write a novel about his alter-ego, the World War I Flying Ace, trying to save his lover Fifi from the Red Baron. He ends up acting out his adventure, coming across the Peanuts gang several times along the way. He successfully defeats the Red Baron and rescues Fifi. However, as he is celebrating his victory with Fifi and his siblings, he learns that the Red Baron has survived, causing him to furiously declare revenge. Anyone who enjoys Snoopy and friends will continue to enjoy how this film takes the things people love about them and runs with it. There are numerous references to other iconic Peanuts moments; the list is long. There's also a lot of new material as well. An example of this is when Charlie Brown ends up becoming the most popular kid in the school and how his life dramatically changes. These different scenarios are important because they put Charlie Brown in new situations probably not even the veterans of the comic have scene. Also, Snoopy's story arc is delightfully written as the allegory to Charlie Brown's life struggle where the Red Baron is Chuck's annoying bad luck that doesn't cease to leave him alone. It's a simple love story, but that's what this film does so well. They provide us with grandeur lessons through straightforward means. In this case Charlie Brown learns about confidence, being true to himself, and perseverance--lessons that can have just as much impact on the adults watching as it does on their children. What the movie does best is provide so much depth to Charlie Brown's character without straying away from the already established depth that we've known him to have throughout the years. It doesn't try to reinvent the characters for a modern world--it appropriately fits this story-arc into the Peanuts canon without disrupting it. Now the movie will not be for everyone. Sure, those with nostalgia for the franchise will immediately love it, newer generations may enjoy the humor that is in there, and for some, it may just be too bland and slow. The only time the film slows down is when the Snoopy story-line comes to a close and finishes with a somewhat lengthy finale. The subplot is actually a fun addition to the movie, since each segment only lasts about 45 seconds, but the climax of it all runs for about 4 minutes and slightly takes away from the momentum of the film. The animation is another solid component to this feature. Headed by senior animator Joseph Antonuccio (Rio), almost every scene flows extremely well. There are areas where the animation looks choppy but this was apparently done on purpose to resemble that of the older films. As long as there's a reason. One thing though that stands out is the 3D texturing on this 2D film and that doesn't mean watching it in 3D either. The fact that Charlie Brown's shoes look like real tangible leather and Snoopy's fur is made up of individual follicles is astounding. The voice actors to this production are well cast and perfectly blend with their animated counter parts. Noah Schnapp as Charlie Brown was perfect, Alexander Garfin as Linus was great, Hadley Belle Miller as Lucy had the best attitude to match, Bill Melendez (if were still alive would've been 99 this year!) voices Snoopy and it's as cute as ever. The list is too long to fully mention but all cast members perform their roles spot on. For writing of various characters they all get a decent amount of screen time too and their own gags. There are times when they do act in ways that seem rather silly but these are children based characters, which makes them gullible so that is acceptable. On the whole, 'The Peanuts Movie' is extremely well-made animated film & does exactly what adaptations should do: be very faithful regardless of current audience, keep it very close to the source, don't try to spice it up with unnecessary additions, and do plenty of callbacks to the original work. Blue Sky does an absolutely phenomenal job transforming the world of Schultz into the computer-animated-obsessed cinematic world we see today. Peanuts has always had a mass appeal, but there do exist people that don't like it. If you don't enjoy it, or even if you adore it, I for one, respect your choices. Give this one a shot, it may surprise you in the end. This is the best Blue Sky has released since the also-faithful Horton Hears a Who and one of the best films of the entire year. Seriously.",

    "review": "  The film brings nothing new to the table except for the Peanuts characters' transition into 3D animation. However, the film is based on a comic strip that run uninterrupted for fifty years and in which its characters had their personalities almost entirely drawn out from the very first moment they first appeared in print; bringing something 'new' might have been downright dangerous. Instead, the film brings out what everyone has come to expect from the Peanuts characters, highlighting each of their unique aspects, taking advantage of the most familiar and ever-present gags, and does so in a way that feels fresh, adapting to a whole new generation without really changing a thing.",

    "review": "  It's not the perfect animated movie, that goes without saying but something about the peanuts movie placed a large grin on my face. I enjoyed that this is probably one of the furthest movie's away from being meta and technologically annoying as one can get. For this film, it works absolutely giving Charles Schulz's legacy a humble but not too ambitious applause. The pacing is a little uneven with the snoopy/red-baron segments and seems to unceasingly draw away from a great focus on Charlie Brown's character (somewhat lurching simple morals into his story as well that don't mesh together healthily). Don't get me wrong, Snoopy and Woodstock were absolutely fantastic in this movie and crisp, classic and styled animation wraps the animal team in a warming bow.",

    "review": "  There's always a dilemma when old classics are given a fresh take on the big screen: they are either too nostalgic or they try too hard and end up losing the original charm.The Peanuts Movie manages to avoid both these problems, instead finding a wonderful balance of sweet nostalgia and fresh energy that comes together in an utterly charming movie.The story is simple enough (I'm not sure what some people might be expecting ?), yet the direction and breezy plot allows the film to flow as if flipping through a collection of the old comic strips. It's a massive feather in the cap of those who brought this production together. The sight gags are funny, the characters are sweet and likeable as always and there's just enough of the self-aware Charlie Brown's pondering to keep adult fans entertained.Treated with the highest respect, Charles M. Shulz's original work truly is delivered with new vibrancy. It'll be a kid's favourite and Christmas classic for years to come.Very, very good (\"grief\"). 4 stars.",

    "review": "  Written by the younger generation of Schulz, the classic animation sticks nearly to its original source materials and remains traditional style of telling a simple yet unambitious story that is friendly for kids. Diverting from the main genre usually seen in Disney's style, Blue Sky Studio approaches by representing the entire story in a group of kiddos without any significant adults characters and relationship between the parents and children. The story is mainly separated into two parts - the first part on the main protagonist, Charlie Brown is very educable and absolutely suitable for the maturer young audiences while the fantasy part of Snoopy that is full of actions and adventure would definitely serve as great enjoyment for the kids. The combination of colorful CGIs and the unique visual effects are spectacular, charming, adorable and it looks as an upgrade from the comic version. Overall, this remake is definitely a delightful, sweet, warmhearted and nostalgic family fare that stresses on the importance of looking and cherishing at the positive values that each person owns.",

    "review": "  Charlie Brown may be the most famous sad sack in animation, but this feature sees him attempting to overcome his sense of inadequacy on a quest for self-improvement. This is in the hopes of impressing the Little Red-Headed Girl that he's too scared to talk to, but the episodic structure of the movie leaves plenty of room for Linus' blanket fixation, Lucy's psychiatric practice, Schroeder's Beethoven fixation, Snoopy's eternal struggle against the Red Baron, and many of the other famous motifs of Charles Schulz's long-running newspaper strip (as well as the dozens of animated specials and films that have adapted this property over the past six decades). One could tell that this movie's creative team held its source material in a reverent place even if they were unaware that Schulz's son and grandson have screenplay credits; most of The Peanuts Movie's detractors seem to feel that the film plays it a little too safe with the Charlie Brown and Snoopy formula. Regardless, The Peanuts Movie is a charming, endearing, and gently humorous effort that proves how relevant its characters still are.",

    "review": "  The Peanuts Movie is based on the comic strip by Charles M. Schulz's . It also has its TV series and its five movies including this one which I am going to talk about. So in this movie, Charlie Brown is not having a good time in life. He screws up at everything. Can't fly a kite, as usual. Can't pitch. So things are not going good, until one day, this new kid who is a girl comes to his neighbourhood, comes to his school. And now Charlie Brown is in love with this girl, and all he wants is to impress her. When I saw the trailer to this movie, I knew it has some potential. The layout is updated. It just looked perfect. But...when it comes to kids movies based on something, you are pretty uncertain. For example, The Smurfs. Quite a sloppy movie. But the good news is the same thing did not happen to this movie. This is literally, one of the best animated movies of this year. It's fun, It's funny, and it is so respectful to the original source material. And also, it tries its best not to be so over the top. If you known The Peanuts, it tells a pretty basic story, and also with a lesson without getting you bored. Here you got a story about the little dude going after this girl. he is all bummed out. He doesn't really know what to do. Then he goes to Lucy, the counselor who charges him 5 cents for advice. It's just some fun stuff. Also, the love interest in this film, the movie doesn't show her face in the start of the film. She always had her face covered. They did the same thing in the trailer, and I find that to be lovely. However, once they show her the girls face, they then cover her again, and then show her face again, and then they cover it again. That is the thing I don't really get. What I also really like is that since this movie is released in 2015, you see kids playing outside Today, kids would either watch TV or play video games, or on the internet. The movie never tells us what year this movie take place, but they could just easily annoy us by modernizing the film. All of the peanuts are great, but Snoopy and Woodstock, oh my goodness. These guys stole the show. These guys are the funniest. There is this subplot where Snoopy is flying on his doghouse hunting down a barren, and it's pretty cool. They got sound recording from Bill Melendez, the man who play Snoopy and Woodstock in the original, even though he is not alive today. How cool is that?This whole movie is cool, and pretty heart warming and sweet. Definitely check this one out. There is nothing much to complain. The movie also take up some traits from the original like Charlie Brown and his kite, Snoopy kissing Lucy, etc. It's all fun. This is a movie that kids will enjoy. And if you an old man who just want your childhood back, go for it, man. And if you are not familiar with The Peanuts, still check this one out, this is a great introduction for you. One of the greatest of the year.",

That said, there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes or so of your life. The Peanuts Movie, thankfully, does not besmirch the wonderful memories we likely all have of the characters and the strips(and credit must be given to Charles Schulz' son and grandson who helped write the script). However, I'm not sure why they felt it was necessary to include 3D...it adds very little, if anything, to the whole experience.

    "review": "  The long-awaited big screen return of Charles Schultz's beloved, Peanuts characters pays loving respect to its source material and honors his legacy, introducing Charlie Brown and Snoopy to a whole new generation of children after 35 years out of the spotlight! The biggest praise I can give this film is for the gorgeous 3D animation that is intentionally down-graded to look and feel like the style of the old cartoons and it works amazingly well for young and old viewers. The gang is all represented well, though Snoopy definitely takes center-stage and he easily steals the film from Charlie Brown with his ridiculous antics and vivid imagination. The story is the weakest aspect which is basically broken down into 3, Charlie Brown episodes stitched together by his attempts to impress a new classmate/neighbor and at times feels disjointed. Also included is the famous Red Baron sequences with Snoopy on his doghouse squaring off against the plane, though I feel they could've cut one of those scenes out as there's a bit too much focus on them. That aside, this is a wonderfully fun and clean animated family film that doesn't modernize the material with pop songs and social media and it actually might remind kids that it's fun to play outside! There is a hilarious lack of adults portrayed in the film, even by Charlie Brown standards, but it's part of the fun watching these characters fend for themselves.",

    "review": "  Twentieth Century Fox Animation that brought us Ice Age and a short featuring Scrat in space as the opening act reintroduces the Peanuts gang in 3D. Throughout the years of Peanuts specials the cast has regularly been replaced to keep the voices sounding young. The music at the school dance and the fact that Charlie Brown takes a bin of recycling out to the curb at his house are some of the few modern touches that I noticed. The characters don't suddenly use cell phones. Snoopy writes his own hero story fighting the Red Baron of WWI. From his doghouse fighter-plane he must save the poodle Fifi (Kristin Chenoweth is the one celebrity attached to this project). Charlie Brown gets all flustered over his new crush, the Little Red-Haired Girl. This movie is like Linus' comfy blanket. Pretty much every part of the story and the relationships between the characters have been done before. There is nothing new except the 3D animation. The point is that there are still universal themes that modern kids can identify with in Charles M. Schulz's creation. Parents and grandparents get a throwback experience. From what I observed Thanksgiving week at the multiplex, kids were laughing and into it too.",

    "review": "  The \"funnies\" were my favorite part of Sunday breakfast. For me, Peanuts was the highlight of the section. Charlie Brown and the gang always were up to some hi-jinks and I loved being a part of their adventures. The Peanuts Movie was a nostalgia driven film that was able to capture the magic of the comic strip and the TV specials. A lot hasn't changed since the last time since we saw old Chuck. He is still the butt of most of his classmates jokes and always finds a why to embarrass himself in public. This time a little red head girl moves in the neighborhood and Charlie falls for her. Charlie must dig down deep and find his confidence before the school year ends. The Peanuts Movie is a film that all ages can enjoy. It's crazy to think that my own parents grew up with Peanuts too. Now a third generation can experience Schulz's classic characters. It's nice to know that movies are still being made for kids that has heart and intelligence. Many children films nowadays rely on brain-less entertainment that use fart jokes for cheap laughs. The Peanuts Movie is better than that. Some of the best moments include Snoopy vs. The Red Barren. I loved the comic strips based off their epic rivalry and I can only say things are as heated between them as ever before. The Peanuts Movie is a real treat for all ages and my second favorite cartoon of the year behind Pixar's Inside Out. As a character, Charlie Brown teaches us to dream big even when the things are looking down. That's an awesome thing to teach to kids.",

Anything but cynical, this film is immensely likeable, genuinely funny and heart-warming and will have you cheering for Charlie Brown by the end. My only curiosity with this film is that I don't believe it was made for most children today or at the very least, the children that Hollywood thinks will eat up the likes of Transformers etc. In fact compared to that particular image, this film offers up some interesting contrasts. There are no computers, smartphones, LCD's or anything like that in sight! The kids still use old rotary phones! And as much of a hermit as I am now, man these kids get outside! This film really is the opposite of all these cash grab remakes! If you get a chance to, go check this one out. It's a really sweet ride from start to finish. I give this 4.5 'Good Griefs!' out of 5.",

    "review": "  Although my only experience with the 65 year old Peanuts comic strip has been recieving a Snoopy toy as my first Happy Meal toy, I still think that this is one of the most beautiful animated films of the year.Much like 2008's Horton Hears A Who!, Blue Sky Studios have done a fantastic job in keeping true to the spirit of the strip and the holiday specials, from the paintly character design breaking new grounds in CGI looking more like traditional animation, the use of archive voice footage of the late Bill Melendez as Snoopy and Woodstock, and all the offscreen adults speaking in trumbone language which is not suprising after hearing about the huge amount of creative control the Shultz family had over the screenplay.I aslo really like how Charlie Brown character arc of his constant failures never once resrts to selfishness even after geeting good chances and I also enjoy the sub-plot with Snoopy's battle with the Red Baron even if in narrative terms, it doesn't really strenghten Charlie's story.Overall, this wonderul film is great for all ages, gives Peanuts fans something to be proud of and ends the pre Force Awakens' film year on a high note.",

The plot consist of the disadvantageous Charlie Brown trying to put his past embarrassments behind him in order to Impress the \" Little Red Haired Girl\" the new girl on the block. As you can probably guess Charlie Brown suffers multiple inopportune scenarios keeping him from his goal. This movie is already on my list as one of the best movies of 2015, the new child voice actors are perfectly cast and are great successors to the previous cast, the archival footage of the late Bill Melendez as Snoopy and Woodstock are a nice touch to the film, and the story and visuals are modern without straying to far from the original cartoon. Speaking of visuals this is the prettiest films I've seen in a long time. The CGI is styled to resemble Schulz's crude line style and perspectives, however the glowing pastel color pallet in this film allows the characters and scenery to pop like the never have before. This is fantastic family fun entertainment everybody will enjoy. I can't wait till it comes out on DVD. 5/5 stars",

Besides the pathetic lovey dovey half a** crap of a story-line that pretty much does nothing but send all the wrong messages. (i will spare you the details) The bottom line is this movie really ruins the classic appeal of the Peanut's name. Who doesn't like snoopy and his pals?

    "review": "  Bringing a beloved franchise out of near complete dormancy, The Peanuts Movie has the right amount of charm and humor for children, their parents, and yes, even their grandparents. (Charlie Brown is HOW old?!) This latest take on the comic strip turned cartoon utilizes a brisk pace and a 3-D animation style that cleverly appears to be a hybrid between hand drawn animation and modern digital trickery. It's not, but the presentation almost fooled me. The plot doesn't take us in any new directions, but it doesn't need to. The movie packs in as many references to the Peanuts franchise as it can, sending Charlie Brown on a mad quest to impress a certain redhead, and showcasing that Snoopy and Woodstock still win at life. The older films exuded a somewhat morose and somber feel that centered on lonely children and their experiences with failure. The Peanuts Movie largely ditches that for a more cheerful experience that succeeds in actually allowing that blockhead Charlie Brown to grow as a character and have an arc. I personally despised the placement of modern music in a Peanuts movie, and a lot of the slapstick humor could have been left on the cutting room floor. But whatever. It's a well-crafted children's movie that will probably best serve as a rental or a purchase for long-time fans of these near timeless characters.",

Rather, it is a celebration of what we love so much about these stories: the unforgettable characters, the story situations which have become a staple of The Peanuts, the excellent humor, and the innocent joyfulness. The Peanuts Movie captures this, and therefore is an amazing celebration of what made Charles Schulz's work so amazing. It's an example of simplicity being a good thing, and the sweet, innocent nature of it makes it maybe not the best movie of the year, but certainly one of the most delightful ones of the year.

At a time when visual gags and high-paced action seem to be the preferred route to a child's brain, this movie takes the opposite path. It is thoughtful, entertaining, and definitely satisfying on many levels. On top of that, both my 7-year-old and my 4-year-old thoroughly enjoyed it (and sat through the whole thing...that's saying something for the 4-year-old!!).It retains much of the original charm of the comic strip and various peanuts specials while also providing something better. The animation is smart, clean, and yet it's created in such a way that it feels almost like it was hand-drawn. And the story neatly fits the most memorable pieces of the comic strip into a modest length movie (little read-headed girl, the Red Baron, various character pieces)... AND makes it fit nicely together. They offset each other so that a 90-minute Peanuts film which COULD have been a disaster become not just palatable, but enjoyable.The three of us loved this movie. I highly recommend it!",

    "review": "  I honestly never thought I'd see this. A full length theatrical film of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and the rest of the Peanuts characters 15 years after the passing of creator Charles Schultz. I also didn't think I'd ever see a studio dare use 3D computer animation over the traditional hand drawn comic strip style. And I didn't think it would be as good as it ultimately did.I'm a huge Peanuts fan, ever since I first saw the famous Christmas special when I was around four years old. The varied personalities and laid back relatable stories set it apart from most cartoons I watched back then. Many feared a new CG film would change the tone of what the franchise was (like what has happened with The Smurfs) and thankfully those justifiable fears have been put to rest because this is as pure a Charlie Brown story as I could have hoped for.One can call this a Peanuts greatest hits collection and they'd be right, but that isn't a weakness of the film. Much like several Peanuts specials I've seen before, this film takes many popular gags from the comic strip and put them together as part of a bigger main story. The main story here is Charlie Brown trying to get the attention of the little red haired girl who just moved in next door to him and prove that he is a true winner. But of course poor Charlie Brown always has the worst luck. What I loved seeing was that Charlie always seems to come up short, but it's not due to contrived circumstance, reckless thinking, or an antagonist getting in his way. A lot of time it's from Charlie just being a good person and doing what he feels is the right thing at the cost of him gaining any popularity. One scene involving his sister, Sally, got me rather chocked up.But wait! Snoopy has his own story going on. Or more like his own fantasies. While he is helping Charlie with his struggles with the new girl, Snoopy takes those situations and applies them to a romance novel he's writing that showcases him as World War 1 fighter pilot hero, The Flying Ace, trying to win the affection of a fellow pilot named Fifi and finally taking down his arch nemesis, The Red Baron. The Flying Ace scenes are really fun albeit a bit overused. Would have like to see more of the supporting kid characters interact and trim down the Red Baron stuff a little. And the animation in this movie is totally hypnotic. I've seen it twice and I just want to watch it again just for the animation style alone. It is 3D computer animation, but it still feels like the old cartoons. The frame rate is lowered to give a more 2D flow and the facial expressions have a strong hand drawn style. It's new yet very familiar. There isn't any other animated film that looks quite like it. Even the music is mostly faithful to the original shorts. Vince Guaraldi's score plays throughout. There a few pop songs in there, but they have the appropriate sound and tone.This is definitely one of the better animated films I've in the past few years and is great way to introduce the kids of today to the Peanuts franchise as well as pleasing older fans like myself. And be sure to stay during the credits.Score: 8.5/10",

    "review": "  Terrible, soulless Peanuts movie. It was wrong in so many ways. First of all, Charles Schultz was always able to carry Peanuts on the storyline and characters alone. This is what gave Peanuts it' charm, in contrast to things like Looney Tunes. The production staff at Blue Sky Pictures however didn't \"get\" this as cartoonish effects were abused during most of the movie, for example there were way too many \"Red Baron\" scenes and the total stupidity of the \"War and Peace\" chase and the \"summer vacation\" part at the end which were totally overdone. The sets were terrible too. The original Peanuts backgrounds have split level houses, 60s modern furniture and beautifully painted trees. In the 1970s cartoons, the backgrounds and sets are one of the most wonderful inspiring parts of the experience, having surely been drawn by someone with watercolor or architectural rendering skills. The sets in this film lacked all inspiration, with almost no trees, boring houses and ridiculous rolling green fields as if the characters were living on a golf course. The story line was completely unbelievable too. Charles Schultz never insulted our intelligence in the ways this movie did, with sappy sentimentality or events and action that could never take place, for example the school \"award ceremony\". My recommendation to the movie makers and the public - watch some of the orignal films such as \"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving\" (1973), read the original comics, and forget about this film.",

    "review": "  The legacy of Charles Schulz's Peanuts characters have lived on for decades. It was only inevitable we'd be seeing a rebirth of the series with computer animation, and it was absolutely perfect. Blue Sky took me by surprise by flawlessly capturing the spirit of the Charlie Brown saga, without taking any advantage of current day reboot tropes like over the top plots and unnecessary innuendos. And the artistic style they've chosen with that somewhat \"choppy\" 2D look drives it home. Even the writing does the film justice, staying true to the source material with not only the story line, but the scripting as well! The whole movie feels the way a Charlie Brown special should, with the right amount of laughs, and the right amount of truly real moments. These are kids growing up in a very big world, and the film completely gets that. It's a beautiful film, that not only satisfies those who grew up with the gang, but also the newest generation of children, who will find this current adaptation something fascinating, with its colorful cast of timeless characters, and unforgettable lessons in life, no matter how big or small the situations may seem. It's innocence in its purest form, with its ultimate ingredient being integrity, and that's what makes The Peanuts Movie the grade A timeless film it deserve to be. Schulz I'm quite positive would be very proud.",

    "review": "  When I first heard of the Peanuts franchise being turned into a CGI animated film by BlueSky studios, I had mix feelings. I am not a big fan of Blue Sky studios since most of there films are knock offs of Dreamworks animated films. I felt that the studio was going to destroy the Peanuts franchise since they are owned by Fox, who previously ruined memorable cartoon franchise like Alvin and the Chipmuck and the upcoming Secrets of NIMH reboot. So I went to see the film with all my relatives on Thanksgiving day and came out of the theater with a smile. The Peanuts Movie is probably the second best animated feature film I have seen this year besides Inside Out. The film managed to say true to its source material without making any pop culture references. They show kids going outside instead of playing on there Apple product, that is something that not animated films would do now theses days. The story is a typical Charlie Brown story that every old or new fans will enjoy and relate to. This kid tries everything he wants to accomplish whether its is test or flying a kite, but always fail; however, he never gives up. This is a perfect role model character for the younger audiences to follow. Snoopy is the comedic relief of the film, but always support Charlie Brown through his struggles of talking to the Little Red Hair girl, who is the love interest of the movie. The Little Red Hair girl is just a character that motivates the main character, which doesn`t give her a lot of personalty. The rest of the character don`t have a lot to do with the movie, but they are still iconic Peanuts characters to see on screen. For example; Lucy is the typical bitch who makes fun of Charlie Brown, Linus is the wise kid who enjoys sucking his thumb and holding his blanket, Sally is the supporting sister, Peppermint Patty and Marcie are the tomboy and bookworm best friend, Schroeder is the musician who enjoys playing his piano and so many more characters that are easily likable. The voice acting in this movie is perform by actual kids and its actually not bad. Another thing I praise about the voice acting is bringing back the old voice recordings of Bill Melendez as Snoopy and Woodstock. The animation is a perfect upgrade to the Peanuts design since it stays true to its source material from the comics and TV specials. If this film was done in 2D animation, I would still enjoy the animation no matter what design that the film is going towards. If there is two problems that the film has to offer is the Snoopy segments. I thought they focus too much on that part of the film instead of the actual movie about Charlie Brown. I would love to see more of the other Peanuts character than the Snoopy flying segments. The other nitpick I have is some of the writing in the film is rehashing the main source material from the Peanuts TV special. I still enjoy the writing, but I think the film use too much of the homage writing deliver to this film. Overall, The Peanuts Movie is a great movie for the whole entire family. Even non-fans could still enjoy this movie. I wish Blue Sky studio could make more original films like the Peanuts movie, but where still stuck to the never ending movie franchise, Ice Age.",

I love the effect of having high resolution, high frame rate background elements, while using hand drawn elements and limiting the framerate of the characters. It created a very unique look and made the movie feel familiar. The story was well written, and dealt with more mature themes than animated movies typically deal with. The jokes were smart and intellectually stimulating for the adults, while at the same time being visually stimulating for the kids.The sense of humanity and humor in the movie was surprising. I just wish there were more fart jokes.",

    "review": "  As I sit there watching the recent Peanuts Movie a thought occurs to me: Would I have liked this better if I was younger? While I am writing this review I realize that I as a College age adult I'm really not in the intended age audience for this film but I'll have it be no secret that I still enjoy children's films. I even still love the Charles Schulz Peanuts strips. But as for the Peanuts Movie, I wanted to like it more than I did coming out of it and it is certainly one of those movies where I feel that if you liked it, good for you I totally understand why, but I can say the exact same thing if you told me that you didn't like it. There's certainly enough to like in the film. The gags involving Snoopy and Woodstock are funny, there's some great physical comedy as well, Charlie Brown is his normal, loveable loser self, and the film is visually stunning. Perhaps stunning is an understatement. Every single frame of this movie is done in a sort of CGI approximation of Claymation, but what makes it so pleasing to look at is that every single thing in the movie has remarkable texture work done to it and is modeled to a way that mimics the distinctive Charles Schulz style but in 3D, in fact the film mixes bits of this with actual hand drawn segments that look as if they could have been drawn by Schulz himself. Unfortunately the fact is that the film is amazing to look at, perhaps not so much to watch.For all the laughs I had with the segments involving Snoopy and Woodstock and Charlie Brown, the rest of the film is a series of misadventures and arcs that unfortunately usually follow the same turn of events: something good happens to Charlie Brown and we get hopeful and then something bad happens to him that brings him down again. All these arcs seem to last about 20 minutes or so which makes the film seem like a compilation of a TV show that I never watched. In fact if I didn't know any better I might guess that it might have been the original idea or might be the idea for this film to serve as the pilot for a new Peanuts TV show. It certainly feels like an origin story at times, what with long running gags from the strip getting their setups all at the same time or nearly every single one of the film's dozens of characters being addressed by name as they get what feels like their mandatory 20 seconds and lines in. It's not a totally irredeemable story, just one that kind of feels like a rushed first draft.I don't want to spoil the ending too much but all I'll say is that, as strange as it may seem to say this, it doesn't feel like Charlie Brown should get the happy ending he gets in this film. This is not because he's a bad person, in fact he's a very good person in the movie. It's more because of how out of line from the way that the movie treats him as the butt of jokes and having all his hopes and dreams crushed throughout the movie. Plus at times it seemed like the movie was trying to make me believe that some other ending was going to happen and I was actually kind of looking forward to that, but after a while I had to accept that the movie was going to go in the direction it was going.But even beside the story problems there are still plenty of questionable decisions from the filmmakers that leave me scratching my head. The aforementioned visual style is great but some of the animation alternates between fluid animation and this near stop motion and it takes me out of the movie for a second with how jarring it is. It's kind of like when you're playing a video game and suddenly the framerate dips due to too much activity. This may very well have been a problem with the digital print of the movie or the theater itself but it would not shock me to find out this is the same in every print. Then there are the other questionable decisions, like the extremely questionable one to add contemporary music to a film that if not for these bits of the soundtrack would seem like a period piece set in the 1950s or whatever timeless period that the long running comic strip was set in. Another questionable one was to have so many gags and jokes be repeated verbatim from the numerous comics, TV shows, movies, specials, etc. that make up the long running Peanuts franchise. When I paid money to see the Peanuts Movie I was kind of under the impression that I would be seeing a movie in the style of the Peanuts franchise, not the Peanuts franchise in movie form.I do realize that this may make it sound as if I thought it was a bad film when that really isn't the case. I can't really say that I liked the film and I can certainly think of more things that I didn't like about it than otherwise, but I wouldn't call it a bad film. I'd more or less call it a mixed bag of a film. It's charming enough and it's funny at a lot of times but it's a movie with plenty of questionable decisions that don't really pay off as well as the filmmakers thought they would. I will say this though: If you have kids in your family take them to see it because they will love it, and I do realize that you can say that about just about any film for kids but this is a really good film for the kids to watch because it's charming and funny and loveable enough at times that it really does feel like it belongs as a part of the Peanuts library. Perhaps, it might be sad to say, I'm just too old for it.6/10",

The movie also throws a lot of references back to the comic strips that would be missed by those who only watch the holiday specials.Those who fear that this will be a cheap attempt at a money grab should be very, very pleased. Yes, it is a lot of what we know with nothing particularly new; but the presentation makes it worthwhile.

So, I was nervous to see how Blue Sky Studios would handle this classic brand. It could have gone one of two ways. It could have been a funny and sweet rendition that pays homage to the original comics and TV specials. On the other hand, it could have been a CGI-washed mess made to make money off of a well known brand. Luckily, it falls into the first category!The Peanuts Movie was like a full-length Peanuts special. There's not real story or character development. It was many skits around a single general idea strung together. However, it worked very well! Though clich�d and predictable, the story is always fun and often hilarious!The writing is fantastic. I found myself laughing at the dialogue and the classic slap-stick comedy. All of the Peanuts characters are just as you remember them! I also really enjoyed the extremely fast pace. The animation is utterly gorgeous. It was a mix of the classic 2D Charlie Brown style with a modern twist! It blended the CGI with actual 2D animation seamlessly! My only flaws with The Peanuts Movie were in the story. Though it was fun, I wasn't completely invested in anything that was going on. I understand that it was a \"kids movie\", but it was like watching many classic Charlie Brown 10-minute specials back to back. Overall, The Peanuts Movie is a hilarious, beautifully animated and very sweet film that pays homage to Shultz's original brand. See it!",

They've done a fine job bringing the world of \"good old Charlie Brown\" and company into modern-day animation. There's a lot of familiarity for long-time fans - the original Vince Guaraldi theme music, the characters, how Charlie Brown's musings are depicted like the line drawings of the original daily comic strip. Some of the jokes are familiar too, but I attribute that more to homage then to lack of originality. I love some of the updating of the sly humor that marked the best of Schulz's classic work, like when Lucy discusses with Charlie Brown how he can be more attractive to girls and asks him, \"Do you have a diversified portfolio?\" Snoopy's antics are just as amusing as always, though I thought the parallel storyline of his romance with \"Fifi\" took up a little too much of the movie. Also, the main storyline of Charlie Brown's struggles to make his feelings known to the \"little red-haired girl\" is a little too familiar. Still, there's an awful lot to like about this movie, which is very family friendly (we took our two-year-old granddaughter as her first movie theater experience - she loved it) and respectful to the history and traditions of the Peanuts universe.",

    "review": "  I saw this not too long ago with a friend and I'm only now just getting around to reviewing it. It did a really good job. The leap to 3D animation didn't take away from anything and I love that the powers that be did not choose to modernize it. You do not see Charlie Brown on the internet looking up how to make people like him, you do not see anyone on Facebook or anything. It's just the same as the comics and the cartoons.Is there anything groundbreaking here? No. If you enjoyed the comics and the cartoons you will find yourself at home here. Which is just fine. We didn't need a gritty reboot or a modernization of Charlie Brown and the gang. Everything is just the way we left it.It's also been a long time since I sat in a theatre full of mostly children so that was kind of nice for the atmosphere as well.",

All your favorite characters are here and the story is the same good old Charlie Brown story just on a larger scale. Charlie Brown (Noah Schnapp) has to muster up enough courage to talk to the little red haired girl (Francesca Capaldi). I'm glad that the movie didn't just go the same way that other big budget children movies have gone. With the exception of a few things I still believed I was watching the Peanuts and not some big scheme to make money. But I guess those things have to be addressed. I didn't much like the soundtrack as there was a little bit of modern music when I really would have preferred some Vince Guaraldi instead. But other than that everything here is pretty good. If you're looking for a good kids movie, The Peanuts Movie looks like a pretty good choice to me.",

    "review": "  The Peanuts MovieInitial Reaction: A documentary about nuts?Main Characters Charlie Brown, Lucy van Pelt, Linus Van Pelt, Sally Brown, Schroeder: Some of the kids featured in the comic. They are voiced by Noah Schnapp, Hadley Belle Miller, Alexander Garfin, Mariel Sheets, and Noah Johnston.Plost Summary It is wintertime, and the kids are getting ready for the holidays (that is after they get through the school year before that). Charlie Brown is trying his best to be a \"winner\", but every time he does something like pitch a baseball or go skating, it all goes wrong. And when a really cute redheaded girl moves in next door, Charlie Brown gets a big time crush on her. But he's too shy to ask her out - and he thinks she wouldn't go with him because he's not a \"winner.\" Still, his dog, Snoppy, tries his best to get him to overcome his shyness. And there are a few events - like a dance and a assembly meeting - where Charlie Brown can show that he really is someone special.SCORINGMain Characters The makers of the film follow the comic book and the TV specials to a T. They show off all the quirkiness of Charlie Brown, his family and his classmates. We get to bossy Lucy, the musical Schroeder and the boy who just can't catch a break, Charlie Brown. SCORE: 9Supporting Cast The rest of the gang is just as memorable as they were in the TV shows/comic strip. This is probably the only time I want to hear some nonsensical mumbling from the adults. SCORE: 9Plot This film has a great start, but it feels like a run on sentence. First something happens, then we get another event, followed by another event - with not much development of character And the sub plot about Snoopy's fighter pilot double fighting off the Red Baron was fun, but it dragged on a bit. SCORE: 7Originality If you've seen the comic or the TV shows, then you're in for a treat - this film will be familiar to you. If not, then this film still can be fun to watch - even if it visits themes that have been done in other films with kids going to school. SCORE: 7Violence Factor The only really scary parts are with Snoopy's fighting ace pilot. He gets into dogfights with invisible enemies, and gets shot down. But how does he walk away from such a crash? SCORE: 7Other Moral Issues This film has a innocent crush at the center of it - and it stays innocent. And it does a very good job of showing what actually makes for a decent person. SCORE: 9Final Score (out of 60): 48 % Score: 80%It may have a story that goes on for too long, but the Peanuts gang shows us why they are still entertaining even after all these years.",

    "review": "  Brilliantly re-introducing the legendary Peanuts gallery to a whole new generation of Lucies and Linuses, this touching colorful Movie smartly doesn't throw out the Brown with the bath water. Instead of going cynical and cutting edge, the latest adventures of Charlie and Snoopy perfectly nail the heart and humor of Charles Schultz, connecting with nostalgia as if it were the football that our pint-size hero finally gets to kick. Indeed, The Peanuts Movie ends up to be the furthest thing from a \"dark and stormy night.\" In this G-rated animated family flick, Snoopy embarks upon his greatest mission as he takes to the skies to pursue their arch-nemesis, while his best pal Charlie Brown begins his own epic quest back home. In an era when potty humor, fully automatic zingers, and overly syrupy messages get fired at the audience from characters moving faster than Ricochet Rabbit on a cocaine binge, it says a lot that this flick plays out nice and easily as opposed to fast and furiously. This is not to say that it's slow-just that it's not overactive and frenetic like the Ice Age series that ironically comes courtesy of the same inspired minds and animation house. Seriously, if select children want that badly for racecar-in-the-red bedlam, they need Ritalin-not Scrat, the Flying Prehistoric Squirrel. Certainly, Peanuts doesn't lack ambition, it simply fixes up - rather than outright fixes - what isn't broke. With eye-popping computer animation, the movie brings in all of the telltale Schultz hallmarks that made the comic strips and holiday specials (A Charlie Brown Christmas and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown) so enjoyable and indelible. Some slight modern touches (Meghan Trainor sings \"Better When I'm Dancin\") don't do much for the story but they don't exactly detract either. Bottom line: New Kids on the Blockhead",

    "review": "  Nearly 65 years ago, artist Charles M. Schulz created a comic strip called 'Peanuts' that has endured through many generations. Sadly, Schultz has passed to not see 'Peanuts' enter the new millennium, and develop into the modern era of animation. Now, with the help of Blue Sky Studios, the wide cast of characters from 'Peanuts' make a return to theaters in a new movie called \"The Peanuts Movie\". Featuring characters like Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Schroeder, Snoopy and more, the film does a magnificent job at recreating its comic origins, as well as maintaining the simplistic charm that defined it. \"The Peanuts Movie\" is a fantastic adaptation of familiar characters with modern animation to showcase the process of how charming and memorable time as made them.The story has Charlie Brown (Noah Schnapp) trying to impress The Little Red-Haired Girl (Francesca Capaldi), even though he does not have the complete social skills to talk to her. Charlie Brown does his best to win her heart, but to no avail, unfortunately. With the help of his trustful dog Snoopy (Bill Melendez archives), Charlie Brown must discover who he truly is, and find out what it means to stand up for yourself.\"The Peanuts Movie\" is a brilliant representation of the works that Schulz did. The characters are the ones everyone knows and loves, and they are represented well here. Charlie Brown is the lovable loser, Lucy is the bossy one, Linus is the supportive friend, Snoopy is the loyal dog companion, and so on. The music has a nice tone to the sweet nature that the comic strips provided, and even includes a few selections from some of the specials that 'Peanuts' have done- most notably, \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" bringing up some familiar tunes. But really makes the film worth the price of admission is the story, and the animation.Let's start with the animation. Blue Sky Studios has been known for a more realistic cartoonish style when it comes to their movies. But with \"The Peanuts Movie\", co-writers and producers Craig and Bryan Schulz- the son and grandson of Charles Schultz- working on this movie, we have gotten a very memorable animated film. The art style mimics that of Schulz, and even though the movie is done in CGI, it almost looks like a 2D animated film. The talented team behind this movie definitely deserves praise as they did an outstanding job recreating the style of the work of Schulz.Now, let's move on to the story. The story provided in the movie is simplistic in nature, and in spirit to what the 'Peanuts' comic strip was all about: providing the inside outlook in the mind of a child. Plus, the movie has a simple lesson that kids would understand very easily. This is a good story for an otherwise great movie.There is, however, one minor problem with the story, and that is wishing for a little more sarcastic humor that the comic strip was best known for.Good grief, that was a lot! But in conclusion, \"The Peanuts Movie\" wonderfully brings to life the charm and simplistic greatness that Charles M. Schulz provided in his comic strips nearly all those years ago, and this is proof that the legacy has continued. Welcome back Charlie Brown, we've missed you.",

    "review": "  This movie is just plain adorable. It completely and perfectly captures the feel of the classic Peanuts gang in every way. Every frame feels familiar, while managing to feel original. I'm very pleased that they didn't feel the need to \"update\" it for modern audiences. There's no computers or cell phones. Schroder hasn't given up his classical music for hip-hop. Charlie Brown gets tangled up in his phone cord. There's no jokes about Marcy and Peppermint Patty being a lesbian couple. This is classic Peanuts as it's always been and always should be. Unfortunately, for all its classic charm, it also falls a little short on the humor, at least from an adult point of view. It has a few chuckle-out-loud moments, but for the most part, it's \"cute\" more than \"funny.\" Snoopy's Flying Ace sequences are, by far, the best part of the movie. It actually sort of gets a little dull in places.Overall, THE PEANUTS MOVIE is something that I think Charles Schulz would have been proud of. Blue Sky did a superb job paying homage to an American icon and my hat goes off to them for the effort. Well done, folks. THE PEANUTS MOVIE gets a \"See With Your Kids, or Netflix It\" on Talon's Movie Scale.",

    "review": "  The Peanuts Movie is one of my favourite movies I have seen all year. Everything in the movie works and it works exceptionally. It is such a joy to see all the characters on the big screen. There's a really great moment in the beginning, they're all skating and they're in a line and the camera pans by each of them. It's a sort of curtain call as you are reintroduced to each character. All the voice work is terrific. Whoever voiced Linus did a very good job at capturing his voice and his spirit.The scenes with Snoopy are all great. What I love is that it's still the original voice. The man who voiced Snoopy has passed away, but they went and got archived recordings and used them in this movie. Snoopy is always one of the highlights of the Peanuts specials and it's no different here. Every scene he is in he steals. However, the best part of the movie, is the charm it has. The heart. The movie is guaranteed to keep you smiling from beginning to end. There's a real innocence throughout the entire movie and it's so refreshing to see a simple movie that teaches kids great lessons. There's a point in the movie where Charlie Brown is faced with a choice, he could lie and be seen as something he's not, or be honest and lose his sudden popularity and he chooses to be honest, he doesn't even question it! It's so refreshing to see a movie where the character doesn't even question his integrity. The ending of the movie is as perfect as you can get. It tugs at your heart strings and is a perfect example of what the Peanuts is all about. The Peanuts Movie is great for kids and Adults alike. It's a great tribute to the past Peanuts specials we've all seen countless times. It's heartwarming and teaches kids great lessons. It's one of the best movies of the year. If you have not seen it yet, you are doing yourself a disservice. Get out there right now and treat yourself to a wonderful movie.",

The basic story is centered around Charlie Brown thinking that he is nothing (what else is new) but when he meets the new girl next door, he wants to prove to her that he is something, but in typical Charlie Brown fashion, he screws everything up. But, the huge heart this movie has comes through in the end and it ends up a very sweet conclusion to the movie. This will definitely be enjoyed by all ages, big and small.

The only update to the proceedings as probably due to the estates request, the only update is actually animating the film with the latest digital bells and whistles whereas a lot of the characters and surroundings within the story are strictly analog with no cell phones, ipads and the likes showing everyones beloved Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus and Schoerder actually outside playing and interacting with each other without it seeming being dated. The humour and heart is still there and cute as heck as Charlie Brown deals with his normal challenges fitting in, dealing with how to say hi to the new girl, as everyone either cheers him on or strictly says Good Grief. Very enjoyable for new fans as well as the young at heart, and a great counter programming film for the awards prestige season. Awesome",

I saw this film in a theatre filled with little kids who laughed at all of Charlie Brown's failed attempts to gain acceptance by his peers and the attention of the new girl. I'm not a kid, so my adult mind can only guess why Charlie Brown's adventures with insecurity are timeless. Well, Charlie Brown tries hard, and fails every time. The whole world seems to conspire against him, but his honesty and genuine heart makes him a star at the end. We also get to experience the world of Snoopy who is everything we all wish we could be -- talented, creative, funny, and cool. Kids in the audience kept asking their parents about what was going on with Snoopy and his imaginary aerial battles, but they kept laughing along with Charlie Brown the whole time. I think that speaks volumes on what kids relate to... All of us have lived through many mistakes so we totally get Charlie Brown -- we can laugh at ourselves. With Snoopy, he's the adult who knows the answer to everything and can do everything we can't do... Anyway, that's my armchair psychology take on Peanuts.

There are no pop cuture jokes or visual gags used for easy laughs. PEANUTS uses its characters and quiet charm entertanin the audience. This is as much fun for the kids as it is the adults who grew up with it. In the movie's spirit: sometimes, you don't need to change to impress anyone. Grade: A-",

    "review": "  The Peanuts gang was a requirement for the holidays when I was growing up. Each one was better than the last. The Peanuts Movie was a nice continuation of the old cartoons.It had an entertaining story and was pretty funny. There were plenty of different stories to keep the movie going. All the characters were brought back. It only made me laugh out loud a couple of times, but I giggled and smiled through most of it. The voices were excellent. I'm sure they worked hard to get them like that. I didn't like the animation. It looked like they stopped working on it too soon. The Peanuts Movie is worth watching down the road or buying for children so they can watch it repeatedly. Kids in the theater were laughing. I giggled. Parents will probably end up buying it.",

    "review": "  A fantastic family movie that captures the feel and meaning behind Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts comics. The movie centers around Charlie Brown (Noah Schnapp) a kid who just can't catch a break. He's a klutz, he cant fly a kite, he can't play baseball, people consistently make fun of him, etc. Charlie Brown feels a lone in the world, but one day something amazing happens. A new girl with red hair (Francesca Capaldi) moves into town and Charlie Brown see's this as an opportunity to start fresh with someone. Along with his best friend and dog Snoopy (Bill Melendez) Charlie Brown starts to make a new him, but along the way he realizes there's more things important like being yourself that really do matter all along! Overall, great story, great meaning for kids to build up their confidence! I would say at times it really is aimed for younger audiences, so for me I liked the nostalgia of feeling like it was a Peanuts comic strip, but it's still a pretty simple story overall! Definitely, recommend watching this if you have kids, or are a fan of Charlie Brown and Snoopy!",

Peanuts is a pleasant conglomeration of movies and comic strips of yore, mixing retro chalkboards and telephones with music updates by Meghan Trainor. Eschewing the breeding masses, I braved a sticky, popcorn floor and saw the late show in 3D.

By telling a more calm and easy paced story that reminds the audience who these characters are, keeping the animation style of the original Peanuts specials while also executing it in the style of computer animation, and keeping the personalities and charm of all the characters, especially Snoopy and Charlie Brown himself, this film will go down in history as one of the best films based on a cartoon ever!! I was glad to be able to sit through something that reminded me of the joy I had during my childhood watching The Peanuts as well as dancing like Snoopy on my living room couch when I was little!! This will always be one of my favorite animated films ever and also one of the best movies of this year and I hope this is good enough to at least snag an oscar nomination!!",

    "review": "  The Peanuts are a rightfully beloved American fable that have permeated the culture so deeply that one needs not to have ever read a single strip to know of and adore the ill-fated antics of Charlie Brown, his over-achieving dog Snoopy, and their childish gang. The Peanuts Movie is a film version of a smile, capturing with such reverence what we as culture have always loved about Schultz's creation. At its worst moments, it's a passable nostalgia trip for families to take together. At its best, however, it's a cute and gently funny little-kids film with strong morals and a giant heart. It plays very much like a compilation of the daily comic strips strung together by a somewhat loose narrative of Charlie Brown trying to impress the ever allusive Little Red-Haired Girl. It's magically fun spending time in this world, free of adult cynicism, focusing instead on Charlie Brown's own good-natured and childish neuroses. His predictable but sweet arc is like a first coming-of-age story for preshoolers. Each of the other main Peanuts (Snoopy, Linus, Lucy, Peppermint Patty, Schroeder, Pigpen, etc) get their moments, all appropriately charming and faithful.All of this is animated with beauty and such respect for its own history. That respect, at times, is the main real downfall of the whole, at times retreading and calling-back some of the classic jokes and references we all know in a somewhat clumsy way (Does Linus really have to talk about the Great Pumpkin so out of context?). Mostly, though, Peanuts is a truly funny all-ages romp that refreshingly never resorts to cheap innuendos to keep parents engaged. Timeless and absolutely adorable.",

    "review": "  I should start off by saying I didn't grow up loving the Charlie Brown films. We were shown the films and shorts every once in awhile before winter or thanksgiving break in school, but I don't have as many films with these characters in my repertoire as I would like. So I may not have liked it or felt as much nostalgia watching The Peanuts Movie as much as some, but man is this a fun little movie. This film felt just like every single clip or film I have seen with these characters. That's what this film did best, it captured the exact tone and feel of the comic, cartoons, and films. Charlie Brown is always in the wrong place at the wrong time and you get exactly that from this film. The music is there, this time from one of my favorite composers, Christophe Beck. Beck did a great job at setting the mood with the wonderfully simple piano theme.Comparing this to another animated film this year that was aimed towards kid, The Spongebob Squarepants film, The Peanutes Movie outweighs in it every category. It's a smart, sweet, and relatively simple story line that never tries to outreach it's grasp. Plus, this is the perfect time of year for this movie to come out. I think my only complaint would be that the red baron sequences didn't fit as well into the story as I think the writers were hoping. But the animation is surprisingly fantastic, the characters are exactly who they should be, and the story has a really heartwarming touch to it.7.6/10",

I'm so glad I was able to see the film because as a kid growing up in the 70's I would spend hours in the library floor reading the Peanuts strip compilation books. Taking my 2 young girls with me I explained to them what to expect and although they knew little of the characters, I believe they've learned a part of myself and my childhood, reading the Sunday funnies at the dining room table, and getting that warm fuzzy feeling of having a warm puppy laying at the foot of your bed. So yes, this film is a cross-generational heart warming and funny film, and although it's nothing new in terms of what my generation has already seen, the film creates a bond for the kids of today to the values and lessons of the past.",

    "review": "  The Peanuts Movie, for any fan of the world famous comic strip drawn by Charles M. Schulz, is a nostalgic trip down memory lane with plenty of old references and charms to bring a smile throughout 92 minutes.For younger audiences not familiar with Peanuts, this movie can definitely serve as a good introduction. In the first few minutes you can get a good sense of who these characters are and how the interact with certain people.For the older fans, this movie will definitely be a treat. For anyone worried that the 3D animation is too modern, I say that not only does it stay faithful to the original look and feel to the classic animated specials, but it is able to take advantage of the medium in different kinds of ways. This is not a film that is animated like modern 3D animated films; you can tell that they definitely took extra care in the handling of the story, animation, and visual appearance. Within the first moments of the film, I was already getting feelings of nostalgia from all the memories of growing up with Peanuts, and I felt that way constantly throughout the film. The characters is what everyone remembers Peanuts by, and Blue Sky does a very good job of capturing each one's personalities; even most of the voices sound similar to the ones I remember growing up with from \"A Charlie Brown Christmas.\" You can tell Blue Sky took extra care to make sure this film could retain the timeless quality that Peanuts establishes; there are no modern-day references, no rap music, and the kids still write with pencils on paper!Christophe Beck does a fine job for the film's score, which mostly comprises of original score, old favorites from Vince Guaraldi, and a couple of pop songs. I personally did not have an issue with the pop music and felt they did a decent job with the flow of the film.While a very charming film, there are a few things I would nitpick about, most of which involve Snoopy's imaginary scenes with the Red Baron. While I do like the addition of these sequences that coincide with Charlie Brown's story, I felt some parts (especially towards the end) tended to drag on for a bit. I feel the last couple of sequences could have been trimmed down, and the parts where Snoopy is cutting between imagination and reality in other kid's houses, while funny, did not need as many as it did.While the film does not break any extreme new ground, it was definitely a treat to watch. I was smiling from beginning to end just from memories. I recommend this film to anyone that is a Peanuts fan.",

    "review": "  From the studio that brought us the Ice Age franchise comes a movie that is very long overdue: The Peanuts Movie. This film serves as a love letter to Charles Schulz and delivers some of the best family fun you will find at the movies. This movie is filled to the brim with everything that made us love these characters to start with and best of all, this movie gets (mostly) everything right. The best part of this film is the animation itself. This movie is absolutely gorgeous to look at. The animation style is computer generated but is made in the style of Schulz's drawings of the characters. IN fact, there are certain snippets of footage in this film that are indeed 2D hand drawn animation that make this movie feel like a homecoming rather than a reboot. There are times in this movie where you simply feel like you are watching a classic Peanuts movie that came out years ago and it is definitely thanks to the effort behind the visuals of this movie. The writing is also a major player in this because the writers here remembered their target audience and that being everyone. We get good and clean family fun in this movie. So many adaptations of older properties feel the need to include raunchy humor for the adults but here the team remembered that this is the Peanuts crew and let the comedy speak for itself. The comedy here is a mix between hilarious slapstick humor as well as well written gags that will appeal to both children as well as adults. This jokes for the adults are blatant, but they are so quick and subtle that they add to the charm of this film. In classic Peanut's fashion there is a message in this film that isn't hammered in, but is shown through truly heartfelt moments. It is very much worth mentioning that the use of the characters is handled superbly with each character getting their due. Charlie Brown is still lovable, Lucy is as harsh as ever, Linus is still Linus, and Snoopy and Woodstock steal the show like never before. The story this time around is simple but effective with Charlie Brown falling for the new girl in class and he is trying his best to impress her. Now this is where my criticism comes in. The story works, there is no doubt about that, however i feel like they could have done more with it. What we have is phenomenal but i feel that the ending is too rushed and if the film had been longer it would have benefitted from it. Other than that one criticism, I loved this movie from start to finish. The heartfelt moments hit hard, the comedy hits harder, and most importantly these are the Peanuts that we know and love. The story could be longer and handled better at the end, but at the end of the day The Peanuts Movie is well worth your time. Take the family out to see this one, I guarantee you will have a good time.",

What can be tiring is the running gag that everything Charlie does or attempts falls apart, but Charlie can always be counted on to do the right thing when it amounts to character. Also, there is too much Snoopy, too many fantasy Red Baron fight scenes. Best part is when Charlie goes to Lucy for psychiatric advice and promptly pays her fee- a nickel.",

    "review": "  A phenomenal experience. I've seen all the previous full length Peanuts movies, as well as many of the TV specials, and there are so many references and inside jokes to them that I'm sure even I missed some of them. For those like me that grew up on Charlie Brown, it will be a fantastic nostalgic trip down memory lane. For those who haven't seen as much, the jokes and inside references will still be funny because they all fit perfectly within the narrative of the movie. It's perfect for children and adults, a story about a kid who can't seem to do anything right but still does everything with character and integrity that shows he really is doing it right. Hopefully, just as A Charlie Brown Christmas has been playing for 50 years, this too will entertain audiences for generations to come.",

    "review": "  A rare home run in modern animated movies, \"The Peanuts Movie\" is a delightful breath of fresh air amongst enjoyable but familiar kids movie tales. Unlike almost every animated movie nowadays, this is has no ticking clock, no epic journey and no modern references that pander to the lowest common denominator of movie go-ers. Instead we get a simple and sweet movie about Charlie Brown just trying to fit in, which is a lot more relatable than the other animated movies out there. Just watching Charlie trying to do his best is enduring enough, but with everything else that director Steve Martino and the rest of the crew of this movie add in, just takes it above and beyond. I can't remember the last time a movie started and firmly planted a smile on me that lasted there for the entire running time. Every character feels exactly like their 60's and 70's counterparts, it carry's the spirit of the peanuts so well, I actually can't believe this is real. The animation is probably the best CGI has ever looked, the way they capture the look of both the Peanuts comics and the animated TV specials and the original movies. Also if your a cartoon dork like me, the amount of little easter eggs, in-jokes and references to the Peanuts legacy including the most admirable one, in the original TV specials the director Bill Melendez voiced both Snoopy and Woodstock and for this movie they used only archival voice recordings of Bill Melendez for Snoopy and Woodstock. Overall, \"The Peanuts Movie\" is a wonderful experience that had me from the first second to the last second.",

With that said, even with a shorter run-time than a lot of other films, this one still seems a bit stretched. The second story-line involving Snoopy feels as if it exists to extend the film out.The CG animation doesn't trump the old fashioned sketches; however, there is more than enough throwbacks and character movements to make this a successful picture visually.Backed with a classic soundtrack and much approved voice work, this film also delivers in the sound department.The Peanuts Movie excels on many levels and is easily a recommendable easy going animation.",

    "review": "  Growing up on Charles Schulz' Peanuts gang gave me somewhat high expectations for the new movie. Fans of the Peanuts have always loved the relatable characters and the warmth of the themes that resonate throughout each image. So if you're like me, I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed.It's been 35 years since the last theatrical Peanuts film, Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don't Come Back) hit theaters, and the first since Schultz' death back in 2000. But written by Schultz' son and grandson, it's easy to see that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. It keeps with the spirit of the original works while bringing a modern animation style. And thankfully, that's about the only contemporary feature that this film has. They do a great job of not modernizing the content too much. It doesn't succumb to fart jokes or modern frivolities. There are no cheap gimmicks to get laughter. It's just a classy adaptation of the classy source material we grew up loving--even featuring echoes of Vince Guaraldi's trademark compositions.The Peanuts Movie revolves around everyone's favorite underdog, Charlie Brown, and his quest to get the new girl to think of him as more than a klutz. He wants her to see him as cool and popular. All the old characters are present here. There's a subplot that is shown interstitially throughout the film featuring Snoopy imagining that he's flying his plane, trying to rescue his love, Fifi, from the Red Baron.It's a simple love story, but that's what Peanuts does so well. They provide us with grandeur lessons through straightforward means. In this case Charlie Brown learns about confidence, being true to himself, and perseverance--lessons that can have just as much impact on the adults watching as it does on their children.What the movie does best is provide so much depth to Charlie Brown's character without straying away from the already established depth that we've known him to have throughout the years. It doesn't try to reinvent the characters for a modern world--it appropriately fits this storyarc into the Peanuts canon without disrupting it. The only time the film slows down is when the Snoopy storyline comes to a close and finishes with a somewhat lengthy finale. The subplot is actually a fun addition to the movie, since each segment only lasts about 45 seconds, but the climax of it all runs for about 4 minutes and slightly takes away from the momentum of the film. However, this is only a minor hiccup in an otherwise fantastic film.The Peanuts Movie truly has an old soul as far as movies go--especially of the family variety. It proves, once again, the timelessness of Schultz' beloved characters.Twizard Rating: 95",

    "review": "  The Peanuts Movie is not meant to be innovative or ambitious, it is nothing more than a nostalgic throwback to the innocent jokes and imaginative adventures from the classic series. Because of this level of simplicity, The Peanuts Movie will resonate with the series fans, however, I doubt it will resonate with many others.Director Steve Martino, who also brought you Ice Age: Continental Drift, manages to recreate the tone of the old series. It is difficult to write about a movie that has such a close resemblance to its origins; not much seems to have changed. In comparison to today's children movies, The Peanuts Movie can seem quite dull at times. In an attempt to make it newer and appealing to the younger audience, the excessive use of mainstream songs throughout the movie becomes unbearable at times, the plot extends for a little too long and Snoopy's separate adventure, while interesting at first, gives the impression of being just a filler to elongate the movie.The animation however, is done beautifully. Watching these classic characters that once appeared in newspapers and old TV's come to life give the viewer a sense of warmth. This feeling accompanies you from beginning to the end, when the film states the moral of the story clearer than any other children's movie has ever done it.While The Peanuts Movie manages to bring back old characters to life and most likely, meet the expectations of old fans, it does not go far beyond that.",

In the movie adaptation we finally discover the origin of the little red-haired girl, Charlie Brown's crush. She makes an appearance as an actual character, and of course Charlie Brown spends most of the movie figuring out how to impress her. This movie is really about Charlie Brown's quest to find meaning in is life and do something noteworthy. Several of the characters have side tromps, including Snoopy fighting his infamous rival the Red Baron. I thought this film paid homage to Charles Schulz' comic fairly well. All of the nuances of the characters are captured, from Lucy's psychiatric booth to Linus and his blanket. It paints an accurate picture of what made The Charlie Brown and Snoopy show so legendary.

Much like Horton Hears a Who before it, this film offers a beautifully-animated take on the classic characters and world, giving us a simple tale of Charlie Brown's life and Snoopy's adventures through span of half a year, in a time where most animated movies have big epic stories and probably WAY too many ideas, and respectfully honors Charles M. Schulz's work and the wonderful Peanuts specials that came beforehand, thanks in no small part to Steve Martino's skilled direction and being written and produced by members of the Schulz family. Take it from me: The Peanuts Movie is one welcoming trip into a nostalgic realm that still relates to people even to this day and is well worth checking out for some good times.",

    "review": "  Rating: Fetching (I am making it happen Regina) This movie does it's job of taking the classic characters and bringing them to our modern theaters in a charming way. I did not remember how much I knew about the Peanuts until I was sitting in the auditorium but I recalled quite a bit that only enhanced the experience. The story is a brilliant blend of the underdog striving to achieve success in Charlie Brown and the friendship that surrounds him, especially with Snoopy. Speaking of which that dog pretty much steals the show for me with his unpredictable humor and undying loyalty to Charlie. Snoopy also presents a minor flaw in the movie with the Red Baron stuff included. I personally thought most of it was well handled, but at times it felt distracting from the main throughpoint. Also since this is a family movie some of the jokes naturally don't hit for me as an adult, but none were juvenile like some other animation movies recently *cough cough* Minions. Overall I would say that you have any desire to see this movie, or just enjoy a good family film with heart check this out.",

There is a beauty to the cg animation which seeks to emulate the original 2D animation. I loved the exaggerated expressions. The story is built around a formula of impressing the girl, using it to be able to concentrate on clever ways to arrive at the conclusions which any adult will see coming. We know Charlie Brown must fail. However, you are unlikely to figure out ahead of time how this happens. The jokes don't constantly hit (through the little kids will find this movie especially funny) but the hits will hit you hard enough that you won't be able to recover until it hits you again. This is the kind of adaptation that will get your kids interested and remind you of why you loved Peanuts in the first place.",

I only went to the theater due to the interesting animation style... the way Schulz's iconic linework was kept in tact in a 3D environment. Still, the trailer made me trepidatious, content-wise. (I like very little non Disney/Pixar American animation, anyway.) Turns out...this is a wonderful little movie. Despite the occasional intrusion of modern music, and a light over-reliance of slapstick, the thing is funny in the way the comic strips and old moves/ TV specials were. That is to say... it has a sardonic, wry, bleak little heart beneath its colorful exterior. The moments of warmpth are hard-earned, and even they are undercut with meloncholy. This movie honors the amazing cartoonist who invented these characters, & I'm happy it's making bank, 'cuz I'd gladly see another.",

It does suffer from many of the problems other Blue Sky productions have, such as an excess of movement instead of just letting a slower moment play out, but even with that most of the charm of Schultz' strip comes through. I don't see this replacing the TV specials, but for what it is - a typically Charlie Brown underdog story with a heap of Snoopy thrown in - I can't fault it, and it certainly made me smile more than once.

I grew up from the cradle with Snoopy and the Peanuts gang (my Mom and Dad still have the headboard with Snoopy from my cradle as a baby) and had all the movies as a kid. This really stayed true to the Peanuts comic strip, and who Charlie Brown is and what he stands for. The Snoopy storyline was cute as well, and did not take from the plot involving Charlie Brown. In the end, I am really hoping for a sequel, maybe in the vein of Bon Voyage Charlie Brown or It's Tokyo, Charlie Brown! As long as the Schultz family is once again at the helm, I will gladly go along for the ride. I am sure Charles Schulz is smiling down from heaven, proud of this movie",

To say that this is Blue Sky Animation's best film to date is an understatement (not a high bar to clear, but still), precisely because it avoids any pressures to try and modernize itself or compromise what it is, instead telling a simple, universally relatable story that gives the film more of a timeless quality. While the die-hard Peanuts fan in me wouldn't have minded a few more darker or bittersweet touches of the kind you'd see from the earlier comics and TV specials, it generally finds a nice middle ground that balances capturing childhood's disappointments and cruel twists of fate with the small victories and sources of solace that make it all feel worthwhile.",

The central story is that there is a new girl at school that Charlie Brown is gushing over and does not have the guts to speak to her. Side plots include a 3D look into what snoopy has been fighting all these years and Charlie Brown trying to win a talent show to impress this new mystery girl. I loved every aspect on how they mixed the old school two dimensional style animation with the new school 3D. It was done carefully and the callbacks to the original specials were done perfectly. Although it does rely on some of the source material to drive the story, I was able to look past that and see that they were just trying to pay homage. \"The Peanuts Movie\" will put a smile on your face no matter when you watch it. It is the children's feel-good film of the year. Is it one of the best animated films I've seen in a long time? Of course not!

    "review": "  \"Good grief Blue Sky Studios, you blockheads really messed with a beloved American icon!\" That is what I would say if The Peanuts Movie was a bad movie. But it is not. True, it feels lengthy and stretched; Like butter over too much bread. That's only because I'm used to these things being resolved in 30 minutes with commercials throughout, but that aside, this is a loving adaptation of the Peanuts characters, and here's why: We start with a snow day declared. Charlie Brown's little sister Lucy answering the phone call of Miss Othmar (Troy \"Trombone Shorty\" Andrews and his classic trombone sound for all the adults) that there's a snow-day! The other kids get this call, and winter fun begins for the Peanuts gang: Peppermint Patty, Marcy, Franklin, Linus and Lucy Van Pelt, Pig-Pen, and all the other characters you grew up with on those annual ABC reruns that have surpassed 50 years! (Fun fact: This year is the 50th anniversary of Merry Christmas Charlie Brown and the 65th anniversary of the original comic strips. Coincidence?) Following that, Charlie Brown is called out to play, and after getting himself together, he brings out: A kite? Good grief, it's one of those movies, where a kid feels hopelessly outmatched by the world, he wants to get the girl, but doesn't have the guts... Well, it goes in that direction after the Little Red-Haired Girl moves across the street from him, but with the help of his trusty dog Snoopy (Voiced through archive recordings by Bill Melendez, the original Snoopy sound effects) they embark on a quest to make Charlie Brown more confident. Along the way, we also see Snoopy write a story about a dog fighting the Red Baron (Sound familiar?) and both stories parallel each other splendidly: Charlie Brown's story inspires the story-within-a-story, bringing in more classic Peanuts without making it a cess-pool of hashed-together imagery of Peanuts. Whether you're eight or 80, you won't be able to help feeling for Charlie Brown, and maybe sympathize with him. The animation may seem odd at first, but that aside, it is a beautiful CGI rendering of the world of Peanuts that feels like one you could reach out and touch (Helps if you see it in 3D) and stays true to the cartoon visuals of the 60s specials and the comic strips. No new characters are introduced, and thankfully, celebrity voices are not forced into the roles of the characters, which avoids distractions of \"Do I know this voice?\" like Citizen Kane managed to do. Christoph Beck provides a great soundtrack to the main story, but don't think that songs meant to help market this movie and some of the Vince Guaraldi music didn't find their way in: The winter dance scene has modern music that seems out of place in a 60s-esque school, but because the Vince Guaraldi music was placed so well, I grant it a pardon: Every timeless tale and beloved character need some kind of twist here and there, or else this would not be a loving tribute, but a rehash of the same old thing. With a fresh new story of Charlie Brown trying to become more confident in visuals that stay true to the source material in a day-and-age of computers, and a cast of actors we won't remember, but who fill the shoes of the original voice actors of the Peanuts TV specials, The Peanuts Movie does not deserve to be slugged by the audience or critics, but to be praised. Those were no blockheads in the studio: Just good people doing the right thing.",

I was very pleased by it and impressed how they managed to convert the 2D world created by Charles Schulz into a 3D world while respecting all the design, details and structure of the characters and elements which are part of this classic world.This movie will please adults as myself who grew up with the classic world of Charlie Brown and Snoopy, but also a new generation of children who will be introduced to it thanks to this film.",

I was A little nervous going in cause sometimes they take a classic and ruin(Godzilla 1997 and 2015) but that wasn't the case Here. The peanuts was a fun movie for all ages its just not for kids. So If anybody tells you that its not good or its a movie just for kids they have no clue on what there talking about. I hope it dose well at the boxoffice so we can get another Peanuts movie",

    "review": "  Schlemiel: (Yiddish) a stupid, awkward, or unlucky person.Charlie Brown is a 'schlemiel. I realized that today watching this through my adult eyes. Charlie Brown is a hapless, self-absorbed, worrisome 'schlep' of a guy who is constantly stuck in existential mode, obsessing over social status and wallowing in self pity. His dog Snoopy, is his Superego. His sister Sally represents the sweetly blissful ignorance that Charles lost the day he became 'self aware' lol.His circle of friends represent people who have an identity in life - everything he is NOT but wishes to be: an accomplished pianist prodigy (Schroeder); a doting motherly older sibling (Lucy); a philosophizing best friend (Linus); a carefree loafer (pigpen); an athletic tomboy (Peppermint Patty), and her faithfully ever-present sidekick (Marcie). Even his dog Snoopy, represents a guy with a certain 'saviore-faire' aloofness, a canine version of Walter Mitty, happily playing out his fantasies with such detached cool that he remained the sole source of entertainment in this animation about pre-life crisis lolI know I'm making this review sound bizarre, but when Schulz wrote Charlie Brown he really brought in some SERIOUS SHIT. This kid has a lot of life baggage at the tender age of 10. If he doesn't get some real help - more than 5 cents worth lol - this will not turn out good.We basically spend an hour and 20min watching a kid obsess over and stalk a girl for an entire school year. If this animation took place in today's world (sadly, it does not) - Charlie Brown would be a Facebook stalker. In today's world that shit is disturbing. I'm pretty sure the producers WISELY decided to keep the story retro...Trust me, they knew that the source material is some heavy shit. It would take a surprisingly disturbing turn on social media, cellphones, snapchats, and texts lolBut, the oddly deep emotional element is EXACTLY what I found so funny about watching Peanuts! :D :D As a child I laughed at the colorful antics - mainly Snoopy. But as an adult I was sitting there thinking 'Damn... this kid has it BAD.' lmaoIMO, as a guy who grew up reading THOUSANDS of Peanuts comic strips and watching every animation made, I was personally disappointed that the source material was not updated and modernized. This movie was basically a re-hash of every Peanuts joke we'd already seen as kids. :-/On another note, I'd LOVE to see a new version of Peanuts where we can witness how they all turn out. :D",

    "review": "  This is such a great movie. I thoroughly enjoyed everything about it. The story stays 100% true to the comics and TV specials, thanks in most part to the excellent writing of Charles Shultz's son and grandson. Add to the fact that the animation staff tirelessly researched and studied Shultz's drawing style down to a T, in order to bring us the most authentic visual style of Mr. Shultz. You almost forget that what you are watching is CGI animation and not traditional hand drawn animation. Even though this is CG, there are also wonderful artistic touches the animators threw in, from the detail of Snoopy's fur and the tuft of fur at the back of Fifi's head to the ambiance of the clouds and the buildings. Plus, when you throw in a director who is such a big fan of the comic (who can also draw the Peanuts gang flawlessly), you really can't go wrong.The critics who have rated this movie as rotten, truly miss the point of the movie entirely. There is no malice, potty humor, or any other \"children's animation\" trope that is so prevalent in today's children's fare. This movie is sincere, funny, touching, and at times emotional. It's probably one of the only movies this year that is good, 100% clean fun for children, adults and fans alike. Go see this movie.",

The producers were smart to refrain from modernizing the storyline or characters and keep it timeless. There are no cell phones, video games or pop references. Most of the story is lifted from the strips and specials of the mid to late sixties when Shultz was in top form. It was nice to see them bring back characters that were long retired, like Frieda and Shermy. I was also pleased that there was plenty of Vince Guaraldi music. My only complaint is that the Snoopy vs. The Red Baron scenes were overly long and too frequent. If you loved the classic Peanuts, I'm sure you'll enjoy this film.",

No matter how familiar we are to the story of Charlie Brown and the Little Red-Haired Girl, Snoopy as the Flying Ace versus the Red Baron, or as Joe Cool, Linus and Sally, Lucy and Schroeder, Peppermint Patty and Marcie, Violet, Patty and Lucy (a.k.a. the original Mean Girls), Shermy and his dance moves, and the rest of the adorable timeless characters, the whole gang never fails to entertain and put big smiles on people's faces. Snoopy and his crazy antics didn't disappoint. He had me laughing. I already knew he was going after Linus' blanket, drag Linus, and cause a riot in the process, and yet it is still funny as ever. At one point, however, I thought I'd never see the Flying Ace have a pint of root beer. I anxiously waited and waited to the near point of giving up that the filmmakers didn't include it. To my surprise, root beer for the Flying Ace and even for every one of Snoopy's siblings! That was great surprise to have them make an appearance (sorry if that was a spoiler alert, but it's not like anyone else was thinking when the Flying Ace would get to have his root beer or expect to see his siblings in the movie -- I know I was). Overall, a delightful movie, one that I would see over and over again like all the classics. Well done!",

The two things they modernize (standardized testing & Little Red-Haired Girl speaking) were intentional. For a lifelong Peanuts comic lover, this movie is perfection. If it fails to infuse a children's movie with adult humor and fleeting mass media references, that only serves to make it a classic alongside its source material.

The answer is a proud yes. I'm happy to say that this film is an absolute love-letter to Charles M. Schulz and his beloved Peanuts comic strip, which lasted for over 50 years between 1950 and 2000.The film begins with a snow day, school is cancelled that day, and we see the whole gang with all their personalities from the strip intact. Charlie Brown, played by child actor Noah Schnapp (who played the young son in Steven Spielberg's recent Bridge of Spies), is on a mission to get the attention of her instant crush, the Little Red Haired Girl, while on a side plot - Snoopy is on a mission as the World War I Flying Ace to defeat the Red Baron and save her damsel in distress, Fifi (played by Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth). The latter lowers the bar a little, but I had to admit, they fit the 3D in the film. However, when I saw the ending scene with Charlie Brown and the Little Red Haired Girl finally meeting for the first time, and the latter telling the former she likes him for who she is, I was a 24-year-old man crying his eyes out, and I never cry during movies.As Charlie Brown, Schnapp sounds exactly like Peter Robbins did in the 1965 special A Charlie Brown Christmas, as do all the other children playing characters such as Lucy, Linus, Franklin, Peppermint Patty (played by teen actress Venus Schultheis), and Marcie. Through the magic of archival recordings, Snoopy's role is reprised by the late animator Bill Melendez, who produced the animated Peanuts specials throughout the 1960's-2000's, The Little Red Haired Girl is played by Francis Capaldi, who also stars in Disney Channel's atrocious sitcom Dog with a Blog. She's proved to be a pretty good actress too. This is not like other movies based on an established properties, such as the horrendous Alvin and the Chipmunks films or the even worse Smurfs series (which thankfully is getting an all-animated reboot 2 years from now), this is a faithful, ambitious tribute to Charles Schulz's original comic strip, a nostalgic trip back in time. And even if some of my fellow critics decided politicize the film (like how Variety's Peter Debruge decided to inject race into the movie), it will still be a movie that both kids and adults can enjoy this November.",

A girl..a boy.. does it matter? No because gender roles don't matter in our society however for a children's movie we are assuming that the writer's were not trying to expose the young by introducing a transvestite in the movie therefore they should have made the script WAY more clear. Another character is smelly boy who is in lathered in dirt for the entire movie. Are his parents neglectful? Why is clean? Does he not have the means to wash himeself? Also how come there are no adults in this movie? Why are all the adults voices morphed? Are they trying to get kids to tune out...I think so.The content in the dialogue was a bit mature in this movie. This movie does not teach kids to base their actions on themselves. Example : Charlie brown tries to impress the girl by changing himself with the help of the book How To Be a Winner. All in all this movie was pathetic and did not represent Charlie Brown in an accurate way. A highschool student could have done a better job at piecing this story together. Wath this if you have absolutely nothin to do with your life. More importantly don't let the younglings watch this.Carsoup (look us up on YouTube)",

Without them, this fiasco of an homage to the legacy of Charles Schulz - brought to the big screen in part by Schulz's son, Craig, and grandson, Bryan - would be irredeemably dull and without purpose. As it is, the film still lacks a raison d'�tre beyond the mercenary, and only the prospect of seeing Snoopy chase the Red Baron once more, Woodstock in tow, should motivate anyone to see it. For my money, if you want a decent cinematic adaptation of the adventures of Charlie Brown and his faithful canine companion, watch�\"Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\"�again. Better yet, check out the \"Peanuts\" TV shows�of yore, referenced throughout this new film (slow plot moment? cue Vince Guaraldi). All we get here is stale recycling of old plot lines, now rendered in 3D. Sadly, this brief review is all the movie deserves.",

    "review": "  A worry going in to The Peanuts Movie was simply this: in 2015, in a time where animation is all computer-animated and with super-sophistication but also lacking the sort of approach that came with the simple, quirky, edgy-but-cute style of the Peanuts cartoons from the past half century, how do you bring that world out and make it feel right? And there was an element of the story that made me raise an eyebrow, and reminded me of an issue I had with the recent 2011 return of The Muppets - a new character comes to the universe of the Peanuts. Would this character fit in? Would it be distracting if he or she looks different or acts un-Peanuts-like? And what does Peanuts-like mean, you might ask, by the way? It's that thing where, simply, kids think like kids, but with an extra level of sophistication in the writing. Let me put it this way: The Peanuts Movie is the only movie that kids will see which has a reference to Tolstoy's War and Peace (though it's not initially called that by Peppermint Patty).But fears are assuaged as I return from seeing the movie and find the movie is very successful at what it aims to be. In short, this is at its best... just another Peanuts movie, but that's a sincere compliment. You watch some of those movies and specials, which have stood the test of time due to the wit of the writing and the beautiful (yes, beautiful) animation that does simply to bring Charles Schulz's comic to life, and those shows and movies (i.e. the best, A Boy Named Charlie Brown, but also Snoopy Come Home and Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown) with issues that kids deal with, whether or not they directly relate to the hero. In this story it's all about this new girl coming to school (we never learn her name, there's really no need to), and how good old Chuck can barely deal with his ridiculously nervous reaction. How can he even say hello to her, much less carry a conversation? What can he do to build up his confidence? Can Lucy with her Nickel-store advice and 10-step book help? Can he become a success in some way?Whether you're coming to this as someone who has been watching Peanuts all your life, or if you have a little kid (or are one) and have never seen one of these and it's your introduction, it is a wholly delightful experience. Schulz's kids were co-screenwriters, which could have been great or not-so-great (one never knows if the purity will work or become too stifling, or if there are too many attempts to make it \"hip\" and \"Modern\", which means it won't age so well years down the line). All of the Peanuts characters we know and like are here - I couldn't find one major one who wasn't, and everyone gets a moment or two (I even forgot for a moment Lucy's crush for Schroeder, but it's here too). And of course Snoopy as the super rascal/charmer/adventurer of the lot who tries to do things like sneak into school as a teacher (\"No dogs allowed!\" duh) and spends his part time writing stories about being an ace pilot with the \"Red Baron\" plane.With the exception of a couple of elements that, frankly, I could've taken or left, like some of the Red Baron bits (some are OK, some may drag unless you're a kid into the action-loaded visuals), and the inclusion of a couple of pop songs (not annoying ones, but they are of this time period) and a lack (not completely, but not enough) of Vince Guaraldi's irreplaceable jazz score, the movie really works. I cared about Charlie Brown on his journey through building up his confidence, through ups and downs that were not, and occasionally were, his fault. And along the whole way, there's that special thing that made Peanuts work, has always made it work, and will continue for many years to come: you want to see this guy win, and yet it's funnier/more realistic when he falls on his face. But maybe every Charlie Brown has his day in this case? Between the talent show, school dance, book report, summer pen-pal deal, can Charlie Brown say ONE word to this girl? Who knows.They're all here and its spirit is pure. What else do you need to know? The Peanuts Movie is a blast of family entertainment in the young and old sense of the word, full of clever lines and visual-eye-pleasing slapstick and, (happy surprise) pathos.",

The 3D destroys much of what I love about the original (the simplicity of the drawings, the uncluttered backgrounds, the oil colors of the movies and oldest specials etc.). This is like going to watch a stage production of \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" but even then...Part of what made the previous Peanuts movies and specials so accessible is that they didn't try to be self-contained presentations but merely \"just another chapter\" in the world of these characters, an extension of the comics. You could watch them in any order, repeatedly, and they would feel just as fresh and inviting, like catching an old episode of Andy Griffith or The Lone Ranger. This movie is designed to stand alone, to be Peanuts for a world in which the daily strip is no longer being produced.My son will want to see it and he will love it and that's fine.

Here are my thoughts on it so far:Peanuts have always been a great part of my childhood with their amazing characters like Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus and Rerun Van Pelt, Sally, Peppermint Patty and others. This is a film I have been waiting for a long time. The animated peanuts movies were fun to watch like A Boy Named Charlie Brown, Snoopy Come Home, Bon Voyage Charlie Brown (And Dont Come Back!) and Race For YOu Life Charlie Brown. Those were some memories. Now Blue Sky is doing a Charlie Brown Movie! Will It Be A Movie After The Events Of The 50 Years Of Comics now as they are adult? Or will it be a good ol fashion Movie taking place in the events of the 50 years of comics? It would be best if they kept them as kids instead of adults. But if they do make them adults they should call it A Charlie Brown Reunion. But if not, I dont know what they should call it because its up to Blue Sky and 20th Century to decide that. But I cannot wait for the new peanuts movie!",
