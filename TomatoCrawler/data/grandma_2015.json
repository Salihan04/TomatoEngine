    "review": "  ABORT LAST NIGHT - My Review of GRANDMA (3 Stars)Although writer/director Paul Weitz (ABOUT A BOY, AMERICAN PIE) will most likely never be accused of being a visionary auteur, he knows how to move and entertain an audience. GRANDMA, which could easily be dismissed as a totally unambitious, artless slice of life, still managed to hold me in its dry, acerbic spell for its brief 80 minute running time. One of my friends loathed this film, calling it completely unconvincing and poorly acted, and I could have so easily leaned in his direction were it not for my deep, blind love for Lily Tomlin. Even with her terrible films, and yes, I never drank the BIG BUSINESS Kool Aid, I've always appreciated Tomlin's delightfully bitter world view. Her killer smile, commanding voice, and take no prisoners attitude has a special place in my cold, cold heart. She's a comic genius who earned her dramatic chops with her stunning performance in the 1975 classic NASHVILLE. It's been such a long time since Tomlin has starred in a movie and even longer since she's tackled a drama, so I went to GRANDMA ready to savor every delicious minute of it. Sure, she still leans on comedic beats here, but having her front and center in every frame was enough to get me through its \"small time\" feel. Taking place over the course of a single day, Tomlin's Elle Reid has just broken up with her much younger short-term girlfriend (Judy Greer) when her granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner from THE AMERICANS) knocks on her door. Needing an abortion that evening and unable to shoulder the cost, Sage has come begging Elle. A broke ex-poet turned teacher, Elle takes Sage on a journey to drum up the funds, encountering people in their lives with the potential to help. It's an extremely clean, simple premise, giving Tomlin one opportunity after another to rail against anyone who gets in their way.I won't spoil what happens, but the cast of characters they meet consist of some great up-and-coming and established names, including Nat Wolff (PAPER TOWNS) as the idiot who knocks Sage up, the late Elizabeth Pena who is gets to match Tomlin's anger in an amusingly explosive scene, Colleen Camp, who proves that you can mine comedy out of a single line of dialogue, Marcia Gay Harden as Tomlin's severe daughter, Laverne Cox, who unfortunately does very little with her tattoo artist role, and best of all, Sam Elliott, as a man from Elle's past. Most of these characters merely exist to shine a light on Elle's tortured, petty, cruel and stagnant personality, which is ok, because the film, after all, is called GRANDMA, not A BUNCH OF PEOPLE. Moreover, while I would watch Judy Greer in almost anything (which means I did see JURASSIC WORLD), and I find Julia Garner to be a strong, self-possessed young actor, the main attraction is Tomlin. Depending on your stomach for her brand of comic bile, you may end up savoring every moment or end up looking for a moist towelette to wipe the somewhat sitcom-like machinations off of you. I'm, of course, with the former camp, loving that Tomlin has been freed up here to \"dyke out\" for the first time on film, instead of having to pretend to actually enjoying kissing John Travolta, her lookalike in the execrable MOMENT BY MOMENT. Elle's take-no-prisoners brand of feminism along with her Mother Cub protective instincts make her encounters bristle with the energy of a person who's sifted through enough crap in her life. Elle is a complicated character in that she doesn't always do or say the right things, yet Tomlin's command keeps you in the game. There's a fine line between being too Sundance-like and too populist, and GRANDMA walks the tightrope quite well between the two. Yes, it's artless, often obvious, and pretty clear from the start where the whole thing will end up, but that quiet, subtle, long final shot of Tomlin feels earned. You may not know what comes next for this unstable, unreasonable, yet wholeheartedly caring person, but you'll feel confident she can handle it by the end.",

    "review": "  Lily Tomlin is an undisputed miracle worker. She's already been comedy royalty for decades, from her time on Laugh-In to 9 To 5, and she even has an Oscar nomination to her name for the classic Nashville. Why? Because she has a range and skills that cut deeper than laughs. But no actual Oscar wins. Perhaps this wonderful gem of a film will finally do it. This is Tomlin in a tour de force.It's not that the 75-year-old Tomlin is warming hearts as a sweet old dearie fighting off illness or senility. Writer-director Paul Weitz (About a Boy) manages to play to her strengths. Tomlin is Elle Reid, a celebrated poet with a real mouth on her, and Tomlin uses the role to take on hypocrisy head on. Her longtime partner has just died and she's just dumped a new, younger version (Judy Greer). That's when Elle's teen granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) shows up and announces she's pregnant.The film is an absolute delight as Elle and Sage go on a no-bull search for 'a reasonably priced abortion', causing down on her luck Grandma to come across that baby daddy (a hilarious Nat Wolff), as well as Sage's mother (an excellent Marcia Gay Harden) and Karl (a terrific Sam Elliott), an old flame from Elle's past. Every encounter reveals long-buried feelings Elle can't just shrug off, and Tomlin, ever the artist, will leave you astonished and devastated.",

    "review": "  A small story with a big performance from Lily Tomlin who gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Elle, an elderly woman who recently lost her life partner and is on the rocks with her current, much younger girlfriend. Her day starts when her granddaughter comes to her for help after finding out she is pregnant. The two go on a mini road trip to collect money. At the same time, we are introduced to Elle's past as we meet an array of characters that filled her past. This is where we get to find out who Elle was as a person. This is Tomlin's show and she is sharp, witty, funny, and sentimental. Though this is seen as a comedy, the story is rather sad as it is about regrets and moving on. But, Tomlin is the main reason to see this and she will make you want a grandma like her.Grade: A-",

    "review": "  This film is way too eager to wrap up all its story lines as cleanly and quickly as possible and that's unfortunate because there was too much to tell and the filmmakers haven't exhausted even a small portion of possibilities created by these characters, above all by the cocky, bossy, anti-dogmatic, anti-pragmatic, no-nonsense, don't-fuck-with-me free spirit, Elle Reid. Yeah, she's a bit of an indie clich� but Lily Tomlin is on steroids here and I loved the turn the character took in the final act (if only they had the balls to go deeper in that particular story line, they could have come up with something great). So at the end of the movie, we have four characters in constant conflicts with each other and they suddenly find ways to resolve the conflicts but if you ask me how we came to that resolution, all I could come up with would be: by a twisted version of divine intervention. One of the conflicts (between Elle and her lover of a year and a half, Olivia) is your typical indie filler. It takes too much time, it contributes little to the overall narrative, but it's kinda cool and it even works somehow, mostly thanks to the two terrific, underused actresses portraying Elle and Olivia (Judy Greer always does so much with so little). And that's too bad, because the film is fun. It's affectionate and smart, but it never ever makes a bold storytelling choice. The actors are bold, yeah, once again - Lily Tomlin, you're a goddess, but the writing, the writing needs work. Actually, starting from scratch would be a good idea. End of rant.",

    "review": "  Elle (Lily Tomlin) is a 70-something lesbian, feminist, and proud misanthrope. When we first meet her, she's in the process of breaking up with her much younger girlfriend. When the girlfriend asks if she ever loved her, Elle responds that their relationship amounts to nothing more than a footnote in her life story. Kindness is not Elle's strong suit. Shortly thereafter, Elle gets a visit from her teenage granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner), who looks like a real-life version of Goldilocks. Sage announces that she's 10-weeks pregnant and has an appointment to have an abortion that very evening, but needs to scrape up $600 to pay for it. Her timing could not be worse as Elle is currently broke, having just paid off all of her debts and cut up her credit cards into little pieces to make wind chimes. Though she's expecting a check in a few days, the next available appointment at the abortion clinic (apparently the only one in town) isn't for another week, so it's imperative that the cash be obtained in the next few hours.And this completes the convoluted premise.Though Elle isn't as nasty to Sage as she is to most people, she has no qualms about hiding her disappointment that her granddaughter turned out to be a sweet teenage girl instead of a crazy man-hating lunatic like her grandma. Though my own Gammy was fond of fashion critiques along the lines of \"would it kill you to wear a little lipstick?\" and \"you wear that shirt so often that I'm starting to think it's your skin\", Sage is chastised for having never read 50-year-old feminist manifestos. As Elle drives Sage from place to place to try to come up with the money, bits and pieces of her life story slowly emerge. Elle is loud and angry and extremely rude, often to people who've done nothing at all to provoke her wrath. Sage is mortified, as well she should be. Perhaps Elle's tantrums are meant to be funny (the movie is classified as a comedy, after all) but no one in my sparsely-attended showing was laughing. Other than impeccable dental hygiene and a slight softening towards the end, the woman has almost no redeeming qualities whatsoever.And Sage's mother Judy (Marcia Gay Harden) is no better, making a late game appearance as a stereotype of a fearsome, no-nonsense businesswoman with an obsequious gay male assistant. Rather than risking offending the pro-life crowd TOO much, the writers make sure that Sage's decision is given plenty of serious thought, with Elle advising her that if she has an abortion, she'll think about it every day FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Seriously? She's a teenager, she's no longer with the baby's father, she exhibits no religious proclivities, and the fetus is only 10 weeks old. What's to even think about? Though Tomlin's performance is good, she's playing such a bitter, hateful shrew that it's hard to even watch. Overall, I found the movie about as rich and satisfying as a set of plastic credit card wind chimes in a gentle breeze. Click.......click.......click.",

    "review": "  Paul Weitz writes and directs this micro-budget dramedy about a lesbian grandmother who has to help her pregnant grand-daughter get enough money for an abortion before 5:45PM. The plot is a bit on the incredulous side, with protagonist Elle Reid having cut up her credit cards and being broke right before this crisis happens. Everyone she knows also just happens to be broke, and the preggo grand-daughter Sage doesn't have a dollar to her name as well. Lily Tomlin is solid in her acerbic and verbally abusive role, but its newcomer Julia Garner and her doe-y eyed stares which match her, as well as Sam Elliot and Marcia Gay Harden. Elliot does incredibly well, his scenes being the most emotional and powerful, dwarfing everything else that comes after. The humour is on and off throughout, sometimes dialogue is forced or feels flat. Overall its a decent little effort by all involved, but it easily could have been much better.",

The story's not going to appeal to everyone -- a gay grandmother, still recovering from the death of her partner, helping her granddaughter find the funds for an abortion -- but honestly this is a character piece for Tomlin. It does do that sort of cliche thing in films like this where it will cut to an unrelated scenery shot (a leaf, a flower, a tree) for atmosphere from time to time, which is a minor irritant for me as I've rarely seen the need for such shots. Still, charming, and worth checking out.",

She's already been comedy royalty for decades, from her time on Laugh-In to 9 To 5, and she even has an Oscar nomination to her name for the classic Nashville. Why? Because she has a range and skills that cut deeper than laughs. But no actual Oscar wins. Perhaps this wonderful gem of a film will finally do it. This is Tomlin in a tour de force.It's not that the 75-year-old Tomlin is warming hearts as a sweet old dearie fighting off illness or senility. Writer-director Paul Weitz (About a Boy) manages to play to her strengths. Tomlin is Elle Reid, a celebrated poet with a real mouth on her, and Tomlin uses the role to take on hypocrisy head on. Her longtime partner has just died and she's just dumped a new, younger version (Judy Greer). That's when Elle's teen granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) shows up and announces she's pregnant.The film is an absolute delight as Elle and Sage go on a no-bull search for 'a reasonably priced abortion', causing down on her luck Grandma to come across that baby daddy (a hilarious Nat Wolff), as well as Sage's mother (an excellent Marcia Gay Harden) and Karl (a terrific Sam Elliott), an old flame from Elle's past. Every encounter reveals long-buried feelings Elle can't just shrug off, and Tomlin, ever the artist, will leave you astonished and devastated.",

    "review": "  Do you want to know what's wrong with the world? What? Yeah, you're right, we don't have all day, and my reviews are long enough anyway. Alright, I'll narrow it down to two things: lack of responsibility and lack of respect. When people live as if their actions have no consequences (or they shouldn't be subject to any consequences arising from their choices), they show a lack of responsibility. When people don't treat others as they would want to be treated, they show a lack of respect. If you stop to think about it, I believe you'll agree that the world would be a much better place if we all were even a little more responsible in our daily lives and a little more respectful in our interactions with other people. Oh, and it's also a big problem when people make a movie in which so few of the characters are likeable. Okay, I guess that makes three things, but they're all relevant when discussing the film \"Grandma\" (R, 1:19).The great Lily Tomlin takes on her first lead role in a feature film since 1988 (when she starred with Bette Midler in the underrated comedy farce \"Big Business\"). Tomlin plays the title character in this comedy-drama about an uninhibited, but tough lesbian poet named Elle Reid and her relationship with her 18-year-old granddaughter, Sage (Julia Garner). Elle is still mourning the death of Violet, her life-partner of 38 years. That situation obviously has her emotionally edgy, but it's pretty obvious that she's always been a real pill. Sage stops by her grandma Elle's house in the morning, shortly after Elle cruelly breaks up with her much younger lover of two months (Judy Greer). Elle, in her own words, is \"just being maudlin\" as she goes through a box of pictures and memorabilia from her lifetime with \"Vi\". Sage says she needs money. She's pregnant and needs $630 to pay for an abortion she scheduled for late that day.Elle has very little cash on hand and has cut up her credit cards, so she peels the cover off of Vi's old car and takes Sage on a sort of local road trip to visit people who give them various sums of money toward their goal. They visit Sage's rude, self-centered boyfriend, Cam (Nat Wolff), Elle and Vi's old friend, Deathy (Laverne Cox) in her tattoo parlor, Elle's scowling friend, Carla (Elizabeth Pe�a), Elle's grudge-harboring old flame, Karl (Sam Elliott), and Sage's unsympathetic businesswoman mother, Judy (Marcia Gay Harden). As the day progresses, instead of an open and frank discussion about Sage's choices and the direction of her life, or even some family bonding, we see Elle being very rude to a series of one-dimensional characters that Elle clearly regards as on the wrong side of the tracks, politically-speaking.\"Grandma\" is full of outstanding acting, but lacking in likeable characters, moral direction... and fun. Garner is well-cast and gives a nicely lived-in performance, while Elliott makes great use of his limited screen time to give an emotionally-layered performance. Tomlin is as great as ever. I just wish it were in service to a better movie. Although this film is mercifully short, it's basically a long commercial for abortion. Earlier in this review, I generously referred to this movie as a comedy-drama, but two out of three websites I checked label the film simply as a comedy. An abortion comedy?? Regardless of my personal feelings on the issue, I find the idea of a comedy about abortion to be offensive. Whether you're pro-choice, pro-life or don't care much either way, I'd like to think we could all agree that this complicated issue would have been better served by at least some discussion of Sage's options and the probable results of different courses of action. Surely nothing is to be gained by portraying the few religious and/or conservative characters in the story simply as close-minded, abusive snobs.\"But you're missing the point,\" someone reading this review is thinking. \"This is a comedy about an unconventional grandmother's relationship with her granddaughter. Well, I would say in response, I can think of a hundred different ways to make a movie like that without exploiting a very serious, divisive and personal issue for comedic purposes. And even if I ignored the issue which drives this story, where's the comedy? Is it in Elle's terrible treatment of both friends and strangers? Is it in Sage's clueless lack of personal responsibility? Is it in the animosity between Elle and her daughter Judy? If that's your idea of humor, go ahead and enjoy this film. I'm not criticizing your taste in movies, but I'm not laughing either. Oh, and the movie's boring too. The director must have known that. He placed title cards between each \"chapter\" of this story, as if to reassure us that the plot was progressing and driving towards some point.If there's any positive message here, it's about not burning bridges in your dealings with others, but even that lesson is overshadowed by selfish and unkind characters who rarely show remorse for their actions or treat anyone with respect, being especially rude to anyone different from themselves. I don't know about you, but I had grandmas who were outspoken but loving and who taught me about personal responsibility and respect. I miss my grandmas. I wish I had missed the movie \"Grandma\" too. \"D\"",

I mean the character played brilliantly by Sam O'Neill. Tomlin is perfect, as are the whole cast. There isn't a trace of phony melodramatics, just a wonderful set of character studies.",

The plot is tightly written, the casting superb, the acting by Lily Tomlin exceptional, and the directing sensitive and consistent. It ranks with some of the best films of the human story in the last several years, not because it is flashy or deep, but because it is credible, honest, and plainly stated for all of the characters.",

ALl of the trailers lesad you to think that it's a comedy...well, if she weren't so vitriolic and mean there may have been humor....but there just wasn't. And I found NO chemistry between grandma and granddaughter. So throw in the fact that many of you will dislike the preaching about abortion and lesbianism and the older woman/younger woman relationship and you've simply got a hot mess.

She is dynamite in this movie with her sharp comedic skills and fantastic timing but still balancing a lot of great dramatic work and compassion for her character who isn't the most likable person in the world. Tomlin really deserves some awards love for this performance I just can't imagine many being better than her this year. Julia Garner is great as well as Tomlin's granddaughter and plays off Tomlin really well. I can't wait to see what else she has in store in her career. Marcia Gay Harden, Judy Greer, and Sam Elliot have limited roles as this is a road trip movie jumping from one house to another trying to find some cash for Tomlin and Davis' characters. All three are incredible in their limited screen time especially Sam Elliot who is on a roll this year with this and I'll See You in My Dreams earlier this year, showing two very different sides to him. The screenplay is fantastic and this is definitely one of Paul Weitz strongest films right up there with About a Boy. I think my only complaint with this movie was it was a little too short and sweet. I wanted a little more out of these characters especially some more backstory to Tomlin and Harden's past relationship woes as well as Tomlin and Greer's struggles. But overall, it is a blast to watch and a tour de force performance from Tomlin that can not be missed.",

    "review": "  In Grandma, Elle (the grandma) tries to borrow money from people she knows for her granddaughter to pay for an abortion scheduled for later that day. The film acts as a road movie as Elle encounters people from her past and the journey becomes more important than the destination. As Elle, Lily Tomlin is funny in her direct and confrontational nature, where she won't take shit from anyone, but the character is much deeper, holding that part of her close to herself and trying to teach Sage, her granddaughter, the same. There's more compassion and purpose in her attitude than one might expect. Her layered performance gives us a sense of her values and her flaws. It's a great performance surrounded by great supporting performances. In Sam Elliot's brief time on screen he conveys a lifetime of hurt from his past with Elle that resonated through the film's entirety. Marcia Gay Harden's performance has that same great effect as she appears late in the film, filling in the missing generational gap between Elle and Sage. She's a tough and obsessively organized woman with a broken relationship between her mother and daughter. Harden communicates this with ease, her life a desperate attempt to maintain an illusion of control. Judy Greer succeeds in showing the experiential gap between her and Elle, and Julia Garner is careful and effective in revealing her Sage's insecurities. Paul Weitz gives each character a unique face and devotes lots of attention to each's personal issues. The dialogue ranges from witty to poignant, and the humor is very well balanced. Weitz wisely chooses not to intervene much with the simple, handheld camerawork, letting his characters speak for themselves.This movie just might fill your heart when Sage and Elle give each other a hug at the end of their long day. We see that Elle is trying to teach her granddaughter self-acceptance in a world where it's too easy to beat yourself up, because life is too short to apologize for who you are. Elle learns something about herself as well, that wanting the best for yourself doesn't mean you can't want the best for others. It's a small film with a big heart that feels true to life, and a hidden gem underneath this year's bigger ticket movies. One of the year's best, in fact.",

Yet when you open to the first scene, you see an older woman (Lily Tomlin) send her lover away. It is a fact of life that there are fights and love dissipates. It is then you realize that maybe this might have more substance. This is a road picture with understated heart; most family looks on and stoically keep their feelings in check when a crisis occurs. Here Lily Tomlin plays a grandmother who fights to understand loves ebb and flow as she also tackles the fact that she has aged. Julia Gardner is not bad as the grand daughter who wishes to get an abortion, yet does not want to tell mom. Their desire to maintain dignity through their faults. Lily Tomlin is amazing and always has delivered honest work. The script gets stronger and eventually delivers the solid landing that completes the journey. Sam Elliot has a wonderful scene as the older woman's ex husband. Actually this is the best written scene in the whole movie. So I recommend this picture and hope that Ms. Tomlin continues to explore new horizons.",

    "review": "  Did I want to see the new movie \"Grandma\" because I'm a grandparent myself? Did I want to see the new movie \"Grandma\" as sort of thank you to Lily Tomlin for her long career? Or did I want to see \"Grandma\" because it was less than 90 minutes long. Well definitely I'll say a little bit of each but any directors of films less than an hour and a half should get a bonus. Let's talk about Lily \"Miss Piss and Vinegar\" Tomlin. For me, my strongest memories of her long career was her characters on \"Rowan and Martin'sLaugh In the the very early 70's. She and others burst onto the scene from that hugely successful comedy show?she was a comedic beast! My next recollection of her was with Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda in the movie \"9-5\" which was hugely popular comedy. I'm sure she has done many other roles but they just don't come to me. I doubt if she was ever up for any post season awards and one could say her career was unremarkable. Yet, she no doubt had a long career in her chosen field (over 40 years) and not many folks can say that. Lets also be candid, Hollywood is not open to roles for women that are not \"knock outs\" or older unless you are an uber box office draw. It was a magical experience for me to see her have a lead role and kill it!! (Like Blythe Danner in \"I'll See You In My Dreams).The moment the movie began and her face appeared on the screen with her sarcastic way of speaking, I just started smiling. Simply I knew would really like her character and this movie. The previews were pretty clear that it's a story about her sort of estranged granddaughter who becomes pregnant and is need in need of money to get an abortion. She turns to her quirky grandmother that she's clearly been disconnected with yet trusts over her CEO, overbearing Mom (Academy Award winner Marcia Gay Harden).So it is all about the journey to find the necessary $600 fee as Tomlin (Elle) reveals her life, friends, partners to her granddaughter (mostly for the 1st time, the Sage (played very well baby Julia Garner) has a 5pm abortion appt. and to her, her back is against the wall. Elle, stops her life to help family and slowly reveals stages of her life as she keeps tracking down \"friends\" over the years to try to get some $.\"Grandma\" very clearly showcases the non-traditional roles and paths of both Grandparents and our youth today?yup, we are not in Mayberry anymore.Made me reflect on how predictable, calm, generally drama-free my life was growing up along with the text book roles my grandparents played in my life as periodic folks in my life. Things were so much cleaner and uncomplicated.Follows Elle & Sage 1 day tale along with the introduction late in the film of ogre Mom and CEO Harden was both a comedy and a drama. As a total package, this film worked VERY WELL and was thrilled to see it. This movie is laced with foul language combined with lots of complicated relationships of family, friends and lovers. So down to earth, so believable, so warm and real.I love that all the lead characters in this movie are female. I love soft,background soundtrack simply supports the mood of the various themes without interfering in any way. The bad language in this film emanates from every single character and pounds home the angst in each characters lives. When used comedically worked, when used to reinforce anger/passion (generally the case), even more effective.SIDE NOTEHow lucky are we to have this BOW TIE theater in Red Bank. Seriously this movie \"Grandma\" and their other film \"Learning To Drive\" (which I reviewed last week) are both magnificent, simple films. Probably neither will gain much in the way of post season nominations nor awards, but boy are they both captivating and immensely enjoyable. Thank you Bow Tie!",

    "review": "  +\"Grandma\" is a movie for every woman, grandmother, mother, daughter, any man who has been involved with the aforementioned, and definitely any fan of Lily Tomlin. She has been a force of nature from her early days in \"Laugh-In\" from 1970-1973 to winning a Grammy for her comedy album in 1972 to an Oscar nomination for her film debut in 1974 in \"Nashville\" and winning a Tony Award in 1985 for the brilliant one woman show her partner of 42 years, Jane Wagner, wrote for her \"The Search For Signs Of Intelligent Life In The Universe\" up to and including a 2015 Emmy nomination for outstanding lead actress in a TV comedy for \"Grace and Frankie\". If there is any justice in the movie business Tomlin should have an Oscar nomination for her role in \"Grandma\".Though her role of Elle is a tour de force for Lily Tomlin she has a strong supporting cast especially Sam Elliot in a scene that is the highlight of the film. Judy Greer, her girlfriend of 4 months, \"Just a footnote\", Elle tells her breaking up with her, Julia Garner as Sage , Elle's granddaughter, Marcia Gay Harden as Elle's daughter, and Sage's boyfriend, Nat Wolff, who is responsible for Sage's pregnancy which puts the story into motion. Laverne Cox as a tattoo artist friend of Elle's, Elizabeth Pena as the owner of a small book store not to forget John Cho as the owner of a coffee shop all have what are basically cameos but each impresses as being chosen for their scenes by the director and screenwriter, Paul Weitz, who wanted the best from each actor and got it.Is Lily Tomlin Elle or is Elle Lily Tomlin? From the public persona of the entertainer we all know, it is hard to decipher if they are separate or combined into one. We see Tomlin's highly skilled comic talents and in her scene with Sam Elliot plus an earlier scene where she grieves for her lover of 38 years, who died a year and a half before the movie starts, we feel the emotional range she can and does show as an actress or is it Lily Tomlin, the woman we think we know? \"Grandma\" is a short film, about 80 minutes including the end credits, that shows Lily Tomlin as an actress who can turn on a dime going from sarcasm to laugh out loud jokes to putting a tear in our eye with, seemingly, little effort. It touches on pregnancy, abortion, independent women, loneliness, growing/being old and what that entails, fleeting fame, how we can hurt people unknowingly, how we hurt each other mostly in short but effective scenes. One scene alone with Elle taking a shower, brushing her teeth, is more than worth the price of admission.",

    "review": "  A small story with a big performance from Lily Tomlin who gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Elle, an elderly woman who recently lost her life partner and is on the rocks with her current, much younger girlfriend. Her day starts when her granddaughter comes to her for help after finding out she is pregnant. The two go on a mini road trip to collect money. At the same time, we are introduced to Elle's past as we meet an array of characters that filled her past. This is where we get to find out who Elle was as a person. This is Tomlin's show and she is sharp, witty, funny, and sentimental. Though this is seen as a comedy, the story is rather sad as it is about regrets and moving on. But, Tomlin is the main reason to see this and she will make you want a grandma like her.Grade: A-",

The main reason to see this film is the performance of Lily Tomin, who just holds the whole movie together with some funny one liners and some some dramatic moments. The film also holds a powerful supporting cast particularly Sam Elliot and Judy Greer. The film has lots of laughs but also intense moments. The writing is extremely well done for such a simple story. I wouldn't put this film in my list of best films of 2016, but would overall say it's a terrific film. My grade=88%(B+).",

    "review": "  ABORT LAST NIGHT - My Review of GRANDMA (3 Stars)Although writer/director Paul Weitz (ABOUT A BOY, AMERICAN PIE) will most likely never be accused of being a visionary auteur, he knows how to move and entertain an audience. GRANDMA, which could easily be dismissed as a totally unambitious, artless slice of life, still managed to hold me in its dry, acerbic spell for its brief 80 minute running time. One of my friends loathed this film, calling it completely unconvincing and poorly acted, and I could have so easily leaned in his direction were it not for my deep, blind love for Lily Tomlin. Even with her terrible films, and yes, I never drank the BIG BUSINESS Kool Aid, I've always appreciated Tomlin's delightfully bitter world view. Her killer smile, commanding voice, and take no prisoners attitude has a special place in my cold, cold heart. She's a comic genius who earned her dramatic chops with her stunning performance in the 1975 classic NASHVILLE. It's been such a long time since Tomlin has starred in a movie and even longer since she's tackled a drama, so I went to GRANDMA ready to savor every delicious minute of it. Sure, she still leans on comedic beats here, but having her front and center in every frame was enough to get me through its \"small time\" feel. Taking place over the course of a single day, Tomlin's Elle Reid has just broken up with her much younger short-term girlfriend (Judy Greer) when her granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner from THE AMERICANS) knocks on her door. Needing an abortion that evening and unable to shoulder the cost, Sage has come begging Elle. A broke ex-poet turned teacher, Elle takes Sage on a journey to drum up the funds, encountering people in their lives with the potential to help. It's an extremely clean, simple premise, giving Tomlin one opportunity after another to rail against anyone who gets in their way.I won't spoil what happens, but the cast of characters they meet consist of some great up-and-coming and established names, including Nat Wolff (PAPER TOWNS) as the idiot who knocks Sage up, the late Elizabeth Pena who is gets to match Tomlin's anger in an amusingly explosive scene, Colleen Camp, who proves that you can mine comedy out of a single line of dialogue, Marcia Gay Harden as Tomlin's severe daughter, Laverne Cox, who unfortunately does very little with her tattoo artist role, and best of all, Sam Elliott, as a man from Elle's past. Most of these characters merely exist to shine a light on Elle's tortured, petty, cruel and stagnant personality, which is ok, because the film, after all, is called GRANDMA, not A BUNCH OF PEOPLE. Moreover, while I would watch Judy Greer in almost anything (which means I did see JURASSIC WORLD), and I find Julia Garner to be a strong, self-possessed young actor, the main attraction is Tomlin. Depending on your stomach for her brand of comic bile, you may end up savoring every moment or end up looking for a moist towelette to wipe the somewhat sitcom-like machinations off of you. I'm, of course, with the former camp, loving that Tomlin has been freed up here to \"dyke out\" for the first time on film, instead of having to pretend to actually enjoying kissing John Travolta, her lookalike in the execrable MOMENT BY MOMENT. Elle's take-no-prisoners brand of feminism along with her Mother Cub protective instincts make her encounters bristle with the energy of a person who's sifted through enough crap in her life. Elle is a complicated character in that she doesn't always do or say the right things, yet Tomlin's command keeps you in the game. There's a fine line between being too Sundance-like and too populist, and GRANDMA walks the tightrope quite well between the two. Yes, it's artless, often obvious, and pretty clear from the start where the whole thing will end up, but that quiet, subtle, long final shot of Tomlin feels earned. You may not know what comes next for this unstable, unreasonable, yet wholeheartedly caring person, but you'll feel confident she can handle it by the end.",

    "review": "  How I wanted to like this movie (despite its lackluster trailer). I love Lily Tomlin (most recently seen on Netflix's�\"Grace and Frankie\"). Not long ago, she appeared on Public Radio International's�Studio 360�to discuss her long career (born in 1939, she made her initial mark on�\"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\"�in 1970), and I was reminded of all of the quirky humor she brings to most of her performances. Unfortunately,�Grandma - though by no means terrible - does not allow much room for her to perform, at all. I blame director Paul Weitz (\"About a Boy\"), since most of the actors give�lazy turns, with one notable exception: Sam Elliott (\"I'll See You in My Dreams\"). And when he's on screen, Tomlin ups her game, as well.Grandma tells the story of young high-school student Sage - played by Julia Garner (\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\"), not up to the task - who shows up on her grandmother's doorstep on the day when Grandma (Tomlin) has just broken up with her much younger girlfriend,�Olivia - played by Judy Greer (\"Archer\"), who is always good, no matter what. Grandma - otherwise known as Elle - is a once-well-known poet who has just paid off all medical debts from her longtime - now deceased - partner's illness. As a consequence, she has no money, and Sage�needs over $600 for an abortion. She won't go to her mother, Judy - played, eventually, by a very strident Marcia Gay Harden (\"Pollock\") - since Mom is everything Grandma is not: uptight, moralistic and structured. It's too bad, though, because Mom also has money.So off Sage and Elle go, in search of friends-of-Grandma to shake down for long-ago debts owed, stopping off at the boyfriend's house first, where said lunkhead threatens the old lady and gets his butt kicked for his pains. In scene after scene, we find�occasionally witty bits of sketch comedy and drama that are just as often weighed down by pedestrian direction. There is very little life on screen. It's as if Weitz were content to have scored Tomlin as his star, only to then forget that a director must guide the actors. So it comes as a sudden surprise when, in a last-ditch effort, Elle drags Sage to an old (male) flame of her own, and we meet Karl (Elliott), who bears a huge grudge towards Elle for how she left him and then wrote about him in a poem. In their scene together, we see what might have been. We feel their history, and actual emotions flow between two human beings. It's a wonder.The rest of the film - divided into six parts, each labelled as if in a poem by Elle (1. endings, 2. ink, 3. apes, etc.) - has its few moments of spark, but mostly it fizzles. When Elle and Judy reach their reconciliation - of sorts - at the end, it has long been expected, and so fails to pack an emotional punch. I wish there were more to recommend here, but at least�there's�\"Grace and Frankie\" available for binge-watching at home. That's not exactly an amazing series, itself, but Tomlin is much better in it than she is here.",

    "review": "  You know the scene in the movies where a rear view mirror in a taxi shows the eyes of the protagonist, and there's an exchange between them and the cabbie? Four times it's happened to me when the driver says, you remind me of... twice and one of those recently, suggesting Shirley MacLaine and twice I was told Lily Tomlin. Yesterday, the eyes the cabbie saw were Lily Tomlin's in the movie Grandma.No, there wasn't a remark that she reminded him of me, the shot moved to her remembering a love that made her laugh, and took her to a place where transformation was an option.Ok, I stood and line yesterday for that movie, telling my friend three times, not to tell me more about a movie, so I won't use up one more word about the plot line. I just want to say that the line waiting for the movie with us, was all wrong, comprised of people who looked like us... over 60 with hip clothes, good haircuts and as my favorite, May Sarton line, \"grandmother (and father) faces\"... Botox and surgery included. With a title like Grandma and starring a septuagenarian, its easy to figure that the demographic attracted will be the star's cohort, but it's an intergenerational story about love and forgiveness and making mistakes and fixing them or not in high school, in mid sophisticated career or late career later life. That Grandma is an academic and author gives license for the writers for thought provoking, funny, smart dialog. That the grandchild is a wise B-student who crosses the street after a dog barks from behind a fence creates a vulnerability that made me care about her safety then and her well being as an adult in development. And in between the generations walked a layer at her treadmill desk, doing the things that gave financial life to her family, and complicated relationships with the one who came before and the one following... not so much in her footsteps. The clich� sandwiched generations, rye, chicken and sour dough. Girls, take your mom's to this movie. Mom's take your mom's to this movie. Mom's take your daughters and grand daughters to this show. I wish I could. I wish I knew what my mom really experienced instead of what I made up from what I saw and the snippets, the highlights of stories she revealed. I wish I had an opportunity to ask her to tell me the back stories of the turning points in her life. Reminding me of, The Turning Point, a wonderful Shirley McLain movie, and, of my own turning point, Lily Tomlin's, Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe... which my sister and I saw live on Christmas day the first year my son went off to his father's family to celebrate without me.",
