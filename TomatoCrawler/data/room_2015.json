    "review": "  Hard hitting drama with incredibly touching performances, something quite rare this day and age. A real master stroke was to focus on the awakening of a boy as he senses and suffers existence; it makes you feel part of his progression and realizations, as he initially enters the world with his mind prone to fantasy and un aware of inhumanity.",

    "review": "  It's hard to think of a more emotionally grueling and uplifting movie this year than Room. It drops you right into a scary world and, thanks to its carefully balanced tone, the film eschews sensationalism and gets at the beating heart of its survival story, namely the love and protection of a mother for her son. It is an emotionally powerful story that hits the big moments, the small moments, and everything in between. It left me analyzing it and rethinking it for hours, the repercussions still reverberating through me. Ma (Brie Larson) has been held in a single soundproof room for seven years, the captive of an older man who is termed \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers). Complicating matters is that Ma has a five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) born into this captivity. It is the only world he's known. To spare him the full horror of their circumstances, Ma has created an elaborate world for him that only exists in Room. After his fifth birthday, Ma tries speaking honestly to her son, lifting the veil of kind fabrications. Together they will scheme to escape their one-room world, but it comes with tremendous cost. It would be easy to fall onto the more seemly elements of this harrowing story and linger on just how bad things are and the horrifying lengths that Ma has to go through to survive. Director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) doesn't have to wallow in depravity to get its point across. There's a sensitivity that manages to temper some of the abuse in a manner that won't make you run out of the room screaming. When Old Nick enters the room for his special time with Ma, we don't need explicit detail to understand what is happening and what Ma is shielding Jack from by demanding he stay in the closet. The reality of their captivity is enough without underlining the worst of the worst for the lowest common denominator. The emotional weight of everything is clear without having to be bludgeoned. The implications are always just peaking around the corners from the safer version of reality Ma has proposed to protect her child. As the audience, we can see the cracks, we can see her front, and we can see the effort and the toll it's taking on Ma. The stakes are clear as well, and so when Ma is instructing Jack and preparing him on their joint escape plan, you'll start to feel waves of anxiety travel through your body. I was shaking with suspense that something could go wrong but also because Ma and Jack are such vulnerable characters that rely upon one another completely. I knew what was going to happen in broad strokes but I was still on the edge of my seat and that's because the movie made me deeply care about the characters and their plight. The escape scene was on par with some of the better suspense sequences in the equally brilliant Sicario. It's not really a spoiler to say that Ma and Jack do get out of their one-room prison because the second half of the film deals with the ongoing consequences and challenges of adjustment. We'd like to think that we can be plugged into our old lives after spending time away, but that's just not how things work, let alone for people who have experienced substantial psychological and physical trauma. Ma is struggling to readjust to her old life under the care of her mother, Nancy (Joan Allen). She looks through old high school pictures and you can tell she laments \"what could have been\" and even bears some resentment for her old friends who got to live the lives she should have had. Just because she's free doesn't mean she's better. Her father Robert (William H. Macy), since divorced from Ma's mother, can't even look at Jack because of the pain it causes; Jack is a child of rape, but Ma demands he be acknowledged as her flesh-and-blood, and even that can be too much too soon for Robert. He's more about seeking justice through the courts and as a result stays on the peripheral of the story for most of the movie. There is no exact time table for PTSD and Ma goes through highs and lows, none lower than when pressed with the question of why she held onto Jack after he was born. Would he not have had a better life in someone else's care, assuming Old Nick would have abandoned him rather than kill his own blood? It's a hard question and it stings. For an obviously punishing story about the worst of humanity, I am not kidding when I say Room is an uplifting film. The darkness is easy to identify and Old Nick is a fearsome and all too real antagonist, one who could roam our very streets in anonymity. However, what stays with me several days after watching Room is not the suffering but the resiliency of spirit, the knack human beings have to persevere amidst the worst. Ma's recovery is rockier but more understandable for us to trace and relate with. Hers is an experience where she can finally begin to focus on something other than her child's safety and deliverance, namely her own well-being. For Jack, there is no playbook. He's spent his entire life inside a small room and never seen the outside world. His sense of understanding has been extremely limited and yet his sense of exploration is alive. Jack slowly and surely builds trusting relationships with Ma's relatives, engaging in other activities, and acclimating to his new surroundings, reforming his sense of the world. It's ultimately Jack who is able to make the greatest breakthrough to his mother, and it's this moment of sacrifice and love that unleashed the last torrent of my tears. Previously I had cried two times over the horrors and Ma's love as her strength, and it was this final moment, this sharing of his \"Strong,\" that let loose the happy tears. It should go without saying but Larson gives an exceptionally powerful performance. After 2013's stupendous Short Term 12, I knew this actress was destined for great things, especially the way she can zero in on a character and inhabit them fully. With Ma (she's never given any other name) Larson is able to convey a multitude of emotions, many of which she has to hide from her son out of loving deference. He can't know just how scared and exhausted she is, though these emotions do take over at time. Larson is tremendous as she exhumes maternal might as she does everything in her power to save the two of them. Early on, she's the character we empathize with the most because she's had her world taken from her and hoping to return. She's so resourceful, from the way she's able to answer her son's questions about the world, to the way she's able to practice and drill their escape plan to a child with no concept of \"outside,\" this is a powerful woman driven by the instinct to endure. When Larson's fa�ade breaks down with Jack, that's when the movie started stabbing me like daggers. In the second half, her character has a long road to go to recovery, if that's even an appropriate word, and Larson gives sensitive and empathetic consideration to every exhausted development. She is easily going to be the one to beat this year for the Best Actress Oscar.Paired with Larson is the remarkably natural child actor Jacob Tremblay, and his performance is worthy of awards consideration itself. At first his worldview is precocious because of how unique it is, which makes him more a figure of fascination than tragedy. He's bright and active with the world around him, turning household items into useful toys and emotional attachments. The film uses parts of his narration to give better insight into just how he's processing the world he knows versus the world as it exists. These bouts of narration never come across as cloying. As the movie continues, he learns more about how his preconceptions of the world are wrong, but he's more intrigued than frightened. During the escape plan, when Jack gets to see the outside world for the first time, it's a transcendent emotional moment. His guarded behavior around others is necessary as Jack builds positive associations with men who are not Old Nick. Tremblay is utterly magnificent; there is no hint of artifice to his performance, which is especially rewarding considering his is a role that could have been suffocated with eccentricities and tics. You feel like you're watching a child grow before you through supportive nurturing. Within the first twenty minutes of watching Room I already knew this was one of the best films of 2015. It just connects so vividly and succinctly, effortlessly powerful and yet skillfully avoiding sensationalism and exploitation while telling an entertaining survival story that still resonates with emotional truth. The performances from mother and son are outstanding and Larson and Tremblay form a heroic duo that take hold of your heart. It doesn't mitigate the darkness or the cruel realities of its premise but Room also doesn't dwell in the darkness, castigating its characters as hapless victims forever broken from their incalculable suffering. They are resourceful and resilient and while their trauma is will not be forgotten it is not the one defining moment of their burgeoning lives. It may sound maudlin but it is the power of love that resonates the longest with Room. That love at first is about protecting the innocent, and then it transforms into healing and acceptance. I hope everybody gets a chance to see Room, a remarkable film with two remarkable performances and plenty to say about the humanizing benefit of love. Nate's Grade: A",

    "review": "  Simple yet profound, small yet grande, \"Room\" is one of the most complex and thought-provoking films I have seen in a very long time. Maybe not complex to everyone, if you look at the imagery, camerawork, and script choices, there really is something incredible here. After being raised in a room for five years, with no outdoor contact, Jack and his Ma Joy escape and see daylight for the first in a long time. Told through the perspective of the child, he is seeing the world, people, objects, and nature, all for the first time. The emotional impact that has on the story is breathtaking. Brie Larson gives a gut-wrenching performance and I believed every single scene she was in. Starting from a confined room, you really begin to see what the world is truly like and how we take everything for granted that is in it. I loved \"Room\" from start to finish. Although I believe this is a brilliant film overall, I have to complain about the way they were able to escape. It felt a little too easy and then that tension was gone throughout the rest of the film in order to focus on the emotional heft, i.e. the family. In the end, \"Room\" has a very raw and true screenplay, incredible performances, inspiring visuals, and a story that is once in a generation, and we do not get many of those. I wish it did not have an easy way out in the opening act, but overall, I feel I can still give it a perfect score. See this film!",

    "review": "  Room is a masterwork that tells a story of captivity and the wonders of the real world. Its a very sad story, but also a hopeful one. Brie Larson gives one of the best performances I have seen in quite a long time. She is a revelation. Her dark, truthful, scared and emotional performance is something truly fascinating. She puts her soul into this character, and it pays off in spades. A few months ago I honestly didn't know much of her, but now I see her as one of the most promising new actresses in the business. Jacob Tremblay further proves my belief that child actors can truly make our jaws drop. Tremblay deserves all the praise in the world for his heartwarming and complex performance, completely capturing the mindset of a young boy being introduced to the world for the first time. Its something truly spectacular, and I kept going back and forth trying to decide if he or Larson stole the show. They both really worked perfectly together. Joan Allen is another underrated performance, as she gives a sweet and loving performance as the grandmother. Her giving a brilliant performance as a mother who lost her daughter and attempts to have a relationship with her grandson is heartwarming. The script from Emma Donoghue is something truly spectacular. She gives us a terrifying real look into the minds of these characters and bringing life to their situation. There was a moment halfway through the film that had me in tears and cheering. Its amazing that a fictional story could feel so much like a true story. Director Lenny Abrahamson",

    "review": "  STUCK HOME SYNDROME - My Review of ROOM (4 Stars)Don't let the bright wonderment of the poster fool you, ROOM is one of the most emotionally devastating films of the year, anchored by beyond stellar performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, a young Canadian actor whose focus and range rivals that of Tatum O'Neal in PAPER MOON. Prepare to be gutted. It's almost impossible to describe this film without spoilers, but I'll do just that. If you've read Emma Donoghue's novel, of which she adapted for the screen, then you already know the basic premise of a mother (Larson) raising her 5-year-old son, Jack (Tremblay) in a tiny room. Shielding him from the world for reasons that become clear upon viewing, he doesn't know that any type of life exists beyond his four walls. Think of this as a much more emotionally vibrant and more honest sister film to LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, which also explored the lengths a parent will go to in order to protect their child. Much of the first half of this film is fraught with unbearable suspense, with the mother doing everything she can to resolve their situation. Danny King, whose work on LES MISERABLES did not make me a fan, employs a live camera and a lot of shallow focus to put the point of view squarely on the shoulders of our two protagonists. Yes, it's a claustrophobic experience, but to feel otherwise would be doing the subject matter a disservice. Director Lenny Abrahamson has made an intimate film about big ideas, and there's very smart economy in its storytelling. It's overlong by at least 20-30 minutes, however, and with such a generous running time of almost two hours, you would expect a little more to William H. Macy's lightly sketched in, barely there character. It's not that he's incapable, but he's given way too little to work with here. Not so of Joan Allen, who digs deep with limited screen time as well. Also tremendously effective in supporting roles are Sean Bridgers, who has a knack for keeping an audience on edge, Wendy Crewson as a journalist who prods just a little bit too much, and Amanda Brugel, as a woman who has to assert herself in order to cut through the muck. I could have done without the tin can-style of recording the voiceover, which certainly feels unsettling, but was truly difficult to comprehend at times. The score by Stephen Rennicks is certainly beautiful and heartfelt, but he could have dialed it back a hair with the final music cue. There was so much sap in it, I was tempted to call the film MUSHROOM! Far from it, this is a challenging experience, often seen through tears, and not an easy sit for any parent who worries about their child. Larson and Tremblay should be firmly in the mix come Awards season. Larson continually surprises me with her performances. Looking like Reese Witherspoon's sister, I keep expecting her to act goofy and self-conscious, yet her instincts are so vibrantly attuned to the material, she seems incapable of making a false move. Whether he has natural abilities or was heavily directed, Tremblay is a highly sympathetic actor whose ability to annoy, infuriate and warm an audience's heart, sometimes within the same scene, is something special to behold. ROOM is very dark, sad, and sometimes without a shred of hope, yet this tale of a Herculean bond between mother and son is well worth all the sobbing you'll likely find yourself doing afterwards.",

Though Room has a few minor errors, such as a final act that feels like it could have benefitted from an additional scene or two of development, there are very few films that have had me as emotionally invested in a story as Room, making it one of the best movies of the year. And if that isn't enough, one sequence in the film had me on the edge of my seat more than any sequence in a film this year.",

    "review": "  Based on a bestselling Emma Donnaghue novel, Room (not to be confused with the cult B-movie THE Room) tells the morbid story of a young woman who was kidnapped, held inside a small, soundproof dungeon of a room, raped, and gave birth to her captor's child. The film opens up in medias res with this young mother in her seventh year of captivity, trying to survive in squalid conditions with her young son and teach him about a world he has never seen. The first act shows some of the most claustrophobic and focused filmmaking this year. We are stuck with these characters in this doomed situation, with only hints of the outside world. Brie Larson impresses us as the young woman who was denied years of her life and we see how her imprisonment and its aftermath have worn on her. Jacob Tremblay also deserves some recognition for convincingly playing a boy who has never traveled more than five feet from where he was born and never met a person other than his mother. Room loses steam toward the end and fails to recapture the engrossing magic that had us at the edge of our seat for the first 35 minutes, but it still has a simple and definitive end that most awards season fare denies the audience. A must see.",

It's dramatic, emotional, suspenseful and a phenomenal film. The story is intense and heartbreaking (times 4 or 5). The acting performances of Brie Larson and young Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscar recognition. While I haven't seen all the performances nominated thus far, young Jacob Tremblay is jaw-dropping. I was excited to see Brie Larson, one of my favorites, finally show her stuff, and that she did. I hope she gets the win. However, Jacob blew me away. There were no words to describe how incredible his performance is for someone so young. Better than any adult actor I've seen this year. I'm serious. There is an incredible career in the making there. The screenplay, based on the novel of the same name, is beautiful. Aside from one scene that bugged me a little, the dialogue is so real. The director did a masterful job pulling the screenplay, performances and the perspective of \"Room\" against the much larger world Brie and Jacob are denied for so long. I'm so glad at least 3 of the 8 Best Pic nominees are worthy.",

    "review": "  How many times in your life have you been forced to finish a bad movie, book, or story, all the while just wishing it would end? Rarely is that longing as desperate in our reality as it is for the characters in Room. When Jack screams at his Ma, \"I want a different story!\", you know there's more to it than just a hunger for a different bedtime yarn. Her response, \"No! This is the story you get!\", punctuates their situation, and ultimately our own desires, with such force it nearly knocked me out. Room, a powerhouse of horrifying drama and real-life suspense, breaks out from its confining premise with enough gentle moments of love to make it one of the year's best.If you can't tell, I'm being careful with the details of the plot. However, know that it's a setup that's about as bleak as one can imagine. Director Abrahamson (maker of the criminally underrated Frank) creates an atmosphere of intensely palpable desperation in his small sets. In lesser hands, Room could've been either an oppressively gloomy downer or dishonestly optimistic hack-job. Instead, it's both strikingly candid and beautifully grace-filledThis compassion for its subjects is thanks in no small part to the much-deserved-Oscar-nominated Larson, and young actor Tremblay. His character, in particular, presents such a powerful look at childish na�vet�, he gives us one of the most amazing examples childhood trauma and perseverance I've ever seen. That theme (determination through suffering) creates an experience that harbors as much exhilaration as it does tears. Piercing and gut-wrenching, Room is a film you may want to escape, but will be glad you endured.",

    "review": "  \"Room\"is a beautiful movie. It does not rely on special effects, guns, sex, action scenes or anything like that. Instead the movie mainly relies on the love of a mother for her son and her ability to go through almost anything just to keep her son alive and well. The acting is brilliant, especially Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley (this boy is definitely going places!). It is a bittersweet movie, hard to watch at times, but a great piece of modern cinema. 4/5 stars",

He is how we experience and learn about the world that is Room. Though I'm not gaga over the film I did enjoy what was presented and how it was presented. It is both dark and horrifying while also containing hope and humour. Considering the subject matter involved... this is a welcomed choice by all those involved.",

But somehow they pulled it off and made one of the beast movies of the year! It was great to see how the story unfold and how exciting, heartbreaking and harrowing it was told. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are fantastic and have great chemistry together. Also a shout out to Joan Allen doing great job as Brie Larson's Grandma. It can be really sad but could have been really depressing where it is almost unwatchable, but there is so much hope and that is where it really shines!",

    "review": "  Based on a bestselling Emma Donnaghue novel, Room (not to be confused with the cult B-movie THE Room) tells the morbid story of a young woman who was kidnapped, held inside a small, soundproof dungeon of a room, raped, and gave birth to her captor's child. The film opens up in medias res with this young mother in her seventh year of captivity, trying to survive in squalid conditions with her young son and teach him about a world he has never seen. The first act shows some of the most claustrophobic and focused filmmaking this year. We are stuck with these characters in this doomed situation, with only hints of the outside world. Brie Larson impresses us as the young woman who was denied years of her life and we see how her imprisonment and its aftermath have worn on her. Jacob Tremblay also deserves some recognition for convincingly playing a boy who has never traveled more than five feet from where he was born and never met a person other than his mother. Room loses steam toward the end and fails to recapture the engrossing magic that had us at the edge of our seat for the first 35 minutes, but it still has a simple and definitive end that most awards season fare denies the audience. A must see.",

    "review": "  ROOM Review - Jack FitzpatrickSimply put, \"Room\" is an emotional film. And it seems as though half the time you do not even know what you're feeling. Seamlessly the film manages to portray happiness in a tragic way, depressingly dark situations yet also present some optimism and make you feel genuinely scared and/or worried about its fictional characters. Room is emotional in a very real sense; it's not just another movie where a romance falls apart, or where a loved one gets a terminal illness and it doesn't tug on your heart strings with cheap bullshit. Room doesn't try to trick you into feeling things, its realistic tone and grim story is enough. Not to make light of the cinematography, music or any of anything else which made the film, these are all good too, however we are really in this one for the writing and acting; the story and characters. The film follows its protagonists as they live their day to day lives trapped inside a small dirty room with no way out. Locked in by a nameless man that they call 'Old Nick,' (Who by the way totally looks like Will Ferrell's cousin or something...) The characters are a mother and son 'Jack,' 'Ma' has been inside this room for seven years and her son has never experienced anything beyond the room in his life. For around half of the movie we stay in the room with these characters, we as an audience never leave the room until the characters do. Personally I was beginning to feel the claustrophobia myself, the movie makes you feel as trapped as the characters are. The room feels hopeless as it does small and the atmosphere is actually quite haunting. Now though, that Jack is five years old, Ma believes that it's now time and that he is finally old enough to help her make their escape. Through a series of events, the two do make it out of the room, however we are still only about half way through the film as we follow their lives after leaving 'room.' The films point of no return; leaving 'room' is both scary and cheerful for both us and the characters in the film. The juxtaposition of being stuck in the room and the freedoms of such an open and unknown world is mind blowing. Yet, before they leave and it is uncertain whether they will succeed or not, you almost don't want them to try. Jack pleads his mother to wait till he is six years old and this is a terrifying theme throughout the film; Comfort and security over freedom. Jack's life and world may have been horrible, however the thought of leaving was frightening and almost made no sense to Jack. The movie manages to portray a horrible situation without feeling like a cheap horror movie, this is to be taken seriously and manages to portray despicable acts and conditions of the characters, without reverting to gross out moments or cartoonish dark villains. The villain of the film, is definitely disgusting and hateable, but ultimately is not the point of the film. The maturity of the film dealing with a sickening character and subject is appreciated. Another running theme of this film was the experience - or really inexperience of five-year-old Jack. He'd never known anything beyond this one room his entire life, basically; 'room' was his world. And this is such an interesting concept to me. Jack's concepts of fiction and reality blur and at such an age he is vulnerable to information. It's important to learn the truth however almost incomprehensible due to his extremely limited knowledge. Possibly my favourite shot of the film, has Jack creating shadows with his hands in the partial sunlight that comes through via sunlight. This shot has obvious relation to 'The Allegory of the Cave' philosophical theory. Put simply, if a caveman never leaves his cave, and all he ever sees are shadows, this is what he believes in, this becomes his reality. And the same goes for the child in the film. 'Room' is all he knows, and beyond stories he's told or what he sees on their television, Jack's sense of reality is inaccurate. He knows about animals such as dogs and cats, he knows about grass and trees and he knows about general bits of information, however due to his isolation he cannot separate reality from fiction and therefore will not know which things are real and which are not. A dragon for example is as real or fake as a dog in his mind. The themes throughout the film and the emotion that these themes bring are all portrayed through the actors; who all did a fine job, but the performance that really stood out was child actor Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Children are often not the best actors, they're still young; still learning, but this kid is ahead of his time, ahead of his age really. For such a thematically complex film as well as a mature and grim one, Tremblay did an amazing job making me believe in his character, as well as his collaboration with Brie Larson as mother and son, their relationship is strong and convincing. This would also be thanks to upcoming director Lenny Abrahamson whom I've never seen any works by, however this seems to be an early work of a promising career. (He also directed \"Frank,\" and \"What Richard Did.\"The film gave me chills when it needed to in moments of pure intensity the beautiful moments were made that much nicer in comparison to the dreary and depressing ones. It even gave me a new perspective on the world and the way we might look at it. What if we are all experiencing some version of Jack and Ma's 'room?' But, this is just a movie review, I don't want to get too philosophical. \"Room\" is saddening yet uplifting. It may be hard to watch for some yet I'd think also hard to stop watching, and overall the film has the ability to change ones' perspective. \"Room\" is shocking, yet beautiful and most of all unforgettable. This is Drama at its' best. 10/10",

    "review": "  I remember seeing a trailer for \"Room\" months back in 2015 and being almost entirely mystified; it looked like a strange, almost ethereal mix of drama and science-fiction that even the trailer couldn't adequately communicate. Not until seeing it, I realized that this is a film that isn't easy to summarize in a brief two minute trailer, and I'll undoubtedly struggle to illustrate the film's genius with its review. This is the kind of film one needs to experience and feel; a film where words often feel either exaggerating or shortchanging in attempting to illustrate the film's emotional power and exceptional narrative.Simply put, \"Room\" is the emotional moviegoing experience of the season. A deeply moving film that combines the aforementioned genres of drama and science-fiction, \"Room\" is the kind of film that hits you with its most powerful shot after you walk out of the theater or turn off the TV. It lingers in your mind and the characters, their motivations, their conversations, their struggles, and their thoughts don't escape you, unlike most dramas, where character names are probably not even remembered by most following the end credits.The film opens with a young mother named Joy (Brie Larson) and her small child named Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who live their life in an enclosed garden shed of about one-hundred square feet and their only available sunlight is a skylight. They eat, sleep, bathe, and cook in there, and for Jack, it's the only life he has come to know. At first, their routine actions and close relationship lead one to believe that they've chosen this life in order to free themselves from the constraints of society. However, we see the horror of their reality soon enough. Seven years ago, Joy was tricked and kidnapped by a man known as \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers), who raped her and had her give birth to Jack. Since then, she has lived inside this closed space; it isn't until their escape-plan is successful that Joy goes back to her mother and father and Jack finally experiences the outside world. Previously, Jack believed, largely in part of his mother, who tried to make their life seem a lot less hellish, that outside of the four walls of \"room,\" as they referred to it, was outer space. The people on TV were just flat, and nothing else besides them and Old Nick existed. Upon finally escaping and trying to return to a life that seems brand new to them, Joy struggles to get Jack to assimilate to the world. His entire life was predicated upon just him and his \"Ma,\" as he was largely kept hidden in the closet whenever Old Nick would come pay them a visit. Now, he must be socialized into the world at age five, and learn that there is not only a larger life, but a larger world outside of \"room.\" His mother, on the other hand, must grapple with her demons that have haunted her since she was captured.If you look at \"Room\" from the perspective of Joy, you find a drama about being re-socialized into the world after living your entire life in captivity. It's a familiar story, but one that is truly sad and potent, and Brie Larson brings such life and emotion to the role for a woman so young (her precocious acting reminds me quite a bit of Jennifer Lawrence). However, if you look at the film through Jack's perspective, you see a film that plays with the realm of science-fiction. While nothing about \"Room\" deals with supernatural or \"the unknown\" in a grandiose sense, we do have a character who has never experienced life first-hand and sees everything around him not only as foreign but, for lack of a better term, alien. This results in a film that's very lucid and ethereal, largely in part because of Lenny Abrahamson's (who directed 2014's \"Frank,\" a strong film dealing with mental illness) unique direction and cinematographer Danny Cohen's dreamlike grasp on reality. These beautiful and immersive aesthetic choices make the world and everything we take for granted and overlook on a daily basis look as if it's an unearthly object, with extreme close-ups and high-contrast depictions employed by Abrahamson. \"Room\" is a film largely bent on repetition; everything from Joy and Jack's daily actions in \"room,\" Jack's attempts to socialize with other adults, Joy's attempt to come to terms with returning to her old life, and more are all showcased as recurring events in the film. This slowburn narrative tactic allows character motivations and interest to rise and boil accordingly, creating a film that turns impacting and even emotional when bigger, more elaborate events occur (the truck scene may be one of the best sequences I've seen in film last year). With all that and more considered, \"Room\" is a wonderful treat of a film; one that will hit everyone differently in a sense that it's not a matter of if it will resonate with you but how it will eventually manage to do so.",

    "review": "  Beautiful story telling. Both this film and The Revenant are about resilience and the power of the human spirit to overcome, but the way that theme is portrayed here is a polar opposite of how it is dealt with in The Revenant. Brie Larson gives a performance that encompasses the intensity of her character's trauma, but does so with admirable subtlety rather than scenery chewing grand moments and demonstrates remarkable dignity and a sad sort of maturity that seems to be ingrained in the character due to the terrible events she lived with for seven years. The character and Larsen's performance reminded me very much of the kind of work we have seen from Mary Louise Parker. Jacob Trembley is brilliant as her five year old son. I do not know if the child was just that amazing an actor or if it involved excellent directorial and editing skills, but his performance is flawless. He carries the same sense of quiet about him that Larson does as his Mother, which demonstrates a detailed consistency that is spot on considering he only knew her and one place for the first five years of his life. The score is also perfectly subtle and reflects the feeling of the film brilliantly. The supporting cast of Joan Allen, William H. Macy, and Tom McCamus were also strong and their performances are consistent with the subdued intensity that characterizes the entire movie. This across the board consistency in all aspects of the film, from the colors, to the music, to the performances is what makes this such a standout work of movie making. It would have been easy to fall into soapy territory, but it never goes there. It is just pure storytelling with a director who very clearly had a vision of how he wanted this story told and carried out his vision down to even the smallest details. Excellent work.",

    "review": "  I was beginning to lose faith in the Academy's selection capability considering I've only really liked 2 of the Best Pic nominees so far, or consider them worthy. \"Room\" is a traditional Academy darling, and rightfully so. It's dramatic, emotional, suspenseful and a phenomenal film. The story is intense and heartbreaking (times 4 or 5). The acting performances of Brie Larson and young Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscar recognition. While I haven't seen all the performances nominated thus far, young Jacob Tremblay is jaw-dropping. I was excited to see Brie Larson, one of my favorites, finally show her stuff, and that she did. I hope she gets the win. However, Jacob blew me away. There were no words to describe how incredible his performance is for someone so young. Better than any adult actor I've seen this year. I'm serious. There is an incredible career in the making there. The screenplay, based on the novel of the same name, is beautiful. Aside from one scene that bugged me a little, the dialogue is so real. The director did a masterful job pulling the screenplay, performances and the perspective of \"Room\" against the much larger world Brie and Jacob are denied for so long. I'm so glad at least 3 of the 8 Best Pic nominees are worthy.",

    "review": "  Powerful & inspiring drama thanks to two brilliant lead performances & Lenny Abrahamson's direction that takes you into the horror of both living inside & out of such a situation. Larson is extraordinary as Joy, and wisely doesn't play her as a saint but a young woman doing the best she can in a hellish situation. She's paired wonderfully with Jacob Tremblay as her son, who convey's a wonderful mix of terror & wonder as a young boy experiencing the world for the first time. Honestly, you want to talk about an Oscar snub, Tremblay should be on that list. Behind the camera, Abrahamson does a superb job putting you into Joy & Jack's world, both inside the room and then later when they escape, especially by focusing on the perspective of Jack (simple things like the sky & trees never looked so strange & wondrous). The filmmakers also don't shy away from hard questions, including decisions Joy makes, which may seem cruel but do make some points. Overall, a truly inspiring film of survival and one of the best of the 2015.",

I can't remember the last time a film literally took my breath away. I couldn't even talk about this movie for about a half hour after it ended.Newcomer Jacob Tremblay is also fantastic in a performance worthy of a grizzled, seasoned veteran. Add in some solid supporting work from William H. Macy and Joan Allen, pitch-perfect direction from Lenny Abrahamson and a perfectly written screenplay, and you have the makings of the best film of 2015. Given the subject matter, Room manages to do the near-impossible: create an uplifting movie going experience without in any way minimizing the horror that is the basis for the plot.

This movie was really well made, but I wanted to stop watching it very soon into the film because of the disturbing subject matter. I've never seen a movie like this. Spotlight is disturbing on a less personal level, even though it happened in real life. Of course, this could have easily happened and similar stories have happened.I did have a few problems with the movie--mostly the pacing and the structure. It felt like the movie could have ended multiple times--which I guess might have been intentional, but the real ending was powerful and moving.The film certainly tries to inspire and have meaning, but for me it's just too overwhelming in how disturbing it is.",

Jacob Tremblay, who plays Jack, is only 10 years old and is absolutely brilliant in his role in a beautiful natural performance. Brie Larson (21 Jump Street) is also perfect as Jack's mother. The minimal soundtrack means that we are immersed in the story without distraction and Lenny Abrahamson, the director, has done an excellent job in conveying the claustrophobic nature of Room and the fear of freedom within the short time of a movie making us feel the emotions of the characters. ROOM is a profound exploration of the challenges of parenting, the relationship between mother and child, social expectations that undermine parents, the formation and modification of world view, acceptance, freedom - so much to think about. Don't miss this harrowing, completely believable, rewarding movie.",

While Jack now five years old, spent the whole life in that \"Room\", not knowing that there is a life outside the \"Room\".I started to watch every movie nominated for Best Picture, and Room is the second one after Spotlight. I had a feeling that there weren't a lot of great movies this year, but I'm happy to say that I was wrong.Room is another pure drama that will be stuck in my head for a long time. A masterpiece story by novelist Emma Donoghue directed by Lenny Abrahamson in perfection. Very touching, with great characters and great acting job.Jacob Tremblay is so young, I don't know if this kind of story would be a good idea for someone of his age, I mean psychologically. However, he was great and one of the things that I enjoyed most about the film. It felt like reality show. I feel sorry that he wasn't nominated for Oscar.One of the part that I liked the most was when Jack narrates his feeling inside and outside the \"Room\".

Even though half of the film is spent in one small room Larson and NINE year old Jacob Tremblay are not limited in the range they have as actors. Larson is about to explode into becoming a house hold name much like Jennifer Lawrence did with Winter's Bone. If you don't believe me watch Short Term Twelve, Larson's previous staring role.

The characters each go through their own ups and downs and the film lets you spectate these moments as if you were there with them. This is one of those films where you will find yourself laughing, crying, scared, nervous, joyous, and wholly engaged in the film. Room to me felt a bit too long but overall a very well made film.",

    "review": "  I bet the film \"Room\" has been playing down at the priceless AsburyPark theatre \"The Showroom\" for 5 to 6 weeks. I really wanted to see itfrom the first preview I saw and as it kept playing at The Showroom forso many weeks (in Movie time) I knew it had to be special. Despite gettingsome nice year end nominations and awards, it was sort of like driving withthe low on gas light on. I knew I was really pushing it if I didn't remedythe situation soon (hint, hint folks). So I did and boy was I happy.I really don't want to talk much about the movie itself because it has avery narrow scope and the previews give you a very good idea of what it is about.However it is one extraordinary script & acting \"Oh My\". BrieLarson (Ma) and Jacob Tremblay (Jack) so quickly transform you fromthinking to you are watching a movie to thinking a watching a truedocumentary.You could see and feel the movie 100% thru the eyes of Jack and watchinghis innocence combined with his quick smart mind at times battle each otherwas exceptional. No clues how Mr. Tremblay really is, but playing a fiveyear old, he did an exceptional job, EXCEPTIONAL.This film reminded me a bit of \"Boyhood\" from last year due to its novel,unique, special story that is quite unforgettable. No doubt, I will flashto this movie several times in my over the next few weeks as I see aheroic \"All In\" Mom or precocious yet innocent child thoroughly enjoyingthe world of make believe and the reality of new things.I will leave it there...GO SEE TODAY. Really good stuff. Near 2 hourmovie fly!",

    "review": "  A mother and her son, which looks like a girl, live in a room that has no windows, a locked door, and no light other than that coming through an overhead skylight. Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a bright five-year old boy with hair down to his shoulders wakes up every morning saying hello to his universe. He does not greet the sun, the grass, the trees outside, where he could run and laugh and play like a normal five-year old but only to the objects he knows for five years as being \"the real world\", his world: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds, thinking that the mouse also lives in that little world, the only one real for him. Sometimes a man comes over, during the night, and then Jack must sleep in the wardrobe, not to be seen. The relationship mother-son appears to be normal: they cook, dance, laugh, stretch out, read about Alice, mother tells the tale of Monte Cristo. The poverty that surrounds them is not painful. The real pain and anger I felt when Jack could not believe that outside \"the room\" exists a real world, with real people, and trees, grass, leaves, seasons, snow. Then the reality strikes: captivity. A child born in captivity, because of a madman, a rapist. A story of a child whose life started in a cage having as a talisman his mother love and her tooth, thinking that \"his strong\" is in his long hair. Real world proves to be scarier than \"the room\". A movie that should be seen, a story that must be known, a boy that deserves all the awards: Jacob Tremblay.",

    "review": "  \"Room\" is one of the most vivid movies that you will ever see. The concept is fascinating: A woman is inexplicably trapped in a room with her five-year-old son. That's all. As the story unfolds, we learn details of how long they have been there and where their food comes from; however, the mystery continues to be preserved as we are left to fill in the rest with our imaginations. There are so many things that I would love to say but I want everybody to be just as surprised and on the edge of your seat as I was. In fact, this film contains ten of the most intense minutes that you will ever see in any movie. I swear, there came a point where I had to remind myself to breath. The story is an endless series of emotional highs and lows that create a deep connection between the characters and the audience. These emotional moments are enhance by a powerful musical score by Stephen Rennicks. Its absence reinforces the hopelessness and isolation of being trapped in the room, but then the score soars when it needs to enhance the joyous and devastating moments. I find that the most poetic piece of the film stems from one of the darkest psychological implications: The mental well-being of this young boy is completely dependent upon his mother but, when everything turns, he suddenly needs to become her strength in a time of need. Again, I'm doing my best to avoid any spoilers so you will just have to see it for yourself. The acting is astounding. Brie Larson will take home an Oscar for the endless number of emotions that she vividly portrays throughout the film. Her character is simply known as \"Ma,\" a constant reminder that she has been stripped of her identity and her entire world is her son. She doesn't need a cape to turn her character into a hero. Jacob Tremblay was equally amazing. It is rare that I believe that a child performance deserved an Oscar nomination but his acting is highly refined and brings out a lot of our emotions. He holds his own against Larson's Oscar-nominated performance and isn't merely along for the ride. The realism of this story is further enhanced by its supporting cast. Joan Allen has been out of vogue for awhile but she delivers her best performance in years. It took a lot to steal the spotlight from Larson and Tremblay, but she definitely had her moment. Also, the very presence of William H. Macy adds a brief but necessary complication to this story. There comes a point where you start dreading that the ending will spoil the entire story. Dreading that, no matter what the ending, it won't live up to the rest of the film. But Emma Donoghue creates the perfect conclusion that allows this story to come full circle. One of the best pieces of advice that I can give is that you should NOT watch the trailer! Just take my word for it and blindly walk into this film. \"Room\" will keep you intrigued, emotional, and on the edge of your seat from start until finish. More importantly, you will walk away from the film a changed person.",

It's also a movie that proves that #BrieLarson deserves her Oscar nomination. Her co-star Jacob Tremblay, who plays her five year old son, also gives one of the most spellbinding and believable performances of the year. It never gets too heavy. Instead, it shifts between being uncomfortable to being heartwarming and loving. It doesn't end in the typical Hollywood crescendo. Instead, it gives much needed closure to the characters as well as the audience. It is well worth the 1 hour 23 minute runtime.",

    "review": "  This is great. If you're looking for a tense, emotionally satisfying, character driven film, this is the one for you. I wasn't familiar with Brie Larson before I saw this, but she's a frigging brilliant actress. I wouldn't be surprised if she becomes the \"next big thing\" in the near future, because the power of this movie is almost totally dependent on her and her performance. It reminded me a little of 'Joy' actually (And it's just a weird coincidence that her character's name in 'Room' is Joy too) because the story is essentially about a mother who has to overcome seemingly impossible odds in order to save her own life. This is obviously a much darker story than 'Joy', but I was struck my the similarity in theme. Moving onto the kid, Jacob Tremblay, he's excellent too. Now, good child actors are a rarity to say the very least, but this one has the right chops. We see the world and events of the narrative through his eyes, and not once did his performance grate on me or make me wince, like most child actors do with such a huge role. He was pivotal to the success of the movie and it really works.I had a concern before seeing this that the entire film would be set in the one room that the characters are being kept prisoner in. Not that I didn't think the film could work if it was, but just because I feel the material would get a little overdrawn if that was the case. I'm happy to say though that the protagonists escape the dungeon halfway through the movie. I don't feel this is a spoiler because this was hinted at in the trailer. But the reason why this is such a positive aspect for me is because I'm interested in similar real life cases and how captives manage to reintegrate into the world after being out of it for so long. This film deals with that very well and it satisfied me. There were a few things that disappointed me, but I don't think they're detrimental to the film or particularly harm it in any way. Brie Larson's father had a small role and I wish they'd expanded on some of the issues he was having with the whole ordeal, but they just wrote him out rather suddenly. I also would have liked more closer with the antagonist, the man who captured Brie Larson in the first place. Other than that, I don't have a negative thing to say about this. It's the sort of film that will stay with you.",

Brie Larson (The Gambler) isn't playing a pretty face with a kid, rather, in this she played a mom who cared with limitations. Crazy people and jaded folk get cinematically put into one place and it annoys. \"He's supposed to protective one with high ideals.\" \"Those two are close, REALLY CLOSE.\" So with the subject matter it's a pattern, especially dramas, but the performances are breathtakingly similar to mother and child. I won't spoil the 2nd Act but things become less stressful and take a turn, and the world isn't what everyone thought. Thrilling in certain moments, but this movie brought you far into its horrifying woods and gave me a breather to think. Director Leonard Abrahamson (Frank) is piecing it together and never lets the world blow up in our faces, and leaves it to the actors how it should be.",

The direction was superb, Brie Larson's performance was once-in-a-lifetime, and the writing was flawless. This movie will likely be in Spotlight's shadow at award time but the nominations will hopefully encourage more people to see it. Lenny Abrahamson proved for the third time he's one of the best directors on the planet. And Emma Donoghue's adaptation of her own novel brilliantly shifts the focus away from sad, somber, depression to inspirational love between mother and child in a cathartic experience. Praise all around. This movie will stick with me forever.",

    "review": "  An absolute fantastic film that before I even jump into it I recommend everyone give this one a watch. Room is about a young lady referred to as Ma (Brie Larson) who lives in a shed with her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Ma was kidnapped when she was 17 by Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) and has been kept captive in the Room. Old Nick comes by to have his way with her and leaves her supplies. This has been going on for seven years and Ma has had enough. Ma weaves a story to Jack that there's only the Room and everything else is fake. It sort of places her in a position to think that this is life and to save her son from the horrific events happening to them. I don't want to spoil anymore, but the acting here is top notch. Brie Larson shines as Ma and the breakout star here is young Jacob Tremblay. Both really get you to care early on about them and some moments truly do get tense. Its a great film about the relationship between a mother and her child and the lengths that said mother will go to to protect her own. Only small gripe is that later in the film and by the ending there are still a few questions that never get answered! I can't recommend this one enough regardless!",

There's an earnestness in the handling of the story and the filmmaking. No showy cinematogs, which is refreshing. The first hour is excellently paced, but the latter part suffers a bit. There's a couple of unbelievable asshole characters - the lady interviewer and that at asshole driving the police car who needed to stfu. Didn't believe the lady po po either, really. Too good at problem solving. Would've liked to have seen Jack be forced to learn how to communicate over a period of time. Just happens too easily. Totally believed the psychology of the boy otherwise. I will never forget the look on his face in the back of the truck. Most powerful moment of any movie this year. Brie is bae",

Unfortunately, Room is a bit aimless structurally; the first act provides goals for the characters to achieve, while the second lumbers along, providing some excellent scenes along the way but no sense of purpose or climax.

Based on Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name, we see the harrowing existence of five-year-old Jack and his mother Joy as they are kept locked away in a garden shed. The eponymous room is both their prison and Jack's entire world. There is only heaven, which he sees through the skylight, the space within Room and the fictional world of TV. Their escape unveils the true wonders of the everyday world to Jack, as well as a difficult adjustment back to normality for Joy.The two central performances are fantastic. Raw, heartfelt and utterly engaging, Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay emote the pain, grief and frustrations of their journey to profound levels. They're two of the finest performances of the last twelve months, so don't be surprised if both walk away with Oscars. That's right, Tremblay is that good!Lenny Abrahamson treatment of Donoghue's script allows for a poignant slow-burner that never contrives to exploit. We're given a beautiful balance of pain and hope, anger and joy. A bleak tale of survival and discovery has never had so much warmth. An intimate and thoroughly rewarding film that will stay with you for a very long time. It deserves every award it's given.5 stars.",

    "review": "  Terrific film! Oh my... what a wonderful year for cinephiles like me! The best emotion rollercoaster I have seen recently. Normally a film can be either uplifting or heartbroken, not both, but \"Room\" is both! The film is so nicely made that I felt deeply enlightened watching this despite the confined space of the plane where I had to spend half a day up in the air. Except for a few confusing minutes at the beginning and the low energy of the middle part, the film is through and through excellent - perfect casting, perfect performance to the point that I totally forgave the quasi-pretentious voice-over of the son (who was terrifically played by Jacob Tremblay - he deserves at least an Oscar nomination this year, if not the golden statue itself). What a lovely film!",

    "review": "  A very unique film coming as a Canadian and Irish co pro that really celebrates the connection of parent and child under very dire circumstances and their attempts to maintain hope for the chances of survival and recovery. The Room jumps right into Ma and Jack as they are entering their final days in a confined room where the are being held captive for unknown reasons by Old Jack, and do extremely well in showing them playing and trying to enstill the normal values and such while only receiving the most minimalist of care from their captors. A sort of fantasy story telling approach helps Ma keep Jack innocent despite everything going on around them until his fifth birthday when it comes time that she feels he can handle an escape attempt to help both of them come from underfoot and reunite with the outside world. Brie Larson and Jacob Trimbley are really note perfect in their roles as Ma and Jack, you really believe their connection and despair, and Jacob was really gradually discovering the outside world with his grandparents and gradually adjusting to everything around him almost like a newborn even though he is a 5 year old. A very deserving if unusual choice for the 2015 TIFF Audience Choice Award and I will be intrigued to see what hardware it picks up at the Oscars this year. Has a slight Beasts of the Sourthern Wild pull to it which was cool. And also best cameo of a Etobicoke landmark in the film with Apache Burger. A solid and surprising gem. .",

    "review": "  The only redeeming quality for this film is the performances of the main actors. Both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay present somewhat compelling depictions of a woman and child who are held for a long amount of time against their will. However, as their predicaments change, the movie begins to hit the clich� 'notes' of a film that wants to play with your emotions, but without any insight on the suffering of its characters. It's as if this film's downfall comes from the fact that it was written by the writer of the novel upon which it's based, Emma Donoghue; this film tries to fit so much drama into its second half, yet it still drags as it provides a shallow impression of the psyches of the characters in this tragic situation. The film's flaccid ending seems like a halfhearted attempt at some sort resolution and relies on the viewer to imagine the changed-state of the principal characters--as it's not shown in any detail.  I'm sorry to say that this movie was ultimately unoriginal (at moments it felt like Peter Jackson's similarly-themed \"Lovely Bones\"), poorly written (laughable moments in the script \"Needle in a haystack\" etc.), and boring (zzzzzzzzz). I feel as if this film would benefit immensely if it was shot/told in a similar fashion to that of the novel upon which it's based: from the viewpoint of the imprisoned child. This is attempted in form of narration spread at different points throughout the film, but the somewhat precocious reflections are brief and, at times, inaudible. While I have not read the novel, I would imagine that telling/shooting the film in a similar manner would add some much needed originality and insight.  I would have given this film 1.5 stars because of its compelling opening situation, but, much like the agonizingly clich� sex-offender glasses of the character who imprisons Larson and Tremblay, its derivative nature is really quite ghastly.",

As Jack views the world for the first time and gains an understanding of what exists around him, it's beautiful and heartbreaking and succeeds in delivering the emotion Abrahamson so desperately wants to communicate, but it's underlined and reworked and restated so many times that the film begins to lose what initially made it so effective. Tremblay and Larson are both excellent; it's a shame they weren't given the vehicle they deserved.",

The pace of the movie was in fact a little slow, as I did have to check the clock once or twice. The characters are brilliant but for me the movie is split into three the first half being the Jack's (Jacob Tremblay) story, the second half being Ma's (Brie Larson) story and in the third half it flip flops between the two. That being said theirs still something there that stopped me from fully caring about the Ma character, don't get me wrong there are some moments but not to the full extent were it hit me and I thought really care for her, but seeing the story from Jack's view kind of makes that a lesser problem. The script is beautifully done, but there are some question that will go unanswered in the movie or some things that I still wanted to know or for the movie to explore a little bit more. Overall this is a good movie and recommend to at least check it out.",

Larson and Tremblay are as fantastic as reported and failure to garner Oscar nominations would only make the Academy look dumber than it already is. However, call me cynical and bloodthirsty, but I got the feeling that Room played it a bit too safe and ended a little too lightly. Ma's suicide attempt was awful glossy, as was the interview, while other topics were barely addressed at all. I get that this is a tough topic and I'm at as much of a loss on how to address it as anyone but I wish that Abrahamson had cut a little deeper on this one. You get the feeling that there isn't anything wrong with Room as is but what it could have been might have really been something else. Regardless, the film is still moving, still powerful and still worth watching. Larson is a lock for a best actress nod in my mind.",

The story follows a mother, Joy, and her son, Jack, who have been living in one small room for the past 5 years. The reason is unknown until about half hour into the movie, so I won't spoil it. Anyways, at one point they get out and Jack hasn't been out of that room, ever. So, this is his first time seeing the outside world and it's really beautiful seeing that, I have to admit. How he is ignorant of everything and discovering everything for the first time. Joy has to deal with a lot of media and her parents and it's all very over-the-top dramatic. That's about the only problem I had with this movie. The overly dramatic plot revolving around Joy. It's interesting at first, but it just keeps going and going and it gets to the point where you're just tired of her character, albeit her actress is amazing. And so is everyone, really. There weren't any bad actors, not even the kid! The direction is great and the first 40 minutes of the movie which are entirely set in the small room look outstanding! I was always fascinated by the movies that are set in small spaces and how the directors manage to make them look bigger and more interesting. The soundtrack is great. All in all, Room is a movie deffinetely worth seeing as it is very emotional, the story is intriguing and the acting is brilliant. Not my best movie of the year, but near the top!",

This film shows the power that a simple story can bring to the viewer and is one that is told in such a heartbreaking and thought-provoking manner. Watching this film, I completely forgot at times that I was even watching a movie and I was completely captivated and effected by all the situations going on. The performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are truly incredible here and together have portrayed one of the best mother-son relationships I have ever seen in a long time in a movie. With Short Term 12 and this under Brie Larson's belt, I am going to look forward to everything she does in the future and I hope she gets a Oscar nomination for this performance because it was memorable and one of the best performances I have seen from an actress in 2015. Brie Larson did a fantastic job portraying a mother who cares deeply for her son and will do anything for him and when she started having mental problems toward the final hour of the film, I felt completely sad for her and her son. Jacob Tremblay as the son was fantastic as well and he gave one of the best performances I have seen from a child in a long time and I hope that he will be in many more great movies in the future. Being a kid raised in an enclosed environment, I completely understood him whenever he would feel a certain way towards life or towards his own mother and there were a lot of heartbreaking and touching moments with them together. The dialogue in the film was fantastic as well. The conversations that Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay had were completely engrossing and her telling him about the outside world was all the more memorable to watch and listen to. There were many times during the first half of the film where I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see how they would gain their freedom and I was left breathless when those scenes ended. Joan Allen as the grandma of Jacob Tremblay's Jack was really likable and she showed a great amount of emotion in the second half of the film and gave a better than average supporting performance. While William H. Macy was a great presence as the grandpa, I could have had more scenes with him dealing with these heartbreaking situations, but because everything else was so good, his limited amount of screen time only felt like a minor problem and didn't detract from the film. Being from a small time director, Lenny Abrahamson shows here that he can get nothing but the best out of these actors and the simple premise, and I look forward to what he does next after this. In the end, I really had no major issues with this film and this was a movie that I was completely floored by and one that I can't wait to see again when it comes out on Blu-ray.",

    "review": "  The film Room is the story of a mother - played by Brie Larson - and her five-year old son who are forced to live in a tiny square room. The viewer has no idea why they are living in this space but as clues are revealed as the movie progresses.This movie is excellent and a must see - I can't say enough about it. The style choice can appeal to both the indie film buff and also the casual big blockbuster moviegoer. It does a great job of using every scene to advance the story forward and the screenplay is written in a way that is believable. In addition the dynamic of the way the mother and son interact is not over the top. Nor does it appear forced. In the first act, I was impressed with the mise-en-scene and the shallow space composition done entirely within a 10 foot by 10 foot room. In the second and third acts, the movie appears to go in particular direction, but then it surprises viewers. However, it is done in a way that is not unrealistic or cliche.

    "review": "  The film Room is the story of a mother - played by Brie Larson - and her five-year old son who are forced to live in a tiny square room. The viewer has no idea why they are living in this space but as clues are revealed as the movie progresses.This movie is excellent and a must see - I can't say enough about it. The style choice can appeal to both the indie film buff and also the casual big blockbuster moviegoer. It does a great job of using every scene to advance the story forward and the screenplay is written in a way that is believable. In addition the dynamic of the way the mother and son interact is not over the top. Nor does it appear forced. In the first act, I was impressed with the mise-en-scene and the shallow space composition done entirely within a 10 foot by 10 foot room. In the second and third acts, the movie appears to go in particular direction, but then it surprises viewers. However, it is done in a way that is not unrealistic or cliche. This movie is easily a top five film of 2015. If someone says it is not, then they simply never saw the film or do not appreciate a drama that does not need fancy CGI in place of breathtaking shots, top notch cinematography, and flawless acting to go along with a well-written narrative. This film easily gets a 10 out of 10 rating.",

    "review": "  Room is a marvelously directed, fantastically crafted and powerfully acted feat of cinema. The story begins in the titular Room, aka a shed in the backyard of a kidnapper. The film is split into two distinctive parts, Act 1 taking place primarily in Room, the shed, and focuses on a bit of the day-to-day life of its inhabitants, mother and son Joy and Jack. Captured when she was 17, Joy has been locked in Room for seven years and had her captor's, Old Nick as he is called, son. Jack is now a rambunctious, excited five-year-old who has only known Room for his entire life. Joy has made it her mission to protect her son and keep him innocent to the horror of their reality for most of his young life, but now must make him understand in order to get him on her side to escape. Their escape is a success, but leads into the next part: adjusting to life outside. Jack follows his mother through their journey to become part of the free world. Brie Larson embodies every instinct and insecurity of Joy in her performance, conveying a young mother's fears and connection with her child as well as a young woman's fears of having to be responsible for everything in her small uncontrolled world. Larson is complimented by her costar, Jacob Tremblay, a remarkably talented young actor who truly owns the screen.",

Desafortunadamente... es muy dif�cil competir con eso (con lo cual se va a repetir la misma historia de la Bullock, y no puedo evitar sentir un poco de pena por Cate Blanchett).En cuanto a Jacob Tremblay es una ~Soberana Injusticia~ q hayan nominado a la PENDEJA de QUVENZHANEHASFHLKJASDRDQQQHSAH WALLIS (quien se caracteriza por tener m�s de Kardashian q de Streep), teniendo apenas un tercio de su talento, y no a �l.

This movie tells the tale of a young woman who is kidnapped as a teenager, held captive for seven years of her life, gives birth to her captor's son, raises the boy for the first five years of his life in a 10x10 garden shed, escapes, and that's when the real struggle begins.Brie Larson is great as the film's heroine and young newcomer, Jacob Tremblay, brilliantly portrays the film's narrator. The young child actor plays the heroine's son (Jack) well because he manages to exude innocence and resilience without appearing precocious. I like that. Joan Allen, William H. Macy, and Tom McCamus are great as Jack's grandmother, grandfather and step-grandfather respectively. This is a great follow-up to Lenny Abrahamson's 2014 film Frank.",

    "review": "  Room: One Skylight, Two Great Performances, and Four Walls make one great film. \"Room\" starts in the middle of a horrifying tale of abduction with little back story and little history. And that works wonder. It places us right in the middle of the claustrophobia of the two main characters, Joy and her son Jack. The first third of the film made me almost as uncomfortable as I was during the whole masterpiece film, \"The Act of Killing.\" There are so many times when this film could have gone awry, sappy and melodramatic. In fact, the sappiest thing about the film was the music, being far too uplifting and loud for the themes in the movie. The framing of each shot in the first-third of the movie augments the feeling of being trapped. The shots are as beautiful as they are terrifying. The acting of the two main characters is spot on, especially the five-year-old boy Jake, played by Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson plays the complicated role of Joy, the mother, who goes through untold agony. We aren't told what happens in detail; we see it on her face, in her body.There were so many times this film could have gone for cheap sentimentality; they could have gone for the easy reconciliation and happy ending, and it didn't. Put one in the win column for small, well writing, well directed and well acted cinema that doesn't involve stunts or explosions. Rating: Pay Full Price\"Room\" is excellent. While it didn't play for cheap emotion and the issues it addresses are horrifying, it could have used more detail regarding the aftermath of events for the mother. The son's issues were dealt with well if not completely. The framing of the shots? Fantastic! The music? Terrible. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscars nominations. ??Peace,?Tex Shelters",

Brie Larson should get some hardware for the job she does but the actor who steals the show is 9 year old Jacob Tremblay. I honestly can't recall a more amazing performance from such a young actor.

I would believed him more if he was 7.Secondly if he was in that room for all his life, then the script written for him was more for a senior kindergarden.I can't help looking back to Danny Lloyd ( The Shining ) who was very natural which I think how a 5 year old child should be.Good script and performance, I like the story.. but since I felt those disconnection early, it was like watching a movie that was supposed to be set in Toronto, but someone messed up and showed the Empire state building in the background.",

Although the story it tells is not for the faint of heart or impatient moviegoers, it is beautifully told, powerfully acted and impressively directed. It is unlikely that you will find an actress as committed as Brie Larson or a child-actor as convincing as Jacob Tremblay this year. Both deliver breathtaking performances that seem real and utterly believable. Perhaps, the greatest compliment they can be given is that at times you almost forget that they're 'acting'. Director Lenny Abrahamson uses these actors beautifully to tell a story with a universal message of hope. A message so powerful that it makes you appreciate your own life.",

    "review": "  I just saw the movie \"Room\" which is highly acclaimed and rated in the 90's on Rotten Tomatoes for both pros and us regular folk. It is a difficult one to recommend because the subject matter is so repulsive and difficult and the way it its told is a slow unfolding. This is a film, not a movie.The movie geek in me liked it a lot...brought me to tears a couple of times (but then I am in a weepy state right now so maybe it was just me). The intermittent voiceover throughout is the little boy, trying to describe the world through his own eyes. I will only share this: It is the story of a young woman who was kidnapped off the street at 17 and then locked in a room by a sicko man for 7 years, where she also gave birth to a little boy who turns 5 as the movie opens. The title is where they lived \"Room\" which was his only world until they escaped and a world that he often misses as he's trying to figure out what is real and not real and where his comfort lies. The performances are grade A. I give it a 4.5 as a film but don't recommend it for those of you who are looking for lighter entertainment.",

What works in the novel can't work here because film is a more objectified experience (and the limited view of the narrator can't really limit the scope of your own experience and the access to information through other channels). I loved the movie, but I have some issues with it, the main issue being that the second half never lives up to the thrills of the first half. Don't get me wrong - I still enjoyed it and the actors did some great work (even though there were some false moments, such as Jack's inability to handle a phone: Really?! That bright and adaptive kid who was so curious about everything and spent so much time observing people couldn't really get the chance to see others speak on the phone in the long weeks he spent in his grandmother's house?!) but the second half had a bit of a dragging problem, as if it they didn't know where to go with that story for a while. But I was immersed in it, mostly due to the unassuming visual flair. And the performances: wow, these performance by Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson were hypnotic! I especially loved the craziness in the room, especially Brie's moments of clarity when she had to convince Jack of going through with her plan. There was something manic about her character and this ambiguity felt real to me. And Jacob Tremblay - I know this is such an extreme pitfall of a role and he makes it look so easy and there are so many layers and details to this experience of a performance. Go watch them.",

    "review": "  \"Room\" is an emotive, powerfully acted and modest piece that refrains from cheap sentimentalityExceptional performances as Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and Ma (Brie Larson) are the highlight here. You won't want to look away from them-not that director Lenny Abrahamson lets you. He never tries to distract you from the fact that there's two people on screen the whole time. He embraces it. It's a wise decision.Abrahamson displays an unnerving knack for extracting emotion. The thinness of the plot is an issue with the source material, and what could have been a hokey feel-good or a crime thriller is instead a tribute to love, life, and human strength that (almosts) steers free of being overly sentimental.The performances are delivered in expert hands that know just when to slow down and let them breathe, when to cut, when to jack up the intensity. We get familiar with closeups and extreme closeups, and it works. The minimalist soundtrack is gorgeously composed and holds our attention during the many diaglogue-free sequences. The same stands for set design and locations. They're inobstrusive and they complement the film's true strengths. The emotional complexity that stirs (or roars) in every scene. The flawless acting. The characters and relationships that are built with such care and attention to nuance that the film's few falters are easily forgivable.A chance for a thriller moment is fumbled in the scene when Jack and Old Nick are approached by the first stranger with his dog. Perhaps Abrahamson felt that a more amped up exchange would have been an easy gimmick, but there was definitely something lost in choosing not to dial up the intensity here. The moment called for it.Regardless, Abrahamson's intuition for storytelling is obvious and refreshing. I only ask that he trust himself more. The pacing is organic, the shots are thoughtfully structured, and he knows how to work within the confines of the story. The film connects. And it does that without the triter voiceovers from Jack and the spots of heavy-handed sappiness (especially in the haircut scene). The music supports the movie well, and so it reaches too-cheesy levels when the film does. We don't need to be cued so obviously as to what and when we're supposed to feel. If you've done the job well, and Abrahamson has, we'll get there on our own.",

    "review": "  Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue tells the story of Ma and her 5 year old son Jack, who are living in the confines of 'Room'. To give away anymore would be giving away too much of the plot. If you've read the book you've obviously got an idea of what happens however, for those that are not aware of this film I beg you to go in with no preconceptions and for gods sake do not watch the trailer (unless you want the whole thing spoiled).What you get from Room is a very powerful and emotive film with excellent performances from Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (played by Jacob Tremblay, a relative newcomer whose only previous release was voicing a Smurf). The supporting cast including Joan Allen and William H. Macy also put in good performances. However it's the mother and son which deserve the plaudits. Brie Larson, who up until now appears to have been in mostly supporting roles in films such as 21 Jump Street and Scott Pilgrim vs the World, however in Room she really displays her acting capabilities and from this performance she should be a contender for best actress when award season comes around. As you watch Room, the second half of the film feels like there isn't much happening however, this is a film about the experience and emotions of these two characters and how their confides mold their lives and the effects it has on them psychologically. There are moments when seemingly innocent scenarios dispense a sense of fear, paranoia and tension which are caused as a result of the predicament they find themselves in. There are also moments elation and unexpected humour. But it's that sense of paranoia and fear especially with regards to children which is a reflection of today's society and is depicted here so well which makes this film both true and sad in equal measure. Room can be tough and unpleasant viewing, I saw it as part of Odeon's Screen Unseen and I probably wouldn't have seen it otherwise but I've very glad that I did.",

It was ironic because she would sit there, gushing about how it was so true, that mother hood was such a blessing and the most wonderful thing a woman can do, and then right after she would be back to being her abusive self. My mom would hate this movie. Not that Joy is an abusive mom in anyway. Quite the opposite. She did everything right, but this movie is extremely real in it's portrayal of such an overwhelming situation. I think this is one of the most honest looks at motherhood I have ever seen. She gets annoyed. She gets tired. She has days when she just needs to be away from him for a little bit. She gets a bit scary at times. She feels inadequate. But she loves Jack. She wants to be everything he see's in her through his tiny 5 year old eyes. I think this is a near perfect movie. My only real nitpick is that I feel like it couldn't chose a POV. Did it want to be from Joy's POV or from Jack's. But it is a very small nitpick as the movie shows us everything we need to see and nothing more.",

    "review": "  Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, this film is a small story driven independent harrowing dramatic thriller. And like many of its kind, the film has to rely on a great screenplay, solid acting, and moving character development for it to get wide recognition. The film delivers on all of these aspects. Director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) has adapted the best-selling novel with grace and grandeur. Here is a film so artistically unique and deviant, chock full of genuine emotion thanks to two outstanding performances, that isn't afraid to take risks and surprise at every turn. The entire idea of 'room,' the abstract concept of space, is ever-present in the production. In their bubble of room, Ma and Jack are restricted, as evident by Abrahamson's close angles and tight shots. The small space allows for high concept filmmaking, and when they get out of room, it only gets better, with a new color palette and experimental camera angles through Jack's eyes. The entire film is seen through the eyes of this child, and it's genius. The title of the film makes the film about the space in our lives and in our selves and our need to escape whatever walls or restrictions that others ? or we ourselves ? have imposed on us. So our experience really is reflected in this freakish story. The film is about the vast room we have at our disposal not the small room to which we might accept restriction. This couldn't be further from Lenny Abrahamson's last film Frank, a bizarre music-orientated comedy. Gone are the idiosyncrasies that made Frank wild and, for many including myself, compelling, instead we have a moving drama that earns its sentiment. The concept of a mother having raised her son in confinement then finally breaking free has many avenues to explore. Having not read Emma Donoghue's book, of whom also wrote the screenplay, I mostly expected a small scale -getting out of the eponymous room then reuniting and resolving itself there. Instead, the film goes further than I expected, getting Ma ? also known as Joy, which is becoming a familiar character's name this year ? and Jack back to her teenage home with her own mother. The story follows twenty-something Joy aka Ma (Brie Larson) and five year-old Jack (Jacob Tremblay), inside a garden shed. We are, of course, unaware that this is a garden shed, but the size is what's immediately noticeable. Small, dark, and dank, with a single skylight. Jack, the product of Ma's kidnapping despite her insistence of his immaculate conception, is oblivious to the space of the room, or lack thereof, and equally of the world outside it. Most nights, a man called \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers) visits the room to have sex with Ma. But Jack doesn't understand this custom, instead letting his imagination dream up a world of wonderment, all existing neatly in the boundaries of the room ? where a mouse joyfully nibbles on some scraps and where his imaginary dog Lucky can frolic. In Jack's mind, the only reality is inside the room, and everything on the other side of the wall is most certainly outer space. After one particularly traumatizing night, when Jack wanders out of his hiding spot to observe the sleeping adults and is frightened by both Nick and an instance of physical violence against Ma, the fatigued woman realizes that she must coach the young boy into aiding with an escape plan to finally rid them of the restrictive imprisonment of the room. Providing any more details would soften the impact of the film, and this is one that is meant to be felt ? even if it's a true kick in the gut. For the first half of the film, we as viewers are held prisoners right along with Ma and Jack. We see what a patient and wonderful mother she is as she strives to provide some semblance of hope for her son, though in a nearly hopeless situation. When Jack turns 5, Ma begins to explain the outside world to him, as she knows they must try to escape in order for her son to have any semblance of a normal life. During this time, we are in awe of this 10 x 10 environment and how it is every bit the nightmare we have imagined while reading the articles and seeing the reports on real life ordeals. The second half of the film is equally fascinating, as we watch young Jack and his sense of wonder and caution at discovering the real world. We also see the psychological trauma that Ma experiences after staying strong for so long. Assimilating into society brings different challenges for both Ma and Jack, plus those of her mother (Joan Allen), her father (William H Macy) and her mom's new beau (Tom McCamus). The film doesn't shy away from their reactions, though some are easier to stomach than others. The different approach is felt immediately as Abrahamson traps us with his two principle characters, Ma and Jack, in tight and sometimes oddly framed closeups. It's a somewhat clumsy execution to show the claustrophobia and intimacy Abrahamson wants to achieve as he uses Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's faces as blank canvases, but the effect is thoroughly felt, and the film's following 30 minutes remain its best. The photography decides to take a step back, but it continues to catch that raw emotion. Then, in a way, it doesn't go far enough. But it's interesting to watch it play in its happy medium. It does rely on some key contrivances to get there, such as the kidnapper's wonky perception and ultimately not fighting hard enough when he could have, but that doesn't take away from the gripping escape sequence as the orchestra swells and squeezes tears from you whether you like it or not. The only criticism of the directorial style was the lapse in direction that the story was supposed to take towards the end of the film. The entire time the story was told through the eyes of Jack. However, towards the last part of the movie, there was a shift that included some of Ma's point of view. This slightly took away from the ways a five year old would try to explain certain behaviors or actions of adults. Also, for those who have read the book, don't expect the movie to include every aspect of it. Just like every other film based on books, graphic novels, comics, or even true events, only certain aspects can be adapted and some must be altered in order to try and make the best move possible. The performances are superb and so consistent with the storyline, there isn't any pretense that any of this was stage or acted. The relationships are well developed within the timeframe of the movie and are delightfully varied to reveal the breadth of human responses to such a tragedy. Brie Larson had not only shown potential but delivered the goods with 2013's Short Term 12. It's a similar environment here with devoted maternal instincts but this time it's pushed to the brink of her skills as an actress. She's drenched in this exasperation that speaks to years of exhaustion. In the tone of her primal performance, she paints a full rich portrait of Joy's whole life from her carefree teen years to her brutal capture by Old Nick when she was 17, to every little story and lesson she's told Jack. Joy's constantly revising the way she raises Jack and while there's bumps in the road, it's a complete picture of motherhood. She balances resilience and vulnerability, hope and dejection with a fine tooth comb. Most times she commands the screen and offers one of the year's best performances. It's a film about the harsh realities of growing up, operating for both of the main characters, and it's a very sensitive and emotionally potent portrayal. Speaking of which, Jacob Tremblay may be the frontrunner for most supporting actor awards as his performance is better then a lot of child actors. How they got a kid this young to pull off the necessary emotions that few adult can properly show off? I don't know, but this is defiantly his movie. Is perception on the world and the adults around him remind us why we were frightened by the rest of the world as children. When our parents aren't around, we might as well be on an alien planet, stepping around strange sounds and sights. This child made me realize how one can see the world differently at a different age. Joan Allen, as Joy's mother, is heartfelt and shows unconditional love in a wonderfully nuanced way, whereas William H. Macy, Joy's father, is regretfully underused but doing the 'in over his head' thing Macy does best. On the whole, 'Room' is an emotional journey through trauma and discovery with the help of a very strong storytelling and acting. Room fell short in some aspects, though they did not sufficiently diminish the overall experience of the film. It brings different concepts for those to learn from, such as the importance of family, experience, and empathy towards others. If you want to escape the confinements of recent big budget films, or want to experience something moving that you will not forget, go see Room. The film deserves a watch!",

    "review": "  Human exploration of people captive in films is a very interesting subject that Hollywood and independent studios produce.Movies such as Shawshank Redemption (1994) The Green Mile (1999), Papillon (1973), Rescue Dawn (2006) Empire of The Sun (1987), Unbroken (2014) Misery (1990) and Buried (2010) represents a wide variety of sub plots that goes from: Jails, prisoners of war and actual abduction.In the film \"Room\" Director Lenny Abrahmson explore the life of Ma (Brie Larson) and his son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who are confined in this small room, which contain a rudimentary kitchen, a bed, a toilet, a sink and a skylight. The film starts when Jack is turning 5 and her mom is doing her best effort to celebrate this landmark, by baking a cake. Throughout the film develops, the audience discover that they are locked in this room by a guy called Old Nick (Sean Bridges) who bring them supplies every night and also for sex with Ma. Ma was abducted about eight years ago in the film plot. Jack is living in a reality that is only portrayed in his personal window to the world, the television. Ironically the real window of the world for Ma is the skylight in this room, she can see the seasons and the time of the day, but for Jack is nothing. He don't know how the real world is and his sense of space is limited but the fact that Ma is the only person that he ever interacted. For Jack the room is a confined world but is a world of fantasies, sounds, smells and strange voices ( Old Nick paying a visit to Ma every night for sex)Ma tries to give Jack some education by making him read books like Alice and Wonderland, but Ma also wants to escape and give Jack the life that he deserve. The process won't be easy...The escape is a beautiful and poetic moment which is also the biggest revelation for Jack been free for the first time. The film Room is a very difficult film to watch, is a movie about the love of a mother for his child, the wounds of a person been abducted for years, the adaptation of a little boy to the real world, but also is a movie about justice and human and family values.Brie Larson is outstanding in this role as well Jacob Tremblay, the film, is really well edited and well directed who carefully crafted with the art direction team the perfect space to make the audience feel locked in that Room.One of the lack in this movie is the development of Ma's dad Robert Newsome (Willam H Macy) his character become important when a pivotal moment happen in the movie and later vanished from everyone's mind.",

    "review": "  Which of the following situations would you find the most traumatic? (1) You are kidnapped, removed from everyone and everything you know and love, never knowing if you will ever be free again. (2) You are born into a captivity in which you know hardly anything about what most people take for granted as \"the world\" and then are suddenly thrust into that world with almost no understanding of what you're seeing, what to do or how to behave. Stop. Think about it. Either situation would be a horribly upsetting and disorienting to experience. We see both situations play out in the fictional drama \"Room\" (R, 1:58). Although the film is not based on any specific real-life story, it does have a strong basis in reality - in the cases that we occasionally see on the news or in a true-crime TV drama. A young woman is taken captive by a monstrous person who holds her for years against her will. In some cases, innocent children are born into such situations, knowing nothing but confinement, with only a mother's love to depend on. Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) was seventeen when a man who claimed that he needed help with a sick dog abducted Joy and imprisoned her in the garden shed in his back yard. The man (Sean Bridgers), whose name Joy didn't know (simply referring to him as \"Old Nick\") kept Joy as a sex slave, bringing her just enough food and other essentials to survive. He brought her supplies once a week, but visited her for sex every night. Eventually, Old Nick's ongoing rape of Joy produced a baby boy. Joy named him Jack. Jack only knows Joy as \"Ma\". He has never even seen Old Nick. At a set time every night, Joy sends Jack to sleep on the floor of the wardrobe in the corner of the room. Old Nick punches a code into the door's electronic lock. He enters. He does \"his business\" and leaves. Jack is now free to climb into bed with Ma.The days belong to Joy and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). He's now five years old. He has never had a haircut, never seen a doctor and never left Room. The wardrobe where he sleeps when Old Nick comes calling, Ma's bed, a toilet, bathtub, sink, toaster oven, small table and old television is all Jack has ever known. As far as he knows, the world he sees on TV is all made up and the small skylight in the roof of the shed is outer space. To Jack, there simply is nothing else but Room, the mysterious voice of Old Nick, and Ma. For her part, Joy does all she can for Jack. She \"cooks\" the meager rations that Old Nick brings and she breastfeeds Jack. She's his teacher, his playmate, his protector and, basically the only person who exists.As hard as Joy works to make a life for her and Jack in Room, their situation is starting to change, calling their long-term survival into question. Joy has tried to escape before, but it becomes clear to her that she has to try again. Maybe Jack is now old enough to help - if she can get him to understand her plan. It isn't a spoiler to reveal that Joy's escape plan works, because that is what the second half of this movie is about. Joy is reunited with her mother (Joan Allen) and father (William H. Macy), who are now divorced. Joy and Jack move in with her mother and her mother's boyfriend (Tom McCamus) who do their best to help Joy and Jack adjust to their newfound freedom, with all that means for each of them.These adjustments aren't be easy. Jack has to learn... everything that you and I take for granted about our world. Joy has to try to get past the emotional trauma of seven years of captivity and having raised a son in that environment. Then, of course, there are certain legal questions that a family lawyer is now there to handle... and the media circus that naturally accompanies such stories in real life. This film doesn't dwell on the legal or public aspects of this case, but those elements are there in the background, even while this dramatically changed family focuses on finding a way to forge fresh bonds and move forward in the most difficult of situations.\"Room\" is as remarkable as the story it portrays. Basing the film on the 2010 novel by Emma Donoghue (who also wrote the screenplay) frees the plot to explore a wide variety of issues without being confined to the details of one specific real-life case. Telling the story through Jack's eyes (complete with a judicious use of well-written narration by the boy) helps us to understand the wide ranging implications of such an experience for Jack, his mother and his newfound family. Director Lenny Abrahamson takes full advantage of these story-telling opportunities with his use of camera angles and the markedly different tone in the movie's very different halves. Topping it all off are exceptionally affecting performances by all the main characters - especially Larson and Tremblay. Although the pacing of the film sometimes lags unnecessarily, there is no criticizing this film's emotional impact and the importance of the lessons that it teaches its audience. I have no room to give this film anything less than an \"A\".",

This is one for which I make exception.Room is getting all sorts of praise for the acting, and deservedly so, but in my opinion, it is the screenplay that should be most acclaimed. This is a film that shows a lot, but doesn't tell much.Ultimately, Room somehow manages the task of making unrelatable characters relatable.

    "review": "  It's hard to think of a more emotionally grueling and uplifting movie this year than Room. It drops you right into a scary world and, thanks to its carefully balanced tone, the film eschews sensationalism and gets at the beating heart of its survival story, namely the love and protection of a mother for her son. It is an emotionally powerful story that hits the big moments, the small moments, and everything in between. It left me analyzing it and rethinking it for hours, the repercussions still reverberating through me. Ma (Brie Larson) has been held in a single soundproof room for seven years, the captive of an older man who is termed \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers). Complicating matters is that Ma has a five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) born into this captivity. It is the only world he's known. To spare him the full horror of their circumstances, Ma has created an elaborate world for him that only exists in Room. After his fifth birthday, Ma tries speaking honestly to her son, lifting the veil of kind fabrications. Together they will scheme to escape their one-room world, but it comes with tremendous cost. It would be easy to fall onto the more seemly elements of this harrowing story and linger on just how bad things are and the horrifying lengths that Ma has to go through to survive. Director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) doesn't have to wallow in depravity to get its point across. There's a sensitivity that manages to temper some of the abuse in a manner that won't make you run out of the room screaming. When Old Nick enters the room for his special time with Ma, we don't need explicit detail to understand what is happening and what Ma is shielding Jack from by demanding he stay in the closet. The reality of their captivity is enough without underlining the worst of the worst for the lowest common denominator. The emotional weight of everything is clear without having to be bludgeoned. The implications are always just peaking around the corners from the safer version of reality Ma has proposed to protect her child. As the audience, we can see the cracks, we can see her front, and we can see the effort and the toll it's taking on Ma. The stakes are clear as well, and so when Ma is instructing Jack and preparing him on their joint escape plan, you'll start to feel waves of anxiety travel through your body. I was shaking with suspense that something could go wrong but also because Ma and Jack are such vulnerable characters that rely upon one another completely. I knew what was going to happen in broad strokes but I was still on the edge of my seat and that's because the movie made me deeply care about the characters and their plight. The escape scene was on par with some of the better suspense sequences in the equally brilliant Sicario. It's not really a spoiler to say that Ma and Jack do get out of their one-room prison because the second half of the film deals with the ongoing consequences and challenges of adjustment. We'd like to think that we can be plugged into our old lives after spending time away, but that's just not how things work, let alone for people who have experienced substantial psychological and physical trauma. Ma is struggling to readjust to her old life under the care of her mother, Nancy (Joan Allen). She looks through old high school pictures and you can tell she laments \"what could have been\" and even bears some resentment for her old friends who got to live the lives she should have had. Just because she's free doesn't mean she's better. Her father Robert (William H. Macy), since divorced from Ma's mother, can't even look at Jack because of the pain it causes; Jack is a child of rape, but Ma demands he be acknowledged as her flesh-and-blood, and even that can be too much too soon for Robert. He's more about seeking justice through the courts and as a result stays on the peripheral of the story for most of the movie. There is no exact time table for PTSD and Ma goes through highs and lows, none lower than when pressed with the question of why she held onto Jack after he was born. Would he not have had a better life in someone else's care, assuming Old Nick would have abandoned him rather than kill his own blood? It's a hard question and it stings. For an obviously punishing story about the worst of humanity, I am not kidding when I say Room is an uplifting film. The darkness is easy to identify and Old Nick is a fearsome and all too real antagonist, one who could roam our very streets in anonymity. However, what stays with me several days after watching Room is not the suffering but the resiliency of spirit, the knack human beings have to persevere amidst the worst. Ma's recovery is rockier but more understandable for us to trace and relate with. Hers is an experience where she can finally begin to focus on something other than her child's safety and deliverance, namely her own well-being. For Jack, there is no playbook. He's spent his entire life inside a small room and never seen the outside world. His sense of understanding has been extremely limited and yet his sense of exploration is alive. Jack slowly and surely builds trusting relationships with Ma's relatives, engaging in other activities, and acclimating to his new surroundings, reforming his sense of the world. It's ultimately Jack who is able to make the greatest breakthrough to his mother, and it's this moment of sacrifice and love that unleashed the last torrent of my tears. Previously I had cried two times over the horrors and Ma's love as her strength, and it was this final moment, this sharing of his \"Strong,\" that let loose the happy tears. It should go without saying but Larson gives an exceptionally powerful performance. After 2013's stupendous Short Term 12, I knew this actress was destined for great things, especially the way she can zero in on a character and inhabit them fully. With Ma (she's never given any other name) Larson is able to convey a multitude of emotions, many of which she has to hide from her son out of loving deference. He can't know just how scared and exhausted she is, though these emotions do take over at time. Larson is tremendous as she exhumes maternal might as she does everything in her power to save the two of them. Early on, she's the character we empathize with the most because she's had her world taken from her and hoping to return. She's so resourceful, from the way she's able to answer her son's questions about the world, to the way she's able to practice and drill their escape plan to a child with no concept of \"outside,\" this is a powerful woman driven by the instinct to endure. When Larson's fa�ade breaks down with Jack, that's when the movie started stabbing me like daggers. In the second half, her character has a long road to go to recovery, if that's even an appropriate word, and Larson gives sensitive and empathetic consideration to every exhausted development. She is easily going to be the one to beat this year for the Best Actress Oscar.Paired with Larson is the remarkably natural child actor Jacob Tremblay, and his performance is worthy of awards consideration itself. At first his worldview is precocious because of how unique it is, which makes him more a figure of fascination than tragedy. He's bright and active with the world around him, turning household items into useful toys and emotional attachments. The film uses parts of his narration to give better insight into just how he's processing the world he knows versus the world as it exists. These bouts of narration never come across as cloying. As the movie continues, he learns more about how his preconceptions of the world are wrong, but he's more intrigued than frightened. During the escape plan, when Jack gets to see the outside world for the first time, it's a transcendent emotional moment. His guarded behavior around others is necessary as Jack builds positive associations with men who are not Old Nick. Tremblay is utterly magnificent; there is no hint of artifice to his performance, which is especially rewarding considering his is a role that could have been suffocated with eccentricities and tics. You feel like you're watching a child grow before you through supportive nurturing. Within the first twenty minutes of watching Room I already knew this was one of the best films of 2015. It just connects so vividly and succinctly, effortlessly powerful and yet skillfully avoiding sensationalism and exploitation while telling an entertaining survival story that still resonates with emotional truth. The performances from mother and son are outstanding and Larson and Tremblay form a heroic duo that take hold of your heart. It doesn't mitigate the darkness or the cruel realities of its premise but Room also doesn't dwell in the darkness, castigating its characters as hapless victims forever broken from their incalculable suffering. They are resourceful and resilient and while their trauma is will not be forgotten it is not the one defining moment of their burgeoning lives. It may sound maudlin but it is the power of love that resonates the longest with Room. That love at first is about protecting the innocent, and then it transforms into healing and acceptance. I hope everybody gets a chance to see Room, a remarkable film with two remarkable performances and plenty to say about the humanizing benefit of love. Nate's Grade: A",

    "review": "  Room is a success due to the two powerhouse leads, Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Larson is so raw and real and gives an unyielding performance as a woman who is so terrified but also so unbelievably devoted to her son. Jacob Tremblay, who was 8 at the time of filming, takes the three most important emotions of Room- fear, anger, and love- and makes complete magic with them and is so good its almost as if he wasn't acting at all. Room is very deep but very rewarding.",

    "review": "  Following the story and escape of young Jack Newsome and mother Joy Newsome from \"Room\", the garden shed of a deranged kidnapper, Room is heartfelt and moving, making the audience thankful for what they have in the true spirit of Thanksgiving. Room is narrated from the perspective of five-year old Jack, beginning on the morning of his fifth birthday. Following Jack around his tour of the shed, Room immediately gives the audience an idea of the experiences that Jack and his loving \"ma\" have gone through. Knowing nothing of the outside world, Jack has a limited perception of the world, his only experiences coming from television programs and a limited skylight view of the sky, \"Outer Space\". Joy, realizing that she and Jack can no longer live in these conditions, decides that Jack is old enough to know that room isn't all the world is. Questioning her proposition of reality beyond room, Jack throws a fit before calming down and accepting the truth. Soon enough, Joy wants more for her son than solely knowledge of the outside world and begins her plans for their escape. Joy, forging a high fever for Jack, heats his forehead with hot towels, hoping to sell the idea to their captor, a middle-aged and scruffy man by the name of \"Old Nick\". Nick refuses to take Jack to the hospital, instead compromising by bringing antibiotics the next day. Jack and Joy spring to work, coming up with another plan the moment Nick steps out the soundproofed dungeon-like shed. Joy rolls Jack up in a rug, preparing him with the proper instructions for what to do when he is placed in the bed of Nick's truck. Joy sells Nick on the idea that Jack is dead and convinces him to bury Jack somewhere besides his backyard, also forcing Nick to swear that he won't look at Jack's not-so-dead body. Jack follows Joy's instructions carefully and successfully rolls, wiggles, and jumps out of Nick's truck. Jack then bumps into a stranger who calls the cops who then find and free Joy from room and bring the two to a hospital, where they await the arrival of Joy's parents. The remainder of the movie follows Jack and Joy's reintegration into the society they have been held away from for so long, as well as Jack's adaptation to strangers, his family, and the world. Though most child actors fail to impress, it would be impossible to overlook the incredible acting of Jacob Tremblay. His portrayal of emotions for such a dark concept is amazing for any actor, but truly marvelous for once so young. As Tremblay ages, one would only hope that he manages to continue to uphold the high standards he has set for himself. Tremblay's performance is truly a spectacle and his mature and emotional acting is sure to catch the eye of the Academy when Oscar season rolls around. Danny Cohen, Room's cinematographer, instills meaning in every frame. While still in captivity, Cohen sets the camera just enough off-focus to provide a feeling of subjectivity into the perception of Ma and Jack as captives without detracting audience appeal. Once freed, however, Room's shots flash with brightness before simmering down, showing the journey of Jack as he is thrusted into a bright, sunny, foreign world, a strange reality to him, before he begins to adapt to his new life and new environment. Both beautiful and meaningful, Cohen's cinematography is masterful.An instant classic, Room is a masterpiece comprised of beautiful cinematography and fantastic acting. My love for Room knows no boundaries.",

    "review": "  This is a perfect example of a film that sold me just by its premise: A boy who has been kept in one room his entire life by his mother, begins to wonder what the limits of the world beyond the walls of the enclosed area are. It's also a film that if you're planning on going to see, you shouldn't watch any of the trailers or even read the IMDB synopsis. Just go out and see one of the best films of the year. Brie Larson, who impresses more and more each film she appears in, plays Joy, mother of Jack. Larson hides the depths of her character for a good portion of the film, which makes the emotional moments all the more powerful later on. The story of a mother and son trying to escape this 'room' and their whole emotional journey is what drives Room to greatness. The film itself has a unique structure in that it seems the film could have ended about 45 minutes before it did, but yet it keeps going. It's not that that time is wasted, but I think the flow and rhythm of the movie isn't always there. Which is why the emotional moments midway through are what stick out to me most.Jacob Tremblay absolutely kills it as Jack. At 5 years old and an extremely demanding role, it's hard not to think he deserves some awards attention as well. He pulls off every emotion that is called of him and his chemistry with Brie Larson couldn't be better. The supporting cast is really good as well, but that can get into spoiler territory so I'll stick with the two leads. I also should mention Lenny Abrahamson's directing. I loved the way he chose to unveil why exactly Jack and his mother are stuck in this room and the revelations that follow. Room as a whole isn't always as smooth as it wants to be, but the performances are among the years best, and I think the story will take you on an unexpected emotional roller coaster.+Larson+Tremblay's performance is an anomaly+Emotional journey+Meticulous directing-Second half doesn't live up to the first8.7/10",

    "review": "  Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay play a mother and her young son who were held captive for five years. For the son, the room (hence the title) was the whole world since he's spent his entire life in it. And initially, I was like: 'yeah, I'm not really buying this premise.' But once the two finally escape, that's where the strong screenplay and direction come into play. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give once in a lifetime performances that feel unbelievably genuine. If Brie Larson doesn't win Best Actress then....well, I would say that the Academy would lose credibility but they already did by not giving an oscar to Leonardo DiCaprio *cough* and for not giving Best Score to John Williams for \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" Anyways, whatever faults I found with the film--I'm not even going to bring them up--because they're so miniscule that to do so would just undermine the sheer emotion that the film handles so well. Some of those scenes hit heavy, which only allows Jacob Tremblay's performance to shine through even more. There was one scene where two characters were having an argument and I felt that it could have been written better. The next scene--something happens, no spoilers--and a character yells \"call 911,\" that one phrase was said with such conviction and urgency that for a second, I thought it was real. I actually forgot I was watching a movie. \"Room\" deals with some some serious drama with right amount of subtlety and pure power. It's a film that I can easily recommend but, at the same time, I know that it won't be a viewing experience that one can just sit back and enjoy (there's a lot to admire and respect, though).

If you do watch the trailer that's fine, but if you wish to avoid knowing what the \"second half\" of this film is like then you should avoid it.That being said, in order to avoid commenting on the second half I am referring to, I'll try to talk about issues explored in the film rather than plot content.The basic premise is that a woman and her son live in a shed, which they refer to as simply \"Room,\" years after the woman's abduction by an older man. Their names are Joy and Jack, and they are very codependent.What I did not expect from this film is that it deals with the theme of perception of reality, and how much the environment has an impact on this perception. Jack has only lived in Room his whole life and knows nothing outside of this life. To maintain his innocence, Joy has had to tell stories to build a certain perspective on reality for her son. One of the best scenes of the film is when Joy decides it is better for Jack to know the truth about the world and reality, and Jack's reaction is heartbreaking and played brilliantly by Jacob Tremblay.I want to say more, but I feel like I would give too much away if I did. In a nutshell, this film deals with issues I never would have imagined to be tackled in a film with this premise. I recommend you see this film unless you find the premise disturbing, though the film is never violent or graphic.3.5/4.0",

The movie had its moments, it really did, and those moments did move me for brief periods of time. Just not in a sustainable way.

    "review": "  As we get closer to the annual Academy Award and Golden Globe award nominations, \"Room\" is one powerful film to keep a close eye on. A fascinating drama about a teenage girl abducted and held captive with her son, this movie combines daunting societal isolation with the need for long-term coping mechanisms. The young mother, Joy \"Ma\" Newsome, raises her 5-year old son Jack in captivity until the time comes to try an escape attempt.With an extraordinary cast and riveting storyline, \"Room\" is one of this year's best films. Brie Larson, as Ma, achieves her most profound film endeavor to date-easily the best female lead performance so far in 2015. Additionally, there's no drop-off in talent from the supporting cast members.Matching Larson's exceptional effort is the work of costar, Jacob Tremblay, who magnificently portrays her 5-year old son, Jack. Look for \"Room\" to be both Larson's and Tremblay's career ground-breaking moment. Supporting firepower is provided by Academy Award nominees Joan Allen and William H. Macy--both playing Jack's grandparents.This is a chilling tale because it takes moviegoers behind shocking newspaper headlines. What starts off as a mother and son survival drama methodically transitions into a story of a daughter and grandson attempting to reintegrate into society. Tremblay's impressive depiction of Jack's overstimulation to his surroundings packs an emotional punch.However, it's Larson's astonishing and heartfelt role that carries this top-shelf film. Larson's amazing transformation from adolescent teen daughter to hostage, and then from young mother to survivor. With stellar acting from both Larson and Tremblay in particular, \"Room\" captivates and grips the audience. Furthermore, it should also net the pair--and this film--numerous award nominations in the coming months.Grade: ABased upon the international best-selling novel \"Room\" by Emma Donoghue, Ma and Jack must coexist in the only world the young boy knows; a 10-foot by 10-foot windowless shed containing a modest bed, toilet, bathtub and small kitchen under an overhead skylight.\"Room\" is an engrossing film that gets stronger and more compelling with each passing minute. Viewers are given a look inside the appalling and cruel circumstances not reported in our 24-hour news cycles. Beyond the shocking living conditions, we find a physically abusive relationship between Ma and her captor--nicknamed Old Nick. Deprived of all but their most basic human needs, Old Nick can't strip away the pair's imagination and hope.",

    "review": "  +Joy (Brie Larson) was kidnapped at the age of 17 and 2 years later gave birth to her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) by her kidnapper Big Nick (Sean Bridgers) where we meet them as Jack celebrates his 5th birthday in the 10 X 10 room, a shed, the only place he has ever known, never going outside. What he knows of the world outside of the shed he has seen on the small TV set they have or been told to him by his mother.The shed has a small sink, 2 chairs, a tub, a bed, a small table, a toaster oven and a closet where Jacob is put in by his mother every time Big Nick comes to rape her. The room is decorated with drawings by the boy and his imagination sees all the things as his friends and the world visible from the very small, very high skylight unimaginable though his mother teaches him to read and explains all the things he sees on the TV as being real.We spend the first 50 minutes with mother and son, with short visits by their kidnapper to abuse her, in what could be a claustrophobic segment but we watch the mother use discipline with her son making him exercise, learn to read, follow oral hygiene, break eggs, learn how to cook and use his imagination. Without telling too much one of the most touching scenes for many reasons is when the pair make a cake for his 5th birthday.The second half of the film deals with their escape--leave logic at the door as it is the only misfire by director Lenny Abrahamson--and what happens to the mother and son coming into the real world.Based on her book and writing the screenplay Emma Donoghue does a good job holding our interest in both segments but I wish there had been about 5-15 minutes more regarding the relation between Joy, her mother (Joan Allen), her father (Willaim H. Macy) now divorced, and their reaction to getting their daughter back 7 years after she was kidnapped.Allen does a excellent job, Macy is wasted in no more than a cameo though his reaction is important to his daughter's freedom. Bridgers, looking like your next door neighbor, is menacing in his lack of looking menacing while Tom McCamus, as the new man in Allen's and now also in the Joy and Jacob's lives is underplayed.Brie Larson is strong, weak, protective, questioning, as the mother who wonders whether she could have done better by her son after doing all she could while they were prisoners.Jacob Tremblay is a revelation as 5 year old Jack whether it be using his imagination about the outside world or when he gets there dealing with it. There were a few times he was incomprehensible on the soundtrack where he does some key narration but just by looks and action he carries the scenes whether alone or dealing with the adults.This sounds like it may be a depressing film and the theme certainly isn't a light one but Jacob Tremblay, at 9 years old, lifts the film up with his acting, his open face and looking at the world with wonder, showing that children can handle life better than most adults.",

    "review": "  \"Room\" is by all accounts a great movie. The acting is some of the best I've seen all year, the story is compelling, the characters interesting and as you follow their plight it's impossible not to get emotionally invested. I urge you to go see it. With that said, I feel like something was lost in translation. Between this film and the novel by Emma Donoghue (who wrote the screenplay, making me ask once again \"What do I know?\") something doesn't sit right with me. Curious? Let's dig in!Joy (Brie Larson) and her five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live in \"Room\", a space no bigger than a tool shed outfitted with a bed, a television and some living essentials. Its all Jack has ever known. Soon after his fifth birthday Joy informs her son of the truth: there's more to the world than just \"Room\". The man who supplies them with food and clothing (Sean Bridgers) kidnapped Joy when she was 17 and there's a whole world waiting for them, if they can escape.If you have seen trailers for this film, you know well ahead what happens in the second half. If you don't I wouldn't say that knowing this gives away so much away that you won't be able to \"Room\", but go in as cold as possible. If you're already in the know rest assured. The extra information did not diminish my enjoyment of \"Room\". It's pretty much impossible not to get involved with what's developing on-screen. Your heart breaks at the very thought of a human being held captive and of another never seeing the outside world. When there is a possibility of escape, no matter how small the odds are you scoot to the edge of your seat because if these two innocents can't be freed, then there's no hope in the world. This story follows two people being forced against their will to live out a life they have not chosen and making the best of it and about seeing this nightmare through a lens of innocence. If you put two and two together you will quickly realize that there are some pretty unsettling things happening here (we don't actually see Joy get raped, but happening regularly without a doubt). You're getting worried, but hold on. This is not what I would call a depressing movie. Seeing the characters move through this story and getting to know them is a rewarding experience. It's like volunteering at a homeless shelter. You might not be around beauty and the situation is sad, but there's something about being there, holding the hand of someone who is at rock bottom that enriches you. This is particularly true with this Lenny Abrahamson picture because the characters are drawn in such a realistic fashion. Jack is not just a precautious innocent who always behaves and sits idly by while the world moves around. 5 year olds can be sweet. They can also be frustrating and impatient. The key is that when they're being funny or asking an innocuous question they melt your heart and you fall head over heels in love. Joy is no a saint either, despite the fact that she's undeniably a victim and a strong person for holding onto shreds of hope.There is still hope within Jack and when I saw the bond between him and his mother it more than made up for the discomfort that I felt thinking about everything that this scenario entailed. I could never quite get over it completely, and I don't think you`re supposed to, but by the end of the film I think you'll manage to emerge unscathed. Witnessing the character of Jack really begin to evolve and grow despite everything he's missed out on ignites your own healing process. If anything, it'll inspire you to think of children and of the resiliency of the human spirit in a whole new way.I do have a criticism which I feel needs to be addressed. Ultimately this movie is about self-discovery and exploration. I don't think it pulls it off 100%. I compare the film to a book that I have not read, but I get the feeling that when you find yourself in Jack's for world the first time, you're not supposed to fully grasp what's happening. Is it a science fiction/fantasy story where the whole world really IS just this tiny? In live action, the illusion is never there. As a person living in the real world, you can immediately tell that there is something wrong. The film is essentially told from Jack's point of view but I never felt like I could truly immerse myself and understand how he thought. Similarly, I think there are missed opportunities with the unique aspects that film can bring to a story. It's not a great example, but I think of Dorothy in \"The Wizard of Oz\", where the use of actors, music and color made it clear that she is in a new world with new rules. It sucked you into this new place to help you understand how different a life it would be. A life lived in a single room could have been conveyed better.I do not think that most people will feel the same way I did about the \"film\" aspect of \"Room\". Even if you do, there's no denying that it is an emotionally successful and touching account that sucks you in right from the beginning, contains real tension without resorting to any cheap tricks and works as a profound examination of two human beings. Then you've got the performances. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay alone should be enough to compel you to get off your butt and see \"Room\" the performances are on a higher echelon than in most films. For those reasons and more, I'm certain that this is not the last time you will hear of \"Room\". (Theatrical version on the big screen, November 10, 2015)",

From the incredible performance by star Brie Larson, who I promise will win best actress at the oscars, and newcomer Jacob Tremblay who gives possibly the best performance by a child actor I've ever seen, the kid is 9 years old! The screenplay by author Emma Donoghue is so smart and the way director Lenny Abrahamson crafts this film is something all cinephiles should take note of! Room is thrilling, triumphant, harrowing, heart-breaking, moving, funny, full of hope, and unforgettable! You will feel every possible emotion throughout the 2 hour runtime. Room is a film that I hope everyone will get a chance to see! 5 out of 5 stars! This is a flawless film!",

    "review": "  Set in a tiny room for half the movie, Room leaves you with more thoughts and feelings than any other movie using the whole world as its setting. Room is a visual representation of the bond between mother and child, which can be heartbreaking at times but always leaves you with a sense of warmth in the end.Having read the book, I was more than excited to see its adaptation to the big screen. I could not be happier with the way it came out. Directed by Lenny Abrahamson, for me a newly found director, Room is the story of a women (Brie Larson) who has been held captive in a shed for seven years with her five year old son, Jack (Jacob Tremlay), who was born in that shed. Jack knows nothing of the outside world and as a result, his mother tries to shield him from everything he might not ever experience, and creates a world for him within Room.The first half of the movie focuses on this aspect. It is absolutely incredible how Abrahamson is able to portray so much in such a little space. Because of this, there are numerous elements in the background and setting that give you clues about the type of life this boy and his mother have, immersing the viewer deeply into the relationship.The second half of the movie focuses on the reality of adjusting to the outside world after escaping and less on their relationship. It is not as strong as the first half of the movie, however, thanks to the brilliant work from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremlay, Room still manages to engage the viewer in an unforgettable manner.Overall, Brie Larson and Jacob Tremlay manage to draw you into their own little world, from both perspectives, the mother and the five year old. Their reality becomes yours and the small things in life don't seem as small anymore. With amazing direction, beautiful cinematography and set design, and breath taking acting, Room's originality succeeds in every aspect.",

Jacob Tremblay's performance is astonishing! The best child performance I have ever seen, mature beyond his years and remarkably brave and strong! Lenny Abrahamson has made a powerful, beautiful, gut wrenching but life affirming movie about the strong bond between mother and son, even in extreme pain, hardship and heartbreak! There is not one false shot, word or moment! This is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen and two of the best performances I have ever experienced! There will not be a movie better than 'Room' this year! The best movie of the decade so far and sure to make my top 100 movies of all time list!",

    "review": "  Based on the best-selling book of the same title,�by Emma Donoghue,�\"Room\" tells the harrowing tale of one�woman's survival through abduction, imprisonment, rape, motherhood and post-traumatic stress. Sound grim? Well, it is, but it is also beautifully life-affirming. As played by the marvelous young actress Brie Larson (\"Short Term 12\"), Ma - the only name by which we know her, spoken by her 5-year-old son, Jack - is a model of strength and resilience, though prone to occasional (and very understandable) fits of despair. Her universe�is limited to a�single room, which she shares with Jack - played by the extremely talented (and relative newcomer) Jacob Tremblay�- through whose point of view the book is told, a device mostly replicated in the film (for which Donoghue also wrote the script). The first images we see are from Jack's perspective: abstract close-ups of furniture and other objects in the tiny space, which slowly morph into shots of Ma. This is the only world that Jack has ever known, and curious sort that he is, he makes the most of it with his imagination. Mother and son have a deeply intimate bond, soon to be tested. We sense, from the opening, that we are in for a riveting and overwhelming experience, a promise to which�Room more than lives up.The director, Lenny Abrahamson, last made a movie about a man trapped by his own psychoses,�\"Frank.\" There, the self-imposed prison was a papier-m�ch� head, inside of which actor Michael Fassbender spent most of the movie. Here, the jail may offer more room to maneuver, but it's far more solid. What are the effects of a seven-year kidnapping? How does one cope without hope? Jack, an originally unwanted�product of violent sexual assault, is now far less albatross than life preserver. With him, Ma's life has structure and meaning. Without him, she�might possibly have long ago surrendered to defeat. In this way, Donoghue weaves a complex tale where good can come from bad, and bad from good. If it comes,�the long hoped-for liberation may joyfully�unlock one set of doors, only to lead Ma and Jack into a new form of captivity.I haven't read the book, so a great surprise for me was how the film doesn't end where you'd expect it to. In fact, what starts out feeling like the third act turns out to be but an extension of the central conflict. It's a tribute to both author and director that they never allow their story a pure happy end. That would be disrespectful to the experience. True, most wounds heal over time, but some leave deep scars. Both Ma and Jack will forever be marked by their years in \"room\" (that's how they refer to their space), no matter what good comes later. The film does leave us with a strong sense of mother-child love, which overrides most of the horrors. And thanks to the exceptional performances from�Larson and Tremblay - and other members of a fine ensemble cast that includes Joan Allen (\"Georgia O'Keeffe\") and William H. Macy (\"The Sessions\") - the bond between Ma and Jack is a�beautiful salve that can, at least, heal the wounds we suffer while watching their plight.�",

After having seen it, I could say that Room is one of the most powerful and emotional films I've seen all year.The acting all around is superb. Brie Larson gives an Oscar worthy performance, displaying so much realistic emotion. The real standout here is 8-year-old Jacob Tremblay, who gives a better performance than the majority of adult actors this year.The story of Room is captivating and really powerful. The first half of the film all takes place in one room, and it works flawlessly. The relationship between the mother and son was so realistic and believable that I was completely invested in their journey. Though the plot seems slightly uneventful after a certain point, it continues to be captivating until the very last shot.The musical score, editing, and cinematography were all fabulous as well. My only flaw with Room was that the pace began to drag a bit during the second half of the film. I won't spoil anything, but after a certain event, not much else happens. Overall, Room is a beautifully acted drama with a captivating story and excellent emotion. See it!RATING: 9/10",

What's disappointing about it, however, is that I don't think it succeeds in suggesting a broader meaning to the highly unusual story it recounts, which seems to be drawn from real life. It's not enough to make us feel sorry for the victims of bizarrely horrible circumstances: a narrative has to make us feel that these experiences relate to us as well.

    "review": "  A gripping, heart wrenching tale of a mother and son reconnecting and for one connecting for the first time to reality after a horror of a life. Brie Larson, who I have been a big champion of with 21 Jump Street, Don Jon, Short Term 12, Trainwreck, and her great TV role on United States of Tara, is amazing as a woman that was kidnapped and imprisoned in a shed for 7 years of her life. It is just unimaginable the torment of being in the same room for 7 years with little supplies and obviously the sexual torment of the kidnapper that led to the birth of Jacob Tremblay's character. Jacob Tremblay is great here and there is a lot of buzz about both actors getting award recognition which is warranted but if Jacob is nominated as a Supporting Actor as he is being campaigned for, that will be singlehandedly the biggest Oscar crime in the history of the show as Tremblay is the commanding force of the movie being in almost every scene and even narrating the movie. But I digress. What it so great about his performance is the factor of only knowing what the world looks like assuming it is this room he is in. He has never seen cars, a fast food restaurant, a hospital, or other people for that matter. The scenes of him just discovering the world for the first time are really powerful stuff that makes you think about how you would have dealt with such a scenario. Joan Allen is really powerful as Larson's mom with this dynamite confrontation between her and Larson but equally powerful with the bonding between her in Jacob. William H. Macy is so great as an actor that he was only in a scene within seconds and broke my heart immediately to the point I was seconds away from crying. That happened twice in the movie, that scene and when Larson finally gets out of the room which I don't think is a spoiler if you've seen the trailer and or realize the inclusion of many other characters. The set decorator and production designer did a great job designing Room making it look very possible to live in but still a small living space as the work of the cinematography enhances. There are some really wonderful moments cinematography wise like the first time Jacob sees the sky in the back of a truck and some of the subtle things that happen in Room. That's what I enjoyed about this movie the most, it could have been an over the top hostage movie but it had so much subtly to most scenes and it was quite nuanced than other movies of the same topic. The wiring is excellent, the direction is superb, the score is powerful though was a bit impeding during some scenes, and a great ensemble. My two quarrels with the movie would have to lie with William H. Macy's character and this unexplained hostility that happens during a dinner scene. It just felt in the end odd placement and even odder that it was never explained why it was such a hostile moment. I would have liked more of Macy and maybe a few more scenes of Jacob discovering the world for the first time. Other than that, this is a harrowing but powerful movie that is a must see.",

    "review": "  A thrilling, heart breaking, and ultimately life affirming film, that calls out as awards season's most selfless entree. Adapted from Emma Donoghue's novel (who also supplied the screenplay), Room tells a shocking story, but with a respectful amount of restraint. While necessarily tense throughout, Room finds levity in it's central theme regarding a mother-and-child's bonding. Brie Larson gives another seamless performance (she may very well be the best duogenarian actress working in Hollywood), and the 9-year old Jacob Tremblay should be very proud of how powerful his delivery is, as the story is touchingly told through his young character's perspective. If there's one disappointment to Room, it's that the second half doesn't quite measure up to the first. The film's first 40 minutes are the most mesmerizing in terms of cinematography and narrative, before it adopts a more conventional yet still compelling approach. Regardless, Room is a must-see if ever there was one, and a very welcome change of pace for director Lenny Abrahamson, after last year's Frank.",

    "review": "  It's a very unique movie, but what works REALLY works. You will be hit in the feels with this one.Most of the film is a two person show between Brie Larson and child actor Jacob Tremblay. Both of them give absolutely amazing performances. Tremblay is perfect. Every reaction is spot on, every behavior, every spat with his mother... it's just perfect. Never overdone, never annoying. Kudos to him. If Larson hit a home run with Short Term 12, she hit a Grand Slam with this one. She's vulnerable, in one of the most extreme positions of weakness imaginable (she's been locked in a garden shed for 7 years. Tremblay is 5. You do the math), yet the love and warmth she brings to her relationship with Tremblay are just too powerful to ignore. This is just a fantastic performance from Larson. If the film has any flaws, it's that it plays its high cards way too soon. The film is neatly cut in two halves, the first half showing Larson and Tremblay's imprisonment and the second showing their difficulty in returning to normalcy, particularly for Tremblay. Poor kid has never known any life other than that garden shed. Unfortunately, the second half isn't as powerful as the first. The rescue of Larson and Tremblay plays like it's the climax of the film, so when it happens, we as the audience are ready at the point to go \"They're safe. Movie over\". Yes, we want to know Larson and Tremblay are going to be okay, but couldn't we just have someone like a doctor or one of Larson's parents say there's going to be an awkward transition period?Even though the second half isn't as great as the first, that does not diminish Larson or Tremblay. Their chemistry and their performances are fantastic and worth the price of admission. No Tommy Wiseau in this one, sadly.",

This hard-hitting, dramatic tear jerker is told through the eyes of 5-year old Jack (Jacob Tremblay), the son of kidnapper and rapist 'old man Nick' who abducted, raped and locked away his Ma (Brie Larson) in what they call 'Room', a shed in the Old Man Nick's garden.After concocting and rehearsing their plan, 5-year old Jack manages to escape and relay a brief and sparse description of where he and his had been held. The highly astute police officer manages to narrow the location down and successfully finds his mum, Joy Newsome.This extraordinary story is a tale about discovery and freedom, a luxury Jack has never known. We see how he discovers the outside world in ways he could never have imagined, as he relishes in the adventure and the excitement we see how he and his Ma adapt back into society and into a life a life that had so far only been a figment of his imagination.",

Maybe not complex to everyone, if you look at the imagery, camerawork, and script choices, there really is something incredible here. After being raised in a room for five years, with no outdoor contact, Jack and his Ma Joy escape and see daylight for the first in a long time. Told through the perspective of the child, he is seeing the world, people, objects, and nature, all for the first time. The emotional impact that has on the story is breathtaking. Brie Larson gives a gut-wrenching performance and I believed every single scene she was in. Starting from a confined room, you really begin to see what the world is truly like and how we take everything for granted that is in it. I loved \"Room\" from start to finish. Although I believe this is a brilliant film overall, I have to complain about the way they were able to escape. It felt a little too easy and then that tension was gone throughout the rest of the film in order to focus on the emotional heft, i.e. the family. In the end, \"Room\" has a very raw and true screenplay, incredible performances, inspiring visuals, and a story that is once in a generation, and we do not get many of those. I wish it did not have an easy way out in the opening act, but overall, I feel I can still give it a perfect score. See this film!",

My eyes were watery the entire time. It's hard to imagine Brie Larson and 9 year old Jacob Tremblay not getting Oscars for their performances. Larson is so convincing you forget she's acting. Tremblay gives one of the best child performances I've ever seen in a film. Unbelievable. SO UNBELIEVABLE!!!I could rave about this all day. Let's also not forget Joan Allen who's wonderful in a supporting role. The heartbreak of Room comes from the horror of being kidnapped for 7 years and the guilt Larson's character feels for her son being raised as a victim. Then the movie moves you by showing the world through Tremblay's eyes after he and his mother escape their abductor. It's so real. So powerful. This is the best movie of the year.",

Brie Larson is outstanding as the kidnapped mother of young Jack (Jacob Tremblay, also really good), who has raised him to believe the entire world is the room where she's held captive, until she uses him as a means of escape, and then simply how they both react to being in the world -- her coping with changes since she's been gone, and him for the first time. I have a few issues with the story, mainly how we never learn much about the grandmother, her boyfriend, or the severely underutilized William H Macy as the grandfather. However, since it's mostly from Jack's viewpoint those would have been difficult to explore anyway. Definitely worth checking out for the performances alone.",

Larson gives the performance of the year as a woman trapped in a windowless room for seven years with her five-year old son. The first act is harrowing and unsettling and you can feel the dread of the two. As good as Larson is, Jacob Tremblay who plays her son gives one of the best performances from a child actor I have seen in a long time. Both should be mentioned come awards season.

    "review": "  STUCK HOME SYNDROME - My Review of ROOM (4 Stars)Don't let the bright wonderment of the poster fool you, ROOM is one of the most emotionally devastating films of the year, anchored by beyond stellar performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, a young Canadian actor whose focus and range rivals that of Tatum O'Neal in PAPER MOON. Prepare to be gutted. It's almost impossible to describe this film without spoilers, but I'll do just that. If you've read Emma Donoghue's novel, of which she adapted for the screen, then you already know the basic premise of a mother (Larson) raising her 5-year-old son, Jack (Tremblay) in a tiny room. Shielding him from the world for reasons that become clear upon viewing, he doesn't know that any type of life exists beyond his four walls. Think of this as a much more emotionally vibrant and more honest sister film to LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, which also explored the lengths a parent will go to in order to protect their child. Much of the first half of this film is fraught with unbearable suspense, with the mother doing everything she can to resolve their situation. Danny King, whose work on LES MISERABLES did not make me a fan, employs a live camera and a lot of shallow focus to put the point of view squarely on the shoulders of our two protagonists. Yes, it's a claustrophobic experience, but to feel otherwise would be doing the subject matter a disservice. Director Lenny Abrahamson has made an intimate film about big ideas, and there's very smart economy in its storytelling. It's overlong by at least 20-30 minutes, however, and with such a generous running time of almost two hours, you would expect a little more to William H. Macy's lightly sketched in, barely there character. It's not that he's incapable, but he's given way too little to work with here. Not so of Joan Allen, who digs deep with limited screen time as well. Also tremendously effective in supporting roles are Sean Bridgers, who has a knack for keeping an audience on edge, Wendy Crewson as a journalist who prods just a little bit too much, and Amanda Brugel, as a woman who has to assert herself in order to cut through the muck. I could have done without the tin can-style of recording the voiceover, which certainly feels unsettling, but was truly difficult to comprehend at times. The score by Stephen Rennicks is certainly beautiful and heartfelt, but he could have dialed it back a hair with the final music cue. There was so much sap in it, I was tempted to call the film MUSHROOM! Far from it, this is a challenging experience, often seen through tears, and not an easy sit for any parent who worries about their child. Larson and Tremblay should be firmly in the mix come Awards season. Larson continually surprises me with her performances. Looking like Reese Witherspoon's sister, I keep expecting her to act goofy and self-conscious, yet her instincts are so vibrantly attuned to the material, she seems incapable of making a false move. Whether he has natural abilities or was heavily directed, Tremblay is a highly sympathetic actor whose ability to annoy, infuriate and warm an audience's heart, sometimes within the same scene, is something special to behold. ROOM is very dark, sad, and sometimes without a shred of hope, yet this tale of a Herculean bond between mother and son is well worth all the sobbing you'll likely find yourself doing afterwards.",

Things slow the moment the kidnapping sex offender appears on screen. Then, sadly, the film's momentum comes to a screeching halt at the moment the villain reaches a stop sign (unfortunate irony!) and what should've been the most dramatic cinematic moment of the year, fizzles out. The movie falls off a cliff. The second half is chemistry-free with poorly written, cartoon character subplots unworthy of a bad Lifetime TV movie. I pray Larson & Tremblay receive the nominations they deserve, but the writer and director need a remedial course in \"Choices Filmmakers Should Avoid At All Costs!\"",

    "review": "  Excellent performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay make Room's extremely interesting concept a heartfelt tale of mother-son love. That this concept is reduced to a mother-son love story is something I'm mixed about, but for sure Room is an enjoyable and touching movie. The young Jacob Tremblay carries the film on his teeny shoulders with surprising ease. This is a weirdly good performance from a child and I mean that in the best way possible. Tremblay's mature performance effectively conveys his character's ignorance to the world and how he experiences the world for the first time. Brie Larson is great as well as the mother who does her best to protect her son and properly raise him in their strange situation. Her character isn't explored explicitly, since the film is through Jack's eyes, but we understand her through the depth of Larson's performance where she unveils years of psychological torment through her eyes. She is also great in capturing the loving kindness of a mother, no matter how imperfect she may be. Together, Larson and Tremblay have believable and often beautiful chemistry as a small family who has lived in a shed with (pretty much) only each other for five years. Lenny Abrahamson's direction is effective at showing us the world through Jack's eyes. Through his camera, Room (what they refer to their shed as) feels like a home where nothing else needs to exist, and the outside world is often scary or dizzying. Off-kilter angles convey Jack's perspective very organically and the close-ups and handheld movements of the camera capture the emotion of the characters. Watching the film, I was excited to see where the film would take its concept and how it would choose to study its main characters. After all, the concept is so interesting. The film signaled to me the potential to explore themes of trauma or parenting through this unique scenario. I was let down a little by the end, when it seemed that the film wanted to settle for a sweet mother-son love story when I thought it would go somewhere deeper and more exciting. It seems to understand the psychology of the mother and son, but never quite examines it the way the film practically demands. It doesn't fail at being a sweet movie and emotional movie. For me, the emotional peak was in the middle, but nothing made me need tissues despite many having advised audiences to bring them. In presenting a touching story of a mother and son who were each other's strength in overcoming what they did, the movie mostly succeeds, and the two lead performances are unforgettable. I just hoped there would be a little more.",

    "review": "  Brie Larson is starting to make herself into one of the finest actors working right now and with Room it seems as if she's made perhaps her biggest statement, even more so than her outstanding work in Short Term 12. Larson her isn't so much in top form as she is at her most vulnerable, emotionally wracking, and jaw-droppingly good as she'll ever be, a performance that rocks the year so far for being one of the best acting performances we'll see all of 2015. It's the kind of role you lose yourself in, scene after scene of heartbreak and difficulty. Her role of Joy is one of the most emotionally demanding roles one could ask for and Larson delivers with astounding results. While her performance is part of what makes the film, the film itself doesn't suffer from relying on a single aspect, but is a richly emotional journey about a subject not always explored in film. Jacob Trembly is also particularly good as her son Jack, raised in the most unusual and disturbing of circumstances, a performance that was either made by the actor, the director, or the editor, it doesn't matter as it's incredibly convincing, the perfect balance to Larson's Ma/Joy that creates an unbreakable mother/son dynamic. The script, surprisingly written by the author who shows a surprising amount of screenwriting intelligence, has made a wholly convincing script grounded in reality and humanity along with a director with an eye for realism while remaining in the art of filmmaking. Room is a great film, maybe one of the best so far this year, a richly emotional film of sorrow and heart in the end. Someone may find it hard to watch, but it's also impossible to wrench your eyes away",

    "review": "  A young mother and her son are locked up in a room with no windows but only a skylight. We soon found out why they are there and they hatch a plan to escape. Part tense thriller and part PTSD the movie, the most intriguing aspect of this emotional film however is that it was told all through the child's point of view. This fresh approach manages to find the humanity and even the humour in the cruel and inhuman situation they found themselves in. A pair of great performances by Brie Larson and the very natural Jacob Tremblay is simply the icing on the cake.",

    "review": "  Room is the wonderful and emotional tale of a young boy going into the outside world for the first time due to being held captive in a 'room' his entire life alongside his mother, joy, who will have to cope with the pressure. I tell you what, Lenny Abrahamson has absolutely done it again. Room is a masterpiece of character development, drama and suspense. You really care about everyone in this movie apart from the captor. It is truly great emotional dialogue and film work that moves you so much and changes your perspective on how our world would work to that of, essentially, an alien. It's not completely perfect per say...the first few scenes set up this child to be annoying and thank god that the opposite happened. Apart from that, pure rich dramatic cinema.",

    "review": "  At the start of Room, a young woman and her five-year-old son are living in the titular edifice, a backyard shed. The woman (Brie Larson) has always told Jack (Jacob Tremblay) that \"outer space\" is all that exists outside Room; as far as Jack is concerned, this is the gospel truth and the universe consists of Room and Room alone.It is not giving anything away to note that Ma and Jack escape Room, as the movie is more about the ability of each to cope with the outside world. For Jack, every step and every breath outside is a wholly new experience. Ma, despite having lived for 17 years before coming to Room, encounters different obstacles - the world has moved on, and she doubts her own ability as a mother to Jack.I had been expecting a suspenseful drama-thriller about a daring escape, given the various synopses I'd read. (The movie is based on a novel by Emma Donoghue, which is itself loosely based on real events.) Much of the first half of the film, though, concentrates on life inside Room for Ma and Jack. Ma uses her strong will and infinite patience to convince Jack for five years that all is well and that what they have is a normal life, that what they see on television is not real, but everything from the single bed to the lidless toilet tank is definitely real. Ma sacrifices as much as she can to keep Jack happy and (relatively) safe, even to the point of giving herself over to her captor on a regular basis in exchange for food and other items for Jack and herself.To say that this first half moves slowly would be to understate things. We don't just get a slice of the life that the duo leads; we get the entire pie, and most of it just isn't all that exciting or intriguing. We do get to see a little into the characters of the characters, pardon the phrasing. We see that Jack doesn't like to not get his way or to have his worldview challenged. Then again, who does at age 5? We see that Ma is often calm but firm with her young charge. It's a small Room, after all; no need to go nuclear when there's really no point to it. In any event, much time is spent watching their everyday sheltered lives. Because the general plot involved their lives beyond Room, I began to grow impatient: Were they going to spend the entire movie in Room, only to escape in the final minutes? Why wouldn't anything happen? The fact that Ma and Jack would eventually escape left the first half of the movie perfectly devoid of suspense. Although still waters do often run deep, I didn't really feel like I was getting a lot out of watching a whole lot of nothing.Once they do escape, though, things pick up. The focus quickly shifts from a struggle for survival to a struggle to understand. Ma's parents, played by Joan Allen and William H. Macy, have different reactions to the return of their daughter and the arrival of their new (to them) grandson. In the five years since Ma's abduction, her parents have separated; her dad lives on the other side of the country now, and her mom lives with her friend Leo (Tom McCamus). With Ma's return, there's a lot of media hype, and lawyers, atop a potent array of stress factors. Escaping may have been the easy part.The acting is uniformly terrific. Larson's work is powerful, evocative, and heart-wrenching, and it's definitely award worthy. Allen and Macy also excel with perhaps the best work in their respective careers, and that's saying something. Young Tremblay is also very good - as is his character, a plucky, long-haired cherub who's more at home in Room than in the outside world (and with good reason).But the acting cannot overcome what's basically a very turgid script. Room is punchless at its core, and it would be a total waste if it weren't for the Herculean efforts of its talented cast. When there is no action, I look for meaning. When there is no meaning or action, I look for the exit. Room suffers from spending too much time contemplating things and not enough time doing them - or at least discussing them. Forget the action, I wouldn't have minded seeing more reaction. The first half of the movie could have been subtitled \"A Series of Plodding Events.\" The second half goes a long way toward saving the first, thanks in part to additional characters and a fresh setting, but it's not enough to save the entire movie.",
