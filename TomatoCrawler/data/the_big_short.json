    "review": "  Better known for his comedy films like Anchorman, Step Brothers and Talladega Nights, The Big Short is a big leap for director Adam McKay. Going from improvised Will Ferrell gags to dealing with the true story of the global financial crisis of 2008 is quite a departure from his usual comfort zone. If truth be told, I'm not a fan of his comedies and had some strong reservations about this but it was hard to resist seeing such quality actors sink their teeth into a very personal subject that has affected us all. Hedge fund managers Michael Burry (Christian Bale) and Mark Baum (Steve Carell), trader Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) and retired banker Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) all work within the financial sector. However, they see a problem arising; the housing credit market is about to collapse and no-one but them can see it coming. They see it as a perfect time to invest against the banks and make money from what turns out to be the fall of the global economy.First off, The Big Short is not an easy film to like. It's so dialogue laden that the bankers and brokers jargon can leave you scratching your head in bewilderment. There's really only so much talk of C.D.O's, Short's and Subprime's that a person can take but that's exactly the point. McKay knows this and he's clever enough to point out that the bankers want it this way. They want the ordinary, every-day working stiff to think it's only them that know how to manage our money for us. McKay doesn't pull any punches and goes straight for the jugular when it's comes to the inner dealings of these immoral and reckless financial swindlers who brought down the world economy. He depicts their carefree avarice in such a detestable way that you're left infuriated. If this was his intention (which I'm sure it was) then you have to say that his film is a success. However, the manner in which he does it can be off-putting. There's a kinetic energy to McKay's direction and, although impressive, it's a little messy with too many jump cuts and forth-wall-breaking moments. Despite his best efforts, his stylistic devices don't always help you to understand the complexity of these events and he finds it tricky to fully transcend the confusion by employing a frantic pace to everything. That said, this is a hugely difficult subject to tackle and he does deserve some credit for managing any form of coherence at all. McKay is clearly angry and it's an anger I, wholeheartedly, share. His scathing attack on the fraudulent activities of these people is potent. His message (and conscience) is clear and his attempt to bring it to a mainstream audience, with quality actors in tow, is an admirable one. It's a good ensemble he's put together and they all deliver fine work; Pitt is the one who takes a back seat and seems underused but Carell proves that his dramatic chops from Foxcatcher was no fluke while Bale has some fun with his eccentric glass-eyed turn. From the leads, I found Gosling to be the most comfortable with his cocksure wolfishness and it's always a pleasure to have the likes of Melissa Leo and Marisa Tomei make an (all-be-it brief) appearance. I can only hope that with such a recognisable cast that the masses wake from their slumber and pay attention to, not so much the disjointed film itself, but the message and teaching behind it.It's not an entirely successful endeavour as it struggles to entertain without getting bogged down in investment lingo but it's an important morality tale with a message that still resonates. If Joy is this year's film to embrace the capitalist system then The Big Short is the indictment of it.Mark Walker",

    "review": "  Adam McKay does a great job taking a convoluted subject and turning it into a very comprehensible film. All actors do a great job, especially Bale, Carell and Gosling, and the directing is unique with it's cutaways. This film is both funny and fascinating, and while I realize a lot of it is compressed, dramatized, the fact that this is all true (by Hollywood standards, but still this happened to some degree) is stunning.",

All the pieces of a great film were there--great cast, important story--but The Big Short fails to do any of these elements justice due to some questionable directorial and editing choices made by McKay and a striking lack of depth. I commend the film, however, for providing a digestible perspective on the 2008 crisis and another venue for Bale and Carrell to show off their acting skills.",

    "review": "  Adam McKay is not exactly the kind of name you associate with a prestige picture that's building serious Oscar heat. McKay is best known as the director and co-writer of Will Ferrell's best movies, from Anchorman and its sequel to Talladega Nights and the underrated 2010 buddy cop movie, The Other Guys. If you stuck through the closing credits for Guys, you were treated to an animated education lesson on the size of Wall street's greed and accountability in regards to the 2008 financial crisis. It was impassioned, angry, and an interesting note to end an otherwise goofy comedy. The Big Short is based upon Michael Lewis' (Moneyball) best-selling book and it's a disaster movie where the biggest disaster is the world economy. The movie McKay co-adapted and directed is bristling with intelligence, indignation, and a clear purpose. He wants to make you very angry, and by the end if you're not, you haven't been paying enough attention.In the wake of the financial collapse in 2008, the fallout was so tremendous that many people felt nobody could have seen this coming. There were a few and they made out like bandits while trying to warn others about the impending doom. In the early 2000s, Michael Burry (Christian Bale) is a hedgefund manager who sees warning signs that the housing market is a bubble ready to burst. He sees the toxicity of the majority sub-prime mortgages wrapped together and sold as a seemingly safe security, a CDO (collateralized debt obligation). His bosses think he's mad and they're furious when they discover Burry has gone from bank to bank making big bets against the housing market. The banks are eager to take what they believe to be easy money from a sucker. How could the housing market burst? Other Wall Street investors take notice of Burry, notably Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) who pitches the plan to \"short\" the housing market. Nobody takes him seriously except Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and his small team who works for Goldman Sachs. Baum is curious how something so large could go unnoticed, so he and his team fly to Florida and Vegas to investigate the realities of the market and what they find does not match the rosy cheerleading from Wall Street. A pair of wannabe traders (Finn Witrock, John Magaro) stumbles across Burry's analysis and try to make their own bets, except they need a bigger name to make the trades. They reach out to an ex-Wall Street trader (Brad Pitt) who agrees to shepherd them on this quixotic quest. Are these men righteous defenders of fraud or just people trying to get their own cut of the pie?The brilliance of The Big Short lies in its accessibility and the virulent passion that McKay has for the subject matter. The movie is structured like a heist and an underdog story, suckering in the audience to root for the upstarts trying to fleece the big banks and profit off their greed and stupidity. For the first 90 minutes or so, the film comes across like a caper and we follow our group of misfits as they fight against the conventional wisdom that the housing market could never topple. These guys see the signs and the risks that others could not or would not see, especially since the flow of money was rich and the good times could be shared, which lead to collusion from the very same agencies designed to regulate and enforce the financial laws. For those 90 minutes the movie flies by on its sense of whimsy and are-we-getting-away-with-this good fortune, putting our band of misfits in position to win big on the losses of the ignorant and fraudulent. And then, in one swift move, it all comes down and you're reminded, rather indignantly by Pitt's character, that what they are benefiting from is the meltdown of the U.S. housing market and by extension the American economy. What once felt like a celebratory caper now starts to feel queasy, and it's in the last act that The Big Short reminds you just how awful the events of the 2008 financial crisis were and how these guys did nothing more than benefit from mass misery. These are not heroes, though Mark Baum is given plenty of moral grandstanding moments that present him as the closest thing we have in the picture. These were a bunch of guys who got rich betting on a lot of other people's bad bets, bets that almost destroyed the world's economic systems. The concluding half hour feels like a sudden stop after a sugar rush, where you're left to question your decision-making but also come to terms with the reality of what seemed like a fun time. McKay lures his audience in with the guise of a heist/underdog story, appealing and accessible avenues of cinema, and then serves the cod hard medicine in the concluding moments.McKay is admirably trying to educate and advocate while he entertains, but he truly wants the audience to understand why they should be sharpening their pitchforks. At several points, characters will break the fourth wall and talk directly into the camera, admitting that certain events didn't happen exactly as we saw, or occasionally they'll remind us that what we watched was exactly how it happened. It's a measure that isn't overplayed and helps juice the spirits of the movie, becoming something of a confidant in the schemes with the onscreen participants. When things gets a little hard to understand with the mountain of Wall Street lingo, McKay will cut to celebrity cameos to help explain the more arcane instruments of the financial system. Margot Robbie luxuriates in a bubble bath and explains sub-prime mortgages, Anthony Bourdain explains CDOs, and Selena Gomez, in a rather cogent analogy, explains synthetic CDOs as an endless chain of side bets being made off one hand of blackjack. The movie goes pretty fast and a viewer might experience information overload, but McKay knows when to slow things down and provide a well-timed assist, so that his learned audience will see the true extent of the corruption and greed rampant in how Wall Street handled its business.Of the three storylines, I found Mark Baum and his team easily the most interesting and I think McKay and co-screenwriter Charles Randolph (The Interpreter) agreed, which is why he's the biggest part of the movie. Burry gets things started but he recedes into the background after the first act, and that's where Baum and his financial team step into the spotlight to further explore how unstable the housing market just might be. I think this is Carell's best dramatic performance to date (I wasn't wowed by Foxcatcher). He's playing perhaps one of the angriest people seen on screen but that's because he has a moral center and the bad business practices, let alone the sociopathic greed of his \"peers,\" constantly enrage him. He's something like a flabbergasted crusading journalist who keeps shaking his head in stupefying revulsion at just how deep this whole thing goes. Having Baum as our entry into the moral morass of Wall Street allows the audience to feel a sense of ethical superiority, and then like Pitt's character, it can all go away with one perfectly articulated retort. There's a moment where Baum is lambasting a mortgage ratings officer (Melissa Leo, her only scene too) after she admits that if they don't rate bad mortgages as good, the banks will just go to their competitor, and then she accuses Baum of being a hypocrite. His reason for the office visit is not that his outrage at the fraud but the fact that this fraud is holding up his winnings. He's not the crusader he may wish to be. Bale (American Hustle) and Gosling (Only God Forgives) are perfectly cast and provide strong supporting work in small doses spread throughout. There is a bevy of familiar faces (Marisa Tomei, Rafe Spall, Max Greenfield, Karen Gillan) appearing in small moments as if everybody in Hollywood wanted to get in on McKay's party.There is one annoying misstep in the movie and it occurs about halfway and it's made to stretch out the stakes in a haphazard manner. The Big Short is a disaster movie where the audience knows exactly when the disaster is coming, and yet there's a section in the middle where the characters are all left in doubt whether their big bets will pay off because of the ratings fraud. Burry is threatened with losing his job. It's silly because we know the economy is going to crash in 2008, but the movie throws out a weak obstacle that, hey, maybe it won't crash. It reminds me of the Hinderberg movie from the 1970s. There were several moments where it looked like that zeppelin full of hydrogen was going to go up in fames... except students of history know that moment is fated in New Jersey, so all the close calls were foolish fake-outs for a major event that was well anticipated. We all know the economy is going down so there's no need for the manufactured doubts.McKay and company want to wake up a fairly apathetic general public about the crimes and negligence of the Wall Street robber barons that risked the world's economy and then managed to skip out on the tab. The tones can juggle wildly, and I'd credit McKay's background in comedy for his ability to maintain a reliable and firm comic footing for the film without losing the significance of his message. It's hard to nail down a genre for the movie; it's a dark comedy, a drama, a true crime picture, and a wake-up call. You have moments that feel like a heist flick and moments that feel like a sickening journalistic expose. It's got highs, lows, laughs, groans, and plenty of human emotions, though the most prominent would be disgust and disbelief. The Big Short is advocacy populism as pop-entertainment, and it succeeds ably. It's an economics lesson for the public. At the end of the movie, the closing text informs us about \"bespoke tranches,\" which are investment opportunities that banks are flocking to ($5 billion in 2013 to $20 billion in 2014). It's just another name for CDOs. Unless an informed public demands action from the system, it seems that Wall Street is doomed to repeat its same high-risk mistakes and that same vulnerable public is doomed to clean up the mess.Nate's Grade: A-",

    "review": "  While I am always intrigued by a premise like this, I know there will be elements that I will not understand. Surprisingly, I was able to follow this film with ease. \"The Big Short\" follows groups of people as the statistics of the housing market, leading up to the crash in 2008, are uncovered. The major thing you have to accept in order to enjoy this film, is definitely it's editing style. The shaky camera and quick edits represent the raw feel of the story at hand, and I thought that was fantastic. A terrific screenplay, a stellar cast, and great direction by Adam McKay all make this a film worth watching. It deserves every bit of praise it is getting, even though it's snail pace can become tiring at times. I had a blast watching this movie, as I was able to see all of the behind-the-scenes facts that I did not know about. In the end, if you have patience, this is a terrific film, but that is a necessity to watch this film. \"The Big Short\" is powerful for what it sets out to say, and nothing more. To me, it is incredibly crafted, but it certainly is not for everyone. Great film!",

    "review": "  There's been many films made about the disastrous financial crash of the late 2000s and \"The Big Short\" may be the best and scathing yet.Adam McKay expertly blends comedy and drama and delivers one of the scariest movies of the year. A tale of human greed, made even scarier by the fact that it was all true, is compelling and quite infuriating. \"The Big Short\" boasts an impressive cast and they all deliver. Christian Bale and Steve Carell have the showier roles and they revel in them. Brad Pitt is understated yet strong, Gosling is appropriately smarmy. The performance are important to emphasize as without them \"The Big Short\" would have had a tough time working.The film is definitely politically planted to the left and while that helps with the tone of exasperation it needs, it diminishes the impact the film needs to fully reach all of its audience. The film does sheepishly skirt the fact that our protagonists ultimately benefited from this disaster - and despite the admiration they deserve for spotting a big problem - all they did was make money from it and did not attempt to actively change it. By exposing that raw truth, \"The Big Short\" could have been scarier.With that said, it is still an incredible film and one of the best of the year. It's a film to be watched by all despite the fact that at the end of the day - it didn't change things one bit.",

    "review": "  The Big Short has all the elements of a great film. A great ensemble cast, engrossing story, unique direction, and intriguing characters. Steve Carell gives another sensational performance in this film proving that Foxcatcher was no accident. He brings a funny and emotional performance with an underlying sense of tragedy. Carell shows that he is a force to be reckoned with in cinema, and he should get some serious notoriety come award season. Christian Bale also brings a fantastic performance to the film. His take on an autistic and socially awkward man was great, and he really captures his unique characteristics. Ryan Gosling was the energy in the film, bringing a fun and slick performance and showing once again that he and Carell work perfectly together once again. Brad Pitt gives a sweet performance that I think the audience will be able to relate to the most, even while he didn't have too much screen time. He did a great job. John Magaro and Finn Witrock also gave underrated performances and were a great duo in the film. The script perfectly captures the financial crisis of 2007â\"2010 brought on by the build-up of the housing market and credit bubble, and the men who profited off it. While you can't sympathize with many of their actions, especially if you were harmed by these events, you strangely still want them to succeed in their endeavor. Its a very funny yet emotional film, and seeing the events leading up to it is nothing short of fascinating. Adam Mckay is a fantastic director. He brings energy and life to these depressing events and interesting characters, and brings his best film to date. Sometimes the film can be hard to follow and loses focus in some scenes, but overall I really enjoyed the film. The Big Short is a very unique biopic, and thanks to the cast, great script, and Adam Mckays brilliant direction its one of 2015's best films.",

    "review": "  THE WHOOPS OF WALL STREET - My Review of THE BIG SHORT (3 1/2 Stars)Writer-director Adam McKay, best known for such zany comedies as ANCHORMAN and STEP BROTHERS, has teamed up with writer Charles Randolph for his shot at something more substantial with THE BIG SHORT, based on the bestseller by Michael Lewis. He mostly succeeds with this funny, confusing, exasperating, artful yet repetitive look at a major financial crisis. Following a group of misfit financial investors who predicted and bet on the fall of the U.S. housing market, the film has a rough start. There's lots of cross-cutting and business lingo thrown at you. If, like me, you just don't understand Wall Street operates, fear not. Once all of the main players are introduced and the predictions of doom have been spelled out, along comes Margot Robbie in a bubble bath to explain it all to you. Breaking the fourth wall, the filmmakers provide a FINANCE FOR DUMMIES moment, the first of many. Stylistically audacious and hilarious to boot, here is where the film finally took off for me. By acknowledging the impenetrability of its subject, I felt able to participate in the story. Although 2011's MARGIN CALL told a similar story, albeit with a much more sobering tone, and WOLF OF WALL STREET turned the investment banking world into one long rave, THE BIG SHORT, a true story, feels unique. Much of that credit goes to editor Hank Corwin, who cuts scenes off mid-sentence and crams in stock footage while juggling a large number of story elements. It's an impressive display from a professional who is no stranger to fast cutting (see NATURAL BORN KILLERS). The cast, particularly Steve Carell and Christian Bale, have a field day with their roles, getting to live out their BOILER ROOM/GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS dreams in this mostly all-male, testosterone-driven fever-pitched battle of subterfuge. While Brad Pitt (in full late 70s Robert Redford mode here) and Ryan Gosling have their moments, Carell and Bale own this film. Playing a short-fused man who feels the hopelessness of taking on the 1%, Carell excels. Imagine if his OFFICE alter-ego, Michael Scott, had lost everything, including his will to live, and gained a terrible hairpiece, and you get his Mark Baum. Bale's Michael Burry exists outside of the main story, yet his presence is essential. Sporting a glass eye and a wardrobe that even The Dude from THE BIG LEBOWSKI would shun, his character plays drums and heavy metal in his basement while figuring out how and when the housing market would crash. Socially awkward yet impressively prescient, Burry becomes our hero of sorts.Here's where my relationship with THE BIG SHORT went from \"in love\" to \"it's complicated\". I found myself rooting for men who profited off the backs of people who lost everything when they defaulted on their loans. Yes, one of the main characters offers up this sobering news, but it makes the entire experience of watching this film feel a little icky. Still, I love seeing a filmmaker use his blockbuster capital to stretch. McKay still has a little of that populist huckster in him, that need to entertain, and with a film ultimately as depressing as this one ends up being, that's not such a terrible thing.",

    "review": "  I find it interesting that despite how catastrophic the global recession of 2008 was, few movies of quality have centered on the topic. It's probably to do with how confusing the inner workings of Wall Street are to the average person. Even if said workings are all utter bullshit. (See: The Wolf of Wall Street.) This is probably why The Big Short is framed partially as a heist movie with plenty of celebrity cameos to explain exactly what the hell is going on. Big Short is about three different teams of Wall Street investors who notice that the sub-prime mortgage market is headed toward imminent collapse and then decide to do the unthinkable - bet against that market (and therefore the American economy) by shorting their stock and get rich while everyone else reenacts October 1929. Christian Bale succeeds as an anti-social polymath who notices the trend and makes little room for those less intelligent than he (everyone else) and sees his limited group of comrades dwindle further due to his bold decisions. Ryan Gosling does a little too well as a slimy banker who wishes to profit off other people's misfortune. I personally found Steve Carell the true hero of the film both as an actor and character. He is a complete misanthrope who hates the system he is a part of, but at the same time he is a crusader who is deeply wounded by the narcissistic and damaging actions his fellow investors are inflicting on the world economy, despite all of the warning signs. He is a man of lovely contradictions and Carell has fun conveying them. The film is 15 to 20 minutes too long and many of the details are hard to keep track of at times. The dialogue is excellent, and the film goes to great lengths to make the material more enjoyable, such as when characters break the fourth wall and speak directly into the camera. And the message they have is clear - Wall Street screwed you over. And it doesn't care.",

    "review": "  Boiler Rooming advanced economics into crazy stupid unlovely shop talk that all filmgoers can understand, pointed morality tale The Big Short qualifies as a drama but the pure lunacy of the story and slick fourth wall-breaking presentation re-package sad true events as one of the sharpest comedies in years. As straight-ahead as the storytelling and stripped-down as the performances are in Spotlight, this film goes the opposite route, making its real-life figures purposely hyper-realistic-just like the ridiculous position they find themselves. Giving the audience gratuitous cheatsheets by having its characters occasionally address the audience directly and, in one example, having alluring actress Margot Robbie explain credit default swaps from a bubble bath, this whipsmart adaptation of Michael Lewis' whipsmart book by the same name winks and nods to the utter madness at hand. In effect, it's not that The Big Short laughs WITH and not AT you, the taxpayers who are still suffering through the fallout of this travesty, it's that the film gets you to laugh at this bubble bursting at all.In this R-rated account of the financial meltdown catalyst of 2008, four denizens of the world of high-finance (Bale, Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt) predict the credit and housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000s, and decide to take on the big banks for their greed and lack of foresight. Usually known for capturing Will Ferrell's unique man-child brand of sophomoric clowning, director Adam McCay improbably but brilliantly takes a complicated stock tip and turns it into a savagely funny payout where a marquee ensemble never outshines the unbelievable insanity of the oft-kilter narrative. Bale and Pitt dial it down, making understated performing an art form, while Carell and Gosling go bigger (appropriate to their respective characters). No one showboats, however, for the sake of stealing the spotlight. After all, who could pull focus from the dramatization of a Doomsday Machine? Bottom line: The WTF of Wall Street",

    "review": "  A scathing indictment, a penetrating character study, a political satire, and alternatively a funny yet serious drama, The Big Short is 2015?s most unique film. Based on the book by the same name, the film follows a group of cynical, shrewd, and opportunistic fund managers and Wall Street brokers as they uncover what will soon become the worldwide economic collapse of 07/08. It?s a film that both explores, explains, and revels in the absurdity that lead to the mortgage collapse- condensing a incredibly complicated financial instruments in to a human drama that sifts through all the bravo sierra to the heart of the matter?fraud and greed.Director Adam McKay takes a pretty stark career turn with Big Short, a film with a profoundly serious subject, yet one that McKay manages to find humor in. It?s entertaining, thought-provoking, and yet relentlessly brutal in its pursuit of the truth. The film?s cast is nothing short of exceptional, featuring an ensemble including Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, and Ryan Gosling. All bring a unique style to the film and inhibit their roles, with an especially impressive showing from both Bale and Carell, enough to garner some award buzz to be sure. The film?s pace is solid, and McKay does a great job interweaving the different subplots to create one over-arching storyline that is secondary to what we all know is about to happen. The film?s moral outrage is palpable, yet justified, a bit preachy, but not singular in its blame. What keeps it anchored is a very intelligent script filled with rich dialogue, smart humor, and attention to detail which refuses to oversimplify what occurred.For some, the film?s eccentricities can be a bit much. It breaks the fourth wall often, which is unsettling at first, and often employs devices such as on-screen definitions, supplied with randomly assorted celebrity break-ins to explain some financial instrument. This contributes to the film?s uniqueness, yet also can result in a disjointed feel from the overall narrative. All in all, McKay?s indulgences as a director pay off more than they don?t, yet there is some inconsistency. The tone is a bit hard to decipher, a comedy in one sense and a drama in the other, yet McKay navigates this by finding dark, cynical, and authentic humor. Simply put, it fits, the cast seems to be thinking??if I didn?t laugh, I?d cry? and we get that.A must see. 4.5/5 Stars",

It makes it even more of a challenge for me to go into a movie blind without having a firm grasp on the source material. What's great about The Big Short, is director Adam McKay acknowledges that I am probably one of many thousands of people who in truth never understood exactly what the housing collapse of 2008 meant to the world. I'd say after just over two hours, not only was I intrigued by the tale and recount of one of the darkest times in American economic history, I was also a bit scared.What we get here are essentially four different approaches to how a few bright and/or hungry minds figured out how to take advantage of the mortgage housing collapse of 2008. We start with Christian Bale's somewhat chaotic character first before moving onto Steve Carell's and Brad Pitt's as we are strung along by the narration of Ryan Gosling. I'm not entirely sure why Gosling was chosen as the narrator, or if one was really needed, but because of it we get some really funny segments when it comes to explaining the complicated concepts of the banks doing what they did.While the acting was pretty solid from this ensemble, unfortunately, it was a little disappointing we didn't get to see more of them interact with each other. The trailer led me to believe this was a group effort to bring to light what the banks were doing, but instead it was more like four individual crusades. You can't really say there were any good guys. There were certainly bad guys.I think what separates this film from being just another ho-hum look at a bad period in American history comes from director McKay. Usually we associate him with comedies like Anchorman. So what we get with The Big Short is actually a movie teetering on the edge of black comedy and drama, though you can certainly feel the disdain of the director for what happened through the dialogue and quick cuts as some real-life stuff is spliced into the film.So while we get four very interesting stories of how these group of bright guys figured out the doom and gloom settling upon us in 2008, the lack of cohesion among our main actors sort of left me wanting a bigger sense of payoff in the end. Not to say it was tough to keep track of, but there was a bit of jumping around. But as I said in the beginning, the attention to detail is staggering and you can't help but feel rotten inside to know something like this was allowed to happen. Surely it can't again. We don't need another one of these well-done movies in the future.",

    "review": "  The real villains behind the great depression we are still somewhat crawling out from under are put on trial for all to see by this hilarious, angry, hugely entertaining and brilliantly scripted movie. Rather than being a preachy chore, it's actually an energetic, breathlessly paced treat. It draws your attention to a topic that is not something you would actively try to find out more about, and makes you realize the full, terrible impact of the credit crisis and the lives it ruined and how the perpetrators, who are all pretty much balf faced criminals who got caught in the act, somehow got away with it all, and are currently probably on a yacht in the Caribbean, champagne glass in hand laughing loudly, whilst people at the bottom and in the middle struggle more than ever. The Big Short is a very funny and very howl of rage that will grip you, entertain you, enlighten you and really piss you off. It points a finger at the guilty principles and says \"i know who you are you fuckers and now so dose everyone else\". Lets hope this genuinely important movie elicits change in some way, so that this never happens again and so that those bastards get theirs finally. Did i also mention the cast? Steve Carrel spectacularly leads and incredible ensemble, in a frankly oscar worthy role for the actor, Christian Bale, a hilarious Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt also give incendiary, mesmerizing performances as they deliver the deliciously complicated and dizzying machine gun dialogue from the masterful, head spinningly loquacious and sometimes intimidating screenplay.

    "review": "  The Big Short: Comes Up Short ***Having read and laughed throughout The Big Short, I was ready to love this film adaptation of Michael Lewis's account of the 2008 Wall Street crash.Lewis has an unmatched talent for exposing prejudice and idiocy in Wall Street and he has been very successfully adapted before in Moneybag (baseball)and The Blind Side (American football). Those tales focussed on one hero and had a clear story arc. I wondered how anyone could take the three heroesof the Big Short and make it work - added to the incredibly complicated machinations of the investment community.On the plus side, you will understand better what the Wall Street idiots did and what they got away with. The comedy director McKay was a good choicebecause he uses every post-modern technique for making it clear. Characters explain to screen, even the gorgeous girl from the Wolf of Wall Street explainsone piece of the puzzle naked in the bath while drinking champagne. It kind of works, but it does not exactly build emotional involvement. On the down side, the 3 plots hang separately - Christian Bale as loner Dr.Burry, Steve Carrell as Baum and his NY team of moral crusaders, and Brad Pitt and his garageboys - all independently work out what was going wrong and decided to short the US mortgage market (deliberately bet against) while everyone else was bettingfor it. Of course, they were right. Now there is progressive complication in all 3 tales, and that's where the film fails to grip. It is emotional overload. Only a few timesin the film did you realise the massive ups and downs the characters were feeling, even after all the clever explanations. I read the book and I could not follow all of it.Someone coming fresh to the film well, good luck.The performances are all good - for once, Bale's weirdness serves him well, Carrell is solid as Baum (with a terrible hairpiece!) and Pitt is outshone by the youngsters in hissegments. The film does not fail to engage and bounce you around for 2 hours and 10 minutes, but never hits the intellectual or emotional heights.It is one of the best films about the financial crisis because it illustrates a Lewis truth - even the losers get lucky sometime. But not that lucky.",

Granted, even this dumbing down would still make a lot of eyes glaze, as the explanation still seemed hard to grasp without basic understanding of how money works.I'm kind of disappointed McKay chose to focus on the economic side of the story.

    "review": "  It is no small achievement to make digestible and accessible to a mainstream audience the complicated and technical subject of the 2008 sub-prime mortgage meltdown, so it is predominantly to writer-director Adam McKay's credit that he never loses the audience throughout the 2hrs+ duration of his film. Using every single trick in the book to do so: he breaks the fourth wall and utilizes metaphors to keep the jargon and exposition-heavy dialogue fun but not frivolous; he utilizes famous and pretty faces for cameos and amongst the main ensemble not only to help us keep track of the numerous characters swirling around but also to keep us engaged. There's the guy from New Girl and the cute one from American Horror Story. Look, there goes Amy Pond from Doctor Who and is that Ryan Gosling or Ryan Reynolds? Batman's here too, playing Rain Man and Michael Scott from the Office plays Angry Guy (the only character with a bit more background and nuance). But the real MVP is McKay. The light touch he brings in both the writing and the presentation is what makes the film works: a visualized dissertation, in the style of a faux documentary with celebrity re-enactments, where the 'comedy' derives from the totally ridiculous and absurd situation our economy finds itself in. Characters unfortunately do come across as a little one note, but this simplification is the price to pay in order to get the important message across effectively and entertainingly so that the film will get the widest audience it so richly deserves and demands.",

Initially, the attempt was interesting - break-out cameos, graphics, etc - but ultimately the film gets lost in the intricacies and the jargon.Just as in Twelve Years a Slave, Pitt's character is the liberal social conscience, but he nicely underplays his character here. The effect is less obnoxious than the in earlier film. Also, the film's denouement flirts with mawkishness and oversimplified lessons-learned. The there-are-no-winners vibe is almost ironic.Ultimately this film is, or at least should be, about how those who have the fortitude to think independently (personified by Burry, Baum, et al), can transcend the psychology of the mob and perceive truths which are often staring at us in the face.Also, seek out the excellent documentary The Inside Job as a companion to this drama.",

There are elements of humour here but many of them margin on smugness. The cast is very strong though and the film does a good job of explaining the lunacy of the time.",

    "review": "  It's so strange that in 2005 I was working at Bank One, later purchased by J.P. Morgan Chase. I was an employee in the exact place where mortgage securities were managed from an IT perspective. I had to learn about tranches, basis points, and ratings agencies, all of which I knew nothing about beforehand. I found out that a pool of mortgages was only \"spot checked\", sent to the ratings agencies for ratings determined by the bank and nearly immediately returned. There was no way the ratings agency could examine all of the loans and their actual rating, so they were basically \"trusting\" the banks to tell the truth. Of course the banks were expecting the brokers to tell the truth too and this movie shows that the brokers had no clue what they were doing. About time we see this laid out in detail. Too bad no one will go to jail and the American people are still suffering while these bankers are still flying to work in helicopters.",

    "review": "  \"THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD!\" is the message of the entire film. But, the content of the film is what you need to worry about. It was about some guys (played by Steve Carell, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt) who knew the economy will collapse in the near future, which was in 2008.The black-comedy film is a talkies film, but what makes it special is that the film has a big charisma for its way of saying or explaining things. For example they broke the 4th wall - which means basicaly some characters in the film started to look at the camera and interact with us. There are moments also when I was smiling all the away in a whole scene - it was so funny that only I in the theatre laughed alone (so sad). This is really a true black-comedy film.The content of the film was really hard to be followed. But, I think they had already made it as simple as possible. For me, I really should watch it again when I have a time. The film is very educational. It's very different than the usual stock market drama. Some people said the film is like Sidney Lumet's Network (1976) - I agree with them.This is Adam McKay's first serious film. Before this, he made some movies with Will Ferell in all of it. The movies are bad to be watch.The cinematography of the film is pretty obvious - it was made like that to create realism. The motivation was strong. It wasn't for the mood, because the content of the film IS the MOOD.The ensemble cast were superb. They acted very well suited for the characters. I was shocked when Steve Carell became mad and then suddenly cries - he had a reputation of a comedian rather than a serious actor.The Big Short is a film for good listeners. If you are not a good listeners, I recommend you to watch a more action movie. Because this movie is all about talking good, bad, and goods.The verdict:A black comedy with a hard-to-follow content but with the impact of the 2008 economy collapse was with us - it became more and more interesting than your girlfriend's chat in your phone.",

    "review": "  This is in some ways a daring movie - it describes the ins and outs of the machinations which led to the 2008 financial melt down with crazy detail - it assumes that the audience should care and understand it. To do that, it sometimes breaks the fourth wall, having actors (occasionally not even characters in the story) address the audience, uses a series of very comprehensible metaphors, and sometimes creates straw man characters and incidents to personify what are really thousands of (mostly) bad actors in the affair. For a business movie, I found it to be much more accurate than most others, although it likes to find easy villains. (For a good analysis, see Michael Grunwald's article in Politico \"What The Big Short Gets Wrong.\"I also must say that many of its heroic characters, while they \"win\" in the end, take on exactly the sort of reckless financial risks that caused the financial crisis when practiced by the investment banks - the difference being that they happened to bet on the right horse.However, it all holds together marvelously as narrative. The object lesson comes across as an entertaining yarn ultimately about (sort of) little guys taking on the big guys - benefiting only by the fact that they've ignored conventional wisdom and instead done the hard work.",

The story of the 2008 GFC is told in such a way that it is never dry but instead it is bold and full of pathos and humour. Combine a great script and great acting and the results speak for themselves. Using many great narrative devices it is edited in such a fashion to continually push the story along. As said the cast are great but special mention should go to Carell and Bale whose characters are played with precision and startling humanity. This is also an enlightening film.

Sags slightly at the end, but if anything, that's a testament to the way in keeps its energy up in the main.

    "review": "  Lively, energetic and bursting with attitude. The Big Short feels like it's the kind of film Anchorman director Adam McKay has ALWAYS wanted to make. The complicated financial subject matter is handled imaginatively where it never makes you feel that your being talked down to. To me, Lumet's \"Network\" as well as Scorsese had a big influence on McKay especially in regards to the editing of the picture which is remarkable and gives the film a real unique personality and presence. Bale, Carrell, Gosling and Pitt are all extremely well put together and each shine brightly in their own individual and varied roles. Not only is the film laugh out loud and devilishly funny but it does well to balance the real and palpable dark side of the '08 financial crisis with regards to unemployment and families made homeless with care and consideration. Maintaining my interest throughout, The Big Short is a terrific adaptation of Michael Lewis' source material and expertly realised by McKay who I hope goes on to tackle more likeminded projects.",

    "review": "  \"Everyone, deep in their hearts, is waiting for the end of the world to come.\"The Big Short is such a refreshing and surprising film because it manages to perfectly balance a difficult subject matter and make it entertaining. It is perhaps one of the most important films made this year reminding us of the worldwide economic breakdown that began in 2007 and left millions of people without their life savings. Many of us don't understand much about economics or how it works, and that is why we have been so eager to forget what happened and continue moving on as if nothing ever happened. This film refreshes our memory and reminds us of what a terrible crime was committed during the housing bubble collapse. The film centers on the few men who recognized the problem early on and took advantage of the situation. The Big Short is a dramatic movie, there is no doubt about it, but it also manages to include some comedic moments by breaking the fourth wall and including pop culture figures to explain some of the more complicated financial terms. It does it in a brilliant way and it's been a while since I've seen a film break the fourth wall as well as this one did. I've seen many documentaries on this subject, but this film manages to explain things better and open our eyes to the dangers we might face again in the future because we've ignored the real problem and seem to be repeating the same mistakes once again. Mckay manages to infuriate and open our eyes while entertaining us at the same time with an engaging film thanks to a witty adapted script which he helped co-write with Charles Randolph.It's not the first time that a film based on a Micheal Lewis novel manages to draw in an audience that doesn't necessarily need to comprehend the subject matter. You could be clueless about baseball, but in Moneyball the story still managed to engage a worldwide audience. The same can be said about this film because the economic terms are explained in a simple way. That is why I believe this is one of the most important films of the year because it allows even those that never seemed interested in economics to understand how it still affects them. It is an eye opening film for those that felt uninterested in trying to understand what happened in 2007. If there is one film that audiences should see this year then this might just be the one (not for its technical or artistic value, but for the importance of its subject matter). The Big Short is Adam McKay's dramatic directorial debut and his background in comedy is what probably helped this film become more accesible. The man who brought us Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers, and The Other Guys, now brings us a thought provoking film. He's received two Oscar nominations (directing and writing) for his work here and what an impressive film he has crafted. The film is heavy on dialogue, but the script is so perfectly written that each character in this film becomes memorable. The performances are outstanding which simply proves what a key element writing is for an actor. It was refreshing to see Ryan Gosling back again after his retirement from the big screen for two years. He plays the charismatic character he could easily play in his sleep, but he is still a delight to watch. He delivers a solid role, but out of the four big names it was Steve Carell who stood out. He gets the best dramatic moments and lights up each scene he enters in. Brad Pitt has a smaller role but he makes perfect use of his screen time with an understated performance. Christian Bale is the only actor who received a nomination for his performance in this film and it is well deserved. He plays a socially awkward character and totally sells it. There are films where there are so many big names that no one really gets to shine, but this film manages to make every character memorable thanks to the wonderful script.",

The movie made it seem like the fund managers cared, but I don't think in real life they did. It was great that someone produced a movie about it because people really lost their homes and down payments and the truth needed to be told. It is important for everyone to see so that people can become aware of how not to get caught up in a bank loan that they can never pay. Banks were really selling the American dream which turned out to be a way to steal their down payment. When the interest rate increased on their variable rate loan, and no refinancing available, they were out on the streets. When you buy a house make sure you don't get sucked into variable rate or ballon payments. Put the minium amount down and save your money for a rainy day. Thieves come in sheeps clothing.",

Just saying you didn't have to be an observant investor or economist to figure out what the future held. i just liked learning more about exactly how corrupt our so-called economic experts really are.",

    "review": "  So I have no problem in admitting that if I had more knowledge about the banking crisis and American mortgages, I'd give this a higher score. Truth be told however, I'm probably shamefully ignorant on the subject and therefore suggest that you brush up on your comprehension of the 2008 economic crisis from a US perspective, as it will definitely help you out when watching this. That aside, on a purely film-making level, I really enjoyed this. The writing is sharp, the dialogue is interesting and the actors are great. Steve Carell, Christian Bale and especially Ryan Gosling act as three pillars for the audience to grab on to as the rest of the film moves at a quick speed. They're the anchors of the story and if you just listen to the shit they say you'll be able to keep up well enough. Brad Pitt is on the poster to try and sell tickets but he has about 10 minutes of screen time at most, just letting you know. For me the film started a little slow, it took a good 15 minutes for me to get comfortable with the style the director was implementing. There's a lot of quick, music video-like cuts and breaking of the fourth wall it felt a little jarring, but I got use to it. The movie does its best to break down complicated wall street jargon into more general and understandable terms, so that was highly appreciated (Although you should still do some preparation). There's also quite a big of humour in here too. Not laugh out loud humour, but a nice light hearted atmosphere that ensures you don't get too bogged down by the subject matter. Overall if you enjoy ensemble casts and good dialogue driven film-making, you'll definitely get something out of this even if you don't know much about the actual theme. On that same note though, it's not a film you can really go into blind or perhaps see on a date, so while the director does try to simplify things, it will still go over your head at times and you may be left playing catch up if you just want to casually watch a movie. There are a few moments that get a little \"preachy\", as in Brad Pitt getting sniffy nosed at the consequences for the good old regular American tax payer, but these are few and far between thankfully. Enjoyable film.",

However, what distinguishes The Big Short from Spotlight, the other Oscar push expose film of the year is that The Big Short takes a complicated, boring crime that is traditionally and intentionally disconnected from its implications and stitches those two ends together in an entertaining, sobering, fantastically acted romp. Spotlight was its equal in execution but unfortunately, not nearly as risky of a film and ultimately, The Big Short manages to give the financial crisis such a moral weight that we can't help but feel awful and sick as we leave the theater. The Big Short educates us, pushes us, entertains us and pushes us to change things and that is impressive. Any other year, this film would be a look for a boatload of Oscar wins for outstanding performances and directing. Unfortunately, the movie has to face two of the most transcendent films of the 21st century so it will go home empty handed on Oscar night, despite being one of the best movies of 2015.",

On the one hand, it tries to entertain you in unique ways (particularly, the celebraty cameos expostulating deftly) because, after all, it's largely a discussion of paperwork and banking. On the other hand, it tries too hard (there's only so many times movie characters can pause to talk to the camera. It gets old after a while - also, how many times does the camera have to zoom in on Burry's glass eye?). And on the one hand, some actors positively chew through the scenery (Carrell seriously committed himself), but on the other hand, some just mail it in (Brad Pitt forgot to act). Also on the one hand, the movie does its best to simplify a marvelously complex issue (again, those cameos). On the other hand, it doesn't really do that great of a job, as indeed, the issue was certainly more complex then displayed on screen. It does a good job of portraying the ambivalence and unknowingness around whether or not this was fraud or incompetence, but a bad job with some of the character's development and personal life. My favorite part of the movie though, is what I enjoy a lot in some great movies: everyone is smart, very smart, and is thinking, churning, probing. A bonus? Anyone who isn't, gets his comeuppance. This is fitting, as the movie is basically a quest for fairness and justice, though fingering a single figure for going to jail muddles this message. The issue was just too complicated to point at a single person who could be held accountable. The 2007 housing crisis took a village, literally.",

The facts are otherwise. One case in point: Wells Fargo, which did not engage in sub-prime lending (at least to the extent of Bank of America, et al), when it was all over, was forced to buy Wachovia because, as Obama said, \"We don't want any bank looking better than any other bank.\" This film, full of actors who have no idea what their dialogue means, lends no clarity at all as to why my home lost 25% of its value, focusing instead upon people who rightfully saw it coming. But the movie's greatest failing is that it posits the wrong antagonist: it wasn't the banks but congress that was to blame... and they're doing it again, right now. C.f. Dodd-Frank.",

As well as the greed filled entrepreneurs who predicted the crisis and profited off the economic collapse, much to the detriment of the American people. The quick editing and humorous cameos, including Selena Gomez at a casino table, easily wash down insider financial language.

It does take an important subject and makes it more understandable. It's about the 2008 financial crisis and the few bankers who saw it coming. It also exposes the corrupt system and criminal bankers/lenders that caused the crash in the first place. One of the biggest frustrations of the past 8 years is that none of these dingbat bankers/lenders who screwed us over saw a jail cell. That is truly a shame and it looks like they are going to do it again. Back to the movie. One of the biggest problems I had was the bad (almost shakey camera moves and terrible editing (seriously this is up for best editing?) There is literally a scene where two characters are walking and talking and before they can finish the camera jumps to the next scene in cutting off dialogue. There was also a weird part where the screen went black and what sounded like radio static could be heard. Maybe that was the theater messing up. Anyway, see it for a better understanding of the financial crisis. Get angry and educated so this wont happen again.",

    "review": "  UPDATE: I've just seen THE BIG SHORT for the second time and am upping my score to ****. This movie is very successful in communicating its key concepts and, for a dialogue-driven movie, there is an excellent feeling of suspense. If you reach similar conclusions me after seeing the movie once, perhaps give it another go. I really enjoyed it the second time around.THE BIG SHORT will not be for everyone. As it tells the story it has to try to convey complex financial topics to its audience making the movie very didactic. The writers have gone to rather bizarre and comedic lengths to get these concepts across to the viewers. For example, in one scene Margot Robbie, as herself, languishes in a bubble bath as she tells us all mortgage securities. At times, the actors speak directly to the audience - in movie talk it's called breaking the fourth wall. Because the movie is so preachy a large amount of the time, and as a result, very dialogue driven, I didn't find it very engaging. The acting is certainly good (especially Steve Carell). But I have seen better movies about the mid-2000s crash that were much more riveting than this - e.g., Margin Call and 99 Homes. So if you head to the cinema to see this one, be ready to have to concentrate hard on learning the large number concepts and to follow the rapid dialogue that forms the substance of the story. Otherwise, you might want to give it a miss.",

Honestly, I only chuckled about 3 times in its entire 2 hour run time. That's not because the comedy was bad mind you, but because I was so horrified by the real life people they were dealing with (and the fact that there were no consequences for their actions) that it was hard to find much humor in it, despite some really funny moments. The movie itself seems to veer wildly back and forth between drama and comedy and it's that unevenness that prevents me from giving it a higher rating. I do give major points to the director for managing to make this subject not terminally boring though. On the acting front, Bale, Gosling and especially Carell do great work here, though none of them are Best Actor quality. Pitt is frankly underused and didn't seem to be doing much here in his role. In the end, while this film definitely doesn't deserve a Best Picture win, it's an important film to see for its subject matter and features some moments and performances for all its flaws.",

It centers on the few finacial folks who saw parts of what was going wrong with the system--and bet against it. This film is informative, and often uses humor and talking directly to the viewer to explain complex banking terms, along with smartly edited montages that put you in the time period . The film is anchored by 2 fantastic, full performances by Christian Bale and Steve Carell, who stay grounded among all the noise. Makes an interesting contrast to fellow Oscar nominee SPOTLIGHT, which is smart and less emotional than this one--but this is more entertaining. Director Adam McKay channels Scorsese to great effect.

    "review": "  Marvelous is the way \"The Big Short\" is able to make a snoozer of a subject matter turn into high entertainment. If you haven't heard already, it is a black comedy covering the events leading up to the stock market crash of 2008, which is both tragic and fiendishly hard to understand unless you're an economics whiz at the top of your game. To understand the intricacies of its fiscal details is impossible, and while the film is attentive to audiences who likely don't understand what the hell is going on (hilariously using Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain, and Selena Gomez to break the fourth wall in an attempt to clearly explain Wall Street terminology), \"The Big Short\" is less about informatics and more about the dramatic occurrences, the quick-witted exchanges, that took place prior to its climax. It makes for one of the quirkiest and best written films of 2015, its laughs punchy, its more serious pauses littered with the very real sense of collapse the world's economy felt during the crisis. \"The Big Short\" begins in 2005, where Michael Burry (Christian Bale), an eccentric fund manager, unpredictably stumbles upon inconsistencies in the housing market, where it appears that several mortgages have qualities that suggest they might be fraudulent. Convinced that the market will collapse sometime around the end of 2007, he creates a credit default swap system with big banks that will leave them penniless and him victorious. Unaware that he might actually be right, deals are made without a hint of doubt - regret will come later. Time goes on, and we are introduced to several individuals who become as emphatically aware of the looming financial disaster. One is Mark Baum (Steve Carell), the abrasive manager of FrontPoint Capital; others are Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), a confident Deutsche Bank salesman, Charlie Gellar (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock), up-and-comers who could potentially make a sizable sum if they make all the right moves, and Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), a Wall Street retiree helping the latter two youths in their risky ambition. While you might not be leaving \"The Big Short\" with a clear idea as to how the economic system works, you will, regardless, have a better understanding of the trials and tribulations that went down before and after the 2007-2008 financial soap opera, frightened by the ignorance of Wall Street heavyweights of the time yet stupendously entertained by the barbs written by Adam McKay (who also directs) and Charles Randolph - for revolving around such a serious topic, \"The Big Short\" is an iniquitous comedy of impervious intelligence. Laughs abound when they shouldn't be, and, bruising as they are, are stunning in the way they come effortlessly in a world where comedy shouldn't even accidentally arise. And so I've come to the conclusion that McKay, making his first serious film after years of helming laugh-a-minute Will Ferrell collaborations, can make anything funny - \"The Big Short's\" combination of genuine rib-tickles and dramatic nuances are what make it such a terrific movie, and its acting, sturdy and revelatory, is predictably excellent from an ensemble of some of cinema's best performers. And I relished the film's aesthetic qualities, which integrates fourth-wall breakings and pop culture asides into the mix like a frenetic MTV oddity. But \"The Big Short\" remains to be an energetic oddball in the scope of 2015, acting as a highlight in a year full of risk-taking films. So while I may not have always been as distinctly aware of what was necessarily going on during its length (economic lingo is something one can never fully be in touch with), I have no doubt regarding the film's brilliance - this is a unique (pardon the tired adjective) and frenzied take on the biographical movie. It is an exemplary dark comedy.",

    "review": "  Saw 'The Big Short' this evening as a members freebie at the Picturehouse. Although I know the story of the financial crisis caused by investment banks giving, selling and buying 'sub-prime' mortgages most of this went over my head. The film followed some investors who understood that mortgage defaults would crash the system and made some kind of negative investment deal whereby they would pay the banks when the banks' shares were rising but the banks would pay them when their shares were falling .. I don't know if that's exactly right but they were essentially betting that there would be a financial crash because of the stupidity and corruption in the system. I think I'd have to see it again and slowly to truly understand the film.",

What they didn't initially know was how structurally flawed the MBS system was, the level of corruption in the market, and the impact on the average person when the bubble burst.Ultimately, a great exposition of the greed, stupidity, self- interest and lack of regulation that caused the 2008 global financial crisis.In its most basic essence, \"The Big Short,\" builds on the visceral truth of Scorsese's \"Wolf of Wall Street.\".Superb performances, especially from Christian Bale and Steve Carell.Fantastic supporting cast which includes Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt and Marisa Tomei. Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain.Big thank you to Brad Pitt's Plan B for keeping in founding important films.Final message of the film is that, unless we deal with the problem at the source the symptoms will keep happening over and over and over.I suspect more than one person will buy seeds after seeing this film...",

It's a big-issue movie, but it avoids being pretentious or overly solemn, by finding humor in the plain facts. Led by a top-notch ensemble cast (that actually outdoes this year's more lauded Spotlight), The Big Short is consistently entertaining, even when dealing with a subject that's of dire concern for just about everybody in the world right now. Razor sharp editing too, which complements the frequent breaking of the fourth wall the characters use (the movie almost could have been called Bugs Bunney Vs. the economic crisis). A much more effective film about power and decadence, than say...The Wolf of Wall Street.",

    "review": "  The Big Short - as I see itDr Manju GuptaThe Big Short is a film about human greed and degradation. It's a film about an eccentric, one eyed hedge fund manager, Michael Burry (Christian Bale) who sees the housing loan bubble burst before anyone else and decides to profit from it by shorting or betting against it. Its about a slickster, Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) who hears about these default swaps at a sleazy party and hard sells them for a hefty commission. It's about a seething but righteous Mark Baum (Steve Carell), and his team, who get wind about it through a misplaced phone call, and join in, driven by revenge against the banks. Its about two young and naive fund managers Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Witrock) who stumble into the information and enter the rat race under the tutelage of a very 'organic' Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) who has retired from the game in disgust but knows how it's played.What makes this Wall Street film about the 2008 financial meltdown different from others is its unconventional presentation. The director adds colour to the monotony of men in suits by daring to use unconventional ways to explain financial jargon. The narrative is broken by hilarious cameos in which celebrities, playing themselves, define some of the complicated terms like subprime mortgages and collateralised debt obligations. Does all this make you feel bored or stupid? No, I am not asking you, Ryan Gosling posed this question to me as I was watching the film and proceeded to introduce the sultry Margot Robbie who explained the terms while taking a bubble bath. Cheeky yes, but also rare ingenuity!The high profile stars live up to expectations and give excellent performances. Bale's eccentricity seems as real as Carell's smouldering contempt. Gosling's smarmy portrayal of the conscience dead Wall Street shyster is matched with Brad Pitt's brilliantly underplayed avatar as the disillusioned retiree. The naivety of his prot�g� is endearingly genuine too. But its the actors in small roles who shine and make the film what it is. The supercilious banker with his condescending smirk as he puts down the two neophytes, the over helpful assistant who smilingly tolerates Gosling's ill treatment, Carell's well etched team mates, the lady entrusted with credit-rating who has a vision problem, the sleazy home loan mortgage agents, an especially ruthless and repulsive bond trader, the 'law -abiding' tattooed tenant all excel in their craft. There are no small actors here, just small roles.McKay, best known for directing subversive comedies accomplishes a great feat as he pulls out all his tricks, from dizzying hand-held camera moves, peppy dance numbers, quick shots of random people to pole dancers making the movie an exhilarating joy ride. Humour lightens up a dark tale of deceit by having characters break the fourth wall and talk directly to the viewer either to confirm what is happening in the film or to contradict it. But the moral tide running beneath all the laughs is palpable. Five trillion dollars in savings and real-estate value is vaporised as the banks continue to act in an astonishingly ignorant or criminally abusive fashion, leaving millions of Americans jobless and homeless with global repercussions. As the protagonists stifle their disdain for the bond-market creeps, the moral ambiguities cannot be ignored, for they have invested in default swaps, which would pay off only if the market collapses.That it would lead to destruction of such mammoth proportion was probably not foreseeable but the human wreckage is their doing too.A strong contender at the Oscars this year, this film based on a book by the same name can simultaneously outrage and amuse, entertain and educate, infuriate and fascinate and keep the viewer engrossed in a story filled with bond-trade babble. The Big Short, based on true events of an economic catastrophe is devastatingly funny. It will appeal to the average viewer because human greed is not limited to Wall Street and sometimes it's better to laugh than cry.",

    "review": "  Based on the true story of how the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) came about from 2005-2008, 'The Big Short' tells the story really well by mixing humour, facts (delivered in an unconventional way by celebrities) and following four tenuously-linked groups who have skin in the game. Vennett (Gosling) introduces us at the start of 2005, via a unique fourth-wall-breaking monologue, placing the players on the field - I'm using this terminology, as most of the film (and Wall Street in general) can be likened to gambling. It may sound boring on the surface - a film about banking and finance - but it does a great job of explaining the terminology in simple terms, whilst not being condescending about it.The groups involved are Burry (Bale), a fund manager and prodigy of sorts, who first sees the housing bubble and notices that the big banks have been over-valuing mortgages (sub-prime). Baum (Carell) and his small company are offered the opportunity to \"short\" the banks' mortgages by Vennett. Geller (Magaro) & Shipley (Wittrock), two young entrepreneurs, who seek help from their mentor, retired Wall St mogul Rickert (Pitt) also pick up on what' happening and get in on the action. It's great to see the banks gleefully taking their money, being so cocky and greedy, only to have it all blow up in their faces two years later.I think Carell, not Bale, should have been Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor! Baum serves as the film's moral centre and calls everyone on their fraudulent behaviour. The film almost acts as a documentary when it delves down to the individual family level and makes you truly realise how little these large corporations care for other humans. The most bittersweet part is the ending - \"and then the crooks went to jail, Congress brought in reform and the fraudulent system was overhauled - just joking! They didn't go to jail, Congress was lobbied so no reform was passed and the big banks were bailed out by the taxpayers\" - funny, sad, and true. Really makes you think, but is also a well-made film with excellent acting.",

    "review": "  2.5/5 stars. One of the more infuriating things about this movie is that the mediocre direction only exacerbates a fundamental flaw with the screenplay: a film like this can only be a documentary, a docudrama, or a fanciful character study. And because this movie tries to be all three-with random fourth wall breaks galore-it falls flat from beginning to end, failing spectacularly. I found myself wondering several times if members of the production team merely failed to read each other's e-mails, as there is no logical reason for (a) Ryan Gosling's frequent contradictions of the factuality of the scenes he's right in the middle of, (b) extreme close-ups of Steve Carell's face serving as the sole attempt at dramatic effect, (c) the jarring and cacophonous song choices in transitions between scenes, and (d) the constant flashbacks in the opening minutes-flashbacks that strive to humanize characters who are merely one-note proxies. Not a single one of this film's five Academy Award nominations is warranted here.",

    "review": "  I find it interesting that despite how catastrophic the global recession of 2008 was, few movies of quality have centered on the topic. It's probably to do with how confusing the inner workings of Wall Street are to the average person. Even if said workings are all utter bullshit. (See: The Wolf of Wall Street.) This is probably why The Big Short is framed partially as a heist movie with plenty of celebrity cameos to explain exactly what the hell is going on. Big Short is about three different teams of Wall Street investors who notice that the sub-prime mortgage market is headed toward imminent collapse and then decide to do the unthinkable - bet against that market (and therefore the American economy) by shorting their stock and get rich while everyone else reenacts October 1929. Christian Bale succeeds as an anti-social polymath who notices the trend and makes little room for those less intelligent than he (everyone else) and sees his limited group of comrades dwindle further due to his bold decisions. Ryan Gosling does a little too well as a slimy banker who wishes to profit off other people's misfortune. I personally found Steve Carell the true hero of the film both as an actor and character. He is a complete misanthrope who hates the system he is a part of, but at the same time he is a crusader who is deeply wounded by the narcissistic and damaging actions his fellow investors are inflicting on the world economy, despite all of the warning signs. He is a man of lovely contradictions and Carell has fun conveying them. The film is 15 to 20 minutes too long and many of the details are hard to keep track of at times. The dialogue is excellent, and the film goes to great lengths to make the material more enjoyable, such as when characters break the fourth wall and speak directly into the camera. And the message they have is clear - Wall Street screwed you over. And it doesn't care.",

    "review": "  Michael Lewis?s 2010 book, ?The Big Short? is by no means an easy read. More or less, it is an expose on the events leading up to the 2007-2008 U.S. financial crisis ? perhaps the biggest crisis in American financial markets since the Great Depression. The book covered Wall Street jargons such as collaterized debt obligation, derivatives and subprime mortgages, among others. The big challenge for Hollywood is to transform an abstruse book into a film that would be watchable and understandable and still be entertaining about an important and difficult subject matter. After all, two of Lewis?s earlier books, ?The Blind Side? and ?Moneyball?, have successfully made the leap from print to the big screen.Adam McKay, who had previously directed the ?Anchorman? films, succeeds in adapting a book to tell the many facets of the crisis that can easily be understood by many who are financial novices. The characters played by Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt are interesting and vivid of the many different players involved, each providing a different perspective. Using unconventional methods such as cameos of big name stars as themselves explaining the financial jargons, scribbles on the screen to create flowcharts and how things interrelate or characters talking directly to the camera ? these all made for an effective storytelling.Even as the film plays out as a comedy, there is an underlining theme throughout of real everyday people losing their homes and jobs due to the greed and dishonesty of others. While the film provides a historical point of view, in the end, the lessons learned from the crisis may be short lived and easily forgettable as situations easily return to the way things were.",

    "review": "  Y si te digo que Adam McKay, director de var�as silly movies (pel�culas tontas), fue encargado para dirigir una pel�cula sobre el colapso del mercado inmobiliario norteamericano y la crisis financiera del 2008 �C�mo te quedas?Al entrar a la sala de cine para ya ver esta pel�cula comet� un grave error (no, no se me cay� el pop corn) pensar que est� pel�cula era una comedia, porque no es una \"comedia\" en s�, \"La gran apuesta\" es una pel�cula dram�tica con humor negro, con sarcasmo y es perfecta. Les voy a decir la raz�n. The Big Short (La Gran Apuesta) es una cinta basada en el libro de Michael Lewis que lleva el mismo nombre y nos trata de explicar la crisis financiera del 2008 pero de una manera muy diferente, porque la pel�cula quiere que tu aprendas que tu salgas de la sala del cine, te hagas preguntas sobre este tema y tomes conciencia sobre lo que ocurri�. Ya que adem�s de ser una pel�cula dram�tica con sarcasmo tambi�n es una pel�cula did�ctica. Y es por eso que les digo que es la mejor pel�cula de este tema (hay muchas pel�culas que hablan sobre esta crisis financiera).El director McKay hace un gran trabajo con esta pel�cula junto a sus guionistas y nos tratan de explicar la historia de estas cuatro personas que vieron venir el estallido de esta \"burbuja\" y beneficiarse con esa cat�strofe. La pel�cula trata tambi�n sobre Wall Street pero no nos muestra a un DiCaprio con fiestas salvajes, drogas y piscinas de dinero sino el otro lado de la moneda, nos muestran el fraude y la mentira del sistema financiero, y nuestros protagonistas se dan cuenta de eso y van a apostar en contra de los bancos. El reparto es un gran fuerte en esta cinta, el \"dream team\" es Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling y Brad Pitt (tambi�n productor). Estos actores nos muestran a sus personajes de manera fascinante con un gran potencial dram�tico, y dan ganas de querer m�s sobre ellos, para m� los que m�s brillan son los personajes de Bale (Michael Burry) y Carell (Mark Baum) en verdad es una pena y un desperdicio que estos dos personajes no se hayan conocido entre la pel�cula, pero era necesario ya que la cinta es una historia 100% real, estos personajes si existieron y eso lo confirma Paul Krugman, premio Nobel de econom�a. Me hubiera gustado ver m�s del personaje de Brad Pitt, el produce la pel�cula y parece que �l se haya dado ese papel para ser \"la voz de la raz�n\" ya que hay varias frases memorables que tienen mucho de verdad. Tambi�n resaltar las actuaciones de John Magaro y Finn Wittrock. Gran reparto.La pel�cula explica muy bien este tema, sus personajes rompen la cuarta pared, y se dirigen al p�blico, cuando hay di�logos complejos en donde usan t�rminos financieros aparece un \"cameo\" de varias celebridades, Margot Robbie nos explica que es un \"subprime\" desnuda en una ba�era (si con eso no te dio ganas de ver la pel�cula ya no s� que m�s hacer), adem�s durante las pel�culas usan gr�ficos ilustrativos, adem�s cuando los personajes conversan y mencionan un t�rmino dif�cil en la parte baja de la pantalla sale el significado para que entiendas. Aun as� esta cinta use todos estos recursos puedes llegar a confundirte y no entender, vaya paradoja.En conclusi�n, tengo que decirles que esta es una gran pel�cula, McKay hace un gran trabajo para explicarnos este tema bastante complicado (y pensar que este director estuvo en los Razzie Awards), el reparto es buen�simo, el gui�n es inteligente y finalmente tengo que decirles que esta cinta es como una denuncia social a lo que pas� en el 2008 y nos invita a averiguar m�s sobre este tema. Y es por todo estas cosas que este filme est� nominado en varias categor�as de los Globos de Oro y tambi�n parece que tendr� presencia importante en el Oscar. Les recomiendo mucho y vayan r�pido a ver \"La gran apuesta\".",

Adapted from Michael Lewis' book about 2008 global financial crisis, the screenplay from director Adam McKay co-writing with Charles Randolph does not broadcast the audiences directly to understand tonnes of financial theories, but to engage and enlighten through another creative way by mixing this dry lessons with parody and satire. Without a significant hero, the choice of the cast is definitely perfect - Bale, Carell, Gosling and Pitt perform extremely well, together with the supporting casts to play around with mortgage, subprime rates and credit debts. Despite illustrating this subject in a triumphant way, it has also successfully delivered self-awareness regarding desperation, political corruptions and collateral damages in economy slowdown; leaving an impression of skepticism on Wall Street while restoring some faith in Hollywood's capability in making great films.",

    "review": "  The Big Short is immediately kind of a weird movie, because it has Christian Bale reprising a role as a Wall Street executive who it totally fucking weird and obsessive about random things, but does a complete 180 from American Psycho by making him a much nicer character. Anyone who's seen both movies will probably pick up this parallel, and it'll make you laugh for a second, but then you'll forget all about it, because this movie is serious business, and the actors are really fucking good. In this film, Patrick Bateman is a brilliant hedge fund manager chilling out in 2005 when he discovers that the housing market is built on a system of fraudulent credit ratings and horribly convoluted wall street bullshit: shitty loans, masturbatory economists, labyrinthine CDO's, etc. Have no idea what I'm talking about? Well, this film is ahead of you and will explain all of this stuff along the way (often using clever visuals, or easy to digest metaphors with famous actors, musicians and economists serving as cameo lecturers). So, Bateman being the hotshot broker he is decides he's going to bet against the (at the time) AAA rated housing market. Everyone thinks he's crazy as fuck, so when he goes to the banks to pitch his idea, they're more than enthusiastic as he puts something like 1.4 billion dollars into the scheme. Well, you can't put this much money into a scheme without somebody noticing, and entrepreneurial believers like Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, and others come climbing out of the woodwork to get in on the action. Bale, once he's made his move jut sits on his ass and waits for the money to roll in, but Carell wants to figure out why this is all happening. His character will take you into the rabbit's hole that is Wall Street fuckery, offering one part Chinatown-esque detective style unraveling storyline, and one part real-life journalist expose on what the fuck exactly happened to cause the 2008 collapse. The film is based on actual events that happened, so this film should almost be required viewing for anyone who lives in North America. \"But I just want to watch a stupid movie and not learn anything when I go to the cinema!\" Well, shut the fuck up, because this isn't about what you want. There's no sound argument for being willfully ignorant, and this film does a good job of pointing out how harmful such placated indifference can end up being. This is a two hour film that not only manages to entertain you and make you laugh, but it also informs you on how and why you may have gotten fucked. The acting is good, the music is solid, the camera work is kind of creative, the dialogue is fast and exciting, the editing is punchy. It's very possible that this movie will end up disappearing into shadows for being too intellectual, or for being about finance, and that would be a terrible shame.TL;DR - 8/10 As I said earlier, this film should be required viewing. This is the best performance I've seen out of Ryan Gosling, it might be the best performance I've seen out of Steve Carell. The subject matter is important; and I mean it's important for all of us to understand, and be upset about it. Do yourself a favor and go and watch this movie, at the very least you'll have a good time, but you might also learn something while you're at it.",

    "review": "  'The Big Short', nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay.... and i have just one question. Why? I thought the trailer looked pretty good, it was about a somewhat interesting topic that i knew jack shit about, but with big names attached and a very positive response, i was expecting more, a lot more. This is not going to be a popular opinion as clearly lots of people love this movie, but i must have missed something, or lots of things as for a good 50% of this film i was bored out of my mind. This was a Drama/Biopic focusing on a very serious and from what i gathered very complex topic revolving around the collapse of the economy, bank stuff, the housing market, and a tonne of other stuff i have no idea about. So it had an uphill task from the beginning, trying to get me interested in the film for 2 hours. And in the end, it only managed to do that for about half of the film. I thought the acting was definitely a positive from everyone, the flicker of humour was well implemented and some unique or interesting choices made in the editing of the film had me really enjoying it at some moments. But everything else..... yeh not so great.The film started out rather engaging, being introduced to all these various characters was fun. It had a serious yet slightly quirky tone, and i gotta say it was great that they kept that tone consistent the whole way through. I was following what was going on, and it was going at a nice calm pace allowing me to pick up most things and piece things together. The film at this point was very interesting and entertaining and had pleasantly surprised me with the editing choices made so far. And that lasted for about an hour, then it just kept going, and going, and i began to lose interest fast, to the point where 20 minutes later i just wanted this thing to be over. I was barely following what was going on with all these numbers and who all these people were and their connections to the story, and it severely hurt my enjoyment of the film. The film even tries to carry people along by stopping the film to have various famous faces explain some of the concepts and banking terms being used. Now although i found these moments surprising and rather fun to watch, i was still just as lost afterwards as i was before. All of this may just be my inability to understand what the fuck was going on, or the story maybe was presented in a shitty incomprehensible manner with terrible writing. I'm not right and i'm not wrong.The acting all across the board was really good, Steve Carrell did a great job as whoever he was, Ryan Gosling put in a strong performance, Brad Pitt was good i guess, and Christian Bale did a great job also and was probably the best of the bunch. They definitely committed to their roles and each one of their personalities felt different and their characters at times had some very interesting dialogue and things to say. But their performances just couldn't get me invested in what was going on. The humour was well delivered, i laughed a few times, and it was a pretty nice blend of humour into this very serious topic and breathed a bit of fresh air into the film. But for me, after that half way point i just couldn't appreciate any of that stuff anymore because i was so bored from my lack of interest in what was going on. I am not saying this is a god awful movie, and i'm definitely not saying that it doesn't deserve to be nominated for all of those Academy Awards, but if it was up to me, Terminator Genisys would be up for Best Picture before i even consider this.So if you really want to see this film, go right ahead, you will probably get something out of it that i most certainly did not. If you end up agreeing with me that's great, if you end up completely disagreeing with me then that's even better. 4.8/10",

So I went into this film just based on the fact that it received a Best Picture Oscar Nomination this morning. What I didn't expect was for this film to blow my f***ing socks off. A filmmaker named John Grierson once said that we shouldn't use film as a means just to entertain, but to inspire and to inform a mass audience and get them caring about a certain subject matter. That's exactly what this film did. Normally, when I drive home from the movie theatre, if I'm with some friends, we generally talk about our favourite performances, the best jokes if it's a comedy, the best set-pieces if it's an action movie and what ideas we have for a potential sequel. On the ride home from this film, I had a pretty heated discussion about the constant fraud the banks on Wall Street and throughout the United States operate in. This film made me completely invested about something I normally couldn't care less about. How did they do that? Well, they sucked you in with witty humour, mostly from Ryan Gosling's constant breaking of the fourth wall and amazing performances, especially by Steve Carrell. This guy knocked it out of the park. One of, if not my favourite performance all year! Which is surprising because Christian Bale got the nomination here, not Steve Carell. Bale was good, don't get me wrong... but Carrell was better. I strongly encourage you guys to see this movie. It's riveting, intriguing, well acted, funny, it's got it all. Will EVERYONE like it? Definitely not. But when a film can get my head spinning hours after I've seen it, then I know it's a great film. Even if it's about a subject matter I had absolutely zero knowledge of before.",

    "review": "  The Big Short is a fascinating study of what can go wrong with an unregulated financial system such as the one that existed in the USA at the time of the GFC, and, to a great extent, still exists now. In retrospect it is amazing how unprepared the world was for the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market which was the basis for billions of dollars of managed funds and bank investments . This movie deals with those few who bothered to do their research and realised, some by luck and some by judgement, that the house of cards was going to fall. It is a fascinating insight into greed, fraud and basic stupidity and what makes it all even more staggering is the fact that it all happened. It is not a film that will suit all as it requires a basic understanding of the workings of financial markets, and that is not everyone's idea of entertainment. But it is exceedingly well done and has a terrific cast led by the always brilliant Christian Bale and the sometimes adequate Steve Carell who is at his best in this. I loved it.",

Simplifying collateralized debt obligations and the collapse of the housing market and turning it into a film may seem a nigh impossible task for most, but not Adam McKay. The film maneuvers the financial intricacies with finesse and humor, producing an extraordinary film in the process.Buoyed by skillful performances - especially the two bullheaded characters played by Bale and Carell - The Big Short reminds the viewer of the reckless profiteering that knocked the country to its knees, and that the next crisis is only a few (million) bad bets away. Carell's character says in his seminal moment, \"Fraud has never, ever worked. Eventually things go south. When the hell did we forget all that?\" May we never forget all that.",

But it wasn't an accident. This is a top quality product with excellent acting; the editing and pace are superb; it is replete with a cast of great stars and support actors, who with super efficient directing and editing are fully used and fully present to the audience. Watch it once for the thrills and a crash course; or more, so as to run a fine tooth comb through. If you think you don't understand this stuff, you will get a fair enough idea after this.

    "review": "  Superb - intriguing, funny, edifying, scary and moving.Based on the book by Michael Lewis (writer of Moneyball, Liar's Poker and Flash Boys, amongst others), the true story (though most of the main characters' names have been changed) of a handful of investors who bet against the US mortgage market in 2006-7. Through their own research they discovered that the US mortgage backed securities market was a bubble about to burst, and they invested accordingly. What they didn't initially know was how structurally flawed the MBS system was, the level of corruption in the market...and the impact on the average person when the bubble burst.Incredibly interesting and informative. Maybe you have to know finance and investments (as I do) to understand some of the concepts, but the mechanics of the market and their proposed investment (their big shorts) are fascinating. What is even more interesting is that market so structurally flawed can even exist, especially without any decent regulation...Quite funny too. Director Adam MacKay's previous feature films have all been comedies - Anchorman, The Other Guys, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers - and here he lightens the mood (at relevant times) with some great humour.As the movie goes on, however, it takes on a more serious and sombre tone. This conveys well the impact of the bubble bursting. The ultimate feeling is one of helplessness and anger.Superb performances, especially from Christian Bale and Steve Carell. We expect this from Bale but Carell is starting to throw off his comedy past and put in some fine dramatic performances. Foxcatcher was the start and here he is in fine form again. Considering how different the two characters he played (in Foxcatcher and The Big Short) are, he is not only a good dramatic actor, but one with decent range.Good supporting cast which includes Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt and Marisa Tomei. Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez appear as themselves and provide some of the film's wackier moments.Ultimately, a great exposition of the greed, stupidity, self-interest and lack of regulation that caused the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.",

Over the holidays I had the opportunity to see The Big Short, which I watched for the second time last Friday. I was pleased to see that the movie held up throughout repeated viewings, a feat which I attribute to the spectacular acting, sardonic humor, and the profound subject matter. The Big Short focuses on Wall Street investors who predict the financial crash of 2008 by doing what no one else at the time was doing- paying attention. The film follows the Wall Street misfits as they discover the corrupt and fraudulent systems upon which the American economy is based. What separates The Big Short from other financial films is that the creators go through enormous pains to make sure that the audience understands the transactions taking place, rather than merely having to accept it as Wall Street mumbo-jumbo. By cleverly utilizing celebrities and simple analogies, the directors reduce abstruse Wall Street jargon into understandable terms and concepts for lay people. (For example, Margot Robbie clarifies that \"sub-prime\" just means \"shit\" as she soaks in a bubble bath, sipping champagne.) This feature of the movie is exactly what makes The Big Short so important- yes, it's entertainment (honestly, it's hilarious), but it is also a worthy educational tool that explains the largest financial crisis in modern history to a broad public audience.",

    "review": "  Before ever stepping into a theater to watch this film, I knew going in that Adam McKay was in the directors chair. Two thoughts ran through my head. One, what was the director of both Anchorman movies, Talladega Nights, The Other Guys, and Step Brothers doing, directing a movie up for multiple Oscars? Not to say that those films are bad in any way, because I love each of them, especially the underrated buddy cop movie, The Other Guys. But really? Adam McKay? And the second thought was; Is this going to actually be funny? Well much to my surprise, a lot of it actually was. And I was extremely pleasantly surprised to see that Mr. McKay was able to transition well from the likes of Will Ferrell schlock, to a possible best picture win. The movie centers around a couple or more main characters during the 2008 crash of the housing market.. Michael Burry (Christian Bale) is a hedge fund manager that was able to predict the impending crisis years before it actually happens. He makes some questionable investments, in preparation for the collapse, which is much to everyone's dismay. Trader, Jared Vennet (Ryan Gosling), gets wind of Michael's investments and starts to figure out the same thing. Soon enough others do as well, and from there on out the story unfolds as a different cast of characters prepare for the crisis. Now , just to give everyone some background on myself, I am a nine-teen year old college student. I have absolutely no interest in the housing market, mortgage rates, CDO's, or banking period. With that being said, I believe the filmmakers understood this fact wholeheartedly. They were able to take a subject, and a story, that was extremely complicated, and make it entertaining and enjoyable. In fact, I think that is the best aspect of this movie. Much like The Wolf of Wall Street, this film is dirty with fourth wall jokes, celebrity cameos, and an overall joking tone. This does seem odd and unconventional, given the subject matter. But they are able to make it work brilliantly. For a movie about the housing market, there was not a second when I found myself bored. I was engaged the whole time, and honestly was starting to feel a little pissed because of what had actually happened. Given the films credit, I believe that was their intention. For a movie that is slated at over two hours, the pacing was very well, and thanks to Adam McKay's brilliant direction, I found myself laughing for most of the runtime. The casting in this movie was simply fantastic as well. Christian Bale is basically a more buff version of Jessie Eisenberg in The Social Network. He is a genius, but has no idea what to say or how to say them. Think Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory, only not that bad. I found that very odd, especially for Christian Bale. Although at this point in his career, he could probably play a woman, and convince me all the same. Ryan Gosling reprises his role, almost, from Crazy, Stupid, Love. He is smooth, and sophisticated, and just the right amount of jerk you want on wall street. I could talk all day about the cast, however the biggest win here is certainly Steve Carell. As a comedian, he is one of the funniest I have ever had the pleasure of watching. As a serious actor, he also hits a home-run. I have been saying for a long time that I believe comedians can be the best actors, and time and time again they prove it to me.  Overall, this is most definitely one of the years best films, and I would say the best film of Adam McKay's career thus far. The subject is extremely convoluted, but it doesn't matter thanks to the brilliant writing, and the awesome direction. The cast all give great performances, my favorite coming from Steve Carell, which make for an extremely enjoyable film. I would not recommend this for everyone, but most will find great entertainment out of it. I would give this movie 4/5 stars. Definitely worth the price of admission!",

    "review": "  Saw this the same day as Spotlight, so pardon me for feeling like the system is out to get us all.I really really enjoyed this. Not only did I not really have any knowledge of what actually happened in 2008 with the housing market crash, but this film explained it in a really entertaining way utilizing celebrity cameos that improved upon the tone of the film itself and broke up the jumping between leads. Really entertaining take on explaining minutia that can't really work in other films. The frenetic and jumpy editing really helped facilitate that fast-paced and information-dense exposition that made it OK.The performances were also QUITE good. Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell lead the cast with great character acting; just phenomenally in-character, quirky, and nuanced. Other than them, it's crazy how the film's tone totally shifts between the 2nd and 3rd acts to reflect the reality of the plot and the dichotomy the main characters (essentially betting on the downfall of the economy) faced after making off with giant amounts of bank money after selling back securities. The world was so crazy during that time and I was in high school, completely unaware.Come for the story, stay for the editing and acting. Just a great film.",

The acting was inspired quirky and funny, just an awesome ensemble. But the film making was distracting to me. It felt sloppy and choppy and tried to hard to make it interesting with strange angles and lots of zooming in and out and lots of montages that didn't always make sense to me. There is one dramatic scene that I think was just terrible, slow and awkward. But most of all despite clear efforts to explain confusing economics to laymen I still was confused. I knew they were working a screwed up system but in the end I still didn't understand how. But that may just be me. It's still worth watching because it's an important story that I think is time to be told and the acting was great.",

Superb actor lineup, Great backdrops -- NYC, Vegas and the suburban wilds of Florida all inter-meshed --- a road show at times. The interludes and humor provided by famous academics or celebrities was useful and added a wonderful respite of humor to what is a serious subject - the milking of mega-dollars from investors, the pervasive corruption of many investment bankers and the self-inflicted delusion of home buyers who propped up an economic bubble-compounded by government regulators asleep at the switch.

    "review": "  Boiler Rooming advanced economics into crazy stupid unlovely shop talk that all filmgoers can understand, pointed morality tale The Big Short qualifies as a drama but the pure lunacy of the story and slick fourth wall-breaking presentation re-package sad true events as one of the sharpest comedies in years. As straight-ahead as the storytelling and stripped-down as the performances are in Spotlight, this film goes the opposite route, making its real-life figures purposely hyper-realistic-just like the ridiculous position they find themselves. Giving the audience gratuitous cheatsheets by having its characters occasionally address the audience directly and, in one example, having alluring actress Margot Robbie explain credit default swaps from a bubble bath, this whipsmart adaptation of Michael Lewis' whipsmart book by the same name winks and nods to the utter madness at hand. In effect, it's not that The Big Short laughs WITH and not AT you, the taxpayers who are still suffering through the fallout of this travesty, it's that the film gets you to laugh at this bubble bursting at all.In this R-rated account of the financial meltdown catalyst of 2008, four denizens of the world of high-finance (Bale, Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt) predict the credit and housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000s, and decide to take on the big banks for their greed and lack of foresight. Usually known for capturing Will Ferrell's unique man-child brand of sophomoric clowning, director Adam McCay improbably but brilliantly takes a complicated stock tip and turns it into a savagely funny payout where a marquee ensemble never outshines the unbelievable insanity of the oft-kilter narrative. Bale and Pitt dial it down, making understated performing an art form, while Carell and Gosling go bigger (appropriate to their respective characters). No one showboats, however, for the sake of stealing the spotlight. After all, who could pull focus from the dramatization of a Doomsday Machine? Bottom line: The WTF of Wall Street",

    "review": "  The Big Short (R) Raise your hand if you are super stoked to go check out a film attempting to educate you on the American financial crisis in the housing market 10 years ago. . . Ya, that's what I thought. . . I apologize if you are a person who pours yourself a drink and sits down to CNN every night to watch stocks and banking news, but most people in the average public would agree that trying to understand it all is like trying to read stereo instructions for the first time. In Chinese. . . Now though, I have to throw a couple of cliche's out there like \"What's the age old saying about assuming\", or \"never judge a book by it's cover\", and \"beauty is in the eye of the beholder\". It all comes down to interperetation and HOW you tell the story. Surprisingly enough, a filmmaker like Adam McKay, known more for his work with the \"Anchorman\" films, \"Talladega Nights\", \"Step Brothers\", and other ridiculous romps in comedy, is the perfect compliment to infuse a little bit of life in this assumed to be stale topic. And when you enlist the star power of Christian Bale, Steve Carrell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt to tell your tale, now there is something to work with. . . Adapted from the also titled 2010 New York Times Best Selling novel, \"The Big Short\" poses as an expose' going behind the curtain of the crisis. Through the perspective of a group of individuals (portrayed by the all star cast) who anticipated the downfall of our economy due to this rotten financial structure, we get some shocking insight as to how this all came to be, the effect it truly had on the world, and what happened when this group decided to do the unprecidented thing in betting AGAINST the American economy for profit when damn near everybody was under the delusion it was rock solid. . . I must at this point applaud the efforts from all parties of the film responsible for their execution in what truly was a circus tight rope balancing act. This film had to walk a really fine line between the drama and comedy genres it was blending. Filmmaker McKay and the performances of his team had to be engaging, witty, and often times comical enough to catch the attention of audiences despite the technical and arguably boring material they had to work with. They had to do this for entertainment value, but still needed to acknowledge while paying respect to the overall situation and the consequences that came from it. This crisis ruined lives. People lost jobs, people lost homes, people went hungry, and many people even died during this dire time. . . In the grand scheme of things, this was in no angle of looking at it EVER considered a laughing matter. Yet, \"The Big Short\" performs the balancing act with grace as the audience has an easy time transitioning between the funny moments as well as the sad. Christian Bale and Steve Carrell lead the charge with truly memorable performances as filmmaker McKay's change of pace film comes off as much educational as it does entertaining. All I know is, if only I had a gorgeous blonde actress in a bubble bath explaining my mortgage to me as this film depicts, I may have paid more attention to the fine print too. . .GRADE: A",

    "review": "  Adam McKay clearly wanted to make a documentary, as his The Big Short ends up feeling much more Michael Moore than Margin Call. The movie pauses many times to helpfully provide exposition on Wall Street mumbo-jumbo, which is entirely necessary for the movie to work simply because there are absolutely no dramatic stakes outside of whether the audience member leaves knowing what a CDO is. By choosing to follow three separate major groups of players, the movie is left without focus, and with the exception of Steve Carrell, none of the cast is able to find any reason to really be on camera. McKay tries to separate the vibe from his Will Ferrell films with annoying and unnecessary freeze frame as well as obnoxious musical cues. At the end of the day, the movie succeeds as a form of education (I think, I'm no expert), but fails as a work of film and as a comedy. For comparison, Margin Call worked without being necessarily understandable; The Big Short focuses so much on being intelligible that it forgets to work at all.",

    "review": "  I can't understand why they didn't just make a documentary. This entire film was just a two hour breakdown of the financial collapse, why not just actually interview these people and show it? I didn't feel like I gained anything from any having actors act this story out. The movie starts out as a slog, and just ends up depressing because it's a depressing story. Why dance around the facts by portraying it with fake dialogue and fake faces when all of this is just readily available as documentary footage? Why even add that layer of protection for big banks by giving them even the tiniest benefit of the doubt that this story is 'inspired by' events. Just show the events. Strip it bare. They spend two hours just trying to break down what happened. Like why not cut the shit and just focus on that? Don't pretend we're invested in the characters that we barely have any information about because you didn't have the time to show us. Make it a documentary and interview these people instead, it's more direct and more honest and more interesting. The movie just leaves you wondering what's real and what's fake.Also stop giving Steve Carrell dramatic roles, he stinks in them.",

This film is about a kind of boring topic (the housing crisis) and the film knows it and even breaks the third wall a few times to help you understand it. The film is a lot 'cooler' than I expected it to be and it's montages, music, and breaking the third wall all worked for me and I loved that, otherwise it could have easily been a very boring film. The cast is top notch and it's not just the four outstanding leads; the supporting cast is great as well. Another big surprise is that the film is directed by Adam McKay, who is known for Anchorman and Step-Brothers and this is his first dramatic film and he does an amazing job as director. Overall, much like 'Moneyball', this film doesn't seem like a mainstream movie, but it's a film that should be watched by a lot of people and its hip and cool enough for everyone.",

Plan B (Pitt's production company) picked it up for a timely tale for awards pedigree with most of the cast members playing to their personas which isnt too much of a stretch, and not fully comitting to whether they want to play more on the side of whistleblowers ala Wall St or Margin Call, or relish breaking the fourth wall akin to the Wolf although I do like them recruiting various personalities right down to Margot Robbie breaking down the shop talk for the viewer. One would hope for a more scathing dramatization for the tale but a little late out of the gate at least for me although has enough elements to be mildly intriguing.",

Its starts out almost like a documentary. There's too many characters, it's convoluted and attempts a cheeky manner of \"explaining\" to us what is going on through the use of celebrities. The language is mostly business, and economic language, so unless you majored in Finance or Economics, you will get confused. Often, it foolishly aims for laughter. But, having said all that, it might be THE live action film of the year. It is a story that is too DAMN important to ignore. It is harrowing, disturbing. It is the most depressing film of the year because it clearly insinuates it COULD happen all over again. So what DID happen in 2008? Only 6 million lost their homes, and 8 million lost their jobs, and that was just in the U.S.A , and it ALL could have been prevented with just a few common sense regulations that would have reined in the criminals, of whom, none went to jail.",

To me, he's always been the go-to dude for stupid Will Ferrell movies, so the fact that he's finally made a film that is smart, edgy, and absolutely hilarious without trying too hard is -- I must say -- quite remarkable. The Big Short is an intelligent and enormously entertaining film that takes serious real-life events and turns it into a satirical, subversive cautionary tale of greed and human nature. I loved the style of the film and the performances are quite strong. Really sharp and quite brilliant.",

All the pieces of a great film were there--great cast, important story--but The Big Short fails to do any of these elements justice due to some questionable directorial and editing choices made by McKay and a striking lack of depth. I commend the film, however, for providing a digestible perspective on the 2008 crisis and another venue for Bale and Carrell to show off their acting skills.",

    "review": "  The Big Short is as educational as it is entertaining. I would venture to say that most people didn't understand what caused the housing crisis of the late 2000's. I certainly didn't. I had a general idea of what was happening, but getting my head around the details would have taken hours, and it wasn't something that I had an interest in doing. I can honestly say that I have a better understanding of the entire concept after watching The Big Short. Am I an expert now? Of course not. I just know a few small points that the film touched upon, but it was enough to give me an appreciation for what was happening. Is the film entertaining though? Definitely. I was enraptured from beginning to end, because of how the characters are invested in what is happening. I would by no means call this a comedy, but it certainly made me laugh a couple of times, even if it was more out of how uncomfortable I was than how funny I found it. With all of that said, however, I hated the way the film was shot. The lighting was abhorrent, the editing was a mess and the direction was boring. Luckily, the script and the acting made up for that. I would recommend this to those who wish to learn something, but also to those that love a good drama. 4 out of 5 stars.",

Great script, great surprising direction from Adam McKay; seriously, he's made one of the best movies of the year here. Works great as an ensemble.

The collapse of the housing market leading to the Great Recession has now found its cinematic primer, and the ridiculousness of the banking industry is put on fantastic display by McKay.It's very hard to summarize my impressions of this movie; on one hand (armed with 20/20 hindsight), I experienced exhilaration at the audacity of the movie's main players as they bet against the housing market. On the other hand, I experienced the outrage and sadness that came with knowing how many people lost so much because of greed. Entitlement had become institutionalized, and no one was punished for it. If there was ever a film that reinforced the philosophy of nihilism, this is it.",

It also works as a character piece, mainly with Bale and Carell, showing their pasts and how it affects them now, Carell especially is very good, McKay also employs a lot of clever visual gags and celeb cameos to make the financial jargon easier to understand, it is over 2 hrs long, but it never feels long because it moves so fast and there's always something urgent happening, as good a job as he does explaining everything, I'll admit there were still some aspects I couldn't follow (though maybe I'm just dumb :p) still it proves that Adam McKay is more than just the Will Ferrell director and has some serious chops",

Christian Bale plays a financier who is able to see that banks giving subprime loans to homeowners will lead to financial collapse and ruin for the country, but no one listens to him. A few executives, including Steve Carrell, get in on the game of betting against the housing market and buying up bad CDO's to line their already fat pockets. It is a very dangerous game, and the movie presents the subject matter in a very compelling, yet digestable way. There is solid acting all around in the movie, and Christian Bale does a brilliant character study. The movie is also very informative and shows how corporate wealth and excess can lead to a slippery slope where the taxpayer shoulders the burden.

    "review": "  Adam McKay is not exactly the kind of name you associate with a prestige picture that's building serious Oscar heat. McKay is best known as the director and co-writer of Will Ferrell's best movies, from Anchorman and its sequel to Talladega Nights and the underrated 2010 buddy cop movie, The Other Guys. If you stuck through the closing credits for Guys, you were treated to an animated education lesson on the size of Wall street's greed and accountability in regards to the 2008 financial crisis. It was impassioned, angry, and an interesting note to end an otherwise goofy comedy. The Big Short is based upon Michael Lewis' (Moneyball) best-selling book and it's a disaster movie where the biggest disaster is the world economy. The movie McKay co-adapted and directed is bristling with intelligence, indignation, and a clear purpose. He wants to make you very angry, and by the end if you're not, you haven't been paying enough attention.In the wake of the financial collapse in 2008, the fallout was so tremendous that many people felt nobody could have seen this coming. There were a few and they made out like bandits while trying to warn others about the impending doom. In the early 2000s, Michael Burry (Christian Bale) is a hedgefund manager who sees warning signs that the housing market is a bubble ready to burst. He sees the toxicity of the majority sub-prime mortgages wrapped together and sold as a seemingly safe security, a CDO (collateralized debt obligation). His bosses think he's mad and they're furious when they discover Burry has gone from bank to bank making big bets against the housing market. The banks are eager to take what they believe to be easy money from a sucker. How could the housing market burst? Other Wall Street investors take notice of Burry, notably Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) who pitches the plan to \"short\" the housing market. Nobody takes him seriously except Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and his small team who works for Goldman Sachs. Baum is curious how something so large could go unnoticed, so he and his team fly to Florida and Vegas to investigate the realities of the market and what they find does not match the rosy cheerleading from Wall Street. A pair of wannabe traders (Finn Witrock, John Magaro) stumbles across Burry's analysis and try to make their own bets, except they need a bigger name to make the trades. They reach out to an ex-Wall Street trader (Brad Pitt) who agrees to shepherd them on this quixotic quest. Are these men righteous defenders of fraud or just people trying to get their own cut of the pie?The brilliance of The Big Short lies in its accessibility and the virulent passion that McKay has for the subject matter. The movie is structured like a heist and an underdog story, suckering in the audience to root for the upstarts trying to fleece the big banks and profit off their greed and stupidity. For the first 90 minutes or so, the film comes across like a caper and we follow our group of misfits as they fight against the conventional wisdom that the housing market could never topple. These guys see the signs and the risks that others could not or would not see, especially since the flow of money was rich and the good times could be shared, which lead to collusion from the very same agencies designed to regulate and enforce the financial laws. For those 90 minutes the movie flies by on its sense of whimsy and are-we-getting-away-with-this good fortune, putting our band of misfits in position to win big on the losses of the ignorant and fraudulent. And then, in one swift move, it all comes down and you're reminded, rather indignantly by Pitt's character, that what they are benefiting from is the meltdown of the U.S. housing market and by extension the American economy. What once felt like a celebratory caper now starts to feel queasy, and it's in the last act that The Big Short reminds you just how awful the events of the 2008 financial crisis were and how these guys did nothing more than benefit from mass misery. These are not heroes, though Mark Baum is given plenty of moral grandstanding moments that present him as the closest thing we have in the picture. These were a bunch of guys who got rich betting on a lot of other people's bad bets, bets that almost destroyed the world's economic systems. The concluding half hour feels like a sudden stop after a sugar rush, where you're left to question your decision-making but also come to terms with the reality of what seemed like a fun time. McKay lures his audience in with the guise of a heist/underdog story, appealing and accessible avenues of cinema, and then serves the cod hard medicine in the concluding moments.McKay is admirably trying to educate and advocate while he entertains, but he truly wants the audience to understand why they should be sharpening their pitchforks. At several points, characters will break the fourth wall and talk directly into the camera, admitting that certain events didn't happen exactly as we saw, or occasionally they'll remind us that what we watched was exactly how it happened. It's a measure that isn't overplayed and helps juice the spirits of the movie, becoming something of a confidant in the schemes with the onscreen participants. When things gets a little hard to understand with the mountain of Wall Street lingo, McKay will cut to celebrity cameos to help explain the more arcane instruments of the financial system. Margot Robbie luxuriates in a bubble bath and explains sub-prime mortgages, Anthony Bourdain explains CDOs, and Selena Gomez, in a rather cogent analogy, explains synthetic CDOs as an endless chain of side bets being made off one hand of blackjack. The movie goes pretty fast and a viewer might experience information overload, but McKay knows when to slow things down and provide a well-timed assist, so that his learned audience will see the true extent of the corruption and greed rampant in how Wall Street handled its business.Of the three storylines, I found Mark Baum and his team easily the most interesting and I think McKay and co-screenwriter Charles Randolph (The Interpreter) agreed, which is why he's the biggest part of the movie. Burry gets things started but he recedes into the background after the first act, and that's where Baum and his financial team step into the spotlight to further explore how unstable the housing market just might be. I think this is Carell's best dramatic performance to date (I wasn't wowed by Foxcatcher). He's playing perhaps one of the angriest people seen on screen but that's because he has a moral center and the bad business practices, let alone the sociopathic greed of his \"peers,\" constantly enrage him. He's something like a flabbergasted crusading journalist who keeps shaking his head in stupefying revulsion at just how deep this whole thing goes. Having Baum as our entry into the moral morass of Wall Street allows the audience to feel a sense of ethical superiority, and then like Pitt's character, it can all go away with one perfectly articulated retort. There's a moment where Baum is lambasting a mortgage ratings officer (Melissa Leo, her only scene too) after she admits that if they don't rate bad mortgages as good, the banks will just go to their competitor, and then she accuses Baum of being a hypocrite. His reason for the office visit is not that his outrage at the fraud but the fact that this fraud is holding up his winnings. He's not the crusader he may wish to be. Bale (American Hustle) and Gosling (Only God Forgives) are perfectly cast and provide strong supporting work in small doses spread throughout. There is a bevy of familiar faces (Marisa Tomei, Rafe Spall, Max Greenfield, Karen Gillan) appearing in small moments as if everybody in Hollywood wanted to get in on McKay's party.There is one annoying misstep in the movie and it occurs about halfway and it's made to stretch out the stakes in a haphazard manner. The Big Short is a disaster movie where the audience knows exactly when the disaster is coming, and yet there's a section in the middle where the characters are all left in doubt whether their big bets will pay off because of the ratings fraud. Burry is threatened with losing his job. It's silly because we know the economy is going to crash in 2008, but the movie throws out a weak obstacle that, hey, maybe it won't crash. It reminds me of the Hinderberg movie from the 1970s. There were several moments where it looked like that zeppelin full of hydrogen was going to go up in fames... except students of history know that moment is fated in New Jersey, so all the close calls were foolish fake-outs for a major event that was well anticipated. We all know the economy is going down so there's no need for the manufactured doubts.McKay and company want to wake up a fairly apathetic general public about the crimes and negligence of the Wall Street robber barons that risked the world's economy and then managed to skip out on the tab. The tones can juggle wildly, and I'd credit McKay's background in comedy for his ability to maintain a reliable and firm comic footing for the film without losing the significance of his message. It's hard to nail down a genre for the movie; it's a dark comedy, a drama, a true crime picture, and a wake-up call. You have moments that feel like a heist flick and moments that feel like a sickening journalistic expose. It's got highs, lows, laughs, groans, and plenty of human emotions, though the most prominent would be disgust and disbelief. The Big Short is advocacy populism as pop-entertainment, and it succeeds ably. It's an economics lesson for the public. At the end of the movie, the closing text informs us about \"bespoke tranches,\" which are investment opportunities that banks are flocking to ($5 billion in 2013 to $20 billion in 2014). It's just another name for CDOs. Unless an informed public demands action from the system, it seems that Wall Street is doomed to repeat its same high-risk mistakes and that same vulnerable public is doomed to clean up the mess.Nate's Grade: A-",

    "review": "  Well, people with knowledge about economics and loans will understand this film better than most. Most will spend the film trying to wrap their heads around what is being said. This is the exact reason there are moments in the film which break the fourth wall - specific celebrities are depicted (as themselves) giving oversimplified analogies directly to the audience to help them along the way. Thanks for the help, but it would be nice to be able to understand what is said in the first place than to be patted on the back by the filmmakers who are saying \"it's okay, we know you're trying your best but we're here to help.\"In the sense that the economic jargon is complex the film is not necessarily bad, but it fails to be entertaining. What IS entertaining is the acting. All good performances here. Christian Bale plays a manic with subtle giveaways such as his distracted persona and his jamming out to music and nonchalant failure to wear shoes in the office. It's hard to say whether his manic depiction of Michael Burry is accurate, but it makes sense and is well-done since manic is very close to genius sometimes, which is exactly what Burry proves to be in this film. Bale can definitely play unstable from viewing previous performances in American Psycho and The Fighter, and he does it again here. Ryan Gosling adds personality to the film, not falling short when portraying a self-righteous jerk whose narration is not that different than DiCaprio's narration in The Wolf of Wall Street. Steve Carell is great in a dramatic role once again after proving his dramatic ability in roles in Little Miss Sunshine and Foxcathcer. Brad Pitt is okay - we don't really get to see much of him in the film, but he plays his character as it was meant to be played. There is a good moment when his character acts as a moral voice of reason, and that is probably the most emotional moment for him in the film and it is very quick.Discussing The Big Short after viewing it is a recommendation - it might help to clarify that the story in general is understandable and deals with good questions about morality versus greed. However, when a film goes over the heads of the audience as much as this film did, it fails to be entertaining. This is a good film but it lacks entertainment - especially from a known comedic director.2.0/4.0",

The financial transactions will lose a lot of people, but the script tries to make the complications of finance entertaining. Only place film goes Hollywood instead of honest is the end, where it claims people blamed financial crisis on \"immigrants and poor people. I must have missed that because I think everyone really blamed \"greedy bankers.\" Also while the film makes it clear that nothing was done against greedy bankers who were actually bailed out by taxpayers, it fails to mention that this lack of prosecution was all was all controlled by Obama,",

When the movie puts up text statements at the end with statistics that 8 million people lost their jobs and 6 million lost their homes in the financial collapse of the U.S. housing market, it was surreal knowing I was one of both of those statistics.

Yes the world wide global disaster that was the Housing Market and the whole shoddy global economic structure. To insult it's audience's intelligence isn't necessarily a bad thing, yet it also requires the intelligence to do so, and that is where The Big Short lacks. Though it may know the details of how the Stock Market and Economy works, it doesn't know quite as much about filmmaking. Oh sure the actors are great, all four of the big names are doing some great work like they always do; however, where the big short fails is having someone who knows how to use the visual medium at all. Adam McKay is a filmmaker who has half of the idea on how a film can be good; the cutaways to celebrities explaining how the business works is a good example of an interesting idea being shoddily done. On the one hand the idea itself isn't bad at all, it reflects social commentary and also does manage to tell relatively boring information in an interesting way of sorts. However, in practice it ultimately comes undone, not just because Adam McKay doesn't have a good idea how to use the camera outside of basic coverage directing (except in this case dipped in semi-\"mocumentary\" filmmaking), however in practice it's still nothing more than explanation for something you might as well read in a book, or just have explained by the characters since it's basically the same thing, they break the fourth wall so much that having all these cameos are redundant. Ultimately The Big Short works like the Jenga game that Ryan Gosling's character uses in the film, aesthetically it looks interesting, it's a good idea, and it can work if you don't think too hard about it, but much like how the game works in the scene, it ultimately falls apart since in execution it fails, it's construction is ultimately shoddy, and when you look at the details much like the housing market, it ultimately falls flat",

The small little monologues that they throw in along with the great camera work really pulled this whole story together. Now i've seen a few docs on the whole wall street situation and with my obviously in depth intellect that i achieved from those PBS docs i can say that this was accurate. They broke down what happened and told it in a way that makes big bank guys look like the tools they were. It needs to be appreciated that they were able to do this while also keeping people entertained without going all wolf of wall street on it. Great movie will definitely make a bunch of 18 and 19 year old students go change their majors to accounting as soon as they can. But anyways, camera angles were dope, monologues(I had to right click and spell check that every time) were dope and the story was dope. Big actors in good roles actually turned out okay this time.

It wants to be Michael Moore (complete with wigs of mop-like hair), but it is terrified of shedding the shiny Hollywood veneer. The overall effect is a lot like that attractive young teacher who got you to pay attention in class simply because you enjoyed looking at them. In \"The Big Short\" it's Margot Robbie in a hot tub and Selena Gomez in a low-cut top. It's a head scratcher why reviewers believe this movie 'does not undermine their intelligence' despite telling them point-blank that they are unable to digest complex information without being sexually stimulated or being pushed to sensory overload. While there are a few facts in this movie to refuel your hatred of Wall Street, it is far too terrified of boring it's audience to genuinely dig into the characters or to pick apart the culture that created this crisis.",

    "review": "  A movie well worth all the awards buzz.Obviously the movie is well-cast. Anyone can see that. But the success of a movie isn't just based on the people on the screen but largely on the ones behind it. Director Adam McKay somehow made economics interesting and upbeat and personal. He made it actually accessible to an average American. Use of pop culture stars like Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez to explain Wall Street mumbo jumbo in layman's terms was pure genius.The humor is sharp and quick and bitter. When you laugh, you laugh at a joke made at the expense of six million American people. You laugh at a joke about the worst recession in American history since the stock market crash nearly a century ago. You laugh because you can't help it, and you know that you're laughing at a terrible thing. That kind of humor saves the movie. It's what keeps viewers on their toes.Ryan Gosling's smart and quick narration traded an outrageous, highly improbable movie about an event for an outrageous, highly improbable movie about a true event that everyone needs to get pissed about - and he did that without being a good guy. The stars of the movie are usually called the \"protagonists,\" but this is a story of all villains. The people we root for are the ones who bet against the American economy. They're the ones who saw the bankers' fraud and called their bullshit and profited from it. How can we cheer for them? How can we not when the only alternative is to cheer for the bankers who pulled the wool over the eyes of the entire nation - the entire world?For me, the most relatable character is Steve Carrell's portrayal of Mark Baum. He's a cynical, paranoid idealist. He hates the banks. He bets against the American economy and hopes it doesn't work. He understands better than anyone that if they win, if the banks lose, he personally will be rich, and America will be ruined. And when they do win, when the real estate bubble does pop, when the system does reveal itself as totally broken, he's devastated. And by the end of this movie, so was I.But don't take my word for it. Go see it for yourself. Go be amazed and devastated at once. GO see it now before the bankers get the wool out again.",

Who would have thought a movie about the financial crisis would transmit so much energy? The Big Short stands our mainly because of this. Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, and Ryan Gosling, move and talk extremely fast throughout the movie and still manage to transmit every emotion in an impeccable way (Personally, I can smell an academy award nomination for Steve Carell and Christian Bale). I usually don't go over other elements in movies besides acting, editing and directing, but I have to mention that the screenplay by Adam McKay and Charles Randolph is brilliant. Not only is this a tale of true events, but also a learning experience. The witty explanations of complicated terms are hilarious, the fast-paced conversations and thinking provide a lens to what Wall Street is really like, and the management of three simultaneous stories is straightforward and clean.Director Adam McKay, uses the perfect combination of actors to turn his screenplay into something more than a film. McKay provides us with a visual representation of a corrupt and self-destructing financial system, making us laugh along the way, to the point of forgetting that this is actually a true (horror) story.",

    "review": "  Really fun, creative adaptation of the Michael Lewis book about investors that foresaw the housing bubble of the late '00s. Adam McKay does a nice job of winking at conventional bio-pics tactics and stretches the format in clever ways. And then while we are laughing and rooting for the protagonists, the bill comes due and the audience is sobered by the consequences of that crash and it's continuing after effects. Hilarious and angry and informative, what more could you ask for?",

    "review": "  It's a daunting concept, knowing your about to delve head first into a film which run time exceeds 2 hours and that it surround the economy. Wall Street, The Wolf Of Wall Street, Margin Call, all tremendous in their own right, however it takes a special kind of something to get a mass audience excited around numbers. You know mathematics, for me it was boring at school and having it be the show runner of my films feels like an irate teacher back in my youth, trying to force feed me poison. So my shock at my adoration for the aforementioned films is not completely unjust. So when Adam McKay, best known for anything stupid starring Will Ferrel, decides to jump into the big league with a sublime cast, lengthy run time and have it all surround the crash of the global economy, the mixed emotion and indeed mixed messages going on in my head reached fever pitch. To my surprise not only has McKay crafted a completely potent black comedy, that revels in a wealth of dialogue and mad hatter visuals, he also manages to steer 4 huge stars, all back onto their A game. Leading the cast, which is a jaw dropping talent pool, Christian Bale, Steve Carrel, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt manage to knock out the best performances in at least a few years, minus Carrel's turn in the highly underrated Foxcatcher. These 4 men, who have little in the way of a connection, minus their love for money and mild notoriety, all lead the charge in what will be, if they are lucky, a huge money making exercise that will cost the financial lives of millions. As the battle each other, the market and indeed themselves, the find their morals pushed to braking point, as they stand to get rich from others misfortunes. The Story itself is extremely overwhelming and luckily McKay knows this, he is fully aware of the limits his previous work and indeed common peoples patience have and acts accordingly. The Big Short is like a wild character piece, littered in desert dry humour, social studies and off the cuff editing. It mixes an extremely well thought out and written script, with actors who are back on form and all ready to rumble. Bale hasn't been this good since The Fighter, Carrel proves Foxcatcher was not a fluke, nor a one off, Pitt pulls off his most lovable character in an age and Ryan Gosling back hands every critic who complained he never spoke enough in films. But these A list gods arent alone, Karen Gillan, Melissa Leo, Marisa Tomei, Margot Robbie, Finn Wittrock, Rafe Spall, Al Sapienza and even Anthony Bourdain show up to brighten the palette considerably. The outcome is a furious punch of colour, that will make you laugh, make you cry and then make you so uncomfortable you'll laugh again. The Big Short is a huge achievement in terms of watching a film maker grow and McKay does so admirably, he doesnt just drop his history given the first sign of a more serious and mainstream approach, he embraces it, dropping comedy gold as much as possible and it works. He manages to just get the right mix of emotion, comedy and indeed detachment to prove to the world a film about numbers can indeed be bloody well riveting. The movie has some minor flaws, its structure sometimes venturing towards formulaic and predictable outcomes do rear their head from time to time, but on the strengths this movie has, if your a fan of any of the lead actors, Wolf Of Wall Street and importantly Adam McKay, The Big Short will deliver a stellar time, that although may be daunting, never bores.",

I can empathise with the director however as we do of course all know whats eventually going to happen due to the nature of the film. Bale puts in a strong performance and the false eye makeup is very well done and believable. This is not however Wolf of Wall street and shouldn't be confused or compared with it as its a very different take on proceedings. Brad Pitt also did a service and is likeable throughout the movie and Gosling plays the arse incredibly well, as the man everyone loves to hate. Overall easy to follow, amusing at points and enlightening at others. Solid viewing.",

For the non-thoughtful, this is a 5-star film, however, for those who have some moral qualms about seeing hedge fund traders creating toxic financial instruments and then cashing in on the rest of us who don't understand those products, and in the process blaming everybody else for being greedy and stupid, well, maybe its just 4 stars. That's cuz its a hell of a good movie! Its the same director who makes Will Ferrell movies! So props to the people, including Brad Pitt, who is listed as a producer (by the way Participant and rest of the EBay mafia are nowhere to be seen). Steve Carell will get an Oscar nomination for his work as one of several (Christian Bale plays another) \"oh-let's-feel-sorry-for-tortured-hedge-fund-traders-they are so-much-smarter-than us\" roles, but at least there's a film out there calling out junk bond bankers for the ethical castrati that they have devolved into. And to show it's heart is in the right place, it points out at the end (in a scrolling set of postscripts which is reminiscent of the postscript scroll on Spotlight, the naughty priest movie) that no one has ben arrested for the fraudulent activity so vividly portrayed - and explained by personages such as Selena, and Anthony Bourdain -- in this expose of how subprime mortgages were camouflaged as triple A investments by bankers and verified by ratings agencies with no scruples.

The movie is roughly about a group of men who figured out that the market for housing loans and credit was ultimately going to fail and discover a bit of corruption along the way. The movie follows Michael Burry (Christian Bale) a stock researcher that is the first to figure it out after looking through thousands of pages of loans. Burry goes off and bets against the market (which at the time was at an all time high) losing millions each year, but which eventually pays off. Then we have Mark Baum (Steve Carell) who leads a small group of investment analysts who decide to follow along with Burry's original plan and buy shorts with Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling). Vennett is also kind of the narrator of the story and guides us along helping with the big technical terms (which are helpful!). Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) are a small investment firm that are trying to get in with the big boys, but are laughed away at every meeting. They discover the market bubble and enlist the help of Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) an ex stock broker who decides to help the guys after seeing their plan. All four teams of men figure out what's going on way before anyone else did and the film portrays their actions and like I said it's very informative. It is slow paced and it kinda expects you to know a little bit about how finance works. Overall, not for everyone, but if the source material interests ya then definitely give this one a look! It has great performances and a story that keeps good pace.",

    "review": "  Many films have dealt with the financial crashes of our recent history, but Adam McKay does a beautiful job in making quite possibly the best film on the subject. Not only has he written a jam-packed script, but he has also taken a very realistic view of the subject, and has made the entire film feel like a giant documentary, which television shows like \"The Office\" and \"Parks and Recreation\" call \"mockumentaries.\" The style is incredibly fascinating, but sometimes feels a little small for a big screen, and feels like something for the smaller screen. However, this is all salvaged by the incredible acting talent that McKay has brought to the table. Ryan Gosling takes the role of narrator, while Steve Carell takes the complete cake as the incredibly complex and entertaining Mark Baum. Carrell brings a real approach to the role, while also keeping up the dry humor and inner-struggle of his character. Brad Pitt also offers some laughs in his not-too-lengthy role, and the duo of fairly unknown Finn Wittrock and John Magaro in their roles is infectious and adds more the the humorous scenes of the piece. And you can't go without mentioning Christian Bale's incredible performance, but it is what we expect from Bale, which is that every role he touches is pure gold. He and Carell are the strongest ones on the acting front, but the ensemble of actors is still one of the best ones of the year, and will be a front runner for the SAG trophy when the time comes. The film is categorized as a comedy, but I think, with further reflection, \"dramedy\" might be a better term. The dialogue is humorous and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments, but the entire piece as a whole is crippling to some viewers, and deals with things that have not only just occurred, but may still be occurring. \"The Big Short\"'s strongest and weakest factor is the script. The script is so full of rich dialogue, that tells the story in a very detailed way, which could be seen as good or bad. If you go to the bathroom, or zone out for a few seconds, you will certainly miss key factors, and even while present in the theatre, you have to really listen carefully to understand what's going on at all times. The plot as a whole is followable, but confusing for a viewer who has not been introduced to the subject, or someone who pays less attention to dialogue. Despite being wordy (trust me, if there were better lighting, a dictionary would be a key thing to have while viewing it), the script is still full of comedy, drama, and great lines from the main and supporting cast. The movie is interesting, and compelling, and done in a very cool style. McKay has brought history into an interesting light, and has paired it up with a perfect cast and well written script. This film has its flaws, but is still entertaining and one of the strongest of the year.",

Steve Carell and Christian Bale were awesome. You lose yourself in this movie that you forget it's a movie, since we all lived through this or knew someone who did. This movie was brilliant. What was very clever is that much of this Wall Street and housing market lingo is so confusing that they used illustrations with random real life famous characters for us to understand. You know they should really have university students and for that matter high school students watch this movie. This may somehow show our young ones how corrupt and unfair this system is and how it really can affect someone that we are close to. At the same time it teaches us to have a simple eye in life and not live beyond our means. GREED is a really bad thing, Great movie.",

The movie takes on the serious topic of the housing marketing crisis and thievery and dumbs it down so even people like me can fully grasp the crookedness of the whole situation. For much of the movie you are along for the ride and enjoy every single minute of the film which is remarkable given the subject matter, that is so dry, but the acting and directing are so superb that you cannot help but love the film. The breaking of 4th wall by some of the characters also adds an extra explanation and sense of humor to many scenes in the film which I personally love. Lastly, the added cameos of the likes of Selena Gomez and Margot Robbie, among others, help to explain and dumb down the story even more. Definite must watch!",

    "review": "  For many years I have said that my brother got the money gene and I got the good looking gene and, once again, \"The Big Short\" may prove that true. The film is about the financial collapse in 2008 and those who made billions of dollars while an unaccountable number of people lost their homes and/or jobs. Much is made of the fact that many behind the scene, knowing what was going on, didn't do a thing to stop it and got away scot free.The film, with humor at odds with the theme, tries to explain exactly how the collapse came about in terms that even people like me might understand including the actors talking to the audience. This latter gimmick is at first interesting, including Margot Robbie in a bubble bath drinking champagne and later Selena Gomez gambling in a Las Vegas casino explaining aspects of subprime mortgages, loans and other finances but it eventually becomes distracting when an actor breaks the fourth wall, making you tune out on what is being said.Though it is very much an ensemble film certain actors stand out such as Brad Pitt, almost unrecognizable until you realize who it is, playing a retired banker, Christian Bale as, to say the least, a very eccentric hedge fund manager, Ryan Gosling as an investor and Steve Carell as a rude trader. Marisa Tomei and Melissa Leo, though good are more or less wasted.What interested me were the actors I didn't know or did know but couldn't name them. In the former group was Finn Wittrock as a young investor and Rafe Spall, both very impressive, and in the latter Jeremy Strong, Hamish Linklater and Adepero Oduye.Though the writers Charles Randolph and Adam McKay wrote the screen play, based on the book by Michael Lewis, using humor just doesn't sit right with a subject we know does not have happy ending and brought the USA on the verge of collapse, affected the rest of the world and still does. The direction by McKay is hectic; the editing by Hank Corwin is confusing and the music, at times, jars the audience out of the movie.Money gene or not, understanding finance or not, I found the actors more interesting than I did the movie. \"The Big Short\", by its subject alone, should have been more effective even though you will shake your head as the screen shows what didn't happen to the ones who caused the collapse.",

A lot of the supporting cast tends to blend together, so if a character wasn't in one of the three major groups of short sellers I couldn't tell who they were. Thankfully, at least one of the major players was typically on screen at all times. Steve Carell gives an outstanding performance, and while I thought Christian Bale was too over-the-top everyone else is solid The film breaks the fourth wall numerous times, with characters giving digressions to the audience or celebrities explaining some of the banking terms, and while it is a bit weird those breaks are uniformly entertaining and serve as levity for what is, as the film unashamedly points out, a film discussing a topic in which tens of millions of people are completely screwed over. That final point is probably the film's biggest fault; it is blunt, and counts on that humour to mask that bluntness. Given one of the film's themes of using bread and circuses to mask the problem that does become a bit, perhaps intentionally, ironic. That and some odd editing choices where some inocuous sentences are cut off keep this from being perfect. The acting, writing, musical score (which may be my 2nd favorite of the year behind \"Compton\"), and certainly the story do make this well worth the watch.",

Besides, The Wolf of Wall Street does everything this movie does and does it better.The film follows multiple different stories as they all figure out the 2008 recession is going to happen before everyone else. However, when the crash comes, the rulebook gets thrown out the window.The biggest problem is the film can't decide whether or not it wants to be comedic or serious. There are some serious moments, such as Steve Carell and Marisa Tomei discussing Carell's suicidal brother. Yet, there are also some truly funny scenes (90% of Christian Bale's antics). It creates this awkward mash-up and makes the film feel like it's sort of all over the place.Another issue with the film is while it does explain the financial crisis well, it tries to do so in the nudge nudge wink wink, break the fourth wall style The Wolf of Wall Street used. Heck, they even got Margot Robbie to be in it for a scene! The results are a little... mixed.The film's star-studded cast all deliver. If the film has an MVP, it's Christian Bale. His confidence and California attitude (he plays a guy from San Jose) clash so hilariously with the Wall Street climate, that it's a joy watching him be the smartest guy in the room. Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling do a fine job as well.The ending is rather serious, perhaps too serious for a film like this. Still, it has a few moments.",

To have seen it coming would have required a natural insistence on looking for the truth, a touch of nerdiness, and the willingness to refuse to overlook what the whole system had mutually agreed to overlook, so long as doing so would keep the money rolling in. The story is incisive, looking through the eyes of a bare handful of players in the financial markets, who bet big on the immensity of the collective foolishness of a hundred million. As the crisis unfolded, these few seers discovered that what was being exposed went beyond foolishness. Big banks were stealing billions from the public by unloading what they now realized were worthless bonds, face values rigged, huge piles of steaming dung still presented as AAA investments. The cast is well-chosen, and the story so amazing as to leave no temptation for writer or director to exaggerate. The aftermath has been just as amazing and disturbing. No banker complicit in the most colossal mortgage scam in history has gone to jail, and the ensuing financial misery has been blamed on poor people and immigrants.",

    "review": "  Here?s something that won?t shock you: America?s big banks are all kinds of corrupt and full of fraudulent leadership. Here?s something that WILL shock you: the movie about that fact is immensely engaging and hilariously entertaining. Director McKay (Anchorman) has found a way to make the financial sector of American economics one of the most spastically fun films in theaters. Without glossing over the sickening and infuriating lack of justice in these too-big-to-fail organizations, The Big Short makes even its most openly educational moments funny and interesting through noble directorial experimentation and bombastic performances.It?s 2005, and a small band of misfits and outsiders begin predicting what all of us now know to be true: the housing bubble collapse of 2008 and ultimately the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression. Who doesn?t love an underdog, whistleblower tale, especially when their takedown is targeted at corrupt old billionaires and annoying young dude-bros? However, much like this year?s superb Spotlight, we and our protagonists quickly realize that what we?re rooting for is more complex than a simple victory. Full of empathy for all involved, the all-star cast is given room to shine, as the story allows for equal parts ethos, pathos and downright hilarity. Most wonderful is the way it plays with the conceit of the ?true story?. Instead of trying to be too authentic or too Hollywood, it presents each in new and daring ways, never letting its audience get ahead of its story. Did I fully understand the details in the math? Not really. Did it matter? Not at all. Bold and energetic, The Big Short is a numbers movie, but its sum far exceeds its parts.",

It was mostly about mortgage-backed securities and CDOs and how some people saw a collapse of the economy as a result of sub-primed mortgages being packaged with AAA mortgages and sold as bonds. Only in the very end of the movie did they address the bank bailouts after Bears Stearns and Lehman Bros, AIG collapsed.",

At a first glance, it has all the ingredients needed to make a classic: a marvelous cast of talented actors, a well-known director and a timely topic. What could possibly go wrong? Unfortunately, it doesn't come together as impressively as one might expect. Although each of the actors are marvelous from a surprisingly convincing Steve Carell to the energetic Ryan Gosling and the dialogue is witty, it can't make up for the confusing subject that is finance. This movie aims at making finance a little easier to understand, but isn't able to succeed. Ultimately, it's worth watching for the superb acting but not the home-run that critics have made it out to be.",

    "review": "  Before the 2008 economic collapse, four investors correctly predicted the housing market would implode and made bets, called credit default swaps, against the housing market, which would make them incredibly rich. Based on the book by Michael Lewis, writer-director Adam McKay has made a scathing, sophisticated satire on the corruption of American capitalism that is motivated by short-term financial gain resulting in widespread fraud. Christian Bale, Steve Carrell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt are the four investors, who represent the audience's consciousness in expressing dismay then anger as they become more learned about the rampant greed. McKay's cynicism is palpable, but he doesn't get weighed down in didacticism and his daring conclusion that the systemic corruption goes on, is blisteringly accurate. And it never turns into an orgy of recklessness and excess the way Scorsese's \"Wolf of Wall Street\" does. McKay isn't particularly talented visually, but the editing is intelligent and he brilliantly stages scenes with celebrities addressing the audience to educate us with dry wit on the complex financial terminology. Co-written by Charles Randolph. Cinematography by Barry Ackroyd, music by Nicholas Britell, edited by Hank Corwin.",

The subject matter can get a little hard to understand at times but the director does some things to try to help you get the gist. These were actually my favorite moments of the movie. I mean I know I understand something better if Margo Robbie taking bubble bath explains it to me. It is funny at times and very depressing at other times. The subject itself can get a little confusing and at times I found myself bored to death. There is no way I would ever want to watch this movie again. Just not that kind of movie.

God, I loved Christian Bale and Steve Carell in this one!Director Adam McKay certainly managed to provoke some big thoughts and ideas throughout. The movie also managed to remain consistently funny and fresh. It was quick-witted and gave great insight through various forms, such as interesting facts, famous celebs explaining certain things, etc. However, I was somewhat dismayed to find that the second half, much like the film's subject matter, began to go slightly downhill to the point where it almost felt like a separate film. By this time, the film had already made its point, yet it began to drag on for slightly longer than I would've liked. Anyway, I had such a blast during this film!!",

    "review": "  This true story about the economic collapse of 2008 is a mix of drama, comedy, and facts. Directed by Adam McKay who did Anchorman, this is an obvious change of direction. Had this been a straight film, the audience would have gotten lost in all the financial jargon. What McKay does is have characters break the fourth wall and speak to us and explain what is going on. There are even scenes with celebrity cameos who tell us in normal terms what is going on. Some may see this as dumbing things down, but I found it entertaining and it made the film more enjoyable. How else would you make banking and housing entertaining to moviegoers who are not economic majors? Among the four big leads, Steve Carell and Christian Bale steal the show as two men who saw the whole thing coming, only to have everyone laugh in their face. Ryan Gosling is also good and Brad Pitt impresses in his small role. Comedy aside, the film acts as a cautionary tale and a look into the greed of the banks and those high up who think they are invincible. Grade: A-",

It should also focus your attention on the need to end Too Big to Fail. It should remind everyone that after the crash in 2007 and 2008, NOTHING CHANGED. The people responsible for the crash got bonuses paid with tax dollars borrowed from future workers of America. After watching the movie, read the book. Then as a candidate how they intend to unwind TBTF in the next two years.",

Surprisingly, I was able to follow this film with ease. \"The Big Short\" follows groups of people as the statistics of the housing market, leading up to the crash in 2008, are uncovered. The major thing you have to accept in order to enjoy this film, is definitely it's editing style. The shaky camera and quick edits represent the raw feel of the story at hand, and I thought that was fantastic. A terrific screenplay, a stellar cast, and great direction by Adam McKay all make this a film worth watching. It deserves every bit of praise it is getting, even though it's snail pace can become tiring at times. I had a blast watching this movie, as I was able to see all of the behind-the-scenes facts that I did not know about. In the end, if you have patience, this is a terrific film, but that is a necessity to watch this film. \"The Big Short\" is powerful for what it sets out to say, and nothing more. To me, it is incredibly crafted, but it certainly is not for everyone. Great film!",

The film was very dense with the content. the kind of movie where it didnt matter if you understood the specifics because they were going to spell it out for you and let you know if it was simply good or bad. to offset the density, they had to have the celebrity cameo explanation, they had to break the fourth wall, narrate, they had to have all sorts of crazy cuts and images and sound mixing. christian bale was fantastic. as was steve carrell. there was a really appropriate amount of heart in the film. never felt forced, even though it really wasnt at the center of the story. bales loss of his eye. carrells brother. the south florida guy who lost his home. max greenfield having to get a new job. steve carells ruthless idealism. the two young guys not wanting to capitalize off of unemployed people. it did at times feel like an episode of the office with the way it was filmed, and some of comedy, (and seeing steve carells face). I also think the general tone of the film had a couple moments where i didnt know what to make of it. like it coudlnt find its footing. but it maybe thats just because the film was pretty stylized and it didnt do a great job of introducing me and easing me into the films style... because after a while i stopped feeling that and i got the world.",

'Margin Call' focussed on a narrow window of the financial market, playing it small while not dumbing down any of the lingo to pander to a bigger audience. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' made sure not to put too much focus on the financial fraud but chose to zoom in on one of its most prolific and extravagant characters.And that's what 'The Big Short' misses: focus. It tries to cover so much ground and packs in an abundance of information, most of which just makes a whooshing sound as it flies over your head.There's focus lacking in every aspect of this movie. Director Adam McKay (of 'Anchorman' uh, infamy) obviously had grand ambitions and hired an editor on crack ... but it didn't pay off. We get that it's supposed to rhyme the crazy and hectic world of Wall Street ... it's just ... not right.Why still three stars then? Because when it does work, it works miracles. The fourth wall is broken and to good effect. The few intimate moments the film does poses seem to linger and every actor on screen is phenomenally on point.So, we can applaud 'The Big Short' for its ambitions at least. Even if it misses the mark a little more than it should.",

    "review": "  I do not grasp what Hedge Fund Managers do, or what Collateralized Debt Obligations (CODs), Credit Default Swaps, Mortgage Backed Securities (MPS) and subprime mortgages are, and what it means to \"short\" something, but director Adam McCay's THE BIG SHORT based on Michael Lewis' book is an excellent film - both comedic and forcefully tragic with many fine actors making this a movie that is both entertaining and deceptively poignant. Surprisingly we do get to understand a lot of what was going on in the fiscal system without having to take a course in the particulars. This is accomplished through visuals - quick flashes of TV shows, cinema and pop stars, artworks, news headlines, sports figures, etc. all subliminally flashing before our eyes embedding the culture of money into our psyches. Throughout the film, there are witty respites whereby the camera exits the narrative, and various actors in wildly strange settings explain Wall Street jargon with idiosyncratic humor to make the \"wheeling and dealing\" more comprehensible.  I left the theater with an abysmal feeling of sadness, my voice cracking and tears in my eyes - not wanting to betray my emotions and my fierce anger at a capitalist system gone completely awry; rigged and fraudulent in handing the money of everyday working people whose pensions, domiciles, and livelihoods were placed into the hands of manipulative, raptor-like greedy banks and money managers. Billions - not millions - of dollars are just abstract numbers to be gambled with as the \"party\" keeps blasting upwards and onwards, monetary gains piling up, until it all implodes with aftershocks eventually destroying the income, employment and shuttering the homes of millions in the US and globally.Many of the main characters are based on real people who worked for Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns among other firms. Christian Bale is terrific as Dr. Michael Burry, a Cassandra-like figure, an eccentric - characterized by walking around barefooted - who foresaw the mortgage collapse early on, watching banks bundle mortgages which were being given AAA ratings by Moody's and Standard and Poor's without proper examination of the underlying financial integrity of the lenders and borrowers. Burry decides to \"short\" - to bet on a future housing crisis debacle and is ultimately proven correct.Steve Carrell portrays Mark Baum, an irascible individual, who was one of the few conscience stricken players in the \"money game\", trying to make participants aware of the looming future cataclysm, but also wrestling with his own hypocrisy in personally profiting from the 2008 world economic bankruptcy. He is an anguished \"truth teller\" antithetical to most characters engaging in this closed world of financial gains and losses, whose egos get propped up by the insubstantial glint of wealth.The director McCay includes every type of trader - from self-centered, sophomoric \"masters of the universe\" to those with some integrity and concern for their clients. The editing is quick and incredibly entertaining for a subject that could easily put many of us to sleep. In THE BIG SHORT we are made painfully aware of the collusion of institutions and governmental agencies, all profiting from the deception that the housing market was one of the best and most secure investments to be made. We see the social and human ramifications of this delusion that brought world markets to the brink of financial collapse. Unlike previous films about Wall Street, this is a true story - a tale that is still resonating in our minds and pocketbooks. Many ordinary persons were encouraged and seduced by the easy access to home ownership, low interest rates that often skyrocketed a few years later to the bewilderment of landlords and tenants who had to flee their properties. This drama showed how the Banks were \"brought down\", but today we are still wondering were they ever punished? Cynicism persists as new ploys and risky gambits continue to be placed before a gullible public by corruptible institutions functioning without legislated safeguards.THE BIG SHORT is a powerful indictment of Wall Street engineering of avarice - profiting the few and afflicting the lifestyles of the majority of Americans that they are called upon to serve.",

With a focus on a colorful, but mostly unconnected group of financial industry outliers who came to understand that the housing bubble simply couldn't be sustained, and bet against the world economy is what is by far the biggest \"short\" bet in history. Christian Bale's Palo Alto fund manager, an Asperger-fueled, flipflop-wearing weirdo, is the first to figure it out, and others follow. Bales performance is revelatory, he continues to simply kill with every new challenge he takes. The rest of the cast, led by a sympathetic Steve Carrell, is also good, but for my money, this is Bale's Oscar nom to lose. I'm slightly unimpressed by McKay's attempt to explain complicated financial chicanery by breaking the third wall, a la Marshall McLuhan in Annie Hall, mainly because he does it often and with decreasing affect. But otherwise, this is a roaring good tale, well told.",

    "review": "  Because of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-2009... \"The U.S. entered a deep recession, with nearly 9 million jobs lost during 2008 and 2009... U.S. housing prices fell nearly 30% on average and the U.S. stock market fell approximately 50% by early 2009... The stock market recovered to its pre-crisis peak but housing prices remained near their low point and unemployment remained elevated.\" That was Wikipedia, not me. When I research the historical background of a movie based on a true story, I look at multiple sources, gain a working knowledge of the topic, summarize that knowledge early in my review and use what I've learned to help me write the rest of the review and evaluate the film. Not this time. I'm no financial expert. The best I can do is pick out what seems to be the most appropriate quote that I ran across in my research and encourage other people who, like me, have very limited financial knowledge to study up a bit before seeing \"The Big Short\" (R, 2:10). Much of that first paragraph talks about the results of the Great Recession, but this story is about the few who saw it coming and profited from that knowledge. The central character is Michael Burry (Christian Bale), an ex-neurologist who became a savant-like hedge fund manager. Looking where he says no one else was willing to look, he came to the conclusion that the housing boom of the early 2000s was actually a housing bubble that was getting ready to burst. He became convinced that the large amount of subprime and adjustable rate mortgages would cause a collapse in the housing market in the second quarter of 2007 and he bet that he was right. Burry used his personal investment capital, and that of his fund's investors, to buy credit swaps from the big banks. This basically amounted to an insurance policy against bundled mortgage funds which would only pay off if the market collapsed. Reasoning that the housing market was \"rock solid\" and that people always pay their mortgages, financial managers were more than happy to take his money - and laugh all the way to their banks.The problem for those banks - and homeowners across the country - was that Burry was right, although only a small number of people realized it at the time. Burry had to weather severe storms of investor discontent in an effort to hold the credit swaps long enough to profit. As Burry shopped his idea around town, what he was doing became public knowledge. Most people were as perplexed and/or amused that Burry was shorting the housing market as those bankers who sold him those credit swaps, but some were intrigued enough to look into the situation for themselves. Among them was fund manager Mark Baum (played by Steve Carell and based on real-life fund manager Steve Eisman). \"Mark\" set his team at FrontPoint Partners LLC (a unit of Morgan Stanley) to digging deep into the housing market - on paper and in person, so they could decide how to proceed. This puts them in business with investor Jared Vennett (played by Ryan Gosling and based on real-life investor Greg Lippmann), a man whose honesty is brought into question more than once during the movie. Two others who catch wind of Burry's scheme are talented and hungry young fund managers Jamie Shipley (based on Jamie Mai and played by Finn Wittrock) and Charlie Geller (based on Charlie Ledley and played by John Magaro) who bring in retired banker Ben Rickert (based on Ben Hockett and played by Brad Pitt) to help them navigate these treacherous financial waters. In short, \"The Big Short\" is about the people who arrived at the same conclusion about the weak U.S. housing market, what else they learned and what they did about it.This film does as well as could be expected in making its subject matter understandable and compelling and may even be said to exceed expectations. Directed and co-written by comedy writer/director Adam McKay (who only got the job after agreeing to do the second \"Anchorman\" movie) and based on Michael Lewis' 2010 book, \"The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine\", this film simplifies and explains things fairly well without dumbing down its subject matter or sacrificing the points it wants to make. Sometimes McKay's actors break \"the fourth wall\" and talk directly to the camera, while other times celebrities like Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdain show up to take us through object lessons of complex concepts. For the most part, it works. Strong acting from several previous Oscar winners and/or nominees also helps make the plot understandable and lends gravitas to the story. Handicapping the film's entertainment value, there are no heroes in this movie, which boils down to greedy people profiting from other greedy people who took advantage of unwise people. However, the film brings to a mass audience important lessons that we all need to understand on some level. \"The Big Short\" gets credit for that and for very nearly overcoming its topic's very high degree of difficulty. \"B+\"",

    "review": "  Nothing Small about \"The Big Short\"\"The Big Short\" is based on the book with the same name by financial journalist Michael Lewis. It is about collateralized debt obligations, subprime mortgages, credit default swaps and bundling. A snoozer right? Not one bit. \"The Big Short\" is more entertaining than most films in the cineplex this holiday season. Even if you don't know much about the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-08, you will recognize a quality film and want to know more about the world economic collapse when the film is over. The film uses a multitude of techniques to tell the story. There are fourth-wall breaking monologues, a model in a bubble bath explaining economics as well as a singing idol and a celebrity chef using metaphors of cooking and gambling to explain the economic crisis. There are jump cuts, slow motion, foreshadowing and flash backs. The filmmakers use any and all tricks to explain a complicated mess of financial chicanery in order to help the audience understand. The banks, mortgage brokers, the credit ratings agencies and the government manipulated people in the nation and world into investing in worthless packages of bonds, and it behooves the director and writer, Adam McKay, to use all cinematic tricks to explain and untangle the financial corruption. The miracle is that the film deciphers the economic melt-down well while entertaining its audience. The acting is stellar from the stars to the bit players. They aren't just playing a role, they embody characters during a remarkable time in history. My mother thinks Steve Carrell was the best actor in the film, for she did not even recognize him at first. He plays against character and she liked that. However, my mother had never seen Carrell in \"The Office.\" His character, Mark Baum, is much like the boss from that television series. However, in \"The Big Short\", he plays it straight. He is a boss of a fund under the umbrella of Morgan Stanley (but it's not Morgan Stanley, and his team likes to point out), and he is on a mission to bring down banks, to show them up, and to prove he's been right about the financial warning signs. He is betting against the hand that feeds him, Morgan Stanley.I preferred Christian Bale's performance as Michael Burry, an unselfconscious, manic math genius. I haven't seen that frightening look in Bale's eyes since \"American Psycho\", but this time he's only killing the mortgage backed securities market. Meanwhile, Brad Pitt, under-playing another disaffected former banker, Brad Rickert, helps two friends make millions while they bet against terrible investments, or \"play short\" the mortgage market. His backstory is revealed steadily and in a way that makes us wonder why he briefly got back into the investment \"game.\" Even Ryan Gosling makes his mark in this star-studded cast playing the prescient \"Jared Vennett.\" Remember, all the characters in the film are based on real people. And that is what makes it so remarkable. The other major players in the film are Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley, and a slew of investment houses who at best ignore the coming financial crisis or at worst, colluded in its creation. From the realtors selling the mortgages, to the banks loaning at subprime, to the banks bundling the worthless packages, they were all making too much money to want to stop. This is exactly the kind of over-exuberance that occurred in the 1920s stock market crash, but few payed attention then or in 2007. \"The Big Short\" is a dramatized film of true events. And to make sure we understand, the actors break the fourth wall several times to tell us what part is true to the detail and what part is fictionalized to make it more dramatic. But if you are still incredulous, read the book. The events are all sadly true, and we are still paying for it. Rating: Pay full price (but you might want to see it twice.) It will take at least two viewings to catch half of what is embedded in this film. This film is entertaining, educational and relevant. Peace,Tex Shelters",

    "review": "  The Big Short offers probably the most in-depth perspective behind the 2008 crisis that left so many jobless, homeless, or with depleted retirement accounts. It is praise worthy for explaining the insanely complex financial and banking jargon that keeps the average citizen in the dark about what really went on behind the scenes.I enjoy movies based on the financial crisis and was enthused about seeing this one. I was slightly disappointed with the movie, but found it overall to be a good movie that explains a complex and tragic time during our nations history. I would have given the movie a stellar review if not for the painfully slow beginning that may have some audience members a little bored or fidgety for the first 20 minutes or so. Have patience watching this movie, once you get past the slow start the movie is an enjoyable and insightful film that will have you incensed by all the chicanery that took place by the rich and powerful in the banking industry. I recommend seeing the movie, but preface that with warning that the movie begins excruciatingly slowly.",

    "review": "  The challenge for me walking into a movie with a script based off a true story is to decide whether or not I have been convinced to a certain level that what I saw was at least truthful to the source material. It makes it even more of a challenge for me to go into a movie blind without having a firm grasp on the source material. What's great about The Big Short, is director Adam McKay acknowledges that I am probably one of many thousands of people who in truth never understood exactly what the housing collapse of 2008 meant to the world. I'd say after just over two hours, not only was I intrigued by the tale and recount of one of the darkest times in American economic history, I was also a bit scared.What we get here are essentially four different approaches to how a few bright and/or hungry minds figured out how to take advantage of the mortgage housing collapse of 2008. We start with Christian Bale's somewhat chaotic character first before moving onto Steve Carell's and Brad Pitt's as we are strung along by the narration of Ryan Gosling. I'm not entirely sure why Gosling was chosen as the narrator, or if one was really needed, but because of it we get some really funny segments when it comes to explaining the complicated concepts of the banks doing what they did.While the acting was pretty solid from this ensemble, unfortunately, it was a little disappointing we didn't get to see more of them interact with each other. The trailer led me to believe this was a group effort to bring to light what the banks were doing, but instead it was more like four individual crusades. You can't really say there were any good guys. There were certainly bad guys.I think what separates this film from being just another ho-hum look at a bad period in American history comes from director McKay. Usually we associate him with comedies like Anchorman. So what we get with The Big Short is actually a movie teetering on the edge of black comedy and drama, though you can certainly feel the disdain of the director for what happened through the dialogue and quick cuts as some real-life stuff is spliced into the film.So while we get four very interesting stories of how these group of bright guys figured out the doom and gloom settling upon us in 2008, the lack of cohesion among our main actors sort of left me wanting a bigger sense of payoff in the end. Not to say it was tough to keep track of, but there was a bit of jumping around. But as I said in the beginning, the attention to detail is staggering and you can't help but feel rotten inside to know something like this was allowed to happen. Surely it can't again. We don't need another one of these well-done movies in the future.",

    "review": "  The Big Short is a perfect movie that I'll never recommend to anybody. It covers the 2008 banking collapse in a most unique way. I study current events (when I'm not in school) and kept up with most of this, but The Big Short was able to add even more pieces to the puzzle for me. I laughed through most of it because of the ignorance of people: the public, the government, the banking industry. But at the end it was one of the saddest movies I've seen because of how true it was. It was amazing that a movie could make me laugh through it then leave so sad and upset at the same time.The Big Short has one of the biggest casts you'll see in a movie outside of an Avengers show (although the actors in The Big Short are much better). The story is solid and entertaining. I was pulled into The Big Short quickly and remained interested in every moment of it. I couldn't have told you whether or not I had to pee through it. At the end I did. Pretty bad. Not a moment is wasted. There is an educational aspect to of it where most will be lost or disinterested, and that's why I wouldn't recommend it. If the movie went on without explaining what was going on I would have left the movie having to explain just about the whole thing. The things they were talking about during the movie were broken down so well that I had no questions to answer. It was amazing. I don't know who I'd say had to go see The Big Short. My friends who like great movies or the intelligent ones. I'd say everyone needed to see it, but I'm afraid most people wouldn't like or appreciate it the same way I do.",

The directing by Adam McKay and screenplay by Michael Lewis, Charles Randolph and co-written also by Adam McKay is fine. The cinematography is okay. The score is fine and the effects are okay. \"I have to report that \"The Big Short\" I personally found this movie an interesting true story about the events that occur in today's history.\"",

    "review": "  There's been many films made about the disastrous financial crash of the late 2000s and \"The Big Short\" may be the best and scathing yet.Adam McKay expertly blends comedy and drama and delivers one of the scariest movies of the year. A tale of human greed, made even scarier by the fact that it was all true, is compelling and quite infuriating. \"The Big Short\" boasts an impressive cast and they all deliver. Christian Bale and Steve Carell have the showier roles and they revel in them. Brad Pitt is understated yet strong, Gosling is appropriately smarmy. The performance are important to emphasize as without them \"The Big Short\" would have had a tough time working.The film is definitely politically planted to the left and while that helps with the tone of exasperation it needs, it diminishes the impact the film needs to fully reach all of its audience. The film does sheepishly skirt the fact that our protagonists ultimately benefited from this disaster - and despite the admiration they deserve for spotting a big problem - all they did was make money from it and did not attempt to actively change it. By exposing that raw truth, \"The Big Short\" could have been scarier.With that said, it is still an incredible film and one of the best of the year. It's a film to be watched by all despite the fact that at the end of the day - it didn't change things one bit.",

The best weapon to use against such fucked up corruption is knowledge.The Big Short is a very well done movie that conveys this message. It was smart in using actors and celebrities we love to tell it's simple truth: The bad guys will always win as long as the majority keep their heads buried in the sand. There were no heroes in this film, just clear winners and losers.The Big Short is an entertaining ride I would recommend to anyone and everyone who plans on owning anything in this world.",

    "review": "  Entertaining & powerful adaptation of Michael Lewis's book that, mostly, does a good job explaining the 2008 housing crisis while throwing in some laughs. The cast is uniformly excellent, with Steve Carrel continuing to show his dramatic chops as Mark Baum while Ryan Gosling is smarmy perfection as Jared Vennett. The standout, though, is Christian Bale, who pulls another disappearing act as Michael Burry, capturing all his eccentricities Lewis detailed in his book, portraying a man who managed to tick off his investors even when he was making them millions. Behind the camera, Adam McCay superbly adapts Lewis's book and even does a better job explaining how the crisis happen with some hilarious guest celebrity clips. The film is also laugh at loud funny, as the characters & situations are so outrageous you don't have much other choice. It does share the main flaw of the book, though, in not pointing out the role the federal government had promoting subprime mortgages (the root of the crash) through Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac. It does rightly criticize the bailout as just rewarding the big banks bad behavior right when the free market was about to justly punish them for it. Overall, one of the funniest & smartest movies of the year, and a nice primer for anyone curious about the 2008 financial crisis.",

I'm curious how much of the emotional part of the story was real, because Steve Carell really sold it. It was great seeing the back and forth from him and Ryan Gosling again. Those two crack me up! Also this is a big step for director Adam McKay as this is his first film that isn't a straight up comedy. It was told at times with a documentary style and the breaking of the fourth wall. I'm still processing the wealth of information that was thrown at me throughout the film. It definitely makes me want to read the book to understand all of the details.",

Clever creative devices used throughout dumb it all down for those of us who need it explained (and that's pretty much all of us). The fraud (at so many levels) is mind blowing and not surprising at the same time. So far, my favorite movie I've seen this year. I got a pit in my stomach as I watched everything unfold because we all know how it came down. But still, best movie I'd seen in some time.",

    "review": "  Going into this movie, I was very skeptical. I was a fan of the book, which I remember little about because I read it when it came out a few years back. The book, as I remember it, dealt with very real investment bankers, CEO's and hedge fund executives, and had a very concise plot. There was one man who, gaining a job on Wall Street, quickly learned what a CDO was and how people were getting fucked over by it. It includes a lot of investment bankers who are identified very specifically by their name and the financial institution they represent. The plot unraveled as the main character talked to these very real people in very real locations about very serious business. The book goes into their backstories, how they got into the business, and what they were doing at the time during events between 2000 and 2008. At the time I thought this book, would make a great tense Wall Street thriller about investment bankers and power brokers. I knew that there was something that smelt fishy about this stew. The smell, as it turns out is poor editing, poor plot design, and poor writing.What we got however, was a quasi-documentary/comedy/drama hybrid which was poorly written, edited, and executed. The 'bad guys' in the movie are generic wall street bankers from xyz corporation. You never really get a sense for who these guys are. Instead the movie focuses on a half dozen 'odd balls' trying to explain complicated financial terms and oh yeah, a little bit of plot. This book has a great theme, its plot is deep and filled with intrigue, and there are very interesting characters with deep plots and backstories, but the plot that the viewer sees is a film is drowned out by its stereotyping, poor design choices, and shitty execution.First off, the movie suffers from attention deficit disorder, switching between all of the books sub characters, turning them into cartoon characters with an agenda. Steve Carrel is pitted as an overly anxious and eccentric hedge fund manager, Michael Burry (Christian Bale) is an ex establishment born again hippy, and Ryan Gosling, is well he is Ryan Gosling. The plot jumps between these characters every few minutes for the first 45 minutes of this film leaving the viewer to figure out what the hell they are watching. There is no effort given to fleshing out the characters stories, because there are literally a half dozen of them and the movie spends equal time on each character, which dilutes the plot. If you were expecting something like The boiler Room, this isn't your movie. I didn't feel at any point during this film that I cared about the characters and their little under developed back stories.The script does a poor job of fleshing out the characters properly. For instance Steve Carrel's character is dealing with the suicide death of his brother; however we never learn anything beyond that he jumped off a building. The scene where he is talking to his wife over the loss doesn't fit well with the rest of the goofy film. This is in part because, they tried to cram that heavy emotional plot element in between Salina Gomez explaining synthetic credit default swaps and Anthony Bourdon likening cooking a left over seafood stew to subprime mortgage derivatives. I was left questioning whether or not the film was trying to be serious or not. There were times in the movie where the actors would literally look at the camera, break the fourth wall to deliver a monolog. The whole movie is bazar to say the least.The movie continually insults the viewer's intelligence. Instead of getting an edgy corporate thriller filled with power, passion, money, sex, and women, we get a goofy quasi documentary about power, money, and strippers. This film is filled with stereotypical flat main characters that don't put a ton of effort in how they present their message. There are times in the movie where you can see Ryan Golsing's brain exploding as he tries to explain what a mortgage backed security is. All the characters, lack the intensity required to pull the story forward. Although the plot picks up in the second half of the film, it continues to waiver from the beaten path as it tries to give all the hot shot actors equal face time. Usually, I don't have to talk about editing or sound design when I talk about a major motion film. However in this case I will, being how poorly the movie was executed on a technical level. There are times for example, when Christian bale is in his office jamming out to his rock and roll music, and the music is very overly loud. It is in fact so loud that it literally drowns the plot. There are countless other examples of sound balance issues that it would be silly to name them all here, but trust me, they are in there and they are distracting to the movie. Sound balance is something that should never be mentioned in a major film, and shows a lack of care put into presenting the movie goer with a finished product.The last thing I have to point out is the presentation of the plot is littered with un-necessary interruptions, like one minor character whose only line in the movie is a monologue explaining that he does in fact speak English, regardless of what his boss said. To that I say, why? Was this relevant to the plot? Did I learn something that I didn't know before? Is this even necessary? I just shook my head in embarrassment as I hid behind my popcorn bag. There is no reason why a character should break the fourth wall in the middle of an important piece to tell the viewer \"that is not what actually happened, in fact I discovered this important information by...\" This happens a lot! Also, Salina Gomez has no business explaining complicated financial terms like synthetic credit default swaps. It is shocking, it pulls you out of the scene, it insults your intelligence as a human being, and it lends to a style that feels like a cheap, internet meme that pummels you with its message and has no substance, a weak plot, and no style. I was really hoping for an edgy Wall Street thriller, but I got this!All of these inadequacies try their hardest to mask Michael Lewis, who wrote a brilliant book about a guy being corrupted by Wall Street; however the film fails to trump the original author. The themes presented in this film are very strong and the message is well received. Wall Street is bad, big banks are bad, Goldman Sacs is a greedy no good bank that needs to be destroyed but isn't because the establishment. I understand movie, we get it, but did you make a good movie about it. NO YOU DIDN'T. It does the job of getting the point across that Wall Street is filled with greed and corruption and irresponsibility, but it does it in an obnoxious way that doesn't pay tribute to the original book. I'm very surprised how poorly this movie was put together, considering how Lewis's other adaptations, Money Ball, and the Blind Side were brilliant movies. This third film falls short due to a blight of too many big names, a poorly written plot, and uninteresting characters. For those reasons I'm downgrading the ratting on this movie from AAA to a BBB. Take that establishment default backed Rotten Tomatoes reviewers!",

    "review": "  A scathing indictment, a penetrating character study, a political satire, and alternatively a funny yet serious drama, The Big Short is 2015?s most unique film. Based on the book by the same name, the film follows a group of cynical, shrewd, and opportunistic fund managers and Wall Street brokers as they uncover what will soon become the worldwide economic collapse of 07/08. It?s a film that both explores, explains, and revels in the absurdity that lead to the mortgage collapse- condensing a incredibly complicated financial instruments in to a human drama that sifts through all the bravo sierra to the heart of the matter?fraud and greed.Director Adam McKay takes a pretty stark career turn with Big Short, a film with a profoundly serious subject, yet one that McKay manages to find humor in. It?s entertaining, thought-provoking, and yet relentlessly brutal in its pursuit of the truth. The film?s cast is nothing short of exceptional, featuring an ensemble including Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, and Ryan Gosling. All bring a unique style to the film and inhibit their roles, with an especially impressive showing from both Bale and Carell, enough to garner some award buzz to be sure. The film?s pace is solid, and McKay does a great job interweaving the different subplots to create one over-arching storyline that is secondary to what we all know is about to happen. The film?s moral outrage is palpable, yet justified, a bit preachy, but not singular in its blame. What keeps it anchored is a very intelligent script filled with rich dialogue, smart humor, and attention to detail which refuses to oversimplify what occurred.For some, the film?s eccentricities can be a bit much. It breaks the fourth wall often, which is unsettling at first, and often employs devices such as on-screen definitions, supplied with randomly assorted celebrity break-ins to explain some financial instrument. This contributes to the film?s uniqueness, yet also can result in a disjointed feel from the overall narrative. All in all, McKay?s indulgences as a director pay off more than they don?t, yet there is some inconsistency. The tone is a bit hard to decipher, a comedy in one sense and a drama in the other, yet McKay navigates this by finding dark, cynical, and authentic humor. Simply put, it fits, the cast seems to be thinking??if I didn?t laugh, I?d cry? and we get that.A must see. 4.5/5 Stars",

    "review": "  In what is probably 2015 best ensemble piece alongside Spotlight, The Big Short also turns out to be one of the best films of the year. Focusing on the 2008 financial crisis, The Big Short takes a different approach to the crisis than the 2011 film, Margin Call, in that this deals with 4 very different people in their route to take down the banks when they predicted the downfall a few years prior.First and foremost, the cast is phenomenal. Sure, you have Brad Pitt being Brad Pitt, Christian Bale being unrecognizably good, Ryan Gosling bringing humor and charm, and Steve Carell nearly stealing the entire film, but the supporting cast also deliver formidable performances all around. Everyone from Melissa Leo, Karen Gillian, and Max Greenfield, all the way to the great cameos that help serve the story, do a phenomenal job. They aren't just throwaway cameos either, Adam McKay uses them is a uniquely comedic way. Being that this story involves big financial terms and phrases that may be confusing and boring to some (the film acknowledges that), the film takes a break and explains to us what's happening using a celebrity in dummy form.This film is a drama by definition, but there's a large comedic presence to the film that balances it out really well. I guess I shouldn't be surprised considering McKay's previous directorial efforts, but it was still refreshing to see, especially in an Oscar bait type of film.If nothing else, these types of films are a wake up call to ensure this doesn't happen again. I knew a little bit about the crisis beforehand, and while this film didn't make my jaw drop in terms of new information, I did leave the theater knowing a lot more than I did prior. I'm sure it will get plenty of Oscar attention with hopeful nominations to Bale, Carell, and McKay. Definitely check out The Big Short+Tremendous cast+McKay's writing and directing drove the film+Self aware+Balance of comedy and drama9.2/10",

    "review": "  Based on the book by Michael Lewis, this Adam McKay (Anchorman films, The Other Guys) directed film focuses on the build-up of the housing and credit bubble during the 2000s. It details some of the main people who were directly responsible for said build-up, those who knew that the bubble was eventually going to burst and ultimately profited from the financial crisis of 2007-2010. The film also highlights those who experienced the biggest losses from the market crash, as well as the unique personalities and actions of those closest to the crisis. For director Adam McKay, who many audiences can associate with comedies such as \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,\" \"Step Brothers\" , 'The Other Guys\", and \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,\" this is his first major film that doesn't use Will Ferrell as the lead actor, and it features way more dramatic material than his other films. There is still a level of humor present, but it has less jokes and more dry humor or smart or sarcastic comebacks and amusing ways of saying something. The film's narrative is driven by four cynical, fringe Wall Street entities disgusted with the large banking institutions' overriding greed for profits. They make the decision to capitalize on the ensuing housing market calamity and the financial meltdown of 2008 upon discovering the market frenzy is being driven by worthless collateral debt obligations. McKay chooses to inject a significant dose of humor in the early scenes to condition the audience receptors for what they are about to experience. Utilizing the Martin Scorsese docudrama style in a similar setting with \"Wolf of Wall Street,\" a strong narrative voice dominates particular moments. Several of these deliberately break the 'Fourth Wall\" in the style of \"Wolfie,\" Jordan Belfort, as the characters, including a hilarious cameo by Selena Gomez, speak directly into the camera to explain the complexities of Wall Street finance. The overall effect adds additional humor and adds another layer in creating a sense of authenticity and truth about the film's subject matter. After a rather lengthy dizzying, yet delightful, character introduction, the film picks up pace as the drama begins to unfold. The story follows Scion Capital founder Michael Burry (Christian Bale), several years before the 2008 housing market crash, who notices the subprime mortgage vulnerabilities and seizes the opportunity to invest. Purchasing large quantities of credit default swaps from numerous major banks, his unorthodox activities attract the attention of trader Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), who in turn convinces FrontPoint Partners hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) to buy into the scheme. Also weaved into the narrative are Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) and Charlie Geller (John Magaro), two small-time \"garage band\" investors who desperately want a seat next to the big boys, but can't get past the lobby. They find an abandoned prospectus about the big short (the film uses more technical terms, but I won't encumber this review with them) on a coffee table, and Wittrock turns to the camera and says that didn't really happen, that the real-life Shipley and Geller actually read about the short in a magazine. They call an old friend, retired investor Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), to help them out; Ben is a paranoiac and a germophobe who loathed his time on Wall Street, but was obviously made comfortably rich by it, and now can't resist a sure thing. Despite extreme criticism from colleagues and severe skepticism from clients, the obstinate few that forged ahead and bet against the economy wound up making billions while the rest of the world lost trillions. Taking a cue from \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" in which reprehensible swindlers profit at the expense of clueless clients in a markedly flamboyant style, the film hopes to lure audiences with its own brand of high spirits. But all of the editing gimmicks grow tiresome quickly, revealing the flimsiness of the story and the disagreeableness of the characters. Breaking the fourth wall, varyingly paced montages, slow-motion, on-screen graphics, unusual narration, and Margot Robbie in a bubble bath are but a few of the jazzy distractions aimed at spicing up an inherently boring subject: the 2008 U.S. financial crisis. If the facts of the situation weren't so fascinating (and there are several details presented here as facts that are actually complete lies), the theatrics would be almost entirely wasted. There is humanity in this movie: Baum rages; Vennett seethes; Burry sweats; Shipley, Geller and Rickert wrangle their guilt. They're at a moral precipice as the economy teeters on the brink of catastrophe. Their families are mostly off-screen, concerned voices or smiling faces in photos. Baum's wife (Marisa Tomei) tries to engage something in him beyond numbness and anger. Those are familiar feelings to the audience - numbness from the complexity of the swindles and manipulations, anger at the inevitability past the first inevitability, a two-syllable word that even a riotously funny Ryan Gosling;s character can't speak without going too far beyond comedy: bailout. McKay's approach here is \"throw everything in, including the kitchen sink\" and that creates an energetic, brilliantly matched representation of the subject matter. This does not mean he is lacking control, however. The story being told includes so many facets and characters that it easily could have fallen into disarray, but McKay makes every single character memorable and illuminates every piece of jargon that could be confusing from the outset. It's a huge accomplishment and a far more important one than might seem apparent. The things that were allowed to happen in the realms of business, finance, and banking are absolutely insane and unbelievable. It has to be largely comedic because there's no other way of delivering this vast amount of information and complete failure of our entire society and make it all snap into place so continuously, without being ripped apart by the overwhelming darkness of it all. This isn't simply circumstantial and theoretical and mysterious to a degree, as in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\", but the cold hard truth. Aside from Bale, Carell, Gosling, and Pitt, there is a top-notch ensemble of quality actors present in the film. Some of these include Melissa Leo, Hamish Linklater, Jeremy Strong, Marisa Tomei, John Magaro, and a variety of odd cameos, such as Selena Gomez, Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain, Max Greenfield, and Karen Gillan. Bale and Carell steal the show, but most everyone plays their part well. Christian Bale goes all out as Dr. Michael Burry, a physician who runs an investment fund. Burry (the only person who allowed his real name to be used) worked in shorts and bare feet, blasted heavy metal, and had no social skills. He found out the housing market was nothing but a shell game by digging into the numbers and couldn't get anyone in government to listen. Steve Carell, with technically the most screen time, has the best scenes of the film, which he completely utilizes in his favor. Ryan Gosling, Finn Wittrock & John Magaro excel, while Brad Pitt is likable in a small role. The ladies - Marisa Tomei & Karen Gillian don't have much to do. On the whole, 'The Big Short' is a highly entertaining, extremely smart, informative, all around well-acted, very amusing, and one of the most unique and best films I've seen this year.",

    "review": "  **** GoodPlease don't shortchange me in a big way if I invest in a wealth of puns on my review of the financial dark comedy \"The Big Short\". Writer-Director Adam McKay focuses on a number of financial outcast wizards that via circumstance and research predicted the housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000's. The film was enriched with eccentric characters which gave the film a big bonus; but it was the performances that made its stock rise. Most notably, the great Christian Bale as Dr. Michael Burry, a rebellious glass-eyed financier who noticed the first inkling of the collapse. I hope the Academy does not Bale out Christian in the Best Supporting Actor category. Other fine thespian turns derived from Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and a very brief but whopping performance from Melissa Leo. McKay's direction and script (which he co-wrote with Charles Randolph) is on the epitome of financially complex terminology & comprehension; so it would not be a bad idea to take your personal CFO when heading out to view \"The Big Short\"; and yes, multiple viewings is a good idea for further numerical knowledge; and you can take that to the bank! Nevertheless, \"The Big Short\" is a fun movie with some very creative bits that you should definitely invest in watching.",

    "review": "  The Big Short reveals a sometimes mind-boggling complex story of finance and big business. The interlocking stories revolve around the one simple ideal that the housing bubble of the United States is propped up on fraudulent claims and horrid business deals, all of which is going to start to come crashing down in one fateful year: 2007. The film interweaves comedy and fourth-wall-breaking narration with a truthful understanding of the problems it tries to relate about a confusing and disastrous time for the American economy. It becomes evident very quickly how much information is wrapped up in the scheme and how much the movie wants to translate it to the laymen of money-making. The small group of characters all begin waking up to the realization that the American are signing their own death warrants and can't take the time to stop and think that this could be true. Our \"heroes\" decide to separately do what any like-minded, enterprising individual would do if they knew the date of the end of the world and everyone thought they were crazy: they short, or bet against it, which in this case means literally betting that the American economy itself will collapse. The fact that such a rather heartless experiment is based on check and re-checked facts broken down to a science almost is frightening and a hard slap to the reality of The Big Short's message of arrogance, stupidity and the themes of moral ambiguity. Christian Bale starts the dominos falling as Michael Burry, a no-shoed, heavy metal-listening, drum-playing MD with a glass eye, no social skills and a gift for numbers. He discovers the bubble bursting two years ahead in 2005 along with the next contender, Ryan Gosling's slimy, suave and harsh-reality-believing banker Jared Vennett. Vennett approaches our runner up to the final man, Steve Carell's morally confused, brash, loud-mouthed, angry, distrustful of the world, no-nonsense banker Mark Balm. Finally, we reach Ben Rickert, played by Brad Pitt, learns of it from two of his young associates trying to get rich. What follows is a harrowing and confusing journey for these characters to prepare themselves for what they know is coming and hopefully warn some about it. All the performances are sublime and real to a fault, but Bale and Carell stand out. Bale is the misfit with no one to help him or agree with his startling discovery. The fact that he has little to no social skill adds to the feeling of pity and heartbreak for his character's struggle to understand what he's really come across. Carell is a deeply conflicted character with a brother who recently committed suicide while on the phone with Carell's character. As he slowly begins to come to a realization of the extent of the fraud and lies in the housing bubble, he is heart-broken and torn completely apart by the evil that humans can knowingly subject others too, and then struggles with the thought of whether he will become one of them that prey on the people too innocent to understand or what he truly is. The Big Short ends in a chillingly melancholy way, with the fact that we haven't really learned from our mistakes and are probably doomed to repeat them. A brilliant film on all fronts.",

    "review": "  It's the Financial Crisis of 2008, for dummies. Well, you can still call me a dummy. As the film rambles on using investment banker jargon, and shortly stopping to explain to you what all of it mean using a whole host of celebrity cameos, my mind was still a jumble.You better believe that this film is one hell of a ride. It's one of the best directed films of the year. Adam McKay, who an absolute comedic genius by reputation, comes out of nowhere with this slam-dunk of a drama. Even when you're lost in it's web of politics, you are still ridiculously entertained by it's style.McKay, whether or not he is fully successful at it, has made a film that attempts to put one of the most complicated events in American history into terms accessible to the layman. He uses a lot fourth wall breaking, pop culture, and quite an abundance of floating texts to make it so. Scorsese seems to be the biggest influence, and The Wolf of Wall Street, seems to be the template to which this film tells us a side story about this most greediest of streets. Among a colorful cast is some of the best performances of the year by Steve Carell as a feisty, Bernie Sanders-esque ex-banker, and Christian Bale as Michael Burry.. a man worth devoting an entire movie on himself. It looks like a 5-star movie, and yet, something about The Big Short, slightly, falls short.A lot of people have said that McKay may have been way over his head when it comes to achieving his political message, and yes, I can see that. McKay is a seasoned comic, but he badly wants to be the next Michael Moore. That's kind of a dangerous road to go down, in his case. Because, let's face it, you can't get onto soapbox, and invite your white, rich, elitist, hollywood friends to get on with you. Nobody wants to listen to it anymore. Hollywood is not in touch with the rest of the world, and neither are politicians. I don't think I would've been left with this impression had the movie not ended on a self-righteous note. The fact of the matter is, if McKay and the entire cast feel the way they feel about the inequities of the system, maybe they need to put their money where their mouth is, and skip out on the limousine ride to the premiere. Maybe they ought to walk down a lonely LA street and greet a bunch of adoring fans, whom could really be down on their luck.Does this limit my absolute praise of the picture, sure. But on all other accounts, The Big Short is an absolutely stunning thing to behold. In many sections, it had me laughing out loud, and clinging on the edge of my seat. I love this style of filmmaking, without a doubt. When any film begins to recognize it's audience, and throws a wink their way, I just love it. McKay has studied well from the Godard handbook... he's also studied the ever-living hell out of investment banking. My God, his mind is like a steel trap of banking.",

    "review": "  What is it about Michael Lewis? He's an author of nonfiction bestsellers whose books keep on being optioned for fiction films (not counting \"Next: The Future Just Happened,\" an actual documentary): first came�\"The Blind Side,\" then�\"Moneyball\" and now�\"The Big Short.\" Lewis is a great journalist and an excellent writer, and his works are filled with vivid details about their subjects; I can see why Hollywood would keep calling. I'm just surprised that we haven't seen more documentary filmmakers attracted to his stories. Then again, sometimes the tales he tells are so outlandish that they seem like something only a screenwriter could invent. Still, if truth is stranger than fiction, then what is lost in its translation to a conventional dramatic form? In the case of�\"The Blind Side,\" quite a lot (though the film was a hit), since the cloying three-act structure imposed in the name of inspirational narrative diluted the power of the unadulterated original. \"Moneyball,\" however,�made with greater restraint (and�much less of a hit), approached the fine nuance of its source. And what of�\"The Big Short\"? It's a giant whale of a story: the global financial meltdown of 2008, rooted in the housing crisis. What will work best? Restraint or excess?It turns out both, though they work wonderfully in tandem. When I first heard that the film was co-written and directed by Adam McKay - who gave us \"Anchorman,\" \"Talladega Nights,\" \"Step Brothers,\" \"The Other Guys\" and�\"Anchorman 2,\" all films�marked by outrageous comedy, subtlety be damned -�I feared�the movie would make a mockery of its theme and devolve into caricatures and pastiche. I was wrong. McKay takes a difficult topic - including CDOs,�CDSs�and other toxic assets - makes it eminently understandable to the layperson, and has a terrific amount of fun with it in the process (embracing, rather than ignoring, his roots in broad comedy). He also elicits fine performances from a strong ensemble cast that includes Christian Bale (\"American Hustle\"), Ryan Gosling (\"Drive\") and�Brad Pitt (\"Fury\").�Steve Carell (\"Foxcatcher\") is better than he has been in many of his recent roles, but still can't tone it down enough to suit me. He doesn't, however, ruin the movie. Nor does McKay's decision to switch tones in the last 15 minutes and preach at the audience about the sins of the financial sector. The previous�almost-two hours are�strong enough to leave an impeccably favorable impression.If you've read the book, all of the major players are here. One by one, we meet a group�of men�(there are no�women) who start to see that the housing bubble of the mid-2000s is built on corruption and lies. They all, at different times and in different places (though some do meet and collaborate), decide to \"short\" the system by betting against the housing market. They're the smartest guys in the room, and our heroes. They're also, in many�ways, no better than the bankers who brought down the world's economy, since they're in it for their own gain. In fact, if you lost money back then, a lot of it could be in their pockets. But for much of the movie's running time, the morality of who did what and for what reason is immaterial. McKay opts, instead, to revel in the utter ridiculousness of how the clearly fraudulent housing market could have thrived, in the first place. Brisk and flashy - though quiet when it needs to be - the movie frequently cuts away from the plot to real-life celebrities - Margot Robbie�(in a hot tub), Selena Gomez�- who stop the action by addressing the audience directly to explain this or that bit of financial mumbo-jumbo. They're not the only ones to break the fourth wall: even the characters within the story sometimes stop what they're doing to talk to us, as well. In short, there's a delightful spirit of cleverness and fun that endlessly animates�Lewis' splendid research. You won't win your money back by watching�\"The Big Short,\" but you will have the consolation prize of�a great time, and learn a ton about why you lost your money in the first place.",

Focusing on a few insightful men who foresaw the bursting bubble, the film raucously illuminates the financial mumbo jumbo with terrific invention and creativity while maintaining a thriller like momentum of building dread. The brilliant cast, led by Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, and Brad Pitt, somehow make the audience root for their victory, which comes at the expense of the collapse of the global economy. Fast and furious, \"The Big Short\" cleverly explores the unimaginable reality that hit this nation hard. Seeing such recent history and its devastating effects (not to mention the lack of repercussion for the culprits) should upset audiences, hopefully galvanizing them to make sure history does not repeat itself.

Not once did I think, oh there's Steve Carrell.

    "review": "  It's Wall Street. A character begins to break the fourth wall and speaks directly to us-the audience-explaining the situation they are in about how they only care about one thing: money. It's interesting due to the nuanced performance of the actor and sense of energy within the scene from the filmmakers. This level of blunt sophistication from 2013s The Wolf of Wall Street is an apparent inspiration when viewing Adam McKay's 2015 effort The Big Short-a film that tries to walk the walk and talk the talk but is as legitimate as a faulty stock bond. McKay-known for his collaboration with Will Ferrell-is stepping out of his \"safe\" zone and taking on subject matter with a bit more bite. Comedy directors have a nice history of taking on tonally \"heavier\" subjects. For example, Jay Roach has proven he can make the broad comedies (the Austin Powers films, the first two Meet the Parents) as well as the more nuanced ones (2008s Recount and 2015s Trumbo) and Billy Wilder laid the groundwork with his versatility on films such as 1959s Some Like It Hot and 1950s Sunset Boulevard. It is nice to see that McKay has strayed from what he usually does but a factor of variables severely dampen The Big Short, making it an uninteresting, unfocused experience. The problem is with Michael Lewis' source material and the filmmaker's ineffective attempt at translating it to screen. Another Lewis property that had wordy subject matter (2011s Moneyball) focused on baseball statistics but Bennett Miller's careful direction, Aaron Sorkin's skillful script and Wally Pfister's cinematography help create a longwinded story cinematic. Although The Big Short has an accomplished crew (including DP Barry Ackroyd and editor Hank Corwin) everything about the film feels off. The scope is too limited or loses attention at the wrong time, the veil of the actors is lifted from the beginning and not believable (Ryan Gosling looks like he should be in another film) or the tone changes too swiftly, causing a tedious, uninvolving sit through and proves a bad investment of time.",

Christian Bale gives a surprisingly AMAZING performance unlike anything he's ever done in the past. Steve Carrell delivers yet another impressive performance and definitely deserves his nomination. Ryan Gosling is constantly hilarious and Brad Pitt, for the little screen time he has, was really good. Finn Wittrock and John Magaro, two actors I've never even heard of, were also very impressive and likeable!I loved the editing and style of The Big Short. It is quickly cut and very unique. There were also some creative decisions that had me laughing extremely hard. The writing is often hilarious and very interesting. I've haven't been so interested in stocks and business since The Wolf of Wall Street! The plot was also very enjoyable and constantly interesting.My main problem with The Big Short is that it gets very confusing. If you don't know specific details and information about stocks and that area, you will most likely get very lost. The movie doesn't take much time to explain many things, so the dialogue gets confusing. This also had me lost in the story for a large chunk of the movie. The pace is also very messy. It's either very quick or brutally slow.Overall, The Big Short is a very funny and interesting film with great editing and superb acting. Unfortunately, it is bogged down by confusing ideas that affect the viewer's experience. See it!RATNG: 8.25/10",

    "review": "  THE WHOOPS OF WALL STREET - My Review of THE BIG SHORT (3 1/2 Stars)Writer-director Adam McKay, best known for such zany comedies as ANCHORMAN and STEP BROTHERS, has teamed up with writer Charles Randolph for his shot at something more substantial with THE BIG SHORT, based on the bestseller by Michael Lewis. He mostly succeeds with this funny, confusing, exasperating, artful yet repetitive look at a major financial crisis. Following a group of misfit financial investors who predicted and bet on the fall of the U.S. housing market, the film has a rough start. There's lots of cross-cutting and business lingo thrown at you. If, like me, you just don't understand Wall Street operates, fear not. Once all of the main players are introduced and the predictions of doom have been spelled out, along comes Margot Robbie in a bubble bath to explain it all to you. Breaking the fourth wall, the filmmakers provide a FINANCE FOR DUMMIES moment, the first of many. Stylistically audacious and hilarious to boot, here is where the film finally took off for me. By acknowledging the impenetrability of its subject, I felt able to participate in the story. Although 2011's MARGIN CALL told a similar story, albeit with a much more sobering tone, and WOLF OF WALL STREET turned the investment banking world into one long rave, THE BIG SHORT, a true story, feels unique. Much of that credit goes to editor Hank Corwin, who cuts scenes off mid-sentence and crams in stock footage while juggling a large number of story elements. It's an impressive display from a professional who is no stranger to fast cutting (see NATURAL BORN KILLERS). The cast, particularly Steve Carell and Christian Bale, have a field day with their roles, getting to live out their BOILER ROOM/GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS dreams in this mostly all-male, testosterone-driven fever-pitched battle of subterfuge. While Brad Pitt (in full late 70s Robert Redford mode here) and Ryan Gosling have their moments, Carell and Bale own this film. Playing a short-fused man who feels the hopelessness of taking on the 1%, Carell excels. Imagine if his OFFICE alter-ego, Michael Scott, had lost everything, including his will to live, and gained a terrible hairpiece, and you get his Mark Baum. Bale's Michael Burry exists outside of the main story, yet his presence is essential. Sporting a glass eye and a wardrobe that even The Dude from THE BIG LEBOWSKI would shun, his character plays drums and heavy metal in his basement while figuring out how and when the housing market would crash. Socially awkward yet impressively prescient, Burry becomes our hero of sorts.Here's where my relationship with THE BIG SHORT went from \"in love\" to \"it's complicated\". I found myself rooting for men who profited off the backs of people who lost everything when they defaulted on their loans. Yes, one of the main characters offers up this sobering news, but it makes the entire experience of watching this film feel a little icky. Still, I love seeing a filmmaker use his blockbuster capital to stretch. McKay still has a little of that populist huckster in him, that need to entertain, and with a film ultimately as depressing as this one ends up being, that's not such a terrible thing.",

Director Adam McKay was clearly challenged to find interesting ways to explain the complex financial meltdown. Michael Burry M.D. (Christian Bale) is the eccentric money manager who stumbles on the fact that the housing market is about to collapse, yet no one on Wall St believes him. He decides to \"short\" the market, creating the credit default swap to make sure he gets paid millions in the inevitable collapse. After 5 trillion dollars evaporates, causing 8 million people to lose their jobs and 6 million their homes, none of the main players are yet behind bars. Embarrassing the government into taking belated action would be this film's huge public service.",

The second half loses some steam in it's execution because we get so tired from the brilliant first half. It is still one of the fastest and most entertaining movies I have sat through this year. Adam McKay, Michael Lewis and Charles Randolph's screenplay is sharp, hilarious and informative. Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling give award caliber performances. Carell's best performance of his career is funny and vulnerable. Gosling is perfectly smug and snarky reciting some of the best lines of the movie sharply. Christian Bale and a supporting cast of great character actors also are wonderful. The movie has an ingenious way of explaining some very complicated material in creative and hilarious ways. This is a mesmerizing, fun and finally powerful movie that is very informative in a great and fun way!

    "review": "  it's been almost three decades since Gordon Gecko instructed us on the value of greed. And during those three decades, something beyond even Gecko's wildest imagination was brewing: the ultimate con. It's precisely that con to end all cons that McKay's film explores, except it is perpetuated without the villainous figures' knowledge, or better yet, they just never bothered to check. The Big Short uses a group of individuals working within the system to achieve its number one goal... make you angry. It relies a little too heavily, however, in scenes that may be interpreted as being condescending, and it borrows, perhaps too much, from Martin Scorsese, but there's no denying the film's entertainment value. Cemented on a strong sense of humor, off-beat characters, fast-paced editing, plenty of rock music and, of course, a healthy dose of cynicism, The Big Short somehow manages to convince you that the good guys are the ones who profited hundreds of million of dollars from the banks fallout who in turned profited from the middle and lower class's misery. What changed? Absolutely nothing. The banks were saved, all the other weren't.",

While his latest has a surprising amount of humor, it carries with it a harsh and critical wit that takes us into the housing credit bubble that brought about the Financial crisis from 2007-2010. As funny as this can be, this is a harsh look at those involved in this devastating collapse. It is a riveting drama that takes a sobering approach to the story, concentrating on just a handful of people who saw the downfall coming. With a smart story, and fantastic casting, THE BIG SHORT is a fine film that delicately handles the serious tones with a sharp comedic edge. With an all-star cast and an impressive script, this is a slyly entertaining film that still carries a very heavy heart. Bale is outstanding, and he leads an impressive cast that also includes Karen Gillam, Marisa Tomei, Max Greenfield, Billy Magnussen, Jeremy Strong and Melissa Leo. THE BIG SHORT is a scathingly funny flick that manages to frighten as much as it entertains.THE BIG SHORT was the closing night feature at this year's AFI Fest and it opens in limited release on December 11th, with a wide release on December 23rd.",

    "review": "  This is a headache inducing mess. Let's start off saying that I think there is a really good movie in this material but Adam McKay was the absolute wrong choice to direct it. I really enjoy McKay who is mostly a director of Will Ferrell's strongest comedies (Talladega Nights, The Other Guys) but he just doesn't have the grip to direct an absurd movie like this but that also comes into the issues with the script. It wants to be some political satire farce so bad but then it wants to also be this heavy statement drama about the wall street corruption and neither of the two gel well. It better hands director wise, it could have but McKay hasn't done enough dramatic material to know how to blend them. I don't know if it was his initial choice or the cinematographer's but the other just flat out terrible thing about this movie is the camera work. It is beyond sloppy to the point that you get a headache trying to follow what the actors are saying, who is saying it, and what they are expressing body movement wise. I find it baffling that the LA Critics rewarded their editing award to this movie because talk about clunky, abrasive, and ugly editing. They do many supercut montages of pictures of somethings relevant to what just was discussed and what it led to but sometimes just random things that make them more of a mockery than a tool to help the story. The other thing is there are these terrible freeze frames used in almost every scene that stop randomly for no purpose on actors just walking away from a scene or moving in a chair like you are about to get some narration from them but it just ends up pointless. Narration is another issue with a lot of breaking the third wall. Being a Wall Street movie, it seems like McKay really wanted to channel Scorsese doing Wolf of Wall Street but this movie never reached the level of cynicism and dark comedy that Wolf has. The editing just looks like someone sat down for the first time using an editing software and played around with all the tools and made a movie out of it. If that wasn't so clunky, that could have help the movie out in terms of focus which it really has an issue with trying to overlap conversations and actions but not being able to ever really balance both. I also hated how this movie undermined the audience. Look, I'm not that smart when it comes to how Wall Street works and how all these pyramid schemes work but it became monkish for the characters to break the fourth wall to explain this stuff in detail but then giving up and making some cameo performance explain it in simpler terms. Those cameos were also beyond stupid and pointless though I like some of the people that made cameos. When it comes to performances, this is an ensemble piece with no one really being the center story which was a focus issue. I think a better version of this movie would have come out of following Finn Wittrock, John Magaro, and Brad Pitt with everyone else secondary supporting stories. Steve Carell is great as always but the was McKay directs his character and the screenplay asks of him makes a clown out of Carell but he gets this real emotional, deep finale that could have been so powerful if he wasn't treated like a clown the rest of the movie. The stand out in the supporting cast is Ryan Gosling who is not typically known for comedies but has some of the best laughs of the movie. He also is the only person that fit the breaking of the fourth wall aspect for me. Brad Pitt is an actor we all take for granted since he is more famous as a movie star than an actor if that makes any sense. This performance shows the subtle talents of his easy going acting skills that were shown in Curious Case of Benjamin Button and even Moneyball but people seem to value his more flamboyant performances like in Inglorious Basterds and Fight Club. Like I said, I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if we focused on Pitt's teamwork with Wittrock and Magaro. Both of those guys have great chemistry and share the better scenes of the movie. We just found out the SAG nominations and it wasn't a total surprise that the ensemble was nominated just from the amount of stars are in it but the surprise came from Christian Bale's supporting actor nomination. He is good in this but he doesn't do anything compelling or top notch. If anyone should have been singled out, Gosling would be my pick. But I will say the ensemble is pretty good as a team yet the clunky filmmaking really messed them up on being able to showcase their talents with no distractions. I also really enjoyed Rafe Spall who also gives some of the funnier line deliveries in the movie. I also enjoyed seeing Max Greenfield and Billy Magnussen together in small roles but I will say where the performances get in trouble for me are the wasted roles for talented women like Marisa Tomei and Melissa Leo. They deserved so much better in terms of their roles and their post Oscar careers (even though Tomei's happened over 20 years ago). The other thing that drove me nuts is the song selections. Sometimes they worked shaping up a passage of time from when they were released but others were just flat out absurd. The score was one of those manipulative \"this is how you should feel\" scores. So overall, their is a compelling movie idea somewhere buried in this mess but in the hands of a better director and screenwriter that could have made it work. If you want a compelling and smart look at the housing crisis, watch 99 Homes out on DVD in February.",

The heroes, (a misnomer at best) regularly break out and adress the audience directly. At times alerting us that the scene we are seeing has been greatly dramatized, but more often reassuring us that the fraud, ignorance and righteous rants of Mark Baum (Steve Carrell) really f--king happened. It's a borderline overwhelming array of pop culture images, early 2000's music and yelly white guys that reminds us how much we remember about Brittany Spears in her prime and how little we recall about the bankers that collapsed our economy.
